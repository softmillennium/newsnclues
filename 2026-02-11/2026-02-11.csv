            • Key hearing: Attorney General Pam Bondi is testifying at a heated House Judiciary Committee amid ongoing controversies related to the Jeffrey Epstein files release, investigation into President Donald Trump's political foes and the handling of the fatal shootings of two US citizens in Minnesota by immigration enforcement officers.
    


• Clashes with lawmakers: Bondi called Rep. Jamie Raskin – a former constitutional law professor and the top Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee – a “washed up loser lawyer,” as the clash between her and committee Democrats escalated over her approach to their questions. 



• Democrats focus on Epstein: Bondi directly addressed Epstein survivors present, telling them that she is “deeply sorry” for the abuse they suffered. Democratic Rep. Pramila Jayapal asked survivors in the room to stand up and raise their hand if they had not been able to meet with the DOJ about the abuse they faced. She said every victim raised their hand.
    


            Lawmakers are breaking for House votes.
    


            Among the legislation being weighed by House members today is a push to curb Trump's authority on tariffs and stricter voting rules.
    


            Attorney General Pam Bondi on Wednesday touted the Justice Department's efforts to “protect” protesters advocating on behalf of conservative causes as a “Weaponization Working Group” intended to focus on the issue is expected to ramp up its work.
    


            “That was one of the main focuses of President Trump and this administration,” she told lawmakers Wednesday.
    


            “We will protect parents at school boards. We will protect children in schools. We will protect parents' rights for their children's education in our school system in this country,” Bondi said. “We will protect Christians. We will protect everyone who wants to freely protest. If Christians want to protest in front of an abortion clinic without being arrested, they will do so.”
    


            CNN reported earlier this month that the working group established by Bondi last year is now expected to meet daily in an effort to produce results in coming months.
    


            Among the group's priorities are probing allegations that the department, under former President Joe Biden, discriminated against religious adherents, and a memo meant to protect school board members against threats from parents.
    


CNN's Casey Gannon contributed to this report.



            Rep. Thomas Massie, one of the only Republicans to address Jeffrey Epstein and the redacted files released by the Justice Department during Wednesday's hearing, pressed Attorney General Pam Bondi on why names were redacted in an FBI document listing potential co-conspirators of Epstein.
    


            “Are you able to track who it was that obscured Les Wexner's name as a co-conspirator in an FBI document?” Massie asked in regard to the billionaire business magnate.
    


            “Within 40 minutes, Wexner's name was added back,” Bondi said of the FBI document, which was partially unredacted after Massie noted the issue when he reviewed unredacted versions of DOJ documents earlier this week.
    


            “In 40 minutes of me catching you red handed,” Massie shot back.
    


            Bondi defended herself, saying “there was one redaction.”
    


            “He's listed as a co-conspirator!” Massie said.
    


            Lawyers for Wexner said in December that the Assistant US Attorney in charge of the Epstein investigation “stated at the time that Mr. Wexner was neither a co-conspirator nor target in any respect.”

            Massie also noted that in several documents he was able to review without redactions, redactions still existed — including large white-blocks in FBI files.
    


            “This guy has Trump derangement syndrome,” Bondi said after Massie's time to question her expired.
    


            After Democratic Rep. Ted Lieu played a decades old clip of Jeffrey Epstein and Donald Trump speaking at a party, Attorney General Pam Bondi said “there is no evidence that Donald Trump has committed a crime.”
    


            Lieu then accused Bondi of lying under oath, saying that a witness reported they talked to a woman who said she was raped by Trump.
    


            “Don't you ever accuse me” of committing a crime, Bondi snapped back.
    


            Trump has never been charged with an Epstein-related crime and has denied any wrongdoing tied to his relationship with the accused sex trafficker.
    


            Lawmakers have repeatedly asked Attorney General Pam Bondi about men who appeared in the Epstein files, questioning why additional people are not facing charges for his alleged sex trafficking operation.
    


            Among the people who are photographed in the files is former Prince Andrew, who attended various parties with Jeffrey Epstein. Democrats have also mentioned President Donald Trump's appearance in some of the documents.
    


            But appearing in the files is not enough evidence for the department to bring charges, Bondi has pointed out.
    


            In a memo from last summer, the Justice Department and FBI said that investigators “did not uncover evidence that could predicate an investigation against uncharged third parties.”
    


            Neither Trump nor former Prince Andrew have been charged with an Epstein-related crime and both have denied any wrongdoing.
    


            An attorney for Colorado Rep. Jason Crow, one of the Democrats targeted by the Justice Department over their “illegal orders” video, went on offense in a letter to US attorney Jeanine Pirro, saying he will take legal action if prosecutors try again to indict him.
    


            “The baseless and absurd allegations by Donald Trump, followed by your carrying out of the President's political retribution campaign has already gone too far, and are evidence of yet another abuse of power directed at those who dare speak out and criticize this Administration,” wrote Abbe Lowell, an attorney for Crow.
    


            Lowell said in the letter that the Justice Department should preserve all records and documents.
    


                    “Not only does Congressman Crow have a constitutional right to free speech, but he also has the right and duty to speak, debate, and inform the public as an elected Member of Congress. The reports that your,” he wrote, adding later: “Accordingly, this letter is a demand that you take no further action against Congressman Crow and puts you and those pursuing any further charges on notice of the legal ramification if you do so.”
                





            Crow's lawyer said potential legal action could include claims that the lawmaker's rights were violated, including his First Amendment protections and Speech or Debate Clause protections, among others.
    


            The letter was sent a day after a federal grand jury declined to indict the Democratic lawmakers related to the video released in November. The six, who are veterans or former intelligence officials, urged service members and intelligence officials in the 90-second video to disobey any illegal orders from the Trump administration.
    


            A Democratic member of the House Judiciary Committee accused Pam Bondi of doing a “Jekyll and Hyde kind of routine” as the attorney general's testy exchanges with members of his party contrast heavily with her more measured responses to questions from Republicans.
    


            “You do a Jekyll and Hyde kind of routine around here and I just want you to answer my questions,” Rep. Hank Johnson, of Georgia, said as Bondi refused to field some of his queries.
    


            “What does Jekyll and Hyde mean? Can you explain that?” Bondi shot back.
    


            “It means you're nice to the Republicans and you turn like Hyde on Democrats,” the congressman responded.
    


            Wednesday's hearing has featured tense exchanges between Bondi and Democrats on the panel, with the attorney general hurling insults at several of them and repeatedly refusing to engage on topics concerning Jeffrey Epstein and the Trump administration's immigration crackdown, among others.
    


            Republicans, meanwhile, have seen no such tension as they've lobbed largely softball questions at Bondi and praised her leadership at the Justice Department.
    


            During Bondi's testimony, Democrats and Republicans found a rare spot of agreement: Threats to lawmakers are bad.
    


            Democratic Rep. Eric Swalwell highlighted several threatening messages and calls he has received, including against his family, and pressed Bondi on why some have not yet faced charges.
    


            “We never expected that the Department of Justice would not seek to prosecute and investigate those who are making threats against us, and that would include those on that side of the aisle,” Swalwell said. “I'm just asking for your help to protect life, because life is at risk with the environment we're in right now.”
    


            On those threat, Bondi said several direct investigations “are very active.”
    


            “I believe one has been charged publicly, and that's something I would be happy to talk to you about off camera, but I can assure you that they are very serious,” Bondi said. “They are being looked into, and I can give you more details on those. None of you should be threatened ever. None of your children should be threatened. None of your families should be threatened, and I will work with you.”
    


            Chairman Jim Jordan followed up, saying he was “sorry for what the gentleman and his family have had to go had to go through.”
    


            Threats against lawmakers have skyrocketed in recent years, with the United States Capitol Police reviewing hundreds of potential threats each day.
    


            Bondi's first hour of testimony was combative, devolving into personal attacks on Democrats and screaming matches over whose turn it is to speak.
    


            The strategy lines up with Bondi's testimony several months ago in front of the Senate: Engage on questions about cartels, immigration and alleged weaponization of justice, launch ad hominem criticisms of democrats, and laud President Donald Trump.
    


            The tension came almost immediately after Bondi refused to apologize for the department's treatment of Epstein survivors and mistakes in redactions. Bondi was quick to accuse Rep. Pramila Jayapal of trying to drag her “into the gutter.”
    


            The attorney general made the same accusation against Rep. Jerry Nadler, who similarly asked about her treatment of Epstein survivors. When Rep. Jamie Raskin jumped into the exchange to criticize what he said was an effort to avoid the question, Bondi shouted that he was a “washed up loser lawyer.”
    


            Bondi also caught Democrats off guard with some of her answers, pivoting to the Dow numbers and ominously telling two of them, “you're a great stock trader.”
    


            The Democratic lawmakers haven't shied away from the fights, repeatedly shouting over the attorney general and accusing her of wasting their questioning time.
    


            “I think it's pathetic that she can't answer the questions,” Rep. Zoe Lofgren said.
    


            Attorney General Pam Bondi called Rep. Jamie Raskin — a former constitutional law professor and the top Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee — a “washed up loser lawyer,” as a clash between her and committee Democrats escalated over her approach to their questions.
    


            “Not even a lawyer,” Bondi added of Raskin, a Maryland Democrat.
    


            The jabs came after fellow committee Democrat, New York Rep. Jerry Nadler asked Bondi how many of Jeffrey Epstein co-conspirators were being indicted or investigated.
    


            She did not immediately answer directly, prompting Democrats' accusations of evading their questions. Raskin jumped in to warn her against filibustering, adding “I told you about that Attorney General before we started.”
    


            “You don't tell me anything,” Bondi shouted.
    


            During her testimony, Justice Department Attorney General Pam Bondi was seen with a document listing out Democratic Rep. Pramila Jayapal's “search history” of Jeffrey Epstein documents held by the DOJ.
    


            Lawmakers this week have been allowed to review unredacted versions of the Epstein documents maintained by the Justice Department.
    


            According to the list Bondi had, Jayapal reviewed emails from the documents that discussed “naughty” young women, an email to Epstein saying “I love the torture video” and more.
    


            Bondi also had a version of a graph, apparently from law enforcement, connecting Epstein with other potential co-conspirators, including his accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell and his longtime assistant Lesley Groff (whose first name is misspelled as “Leslie”).
    


            Groff's lawyer told CNN his client had no comment on the chart.
    


            Bondi's chart includes images and the names of three employees of Epstein and others whose images are redacted.
    


            CNN has previously reported on a more heavily redacted version of the chart that did not include as many names and connections to Epstein as Bondi's version.
    


            Attorney General Pam Bondi directly addressed Epstein survivors sitting behind her as she testified to Congress, telling them that she is “deeply sorry” for the abuse they suffered at the hands of “that monster.”
    


            The Justice Department has for months been under fire over its handling of the so-called Epstein files, both for their resistance to produce every document that was part the investigation into accused sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein and mistakes in redactions when those documents were ultimately released.
    


            But the notion was challenged soon after, as Rep. Pramila Jayapal asked survivors in the room to stand up and raise their hand if they had not been able to meet with the department about the abuse they faced. Every victim who stood raised their hand, Jayapal said.
    


            The interaction devolved when Jayapal asked Bondi to “apologize for what your Department of Justice has put them through,” citing mistakes in redactions that publicly released their information or picture.
    


            Bondi attempted to push back on the notion, saying that Jayapal did not ask the same of her predecessor Merrick Garland, but the two continued to speak over each other.
    


            Bondi said that she would not be thrown into “the gutter” for Jayapal's ‘theatrics.'
    


            Since her time as Florida Attorney General, Bondi has been outspoken about her support for victims of sex abuse - a matter that has now become a centerpiece of her tenure atop the Justice Department.
    


            Attorney General Pam Bondi used part of her opening statements Wednesday to criticize Democratic leaders who did not support the Trump administration's immigration crackdown, blaming them for “avoidable clashes on the streets.”
    


            “A few elected officials have declared that they are ‘at war with the federal government' and encouraged widespread obstruction of law enforcement,” Bondi said.
    


            The attorney general cited Minnesota, where protesters and law enforcement clashed for weeks following the shooting of two people by DHS officers.
    


            CNN has reported that the Justice Department issued subpoenas to several state and local democratic lawmakers in Minnesota as part of an investigation into potential obstruction of federal law enforcement, saying that “citizens and law enforcement officers have both been endangered by reckless rhetoric” by those leaders.
    


            The attorney general however lauded Democratic leaders in Washington, DC, and Memphis, Tennessee as working with the federal government to combat crime.
    


            “Public Safety does not have a party registration,” she said. “When your constituents call 911, they don't ask for political views of the responding officer. They ask for help.”
    


            In his opening remarks, Democratic Rep. Jamie Raskin lambasted the Justice Department for opening an investigation into the partner of Renee Good, the woman who was killed by a Department of Homeland Security officer in Minnesota last month.
    


            “How sick is that?” Raskin said of the investigation as he highlighted the killings of other people by federal officers across the US amid the administration's immigration crackdown.
    


            Officials, including DHS Secretary Kristi Noem, have called Good a domestic terrorist.
    


            Raskin continued, highlighting the politically focused efforts by the Justice Department to investigate Democratic officials, including the failed cases against former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James.
    


            “You've turned the people's Department of Justice into Trump's instrument of revenge,” Raskin said.
    


            A judge dismissed the cases against James and Comey, finding that the US Attorney who brought the charges, Lindsey Halligan, did not have the authority to be appointed in the position without Senate approval.
    


            The committee's top Democrat tore into Attorney General Pam Bondi on Wednesday over her handling of the Epstein files as he acknowledged survivors of the late sex offender and their family members who are seated in the audience behind her.
    


            “To promote justice for the people, you've got to listen to the victims, like the women seated behind you today,” Rep. Jamie Raskin said during his opening remarks. “Those are just some of the hundreds of survivors of Jeffrey Epstein's global sex trafficking ring who are demanding that the truth be told and are demanding accountability for the abusers who trafficked and raped them.”
    


            He continued: “You still haven't met with these survivors, so with their permission, let me introduce to you the survivors and late survivors' family members who are present today: There's Theresa Helm, there's Jess Michaels, Lara Blume McGee, Dani Bensky, Liz Stein, Marina Lacerda, Sky and Amanda Roberts, who are the family of the late Virginia Giuffre, Sharlene Rochard and Lisa Phillips.”
    


            The women did not stand up as Raskin introduced them, and Bondi did not appear to react as their names were called out one-by-one.
    


            “As Attorney General, you're siding with the perpetrators and you're ignoring the victims,” the Maryland Democrat said. “That will be your legacy unless you act quickly to change course. You're running a massive Epstein cover up right out of the Department of Justice.”
    


            Jeffrey Epstein survivors and family members of Epstein victim Virginia Giuffre are expected to be seated in the hearing room when Attorney General Pam Bondi testifies in front of the House Judiciary Committee this morning, according to a committee source.
    


            The group in the audience is expected to include Theresa Helm, Jess Michaels, Lara Blume McGee, Dani Bensky, Liz Stein, Marina Lacerda, Sky and Amanda Roberts, Sharlene Rochard, Rachel B., and Lisa Phillips, they said,
    


            Epstein survivors have condemned what they consider the Justice Department's incomplete release of the Epstein files, saying the process has lacked transparency and botched redactions.
    


            Democrats and Epstein survivors amp up pressure on Attorney General Pam Bondi to answer questions about the Epstein files.
    


            “I intend to get real answers on why the DOJ is not pursuing further action and to get survivors the attention and the answers that they deserve,” Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal told reporters Wednesday.
    


            “Pam. I have a clear and simple message for you. The way this administration, and you specifically have handled survivors, has been nothing short of a failure,” Sky Roberts, brother of Epstein survivor Virginia Guiffre said, “Pam Bondi and the Justice Department failed us repeatedly, across administrations, across political lines, across decades and the people who had the authority to intervene.”
    


            Multiple survivors are expected to attend the hearing.
    


            Survivor Jess Michaels had a message for Republican lawmakers: “Are you going to have courage, or are you going to be complicit?”
    


            Michaels also suggested that GOP members give a minute of their allotted question time to Rep. Thomas Massie so he could ask further about the files.
    


            Survivors strongly criticized the Justice Department for its handling of releasing and redacting the files, and the lack of investigations or follow-up on other people named in the files.
    


            “Every credible allegation must be taken seriously and investigated thoroughly no matter who the person is, how wealthy they are or how well connected they are,” Epstein survivor Marina Lacerda said.
    


            GOP Congresswoman Nancy Mace, who has been outspoken in her support of survivors spoke.
    


            More than 20 victims of Jeffrey Epstein urged Attorney General Pam Bondi to respond to multiple questions about the exposure of victims' information and inconsistent redactions in the Justice Department's release of millions of files related to the late convicted sex offender.
    


            The letter, which came as Bondi was set to testify before Congress on Wednesday, includes a list of 14 questions about the department's review of the documents, adding that for victims of Epstein, the release “remains incomplete in a way that is both staggering and indefensible.”
    


            The documents “shed no light on whether the investigation into Epstein's accomplices continued, or why the government failed to pursue charges against individuals it knew to be involved,” the victims wrote.
    


            Among the questions are whether the Justice Department had any quality control or review procedures for redactions, whether it will provide a timeline for releasing any remaining documents and whether it will release files on any men who were investigated.
    


            CNN previously reported the Justice Department failed to redact identifying information about many victims while it redacted the details of people who may have helped Epstein.
    


            Last week, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche signaled that the department does not expect to bring charges against anyone else linked to Epstein saying, “It's not a crime to party with Mr. Epstein.”
    


            In the letter to Bondi, the victims responded, writing: “Survivors are not alleging guilt by association, and to suggest they are is a profound dismissal of the serious crimes that were reported, investigated, and buried.”
    


            “The Department's actions to-date mirror the very dynamics Epstein relied upon: powerful actors protected by secrecy, while victims are exposed, scrutinized, and made to bear the consequences,” they write.
    


            Attorney General Pam Bondi's last appearance on Capitol Hill, before the Senate Judiciary Committee last fall, was a partisan slugfest over weaponization, national guard troops and the Jeffrey Epstein files.
    


            Notably, Bondi came out firing, using pre-prepared one-liners to deflect and levy personal attacks to push back against Democrats.
    


            For instance, when Connecticut Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal questioned Bondi over her connections to a law firm involved in a merger scrutinized by the Justice Department, Bondi went after Blumenthal for decade-old allegations he lied about military service in Vietnam.
    


            “Senator Blumenthal, I cannot believe that you would accuse me of impropriety when you lied about your military service,” Bondi said. “How dare you? I'm a career prosecutor. Don't you ever challenge my integrity.”
    


            And when Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin pushed Bondi on the legal rationale for sending National Guard troops to Durbin's state against the governor's wishes, the attorney general shot back: “I wish you loved Chicago as much as you hate President Trump.”

            Justice Department officials met last week to discuss how to reenergize probes that are considered a top priority for President Donald Trump — reviewing the actions of officials who investigated him, according to a source familiar with the plan.
    


            Almost immediately after Pam Bondi stepped into her role as attorney general last year, she established a “Weaponization Working Group” to review law enforcement actions taken under the Biden administration for any examples of what she described as “politicized justice.”
    


            She said the group would focus on investigations into Trump conducted by former special counsel Jack Smith and his staff; Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg and New York Attorney General Letitia James; and any “improper” investigations into the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol.
    


            But after a year, the group has not produced anything publicly.
    


            In recent weeks, Trump has been pressuring Justice Department officials for results in these and other investigations, recently admonishing a group of US attorneys for failing to deliver on cases he wants brought.

            You may not know what neodymium is (or even how to pronounce it). But you have plenty of it in your home.
    


            Neodymium is a rare earth, one of the minerals near the bottom of the periodic table that are crucial for everyday life. The element is among the most valuable of all the rare earths because it's so widespread in so-called “permanent” magnets. And China has a near-monopoly on its processing.
    


            As a result, neodymium and the other rare earths have become a major factor in trade tensions between the United States and China, the world's number one and number two economy, respectively.
    


            Much of US's manufacturing base - autos, aircraft, appliance - would be crippled without access to neodymium. The element makes up about 30% of the mass of permanent magnets by weight, according to Rod Eggert, a professor at the Colorado School of Mines and an expert in the field.
    


            The neodymium magnets are very small and very powerful.
    


            How strong?
    


            “If you were to put them next to a fridge, the fridge would fall over,” said Gracelin Baskaran, director of the Critical Minerals Security Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.
    


What are rare earth minerals, and why are they central to Trump's trade deal with China?



            Neodymium-based magnets power all manners of motors. Unlike traditional magnets, they don't lose magnetism when exposed to the constant electric current used to turn the motors on and off.
    


            The makes them critical to American manufacturing of motors in automobiles, from the simple motors that move windshield wipers to the complex ones that move electric vehicles. They're also found in many household goods, like power tools and air conditioners, as well as in jet engines and wind turbines.
    


            The Trump administration says that neodymium and the other rare earths are so essential to the United States that access to them is a national security issue. But China dominates the processing of rare earths, giving it massive leverage in trade talks. China handles 90% of the processing capacity needed to turn raw ore into useable minerals.
    


            “Rare earths are not rare,” said Igor Hulak, an energy and resource partner at consultant Kearney. “They can be found in many countries and on a number of continents. But what is rare is the way the rock is separated, processed and refined.”
    


The US wants these critical minerals, but militants with American weapons stand in the way



            Processing, Hulak said, is an ordeal. It takes a lot of energy to heat the ore, which is then treated with chemicals to separate out the rare earths. The end result also produces toxic waste, some of which is radioactive.
    


            “So the rest of the world, well, simply allowed China to develop this high concentration (of processing),” said Hulak.
    


            Once the neodymium (or a less pure but still useful version called neodymium-praseodymium oxide) is processed, the material is turned into magnets. That's also typically done in China. (For some higher performance motors, such as those that power electric vehicles, another rare earth – dysprosium – is added to the mix.)
    


            The combination of price, availability and widespread use means neodymium produces more revenue than any other rare earth element.
    


            The United States is trying to wean itself away from China's rare earth processing. President Donald Trump earlier this month announced plans to create a strategic rare earths reserve. And the US government has been subsidizing projects to increase domestic ore mining and processing. But it will take years to catch up with the availability from China, giving the country a continued chokehold on the elements.
    


            “It takes a number of years to bring any new mine or processing facility into production, even from the day that you make the decision to build a new mine or processing facility,” said Eggert.
    


            Given China's dominance of the market and the advantages that go with scale, there is no way an upstart processor can compete without significant government support, Hulak said.
    


Trump says rare earths are part of his Greenland deal. It's ‘completely bonkers'



            Once the neodymium is turned into magnets, they are placed around a core inside of a motor and connected to an axle. The core is surrounded by an outer shell that includes a network of electrical wires. When a current is passed through that wire, it creates an electrical field that first attracts, then repels, the magnets, forcing them to spin and turn the axle.
    


            Many companies that depend on these magnets have been looking for alternatives, either a rare-earths-free magnet or a motor without magnets. The hope is to make their supply chain more secure and resilient, Hulak.
    


            But so far there are no alternatives.
    


            “You trade off the performance, you trade off efficiency, you trade off the weight or the size, you trade off torque, and all of that has a big impact on the motors,” Hulak said. “There is no silver bullet.”

            Australian authorities have released a recording of the emergency call made by hero teen Austin Appelbee after he swam for hours in rough seas to get help for his family.
    


            Austin, 13, can be heard calmly describing the situation and asking for a helicopter to search for his mother and two siblings in a recording released by the Western Australia Police Force on Wednesday.
    


            The family had been paddleboarding and kayaking off the coast of Quindalup, Western Australia, on January 30 when they were swept out to sea.
    


            Austin swam four kilometers (2.5 miles) to shore and then ran along the beach to reach a phone to call for help.
    


            “Hello, my name is Austin… I have two siblings, Beau and Grace. Beau is 12 and Grace is eight,” he said.
    


            “We got took out to sea and we got lost out there,” added Austin.
    


            “I don't know what time it was but it was a very long time ago,” he said. “We couldn't get back to shore and Mum told me to go back to get help.”
    


            “I think they're kilometres out to sea. I think we need a helicopter to go find them,” said Austin. “I don't know what their condition is right now, and I'm really scared.”
    


            Austin set out for shore in his kayak, but abandoned it when it started to take on water, leaving him to swim back. Once he reached the beach, he then had to run two kilometers to get to a phone.
    


            The boy also had the presence of mind to request an ambulance for himself.

            “I'm sitting on the beach right now, and I have to also explain – I think I need an ambulance because I think I have hypothermia,” he said.
    


            “I'm extremely tired. I think I have heatstroke, and I feel like I'm about to pass out.”
    


            Austin's brother and sister were ultimately rescued along with their mother Joanne, 47, after being found clinging to a paddleboard.
    


            Speaking to CNN affiliate 9News earlier this month, Austin said that thinking of his family drove him on.
    


            “I just said ‘alright. Not today, not today, not today,'” he said. “I had to keep on going.”
    


            The Western Australia Police Force praised Austin's actions in a statement Wednesday.
    


            “Austin's ability to think clearly under pressure demonstrates the type of composure that greatly assists first responders during emergencies,” it read.
    


            Police forward commander acting sergeant Andrew McDonnell said that Austin had helped his family out of an “extremely dire” situation.
    


            “They were in real trouble, and time was absolutely critical given how long they had been in the water and with daylight fading,” he said in the statement.
    


            “What Austin did was nothing short of extraordinary,” added McDonnell. “His bravery and courage in those conditions were remarkable, and his actions were pivotal in bringing about a successful outcome.”

India has imposed curbs on artificial intelligence content on social media platforms. The restrictions will take effect on February 20, the federal government said on Tuesday.

The curbs stipulate that AI-generated content should be prominently labelled, and also cuts the time allowed for illegal content – including non-consensual deepfakes – to be taken down, reducing this to within two-to-three hours from the earlier 36-hour window for social media platforms.

Content ruled as illegal by a court or an “appropriate government” has to be taken down within three hours. Sensitive content featuring non-consensual nudity and deepfakes must be removed within two hours, according to the new rules, The Hindu newspaper reported.

The draft version of the new rules specifies that 10% of any imagery would have to be covered in the labelled disclosure, but platforms have been given some leeway, The Hindu quoted an unnamed official as saying.

India's approach to the democratisation of AI shows that scale, inclusion and innovation can progress together. It is a continuing commitment to ensure that technological progress strengthens societies, reduces inequalities and supports sustainable development for all.Read more… pic.twitter.com/F4eRAT0ugJ

The labelling must comprise permanent markings that can't be removed.

Indian IT law states that failure to comply with the rules will result in the loss of safe harbor protection – the principle that sites that allow users to post content are not held liable for them.

The development also comes ahead of the India AI Impact summit, which will be held in New Delhi next week.

India says its emphasis on AI governance balances innovation with accountability.

India is the world's third-largest AI talent hub and leads globally in AI skill penetration, according to Stanford's AI Index.

Google, Amazon, and Microsoft together committed more than $50 billion in investments in India toward cloud and AI infrastructure last year. New Delhi has extended a tax holiday in its federal budget for companies building data center infrastructure in the country to serve global markets.

Colombian President Gustavo Petro has claimed he has survived an assassination attempt following months of warnings about an alleged plot by drug traffickers to target him.

The South American nation has been scarred by decades of conflict involving guerrillas and other armed groups. The alleged attempt on his life also comes ahead of congressional elections on March 8 and presidential elections scheduled for May.

During a live-streamed cabinet meeting on Tuesday, Petro said that hours earlier he was in his helicopter with his daughters and was unable to land at a destination in the Colombian department of Cordoba on the Caribbean coast due to fears that unidentified individuals “were going to shoot.”

“I'm trying to escape being killed. That's why I couldn't arrive on time last night, because I couldn't land where I had said. This morning, I couldn't land where I was supposed to either, because there was information that the helicopter was going to be shot at,” he said.

Constitutionally barred from seeking a second term, Petro claimed that a drug-trafficking organization has targeted him since he took office in August 2022. He had previously reported another alleged attempt on his life in 2024.

According to El Tiempo, Colombia's largest cartel, the Gulf Clan, operates in Cordoba. The outlet also notes that the group recently suspended peace talks with the government after Petro agreed with US President Donald Trump on cooperation to capture cartel leader Hobanis de Jesus Avila Villadiego.

Petro and Trump met at the White House earlier this month amid rising tensions, with the latter criticizing Colombia's efforts against drug trafficking as inadequate after previously calling the country's president an “illegal narco-leader.” Petro rejected the accusations and criticized Washington's operations in the Caribbean and Venezuela, actions he said were harmful to regional stability.

Petro made the latest statements after Colombian Senator Aida Quilcue was taken by unknown people in her home department of Cauca, a conflict-affected, coca-growing region contested by dissidents of the now-disbanded FARC guerrilla army.

The award‑winning Indigenous activist was rescued, her team reported on X, hours after the vehicle she had been traveling in with two bodyguards was found abandoned. The 53‑year‑old activist told AFP she had been taken by “various armed men,” without saying which group they belonged to.

NEW DELHI, February 11. /TASS/. Russia is set to take its relations with India as far as the South Asian republic is ready, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov told The Indian Express in an interview.

""Ties depend on both sides. We are prepared to go as far as India will. The sky is the limit,"" the senior Russian diplomat said as he described the history of bilateral relations as extraordinary.

""We have several projects in the pipeline, many of them with no parallel that others might have.

MOSCOW, February 11. /TASS/. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov accused Europe and Kiev of interfering with the US initiative on the peaceful settlement of the Ukrainian conflict.

In an interview with the Empatia Manuchi online project, the top diplomat pointed out that Russia is always ready to search for a balance of interests but will never sacrifice its own security.

TASS has compiled Lavrov's key statements.

Russia is always ready to search for a balance of interests but will never sacrifice its own security: ""We are always prepared to compromise, or more simply, to balance interests. The crucial point is that the legitimate interests of each state must be taken into account.""

""Our legitimate interest is to ensure our own security. Like any normal country, we are concerned that our history should continue, that our people should develop under the most favorable external conditions possible, and that we secure economic growth, resolve social issues, and improve the population's well-being.""

When talking about security guarantees, Europe and the Kiev regime ""mean guarantees not with Russia, but against Russia.""

The goals of the special military operation are not subject to opportunism: ""Hope comes only from your own truth and from the actions you take in real life to ensure that truth prevails. Our position is not subject to opportunism, twists, or contortions.""

Russian President Vladimir Putin has clearly defined the goals of the special military operation. ""These goals remain unchanged and are not open to opportunistic compromise.""

The Ukrainian armed forces will certainly be ""forced out"" of the part of Donbass that they still occupy.

Those commenting on the Abu Dhabi talks either want to thwart them or shift the blame for their lack of flexibility elsewhere: ""Public commentary at every turn serves only to sabotage discussions or, which amounts to the same, to shift blame for intransigence onto one's counterpart.""

Russia has not changed its position during the talks between Russia, the US, and Ukraine in the UAE: ""We have not altered our stance.""

Talks aimed at achieving results do not lend themselves to publicity; that's why Moscow ""maintains a diplomatic silence"" on the results of the Abu Dhabi contacts.

The key principles on which the existence of a state and the lives of millions depend cannot be a subject of compromises on Ukraine: ""Listen: compromise cannot extend to fundamental principles upon which a state's existence depends - least of all when the lives of millions hang in the balance.""

During an Anchorage summit, the leaders of Russia and the US, as well as delegations from both countries, managed to find approaches that paved the way to peace in Ukraine and the corresponding treaty's coordination: ""In Anchorage, we developed approaches building upon the American initiative and proposals, which charted a viable path to peace. That framework made it entirely feasible to swiftly finalize a comprehensive settlement agreement.""

At the August 2025 Anchorage summit, Russia and the US found a balance of vital interests. Now, however, Vladimir Zelensky and his European allies are trying to change everything to suit their own agenda: ""Very few measured voices in Europe are calling for a serious approach to resolving the conflict.""

Europe and Kiev ""undermined"" the US initiative on the Ukrainian conflict settlement: ""All subsequent versions reflected attempts by Vladimir Zelensky and, principally, his patrons in Britain, Germany, France, and the Baltic states to undermine this American initiative.""

Russia has not yet received any 20-point documents on Ukraine: ""This document has already gone through several rounds of review. At present, however, they are referring to a twenty-point ‘document' that has never been officially or unofficially shared with us. Only fragments of it have appeared in the media.""

Vladimir Zelensky needs security guarantees so that he can continue the war without acknowledging the loss of territories.

The head of the Kiev regime expects that, in the event of a ceasefire, NATO will deploy missiles to Ukraine capable of ""targeting"" Russian towns.

All Western deliberations on how to move towards peace in Ukraine completely ignore the human rights situation: ""In Ukraine, we witness the comprehensive prohibition of the Russian language across all spheres of public life and the banning of the canonical Ukrainian Orthodox Church. These matters remain wholly absent from the West's - from Europe's, and certainly from Britain's - deliberations on pathways to peace.""

Zelensky does not care about the Ukrainian Constitution, under which he should have canceled the obsolete laws against the Russian language and the canonical Orthodox Church: ""He disregards that very Constitution. Under its provisions, he is obliged to repeal all these Neanderthal laws annihilating the Russian language and the canonical Orthodox Church.""

Instead of human rights protection, Europe and Kiev are proposing a ""tolerance accord"": ""In the final versions leaked to the press after intensive negotiations between American, European, and Ukrainian representatives post-Alaska, all such references had vanished. Instead, the text spoke vaguely of ‘mutual tolerance' between the parties (Russia and Ukraine).""

The European-staged provocations at sea will soon halt: ""They did provoke us, indeed. Currently, we are observing a significant number of such provocations at sea as well. However, I am confident that these will soon abate, as those orchestrating them will come to realize the seriousness of the consequences for themselves.""

The US, Denmark and Greenland are likely to negotiate the future status of the island: ""I expect that the US, Denmark, and Greenland will reach some arrangement. Now the European Union wishes to involve itself as well - ever eager to insert its services wherever possible. Reports indicate the original annexation plan has been shelved in favor of a quasi-lease or quasi-purchase agreement. The details remain unclear. In truth, it is not our affair.""

Debates over Greenland's territorial affiliation are hardly likely to change the Arctic situation: ""It is unlikely to change anything.""

The Board of Peace proposed by US President Donald Trump cannot replace the UN: ""That is an entirely different matter.""","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

Democrat Ro Khanna and Republican Thomas Massie reveal names they say DoJ redacted ‘for no apparent reason'. Plus, at least 10 dead, including suspect, after school shooting in Canada

Good morning.

The Democratic congressman Ro Khanna said on Tuesday that he and his Republican colleague Thomas Massie had forced the justice department to disclose the “hidden” names of six wealthy men they say are “likely incriminated” by their inclusion in the Jeffrey Epstein files.

Khanna read the names in the House of Representatives, protecting him from defamation lawsuits by the speech and debate clause of the US constitution.

In other news, Epstein, the convicted sex offender, appeared to engineer an intimate relationship between a woman in his orbit and Kimbal Musk, brother of Elon and a Tesla board of directors member, according to emails released by the DOJ.

Who are the six? Congressman Ro Khanna named: Leslie Wexner, the Victoria's Secret founder; Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem, CEO of DP World and an Emirati billionaire businessman; and four others identified as Nicola Caputo, Salvatore Nuara, Zurab Mikeladze and Leonic Leonov.

What did Khanna say? “Why did it take Thomas Massie and me going to the justice department to get these six men's identities to become public? If we found six men they were hiding in two hours, imagine how many men they are covering up for in those 3m files,” he said.

At least nine people have been killed and dozens injured after an assailant opened fire at a school in western Canada, in one of the deadliest mass shootings in the country's history. The suspect was later found dead from what appeared to be a self-inflicted injury.

The suspected shooter was found dead at the school, police said, adding they did not believe there were any more suspects or ongoing threat to the public.

Because of Canada's strict gun laws, which make it difficult to own handguns or assault-style weapons, the country has experienced far fewer instances of mass violence compared with the US. This is the second-deadliest school shooting in Canadian history, the first being a 1989 incident that killed 14 students.

What has the prime minister, Mark Carney, said? Carney said he was “devastated” by the shootings. “I join Canadians in grieving with those whose lives have been changed irreversibly today, and in gratitude for the courage and selflessness of the first responders who risked their lives to protect their fellow citizens,” he said.

A Washington DC grand jury declined to indict six Democratic lawmakers who were denounced by Donald Trump after they made a video urging troops to refuse illegal orders.

Federal prosecutors had sought an indictment against the Democrats who participated in the video, including Elissa Slotkin, Mark Kelly, Jason Crow, Chris Deluzio, Maggie Goodlander and Chrissy Houlahan, who all have military and intelligence backgrounds.

Trump was outraged by the clip, and described it “seditious behavior by traitors” that was “punishable by death”. Pete Hegseth, the defense secretary, formally censured Kelly, a retired Nasa astronaut and decorated navy captain, over the incident and attempted to reduce his rank and pension. Kelly filed a lawsuit against Hegseth last month arguing the video he and other Democrats made was protected free speech, and that the secretary had undertaken an “unconstitutional crusade” against him.

How did Kelly react to the administration's failed indictment against him? He described it as an “outrageous abuse of power by Donald Trump and his lackies”. “It wasn't enough for Pete Hegseth to censure me and threaten to demote me, now it appears they tried to have me charged with a crime – all because of something I said that they didn't like,” Kelly said. “That's not the way things work in America.

The FBI released footage of an “armed individual” at the home of Nancy Guthrie, the 84-year-old who has been missing since 1 February.

An Israeli court rejected an appeal to allow a five-year-old Palestinian boy with an aggressive form of cancer to enter Israel for life-saving treatment, citing a government policy that bars residents registered in Gaza from crossing the border.

Meanwhile, the White House reiterated Donald Trump's opposition towards Israel annexing the West Bank, amid Israeli maneuvers for more settlements in the occupied Palestinian territory.

Facing existential challenges on trade and security, the bloc has finally realised it has to grow up and go it alone – but the path ahead is a rocky one

 Don't get This Is Europe delivered to your inbox? Sign up here

Emmanuel Macron put it simply – and starkly. Confronted with “a world in disarray” and a double, potentially existential challenge from the US and China, he said: “Europe must become a power.”

The bloc is facing “a Chinese tsunami” on trade, Macron told several European newspapers, as the country most Europeans had for decades seen principally as an infinite export market transforms itself instead into a ferocious, low-price, hi-tech competitor.

And on defence, the US – which Europeans had thought “would guarantee our security forever” – was now “openly anti-European”, showed “contempt” for the EU, sought its “dismemberment” (and was “microsecond-level unstable” on trade, too).

“We are not moving at the right pace, and we are not operating on the right scale,” Macron said. “This must be the moment of awakening. It is time for Europe to wake up … If we do not decide for ourselves, we will be swept away.”

Stirring words, for sure. But this week there is a real sense that what Macron referred to as Europe's “Greenland moment” – Trump's attempted grab for the Arctic island, a semi-autonomous part of Denmark – may finally be focusing continental minds.

Two key events may give a hint of whether, and how, that focus translates into action. At a 16th-century chateau in rural Belgium on Thursday, Europe's leaders will discuss urgent measures to reboot the EU's sluggish economy and make it more competitive. And at the Munich Security Conference (MSC) on Friday and over the weekend, they will join other world leaders, military officials and experts to discuss European security and defence – and the future of the transatlantic relationship.

“We have the second largest economy in the world, but we are driving it with the handbrake on,” the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, said before the gathering at Belgium's Alden Biesen castle.

Leaders will discuss simplifying, loosening and scrapping regulations to cut red tape, remove barriers and deepen the single market; facilitating the flow of savings and investments; and keeping public money in the EU through a “buy European” rule.

The leaders will be addressed by two former Italian prime ministers, Enrico Letta and Mario Draghi – whose recommendations in 2024 reports on, respectively, the EU's single market and EU competitiveness the bloc has so far struggled to implement.

IMF research shows EU internal regulatory barriers equate to a 44% tariff on goods, and 110% on services, and one thinktank found only 15% of Draghi's 383 proposals – without which he said the bloc risked a “slow and agonising decline” – had been actioned.

Thursday's talks centre on how the EU can hold its own economically in a world that von der Leyen last month described as having “changed permanently”. Friday's will turn to the bloc's other critical challenge: defence and security.

The MSC's organisers were blunt in their pre-conference report: Europe had reached the “painful realisation” that it needs to be more assertive and militarily independent of a US administration it said was sliding into “competitive authoritarianism”.

Europeans have understood they simply cannot resist unfair trade deals or violations of other countries' sovereignty, it said, if they are “heavily dependent on the military assistance of the country that is using coercive tactics and slashing existing norms”.

Speeches from von der Leyen, Germany's chancellor Friedrich Merz and Nato chief Mark Rutte – who recently said Europe could “keep on dreaming” if it thought it could cope without US support – should provide at least an outline of the bloc's response.

Europe's citizens appear to have grasped the threat. A six-country poll by YouGov published this week found that opinion had turned radically against the US since the “Greenland moment”: between 62% and 84% of respondents expressed disapproval.

A political challenge

The most common view was that Europe's autonomy must now be prioritised over preserving the transatlantic alliance. But how? A report today by the European Council on Foreign Relations (ECFR) reveals the political challenge facing leaders.

Most European voters now realise the US is no longer a reliable ally, it said. Most also accept the need to increase defence spending. The problem, however, is that the Europeans who think those things are not always in the same camps or countries.

The report, based on polling in 13 countries, identifies several distinct groups. The largest (28%) are the Euro-hawks, who no longer see the US as an ally, back increased national defence spending, and take a broadly positive stance towards today's EU.

Euro-doves (21% overall) are equally sober about the US and attached to the EU, but do not support more defence spending. Atlanticists (12%) tend to still consider the US an ally, while Renegades (15%) reject everything: US, EU and more defence spending.

Nationalists (12%), meanwhile, do not believe much in the EU or see the US as an ally, but support more military spending, while the smallest group, the Trumpists (5% overall), still see the US as their ally, and are generally not much in favour of the EU.

These groups, the authors write, are present in different proportions in different countries and among different political camps: Euro-doves, for example, are most plentiful in Spain and Italy; Renegades among supporters of the populist left; nationalists among the populist far right.

The authors suggest Europe's way forward is a “values coalition” of compromises across the board: more defence spending for the Euro-doves; greater realism on the US for Atlanticists such as Poland; concessions for Euro-hawks such as France and Germany.

“Our polling delivers a clear message: a mobilised European majority can be composed out of the continent's scattered public,” said co-author Paweł Zerka. “But this requires leaders to step up and build bridges across the citizens' archipelago.”

Trump, outraged by clip of six lawmakers, called them ‘traitors' and said behavior was ‘punishable by death'

A Washington DC grand jury declined to indict six Democratic lawmakers who were denounced by Donald Trump after they made a video urging troops to refuse illegal orders.

Federal prosecutors had sought an indictment against the Democrats who participated in the video, including Elissa Slotkin, Mark Kelly, Jason Crow, Chris Deluzio, Maggie Goodlander and Chrissy Houlahan, who all have military and intelligence backgrounds.

Slotkin, a former CIA officer, organized the video in which the lawmakers said officers can resist unlawful commands. Trump was outraged by the clip, and described it as “seditious behavior by traitors” that was “punishable by death”.

Pete Hegseth, the defense secretary, formally censured Kelly, a retired Nasa astronaut and decorated navy captain, over the incident and attempted to reduce his rank and pension. Kelly filed a lawsuit against Hegseth last month arguing the video he and other Democrats made was protected free speech, and that the secretary had undertaken an “unconstitutional crusade” against him.

In response to news of the failed indictment, Kelly described it as an “outrageous abuse of power by Donald Trump and his lackies”.

“It wasn't enough for Pete Hegseth to censure me and threaten to demote me, now it appears they tried to have me charged with a crime – all because of something I said that they didn't like,” Kelly said. “That's not the way things work in America. Donald Trump wants every American to be too scared to speak out against him. The most patriotic thing any of us can do is not back down.”

Slotkin said in a statement on Tuesday that the video “simply quoted the law” and Jeanine Pirro, the US attorney, attempted to persuade a grand jury to indict Slotkin at the direction of Trump.

“Today, it was a grand jury of anonymous American citizens who upheld the rule of law and determined this case should not proceed,” Slotkin said, describing it as “another sad day for our country”. “Because whether or not Pirro succeeded is not the point. It's that President Trump continues to weaponize our justice system against his perceived enemies. It's the kind of thing you see in a foreign country, not in the United States we know and love.”

The Department of Justice had recently requested to interview Slotkin, the Michigan senator announced last month. Slotkin said she sent a letter to Bondi and Pirro informing them she would not comply with their inquiries and urged them to retain their records in the event she decides to sue.

“I'm not going to legitimize their actions,” Slotkin said. “Our constitution is crystal clear on the issue of freedom of speech – something worth fighting for. To be honest, many lawyers told me to just be quiet, keep my head down and hopefully this will all just go away.

“But that's exactly what the Trump administration and Jeanine Pirro want. They are purposely using physical and legal intimidation to get me to shut up. But, more importantly, they're using that intimidation to deter others from speaking out against their administration.”

The Trump administration has frequently sought to weaponize the legal system against political rivals and critics of the White House, including the former FBI director, James Comey, and Letitia James, the New York attorney general. A federal grand jury twice declined to indict James, while a judge dismissed the case against Comey after finding the prosecutor had been improperly appointed.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

UKRAINE

President to announce polls

President Volodymyr Zelenskiy intends to announce on Feb. 24 plans for presidential elections and a referendum, the Financial Times reported yesterday, citing Ukrainian and European officials involved in the planning. Under a framework being discussed by US and Ukrainian negotiators, any peace deal would be submitted to a referendum by Ukrainian voters, who would simultaneously vote in national elections. Officials had discussed the possibility that the national election and referendum could occur in May. Kyiv has begun planning a presidential election alongside a referendum on a prospective peace deal with Russia, the Financial Times reported.

UNITED KINGDOM

More troops headed to arctic

The government yesterday announced it would boost its troops stationed in Norway and play a “vital” role in a NATO arctic mission in face of “rising Russian threats.” The decision to double the number of British troops in Norway from 1,000 to 2,000 in the next three years comes as the US was set to relinquish two top regional NATO command posts to press allies to take greater responsibility for their defense.

 PHILIPPINES

Ferry possibly overloaded

Authorities yesterday said that a ferry might have been overloaded when it sank in the country's south last month, killing dozens of people who received no warning from the ship's crew. The death toll has risen steadily since the Trisha Kerstin 3 went down off Mindanao on Jan. 26, with the body of a woman pulled from the wreckage by divers yesterday morning bringing the tally to 52. The triple-decker vessel capsized on nearly the same route where 31 people were killed in a 2023 fire aboard the Lady Mary Joy 3 ferry. Locally based Aleson Shipping Lines owned both ships. Acting Secretary of Transportation Giovanni Lopez cited multiple safety violations in announcing administrative charges against the company, including that vehicles boarding the ferry were never weighed as required by law.

COLOMBIA

Kidnapped senator rescued

A senator was rescued from kidnappers on Tuesday as the president reported an attempt on his own life in the run-up to elections that observers have warned could be marred by violence. Senator Aida Quilcue, an award-winning indigenous activist, was taken by unknown people in her home department of Cauca. The 53-year-old was rescued by a group of indigenous people, her team reported on X, hours after the vehicle she had been traveling in with two bodyguards was found abandoned. President Gustavo Petro on Tuesday claimed that he too had been targeted, escaping an assassination attempt on Monday after months of warnings about an alleged plot by drug traffickers against him.

HONG KONG

Captain pleads not guilty

The Chinese captain of a Hong Kong-registered cargo ship yesterday pleaded not guilty to criminal damage of a Baltic Sea gas pipeline that was forced to shut down after a leak. Finnish police believe the vessel's six-tonne anchor struck the Balticconnector pipeline between Finland and Estonia in October 2023, leading to damage and the anchor breaking off. The ship's captain, 43-year-old Chinese national Wan Wenguo (萬文國), has been in custody in Hong Kong since May last year, accused of causing “criminal damage.” Wan was “reckless” and “damaged property belonging to another” without lawful excuse, the charge sheet said.

In recent days, anime conventions throughout China have reportedly banned participants from dressing as characters from Pokemon or Detective Conan and prohibited sales of related products.
China Military Online yesterday posted an article titled “Their schemes — beware the infiltration of Japanese militarism in culture and sports.”
The article referenced recent controversies around the popular anime series Pokemon, Detective Conan and My Hero Academia, saying that “the evil influence of Japanese militarism lives on in

Schellenberg's lawyer, Zhang Dongshuo (張東碩), yesterday confirmed China's Supreme People's Court struck down the sentence. 
Schellenberg was detained on drug charges in 2014 before China-Canada ties nosedived following the 2018 arrest in Vancouver of Huawei chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou (孟晚舟).
That arrest infuriated Beijing, which detained two Canadians — Michael Spavor and Michael Kovrig — on espionage charges that Ottawa condemned as retaliatory.

Once a symbol of cooperation, the “Friendship Bridge” connecting the two snow-covered banks has been reinforced with rows of razor wire and “dragon's teeth” anti-tank obstacles on the Estonian side.
“The name is kind of ironic,” regional border chief Eerik Purgel said.

Editor's note: This is a developing story and is being updated.

Ukrainian drones struck Russia's Volgograd oil refinery overnight Feb. 11, Ukraine's General Staff reported.

After the strike, a fire was reported on the facility, and the extent of the damage is being assessed, the General Staff said.

Russia's Defense Ministry earlier claimed that it had shot down 48 Ukrainian drones in several regions, not including over Volgograd Oblast itself.

Volgograd Oblast Governor Andrey Bocharov said damage was reported in a facility in the South Volgograd, referring to the oil refinery. Bocharov also claimed that an apartment building and a kindergarten were damaged, with no casualties.

""Emergency services and municipal authorities are conducting search and rescue operations to locate and dispose of possible drone debris,"" he added.

The refinery, operated by Russian oil giant Lukoil, was struck by drones for the first time this year, Telegram channel Exilenova+ reported.

Volgograd is located about 354 kilometers (220 miles) from Ukraine's eastern border with Russia and approximately 500 kilometers (310 miles) from Ukrainian-controlled territory near Kramatorsk, Donetsk Oblast.

Previously, on Jan. 10, Russian authorities in Volgograd Oblast reported a drone attack overnight that sparked a fire at an oil facility in the region's Oktyabrsky district.

The General Staff also said that several facilities in Russian-occupied Ukraine were hit, including a fuel depot in Crimea, anti-aircraft missile systems in occupied parts of Donetsk and Kherson oblasts, a logistics depot, military equipment, and facilities in which soldiers from Russia's Rubicon brigade were located in Zaporizhzhia Oblast. 

Kyiv regularly strikes deep within Russia and the occupied territories of Ukraine in an effort to diminish the Kremlin's fighting power.

Ukraine considers Moscow's energy sites military targets as they fund Russia's war against Ukraine.

On Feb. 7, Ukraine attacked Russia's Bryansk Oblast with Neptune missiles and High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS), targeting energy infrastructure and disrupting the power supply, Governor Alexander Bogomaz claimed.

On Feb. 8, the pro-Ukrainian Atesh partisan group disabled communication infrastructure in Russia's Belgorod Oblast, the group claimed.

""An agent of our movement set fire to a hardware module at the base of a communication tower. As a result of the destruction of the ground equipment, all the infrastructure installed on the mast was completely de-energized and put out of action,"" the Atesh group announced.

Russia may have lost about twice as many soldiers in Ukraine in December 2025 as the Soviet Union lost during the Soviet-Afghan War, a former British intelligence chief said on Feb. 10.

Sir Richard Moore, the former MI6 chief, gave an interview on Sky News' on the World podcast with journalist Yalda Hakim on Feb. 10, where he said that about 30,000 Russians were killed in Ukraine in December, describing the number as ""astonishing.""

Moore compared this monthly death toll for Russian soldiers to the casualties in the Soviet-Afghan war, which lasted for 10 years (1979-1989) and resulted in the death of approximately 15,000 Soviet soldiers.

""The losses are terrible, and even the Russians will struggle to replace that level of losses. So, they continue to do appallingly badly on the battlefield,"" Moore said.

Moore added that despite the losses, Russian President Vladimir Putin ""is more comfortable than he should be.""

""We should be adding more pressure. We should be helping the Ukrainians more extensively than we are. We should be giving them more permissions than we are at the moment,"" Moore said.

In December 2025, Russian losses for the first time exceeded the number of newly recruited contract soldiers, according to Ukraine's General Staff. Russia added 27,400 contract soldiers that month, while its losses reached 33,200 killed and wounded.

In previous months, the balance was more favorable for the Kremlin, according to Ukrainian figures. 

In November 2025, losses amounted to about 31,000, while more than 33,300 people were recruited on contract. In October, the figures stood at 31,500 losses versus 35,600 new contract soldiers.

In September Moore warned that he sees ""no evidence"" that Russian President Vladimir Putin is interested in negotiated peace in Ukraine except for full capitulation.

He made the statement when announcing MI6 would be launching a dark web portal to reach potential spies in Russia and other rival countries.

The British intelligence agency said it is using the dark web for the first time to minimize risks for the spies. MI6 shared instructions on how to use the platform on YouTube in several languages, including Russian.

Kateryna Kotsar, a Ukrainian freestyle skier, said on Feb. 10 that the International Olympic Committee (IOC) barred her from using a custom helmet with the inscription ""Be Brave like Ukrainians"" at the 2026 Winter Olympics.

The prohibition, which was communicated to Kotsar ahead of the Olympics, marks the second such notice provided to a Ukrainian athlete at the Games. 

Ukrainian skeleton racer Vladyslav Heraskevych also said on Feb. 10 that he has been barred from using a custom helmet at the 2026 Winter Olympics that honors Ukrainian athletes killed in Russia's war.

""About a week before the Olympic Games, I received an email saying that the International Olympic Committee considers this helmet to be propaganda, which means I cannot compete in it at the Games,"" Kotsar said on Ukrainian television. 

""Due to a lack of certain experience, knowledge, and probably confidence, I simply changed the helmet, and now it just has a small Ukrainian flag on it,"" Kotsar, who is competing at her first Olympic Games, added.

While the IOC contends that the Olympic Charter bars the ""politicisation of sport,"" questions have been raised over what is considered a politically motivated gesture.

Kotsar's comment emerged after the IOC's decision to bar fellow athlete Vladyslav Heraskevych's helmet drew widespread scrutiny in Ukraine.

President Volodymyr Zelensky posted in support of Heraskevych, noting that the helmet features portraits of Ukrainian athletes killed by Russia, including figure skater Dmytro Sharpar, who died in battle near Bakhmut, and 19-year-old biathlete Yevhen Malyshev, who was killed near Kharkiv.

""This truth cannot be inconvenient, inappropriate, or called a 'political action at sporting events,'"" Zelensky said, describing the helmet as a reminder of the price of Ukraine's struggle and of the Olympic movement's mission to stand for peace and life.

Kotsar stressed that the ban on the helmet's use in competition was handed down by the IOC, not the International Ski Federation. ""I've been competing in this helmet since 2022, and it has always had this inscription. I try to carry it with me all over the world,"" she said.

While the Russian and Belarusian national teams are banned from the Games, their athletes are allowed to compete in individual events under a “neutral” status.

The 2026 Winter Olympics kicked off on Feb. 6 and are ongoing in Milan.

Bombardier BBD-B-T said on Wednesday that Dubai-based private jet provider Vista Global has placed an order worth US$1.18-billion ($1.59-billion) for 40 Challenger 3500 business jets.

The order includes options for an additional 120 planes, which would bring the total value of all 160 aircraft to about US$4.72-billion, Bombardier said.

The deal comes amid sustained demand for private flying, which is swelling business jet makers' order books.

Bombardier to buy U.S. jet service provider amid White House threats to decertify planes

Bombardier, which reported an 11-per-cent rise in third-quarter revenue in November last year, is considering raising production of private jets. Customer demand for aftermarket care of jets is also growing, leading to service expansion in the U.S.

The Montreal-based company's shares have risen over 211-per-cent in the last year.

Bombardier recently came under fire from U.S. President Donald Trump's threats to decertify its business jets, over Ottawa's lengthy certification of jets produced by U.S. rival Gulfstream.

However, that dispute seems to be at its end, with the head of the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration saying on Tuesday he expected Canada to certify some Gulfstream business jets that had been delayed for years.

A visibly upset Prime Minister Mark Carney on Wednesday promised Canadians would get through what he called a 'terrible' mass shooting at a school in Tumbler Ridge, British Columbia.

Prime Minister Mark Carney says it's a difficult day for Canada and the nation is mourning after a mass shooting that has left 10 people dead in Tumbler Ridge, B.C.

Seven people were killed Tuesday at a high school in the small mining community, located in the northeastern part of the province. The RCMP said two more individuals were found dead in a residence connected to the incident, and the suspected shooter had died of an apparent self-inflicted injury.

Speaking to reporters ahead of a caucus meeting, Mr. Carney said he had spoken to B.C. Premier David Eby and that all assistance will be offered.

“This morning, parents, grandparents, sisters, brothers in Tumbler Ridge will wake up without someone they love,” said Mr. Carney, who was visibly emotional.

“The nation mourns with you. Canada stands by you.”

Ten killed, including suspect, in mass shooting in Tumbler Ridge, B.C.

In the wake of the incident, the Prime Minister's Office confirmed that Mr. Carney's trip to Germany for the Munich Security Conference has been cancelled. It said that Defence Minister David McGuinty, Foreign Affairs Minister Anita Anand and Artificial Intelligence Minister Evan Solomon will attend on his behalf. The office also postponed a previously scheduled announcement that was expected to be about Canada's new defence industrial strategy.

The PMO said Mr. Carney remains in the national capital region at this time, while Public Safety Minister Gary Anandasangaree is joining Mr. Eby in Tumbler Ridge, B.C., later today. Housing Minister Gregor Robertson, who is from B.C., will also be there, as will Nina Krieger, province's Minister of Public Safety and Solicitor-General.

Mr. Carney said he has asked for the flags on Parliament Hill to be lowered to half-mast for the next week. He will also be delivering a statement in the House of Commons Wednesday afternoon.

He thanked first responders, teachers, staff and residents for their response to the shooting, as well as the world leaders who have reached out to express condolences.

“We will get through this, we'll learn from this, but right now, it's a time to come together – as Canadians always do – in these situations, these terrible situations, to support each other, to mourn together and to grow together,” Mr. Carney said.

Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre said the incident was devastating and called on Canadians to unite in support of the families and larger community.

“The fact that this took place at a secondary school – it makes it even more tragic,” he said. “As a father, I can't even imagine the phone calls that parents might have received.”

“I can't imagine the heartache and hell that they're living through.”

He said he will be in touch with Mr. Carney and other parties to offer support.

“I encourage all Canadians to pray for the community and pray for the family as we go forward and take the necessary steps to support them,” he said.

Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre called on Canadians to unite in support of the families and community of Tumbler Ridge. Interim NDP leader Don Davies, Green Party Leader Elizabeth May and B.C. Liberal MP Zoe Royer offered condolences at a news conference in Ottawa.

The Canadian Press

Governor-General Mary Simon said in a statement that she and her husband Whit Fraser send their deepest condolences to the community. They also thanked the first responders.

“In this unimaginable moment of tragedy, the whole of Canada has Tumbler Ridge in its thoughts,” she said. “Let us stay united in our compassion and reach out to one another with love and tenderness today, as we join the entire nation in grieving.”

Her office also confirmed that her schedule has been suspended in light of the events.

Government House Leader Steven MacKinnon's office confirmed that the House of Commons will hold a moment of silence at 2 p.m. ET, before speeches from Mr. Carney and the opposition leaders. From there, the House of Commons will rise.

NDP interim leader Don Davies expressed his condolences to residents of Tumbler Ridge while appearing with other MPs to hold a news conference ahead of national Kindness Week, which occurs from Feb. 15 to 21.

He said there was a “cruel irony” to being at such an event, but also a profound symmetry given the gathering of MPs across party lines to focus on the opposite of what has happened in British Columbia.

Responding to questions from journalists, Mr. Davies said there will be time in coming days to learn more about what has happened. 

“Right now, we have to come together as a country and express our deep condolences and grief to all those who are suffering and offer whatever help might be needed in this community at this time,” he said.

At the same event, Green Party Leader Elizabeth May said she expected first responders are going to need a lot of emotional support after what they witnessed inside the school doors in Tumbler Ridge.

“It's unspeakable. It's a terrible tragedy and we mourn with those who have lost so much,” she said.

Stephen Fuhr, a Liberal MP from British Columbia, told journalists that troubled people do unthinkable things from time to time.

“It's a massive tragedy. It's in a very small community. It will be very difficult to deal with this. Who do you lean on when your entire community is affected by tragedies of this magnitude that you don't see in our country very often?”

Editor's note: A previous version of this story incorrectly said Prime Minister Mark Carney would deliver a statement in the House of Commons Tuesday afternoon. The statement was scheduled for Wednesday afternoon.

Attorney-General Pam Bondi testifies before a House Judiciary Committee oversight hearing on Capitol Hill in Washington on Wednesday.Tom Brenner/The Associated Press

Attorney-General Pam Bondi launched into a wide-ranging, passionate defence of President Donald Trump, repeatedly shouting at Democrats during a combative hearing in which she postured herself as the Republican's chief protector and tried to turn the page from persistent criticism of the Justice Department's handling of the Jeffrey Epstein files.

Besieged by questions over Epstein and accusations of a weaponized Justice Department, Bondi aggressively pivoted in an extraordinary speech in which she mocked her Democratic questioners, praised Trump over the performance of the stock market and openly aligned herself as in sync with a president whom she painted as a victim of past impeachments and investigations.

“You sit here and you attack the President and I'm not going to have it,” Bondi said. “I am not going to put up with it.”

With victims of Epstein sitting behind her in the hearing room, Bondi defended the department's handling of the files related to the wealthy financier's sex trafficking investigation that have dogged her tenure. But she repeatedly refused to directly answer questions from Democrats who have accused her of perpetuating a cover-up and ignoring victims.

In her opening remarks, Bondi told the victims to come forward to law enforcement with any information and about her abuse and said she “deeply sorry” for what they had suffered.

“Any accusations of criminal wrongdoing will be taken seriously and investigated,” Bondi said.

 

The Associated Press

Bondi's appearance before the House Judiciary Committee comes a year into her tumultuous tenure that has amplified concerns that the Justice Department is using its law enforcement powers to target political foes of the president.

Just a day earlier, the department had sought to secure charges against Democratic lawmakers who produced a video urging military service members not to follow “illegal orders.” But in an extraordinary rebuke of prosecutors, a grand jury in Washington refused to return an indictment. 

The committee chairman, Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, opened the hearing by repeating talking points that the Justice Department, under Democratic President Joe Biden, was weaponized against Donald Trump and conservatives. Democrats and many good government advocates say it is Trump's own administration that has politicized law enforcement.

“What a difference a year makes. Under Attorney-General Bondi, the DOJ has returned to its core missions – upholding the rule of law, going after the bad guys and keeping Americans safe,” Jordan said.

Democrats excoriated Bondi over haphazard redactions in the files that has kept secret the names of abusers but exposed private and intimate details about victims and also included nude photographs.

“Your department has shown a pattern of redacting the names of powerful predators,” said Rep. Pramila Jayapal, a Washington Democrat, reading from an e-mail involving a withheld name and referencing a “torture video.”

She asked victims of Epstein's abuse to raise their hand if they had been unable to meet with the Justice Department. Jayapal noted that “every single survivor has raised their hand.”

Bondi has struggled to move past the backlash over her handling of the Epstein files since distributing binders to a group of social media influencers at the White House in February, 2025. The binders included no new revelations about Epstein, leading to even more calls from Trump's base for the files to be released.

Members of Congress were at the department earlier this week to look through unredacted versions of the files. As part of an arrangement with the Justice Department, lawmakers were given access to the over 3 million released files in a reading room with four computers and were allowed to take handwritten notes.

Opinion: How did Jeffrey Epstein become Jeffrey Epstein?

Democrats have accused the department of redacting information that should have been made public, including information that could lead to scrutiny of Epstein's associates. Meanwhile, survivors have slammed the department for inconsistent or non-existent redactions that allowed for the inadvertent release of nude photos and other private information.

Department officials have defended their handling of the files, saying they took pains to protect survivors, but that errors were inevitable given the volume of the materials and the speed at which the department had to release them. The Associated Press and other media organizations are still reviewing millions of pages of documents, many of them previously confidential.

An AP review of records shows that while investigators collected ample proof that Epstein sexually abused underage girls, they found scant evidence the well-connected financier led a sex trafficking ring serving powerful men. Videos and photos seized from Epstein's homes in New York, Florida and the U.S. Virgin Islands did not depict people being abused or implicate anyone else in his crimes, a prosecutor wrote in one 2025 memo.

The case involving lawmakers' video to military service members could provide additional fodder for Democrats to hammer Bondi and question how the Justice Department is using its investigative authority.

The video, featuring Democrats who are veterans or have experience in the intelligence community, angered the administration – Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, in particular.

The Justice Department opened an investigation into the video in which Democratic Sens. Mark Kelly of Arizona and Elissa Slotkin of Michigan, along with four other Democrats, urged U.S. service members to follow established military protocols and reject orders they believe to be unlawful.

A grand jury in Washington on Tuesday declined to issue any indictments. It wasn't immediately clear whether prosecutors had sought indictments against all six lawmakers or what charge or charges prosecutors attempted to bring. But it marked the latest instance of a grand jury rebuffing the Justice Department in cases involving critics of the administration.

A school shooting in British Columbia left eight people dead, including the shooter, and dozens injured, Canadian police said. Two other deaths at a nearby residence are believed to be related to the incident.



A shooting at a high school in the Canadian province of British Columbia left eight dead, including the suspect, authorities said on Tuesday.

Two more people were found dead at a nearby home in what is believed to be a connected incident, authorities added.

""As part of the initial response to the active shooting, police entered the school to locate the threat. During the search, officers located multiple victims. An individual believed to be the shooter was also found deceased with what appears to be a self‑inflicted injury,"" the Royal Canadian Mounted Police said in a statement.

Canadian media have described the shooter as a woman, which would be unusual, as mass shootings in North America are almost always carried out by men.

At a press conference, the RCMP declined to provide any details on the suspect's identity or the type of weapons used.

Six people, not including the suspect, were found at the school, the RCMP said. A seventh victim died while being transported to a hospital. 

More than 25 people were injured in the shooting at Tumbler Ridge Secondary School. This included two people with serious or life-threatening injuries, who have been airlifted to a hospital.

Police said all remaining students and staff were safely evacuated and they did not ​believe there were any more suspects or ongoing threats to the public.

They received the report of the active shooting around 1:20 p.m. (20:20 UTC/GMT) local time on Tuesday, February 10.

British Columbia Premier David Eby told reporters that police reached the school within two minutes of receiving notification.



Prime Minister Mark Carney issued a statement of support for the affected families, saying he was ""devastated by today's horrific shootings in Tumbler Ridge.""

His office said he was suspending a planned trip to Halifax, Nova Scotia, where he was to announce a new defense industrial strategy, and to Munich, Germany, where he was to attend the Munich Security Conference.  

Larry Neufeld, the member of the legislature for Peace River South, told reporters at the legislature that an ""excess"" of resources, including RCMP and ambulance support, had been sent to the community.

He said he didn't want to release any more information over concerns that it might jeopardize the safety of the ongoing operation.

Tumbler Ridge Mayor Darryl Krakowka said the whole community was grieving, calling it a ""big family."" 

He said he had lived there for 18 years and probably knew every one of the victims.

DW also spoke with Trent Ernst, a journalist with the Tumbler RidgeLines newspaper, who said the number of 10 dead was ""a pretty large number"" in view of the just 150-160 children at the school.  

According to Ernst, incidents like school shootings were ""not even considered a possibility in a place like Tumbler Ridge.""

""If there's a kid in the classroom, you know, flipping his knife back and forth, he gets sent to the principal's office. It feels so 1960s, 70s compared to when you look at what happens, you know, in larger communities down in the States,"" he said.

Ernst said, however, that now, the general feeling that Tumbler Ridge was a ""very safe place"" had been destroyed.

""That sense has been broken,"" he said.

Tumbler Ridge is a remote municipality with a population of around 2,400 people. It is located in the foothills of the Rocky Mountains more than 1,000 kilometers (600 miles) north of Vancouver, near the border with Alberta.

School shootings are rare in Canada. The shooting at Tumbler Ridge is the second-deadliest school shooting in Canadian history, according to Canadian national broadcaster CBC.

More people in Germany are taking driving tests than ever before — but costs have also skyrocketed and not everyone passes the first time, according to new statistics. DW has more.

Welcome to DW's coverage of what Germany is talking about on Wednesday, February 11. Catch up on yesterday's news here.

Hertha Berlin's wait for a German Cup final appearance at ""home"" in the Olympiastadion has been extended for another year after a quarterfinal defeat to SC Freiburg on penalties on Tuesday night.

The German Cup (DFB Pokal) final has taken place in Berlin since 1985 – but Hertha, who play their Bundesliga 2 home games at the Olympiastadion, haven't reached a cup final since 1979 when they lost to Fortuna Düsseldorf in Hannover.

Ironically, Hertha's amateur reserve team sensationally reached the final in 1993, losing to Bayer Leverkusen, but the first team has never made it that far.

After 90 goalless minutes on Tuesday, Bundesliga side Freiburg took the lead in extra-time through Japanese midfielder Yuito Suzuki. Fabian Reese drew Hertha level with a stunning goal to take the tie to penalties, where Freiburg won 5-4 to join Bayer Leverkusen and defending champions VfB Stuttgart in the semifinals.

The final quarterfinal takes place on Wednesday night as Bayern Munich (who haven't reached a cup final since 2020) face RB Leipzig.

A former member of the United States armed forces was sentenced in Germany to two years and eight months in prison on Wednesday after being found guilty of planning to pass on sensitive military information to Chinese intelligence.

The court found that the 39-year-old US citizen, who had previously served in the US Navy before working for a civilian contractor on US military bases in the southwestern German cities of Wiesbaden and Mainz, had contacted Chinese state institutions on several occasions in summer 2024 with offers of intelligence.

He was arrested on November 7, 2024, before actually managing to pass on any information.

The court determined that the man's motivation stemmed from a falling out with his employer relating to perceived injustices against the US military, for example, alleged billing fraud. According to the judge, the accused raised these issues with both his employer and US authorities. Feeling ignored and seeing no improvement, he decided to take further action.

The court noted that the Chinese authorities appear to have shown little interest in the information offered.

A group of leading German businesses has warned that the European Union is ""falling behind in global competition"" and called on the bloc's leaders to implement key reforms to boost competitiveness with global players like the United States and China.

The ""Made for Germany"" alliance of 123 companies and investors said in a statement on Wednesday that Europe's industrial base is under immense pressure, facing off against nations that control their industrial policy, deliberately deregulate the economy and rapidly expand key technologies.

""Many European companies are losing competitiveness every day,"" warned the group, which includes German heavyweights like Siemens and Deutsche Bank, calling for a move ""away from overregulation.""

""Europe must master the critical technologies that underpin industry, energy supply and security,"" said Siemens chief executive Roland Busch. ""We have everything we need to do this: a strong industrial base, first-class talent and in-depth technological expertise.""

Deutsche Bank chief executive Christian Sewing criticized the EU for not playing to its strengths, saying, ""There is already considerable interest in investing in Europe again, and it will grow even more if we set the right course now.""

The ""Made for Germany"" initiative was launched last year in a bid to boost the country's ailing economy, with businesses and investors pledging to invest over €800 billion ($952 billion) by 2028.

The group's statement comes a day before EU leaders are set to gather in Belgium to discuss the bloc's economic challenges.

Germany continued its impressive start to the Winter Olympics in Milan-Cortina with another two medals on Tuesday: Julia Taubitz won gold in the women's single luge and Emma Aicher and Kira Weidle-Winkelmann won silver in the Alpine skiing women's team combined.

After gold for Max Langenhan in the men's luge on Sunday and Philipp Raimund in the men's ski jumping on Monday, plus bronze in the biathlon mixed relay, ""Team D"" (for Deutschland) is currently joint-second with Sweden in the early medal table, behind first-place Norway.

On Wednesday, German medal hopes will be focused on the women's biathlon singles, where world champion Franziska Preuss is going for gold — along with fellow Germans Vanessa Voigt, Janina Hettich-Walz and Selina Grotian.

German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul is set to welcome counterparts from several Central Asian countries to Berlin on Wednesday.

In addition to bilateral meetings with the foreign ministers of Turkmenistan, Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan, meetings with business representatives are also planned.

According to the German Foreign Ministry, Central Asian states are becoming increasingly important partners for Germany on various current issues, including energy, raw materials and climate change.

Countries in Central Asia are also key when it comes to preventing Russia's circumvention of sanctions imposed in relation to the ongoing invasion of Ukraine.

A record number of people took driving tests in Germany in 2025 — but the first-attempt pass rate remained relatively low, according to the latest annual figures from the Technical Inspection Association (Technischer Überwachungsverein or TÜV), which carries out driving tests, licensing and inspections.

According to the TÜV, 1.89 million practical driving tests were administered in 2025, some 90,000 more than in 2024 — marking an increase of 4.9%. Theory tests were also up by around 33,000 to 2.04 million, an increase of 1.6%. The vast majority of tests were for the standard category B license (73% of practical tests and 80% of theory tests).

""Driving licenses are booming as much as ever,"" said TÜV spokesman Richard Goebelt.

The majority of learner drivers in Germany passed their tests first time (65% practical, 63% theory), meaning that every third applicant faced a re-test, where the pass rate was significantly lower (58% practical, 44% theory).

""Repeat applicants have a hard time and some even fail several times,"" said Goebelt, explaining that every failed test adds extra psychological and financial pressure. ""If you want to get your driving license faster and cheaper, you have to do everything to pass at the first attempt.""

The cost of obtaining a driving license in Germany has skyrocketed in recent years. According to the ADAC, Europe's largest automobile association, learner drivers in 2026 can expect to pay between €2,500 and €4,500 ($2,980 and $5,360) in total costs. By way of comparison, the average cost in 2020 was around €2,200 and in 2017 around €1,900.

German Transport Minister Patrick Schnieder (CDU) has announced reforms on which he is expected to elaborate this week. According to the minister, the goal of the reform is ""to make obtaining a driving license more affordable — while maintaining the same high standards of road safety.""

The TÜV Association has proposed ""mandatory, standardized digital progress checks"" to determine ""readiness for the driving test"" before the exam. The association is critical, however, of ""proposals that amount to a blanket reduction of requirements for preparing novice drivers — for example, reductions in driving time, test duration and the question catalog.""

A total of 818 crimes against journalists or media were reported to Germany's investigative federal police force between April 2024 and November 2025. Just over 10% of them were violent in nature. 

A response to an inquiry from the opposition Left Party shows a steep increase in politically motivated crimes against the media in Germany over the last couple of years. 

Figures released by the Interior Ministry showed that a total of 818 crimes targeting ""media"" were registered with the BKA, Germany's federal investigative police force, between April 1, 2024 and November 30, 2025. 

That averages out at roughly 41 cases per month over a 20-month period, and compares to 290 crimes, for an average of roughly 24 per month, in the calendar year 2023. The increase equates to roughly 71%. 

The Left Party's spokesman on media politics in the Bundestag parliament, David Schliesing, said the figures had reached a ""shockingly high level.""

""The federal and state governments must urgently take action and do considerably more to protect journalistic work,"" he said. 

Authorities attributed roughly 30% of the cases, 244, to the right wing of the political spectrum and 78 cases, just under 10%, to the left. 

A ""foreign ideology"" was deemed the motivating political factor in 153 cases, and a ""religious ideology"" was singled out for 31 cases. 

The plurality of the politically motivated cases, 312, were not assigned to any of these four pigeon holes by investigators. 

More than 10% of the crimes, 89 in total, were violent in nature. This included 73 cases of assault or causing injury, 13 so-called ""resistance crimes"" (for instance when violently resisting arrest or detention), two cases of arson and one robbery.

A total of 211 took place in the context of public demonstrations, including the vast majority, 73, of the violent crimes, the Interior Ministry figures said. 

Other common offenses included 101 cases of coercion or threats, 53 cases of incitement to racial violence, 47 propaganda offenses as well as 43 cases of damage of property.

Berlin — home to many media outlets' headquarters, as well as being a notoriously politicized city and a magnet to demonstrators from across much of the country — dominated the figures. 

Almost half the crimes, 406 in total, took place in the capital and city state, as did 51 of the violent crimes.

Perhaps surprisingly, second in line was the largest eastern state of Saxony, despite it being only Germany's seventh most populous state, with 82 cases. 

Bavaria was next in line with 64, while the most populous state of North Rhine-Westphalia, which is also home to Germany's unofficial media capital of old Cologne, logged 55.

			Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem is among six powerful men whose names have been unredacted in the Epstein files

Amid the tens of thousands of deeply disturbing photos, videos and emails contained in the Epstein files is a chilling message: “I loved the torture video.”

The name of the person who received that email from paedophile Jeffrey Epstein was redacted when the US Department of Justice (DOJ) released 3 million files on Jan 30.

Now that man can be identified as one of the Middle East's most powerful businessmen.

Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem, the chairman and chief executive of DP World, which owns a vast global network of ports and shipping and logistics companies, was one of the “six wealthy, powerful men” who initially had their names redacted in the files but were unmasked on Tuesday.

Ro Khanna, the Democrat who helped to force the Epstein files release, named Mr Sulayem on the House floor where members of congress are legally protected from the threat of defamation.

The DOJ allowed lawmakers access to unredacted Epstein files for the first time on Monday, allowing Mr Khanna and Thomas Massie, the Republican who pushed for the release, to identify redacted men.

Mr Khanna said the DOJ had hidden the names of men for “no apparent reason”.

Mr Sulayem's name appears extensively in the files, alongside photos of him and Epstein together.

He exchanged emails with Epstein for more than a decade after Epstein was jailed in 2008.

In April 2009, while he was still serving his 18-month sentence in a Palm Beach jail but allowed work release, Epstein emailed Mr Sulayem.

“Where are you? are you ok , I loved the torture video,” he wrote.

Born into an influential Emirati family, Mr Sulayem has risen to become one of the region's most influential figures.

His father was an adviser to Dubai's royal family and his brother is the president of the governing body of Formula One and other motorsports.

In a letter included in the DoJ files, Epstein suggested that he had known Mr Sulayem since 2002 and described him as a “close personal friend”.

“Sultan Bin Sulayem has a net worth of well over $100 Million Dollars. I have known him for more than 8 years and will personally vouch for him and any information he provides in connection with this application,” Epstein wrote in 2010, in what appears to be a reference letter for Mr Sulayem's attempts to lease an undisclosed property.

Since Mr Sulayem took the helm of DP World as chairman in 2007, the company has become one of the biggest port operators in the world.

DP World also owns British shipping company P&O Ferries, which fired 800 seafarers in 2022, giving them just 30 minutes' notice. The move was criticised by the Tory Government at the time, with Grant Shapps, then transport secretary, describing it as “shameful”.

In a letter addressed to Mr Sulayem, the workers' union said the dismissals were “callous and beneath contempt”.

“This behaviour not only lacks any form of basic decency, but appears to be a flagrant violation of UK labour law,” the letter added. P&O denied any wrongdoing.

In 2008, he was pictured with Donald Trump at a gala introducing Trump's International Hotel & Tower in Dubai.

Michael Wolff, the biographer who spoke to Epstein for more than 100 hours before his death, previously said Mr Trump and Epstein shared an “abiding obsession” of chasing supermodels.

In 2007, Mr Sulayem had emailed Epstein about his own attempts to meet a supermodel, according to a separate cache of emails obtained by Bloomberg.

“She told me a funny story,” Epstein wrote to Mr Sulayem in a November 2007 email.

“Yes,” Mr Sulayem replied. “After several attemps for several months we managed to meet in NY. there is a missunderstanding she she wanted some BUSINESS! while i only wanted some PUSSYNESS!”

“Praise Allah, there are still people like you,” Epstein wrote back.

Even after Epstein's conviction in 2008, Mr Sulayem continued his correspondence.

In 2015, he described one encounter to Epstein as “the best sex I ever had”.

He later appears to have helped arrange for a Russian masseuse from Epstein's “private spa” to get a job as a trainee at a five-star hotel in Turkey so “she gains better experiences”, he wrote in 2017.

Among the other redacted names revealed by Mr Khanna on Tuesday were Les Wexner, the billionaire retail mogul.

Mr Wexner's ties to Epstein have been extensively reported, including that Epstein used to tell women he was a recruiter for lingerie brand Victoria's Secret, which is owned by Mr Wexner.

Neither Mr Wexner nor Mr Sulayem have been accused of wrongdoing or have been convicted of any crimes in connection to Epstein.

Mr Khanna suggested there are probably more names in the files that should be unredacted.

“If we found six men that they were hiding in two hours, imagine how many men they are covering up for in those three million files,” Mr Khanna said on Tuesday.

He noted that the FBI had scrubbed the files before handing them over to the DoJ, including files “naming rich and powerful men who went to Epstein's island, who went to his ranch, who went to his home and raped and abused underage girls”.

“They're all hidden,” Mr Khanna said. It asks a fundamental question: ‘Who are they protecting?'

DP World has been contacted for comment.

Nearly 6 in 10 Americans say they would prefer a system in which presidents are elected based on the popular vote.

Truthout is an indispensable resource for activists, movement leaders and workers everywhere. Please make this work possible with a quick donation.

State lawmakers in Virginia are on their way to joining an agreement with other states that aims to diminish the importance of the Electoral College in favor of a system in which presidential elections are determined based on which candidate wins the national popular vote. 

The National Popular Vote Interstate Compact utilizes a little-known provision in the U.S. Constitution, which allows state legislatures to decide how to allocate their Electoral College votes. Every state in the country, plus Washington D.C., currently does so through popular vote within their own boundaries (with two states doing so through popular vote within individual congressional districts).

However, the current system is imperfect: Although electoral votes are allocated based partially on population, every state is guaranteed at least three electors, giving much smaller states a higher proportionality of votes than larger states. The result can sometimes mean a candidate who didn't win the popular vote can win the presidency through the Electoral College, which has happened several times throughout U.S. history, including twice since 2000.

This system also makes it less likely for voters in states that are heavily Democratic or Republican to take part in presidential elections, as they may view their participation as pointless. 

“Under the current system, the presidential election is decided by voters in a handful of battleground states, while the votes of the four out of five Americans who live in safely blue or safely red states are essentially irrelevant,” Alyssa Cass, a spokesperson for National Popular Vote, told Truthout.

Indeed, presidential candidates seem to ignore these states, and in turn their constituents' concerns, focusing their attention instead on the “swing states” that could tip the scales of the Electoral College. In 2024, 94 percent of the 2024 presidential general election campaign took place in just seven states. 

“Voters don't have an enormous amount of confidence in a system where the majority of their voices aren't being heard,” Cass added.

Under the terms of the compact, states involved in the agreement would send their votes to whichever candidate wins the popular vote, even if a majority of voters in their own boundaries chose someone else. The Electoral College would still technically exist, but would be used in a way that guarantees the popular vote winner receives a majority of the electoral votes to become president. 

The compact does not go into effect until it reaches the number of states needed to have a majority of Electoral College votes, currently at 270. The compact currently has the support of 17 states plus D.C., representing 209 electoral votes.

If Virginia joins the compact, it would increase that total to 222 Electoral College votes, with just 48 remaining before the compact goes into play. 

Nearly 6 in 10 Americans support changing the current system of selecting the president to a system where the winner of the popular vote takes the Oval Office.

On Monday, the Virginia State Senate approved passage of a bill that would place the commonwealth within the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact. The bill now goes to the House of Delegates, where it is expected to pass, with lawmakers potentially voting as early as Wednesday in support of the measure. Democratic Gov. Abigail Spanberger is expected to sign the bill if it reaches her desk.

Senate Democratic Majority Leader Scott Surovell expressed support for the bill earlier this week, saying it is far past time to get rid of the Electoral College.

“The Electoral College is not something we should be lauding and patting ourselves on the back and saying what a wonderful thing it is,” Surovell said. “It has arrogant, aristocratic and racist origins, and its consequences continue to play itself out today.”

With Virginia poised to join the compact, proponents are optimistic that more states will soon want to join.

The compact is “well on its way to enactment, especially with this latest burst of momentum in Virginia,” Cass said.

In a victory for the fossil fuel industry, a set of Obama-era rules that required the federal government to regulate the emissions of six greenhouse gases is being reversed by the Trump administration. The changes would undo the legal basis of the fight against global warming, as well as remove industrial reporting obligations and roll back emissions standards for cars and trucks. Environmental engineer Gretchen Goldman helped author those emission standards while working for the Department of Transportation under the Biden administration. Now as the president of the Union of Concerned Scientists, she says their repeal will not only increase what drivers pay at the pump but also set U.S. innovation back on the world stage. “We're really seeing the abdication of U.S. leadership on climate, and that has huge implications, both for our immediate ability to reduce heat-trapping emissions globally … but also in terms of our standing and contribution in the world.”

We turn now to the Trump administration's sweeping rollback of climate change policy. On Thursday, the Environmental Protection Agency plans to overturn its own conclusion that greenhouse gases endanger public health and cause global warming. Known as the endangerment finding, the Obama-era rules from 2009 required the federal government to regulate the emissions of six gases, including carbon monoxide and methane, which are released from the burning of oil, gas and coal. The Trump administration's reversal of this decision would undo the legal basis of the fight against global warming and remove emissions standards for cars and trucks and reporting on obligations for power plants and industries. The EPA's draft version the new rule says the endangerment finding overstated the risk of heat waves and underplayed the benefits of increased carbon pollution.

In a post on X on Tuesday, the EPA Secretary Lee Zeldin wrote, quote, “This week, we make history. Getting ready to join President Trump to announce the single largest act of deregulation in the history of the USA,” unquote.

For more, we go to Washington, D.C., where we're joined by Gretchen Goldman, president and CEO of the Union of Concerned Scientists, also an environmental engineer, formerly worked on environmental policy in the Biden White House and at the Department of Transportation.

Gretchen, thanks so much for being with us. Talk about the significance of what's happening now.

GRETCHEN GOLDMAN: It's quite significant, and it was quite devastating to see, even though we expected that this was coming. The impacts of this action will be vast, both in terms of our immediate ability to protect people from the harms of climate change, economic harms, health harms, and also in terms of our ability to meet U.S. climate goals, to meet global climate goals.

And this is all happening with time that we don't have. We know we need to swiftly and dramatically reduce heat-trapping gas emissions now, as year after year we see devastating harm from climate-driven extreme weather events. And this is now something we really need to take action on, and so it's quite devastating to see this week.

AMY GOODMAN: The Trump administration initially attempted to undermine the science behind the endangerment finding. And again, for people to understand, explain exactly what that is and what that report was, based at the Department of Energy.

GRETCHEN GOLDMAN: As part of their broader attacks on climate science and climate action, the Trump administration secretly convened a group of climate contrarians under the Department of Energy to produce a report that reiterated many of the long-debunked climate denial talking points and tried to pass it off as a science-based report. We won in court, the Union of Concerned Scientists and the Environmental Defense Fund together. We won, and the administration disbanded that group of climate contrarians and have had to turn over more than 100,000 pages of documents related to that. We're seeing that they are being slowed down by these efforts and our ability to push back.

AMY GOODMAN: Can you talk about President Trump's personal connections to fossil fuel executives and how exactly that is affecting what is expected to be announced on Thursday, again, what many are calling the single — including Zeldin, the single biggest attack in U.S. history on federal authority to tackle the climate crisis? He calls it the single largest deregulation act in U.S. history.

GRETCHEN GOLDMAN: This is their holy grail. They've been focused on this for a long time, because the reality of climate change and its impacts are very inconvenient if you're someone who wants to give handouts to the fossil fuel industry and wants to ensure that these industries can continue polluting communities across the country. And so, we're seeing them really take steps to give handouts to connections to the fossil fuel industry and others. And that's harming communities, especially Black and Brown communities, where we know already face disproportionate impacts and harms from toxic air pollution.

AMY GOODMAN: This comes a month after President Trump pulled the U.S. out of the UNFCCC — right? — the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Talk about the significance of these two acts together.

GRETCHEN GOLDMAN: We're really seeing the abdication of U.S. leadership on climate, and that has huge implications, both for our immediate ability to reduce heat-trapping emissions globally, as we know is desperately needed, but also in terms of our standing and contribution in the world. The U.S. has long exhibited climate leadership in terms of innovation, in terms of reduction in emissions and in terms of providing that urgency around what we need to do to take action on climate change. And this, unfortunately, is going to set us back a long time in terms of that diplomacy, those international relationships and the U.S.'s ability to help lead the world in taking action on climate change.

AMY GOODMAN: Karoline Leavitt, the White House press spokesperson, emphasized auto standards being an area where regulation will be rolled back. You used to work, Gretchen Goldman, at the Department of Transportation. Can you talk about emissions standards and what's been achieved by these standards, and the incredible effect of a rollback?

GRETCHEN GOLDMAN: I was at the Department of Transportation working on climate and transportation issues, and so this is very devastating to me personally, as well. Under the previous administration, we issued the strongest standards to reduce dependence of cars and trucks on fossil fuel, and this was saving people money at the pump. It was helping us with climate emissions reductions, and it was reducing toxic air pollution in communities. It was one of the strongest climate actions that this nation has taken. But now, tomorrow, it's expected to be announced that they're repealing those standards, and that's going to set us back. It's going to cost consumers more money, and it's really going to stifle innovation and our ability to meet the moment and reduce climate emissions everywhere.

AMY GOODMAN: Well, I want to thank you very much for being with us, Gretchen Goldman, president and CEO of the Union of Concerned Scientists, speaking to us from Washington, D.C.

A very happy birthday to Messiah Rhodes!

Fourteen-year-old Ariana Velasquez had been held at the immigrant detention center in Dilley, Texas, with her mother for some 45 days when I managed to get inside to meet her. The staff brought everyone in the visiting room a boxed lunch from the cafeteria: a cup of yellowish stew and a hamburger patty in a plain bun. Ariana's long black curls hung loosely around her face and she was wearing a government-issued gray sweatsuit. At first, she sat looking blankly down at the table. She poked at her food with a plastic fork and let her mother do most of the talking.

She perked up when I asked about home: Hicksville, New York. She and her mother had moved there from Honduras when she was 7. Her mother, Stephanie Valladares, had applied for asylum, married a neighbor from back home who was already living in the U.S., and had two more kids. Ariana took care of them after school. She was a freshman at Hicksville High, and being detained at the Dilley Immigration Processing Center meant that she was falling behind in her classes. She told me how much she missed her favorite sign language teacher, but most of all she missed her siblings.

I had previously met them in Hicksville: Gianna, a toddler who everyone calls Gigi, and Jacob, a kindergartener with wide brown eyes. I told Ariana that they missed her too. Jacob had shown me a security camera that their mom had installed in the kitchen so she could peek in on them from her job, sometimes saying “Hello” through the speaker. I told Ariana that Jacob tried talking to the camera, hoping his mom would answer.

Stephanie burst into tears. So did Ariana. After my visit, Ariana wrote me a letter.

“My younger siblings haven't been able to see their mom in more than a month,” she wrote. “They are very young and you need both of your parents when you are growing up.” Then, referring to Dilley, she added, “Since I got to this Center all you will feel is sadness and mostly depression.”

Dilley, run by private prison firm CoreCivic, is located some 72 miles south of San Antonio and nearly 2,000 miles away from Ariana's home. It is a sprawling collection of trailers and dormitories, almost the same color as the dusty landscape, surrounded by a tall fence. It first opened during the Obama administration to hold an influx of families crossing the border. Former President Joe Biden stopped holding families there in 2021, arguing America shouldn't be in the business of detaining children.

But quickly after returning to office, President Donald Trump resumed family detentions as part of his mass deportation campaign. Federal courts and overwhelming public outrage had put an end to Trump's first-term policy of separating children from parents when immigrant families were detained crossing the border. Trump officials said Dilley was a place where immigrant families would be detained together.

As the second Trump administration's crackdown both slowed border crossings to record lows and ramped up a blitz of immigration arrests all across the country, the population inside Dilley shifted. The administration began sending parents and children who had been living in the country long enough to lay down roots and to build networks of relatives, friends and supporters willing to speak up against their detention.

If the administration believed that putting children in Dilley wouldn't stir the same outcry as separating them from their parents, it was mistaken. The photo of 5-year-old Liam Conejo Ramos from Ecuador, who was detained with his father in Minneapolis while wearing a Spider-Man backpack and a blue bunny hat, went viral on social media and triggered widespread condemnation and a protest by the detainees.

Weeks before that, I had begun speaking to parents and children at Dilley, along with their relatives on the outside. I also spoke to people who worked inside the center or visited it regularly to give religious or legal services. I had asked Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials for permission to visit but got a range of responses. One spokesperson denied my request, another said he doubted I could get formal approval and suggested I could try showing up there as a visitor. So I did.

Since early December, I've spoken, in person and via phone and video calls, to more than two dozen detainees, half of them kids detained at Dilley — all of whose parents gave me their consent. I asked parents whether their children would be open to writing to me about their experiences. More than three dozen kids responded; some just drew pictures, others wrote in perfect cursive. Some letters were full of age-appropriate misspellings.

Among them was a letter from a 9-year-old Venezuelan girl, named Susej Fernández, who had been living in Houston when she and her mother were detained. “I have been 50 days in Dilley Immigration Processing Center,” she wrote. “Seen how people like me, immigrants are been treated changes my perspective about the U.S. My mom and I came to The U.S looking for a good and safe place to live.”

A 14-year-old Colombian girl, who signed her name Gaby M.M. and who a fellow detainee said had been living in Houston, wrote a letter about how the guards at Dilley “have bad manner of speaking to residents.” She wrote, “The workers treat the residents unhumanly, verbally and I don't want to imging how they would act if they where unsupervised.”

Nine-year-old Maria Antonia Guerra, from Colombia, drew a portrait of herself and her mother wearing their detainee ID badges. A note on the side said, “I am not happy, please get me out of here.”

Some of the kids I met spoke English as well as they did Spanish.

When I asked the kids to tell me about the things they missed most from their lives outside Dilley, they almost always talked about their teachers and friends at school. Then they'd get to things like missing a beloved dog, McDonald's Happy Meals, their favorite stuffed animal or a pair of new UGGs that had been waiting for them under the Christmas tree.

They told me they feared what might happen to them if they returned to their home countries and what might happen to them if they remained here. Thirteen-year-old Gustavo Santiago said he didn't want to go back to Tamaulipas, Mexico. “I have friends, school, and family here in the United States,” he said of his home in San Antonio, Texas. “To this day, I don't know what we did wrong to be detained.” He ended with a plea, “I feel like I'll never get out of here. I just ask that you don't forget about us.”

Around 3,500 detainees, more than half of them minors, have cycled through the center since it reopened, more than the population of the town of Dilley itself. Although a long-standing legal settlement generally limits the time children can be held in detention to 20 days, a data analysis by ProPublica found that about 300 kids sent to Dilley by the Trump administration were there for more than a month. The administration in legal filings has said the agreement from 1997 is outdated and should be terminated because there are new statutes, regulations and policies that ensure good conditions for immigrant minors in detention.

Habiba Soliman, 18, told me she had been detained for more than eight months with her mom and four siblings, ranging in age from 16 to 5-year-old twins, after her father was charged for an alleged antisemitic attack in June at a rally in Boulder, Colorado, supporting the Jewish hostages who were being held in Gaza. Their father, Mohamed Soliman, pleaded not guilty to federal and state charges. Authorities have said they are investigating whether his wife and her children provided support for the attack. They deny knowing anything about it and an arrest warrant reports that he told an officer he never talked to his wife or family about his plans.

Despite Trump's promise to go after violent criminals, the vast majority of adults detained at Dilley over the last year had no criminal record in the United States. Some of the parents I spoke to had overstayed visas. Many had filed applications for asylum, had married U.S. citizens or had been granted humanitarian parole and were detained when they voluntarily showed up for appointments at ICE offices. They said that it was unfair to arrest them, and that detaining their children was just plain cruel.

There were children in Dilley who were so distraught they cut themselves or talked about suicide, several mothers told me. Recently, two cases of measles were discovered in the center. Federal officials said they quarantined some immigrants, and attorneys said ICE cancelled in-person legal visits until Feb. 14 as a safety precaution.

The Department of Homeland Security, which oversees ICE, said in a statement that all detainees at Dilley are “being provided with proper medical care.” DHS did not respond to questions about individual detainees but said that all “are provided with 3 meals a day, clean water, clothing, bedding, showers, soap, and toiletries” and that “certified dieticians evaluate meals.” Detained parents are given the option for their families to be deported together, or they can have their children placed with another caregiver, the statement said.

CoreCivic said that Dilley, like its other facilities, is subject to multiple layers of oversight to ensure full compliance with policies and procedures, including any applicable detention standards.

Moms told me that their kids had lost their appetites after finding worms and mold on their food, had trouble sleeping on the facility's hard metal bunk beds in rooms shared by at least a dozen other people, and were constantly sick.

“The shock for my daughter was devastating,” Maria Alejandra Montoya from Colombia wrote in an email to me about her daughter Maria Antonia. “Watching her adapt is like watching her wings being clipped. Hearing other children fight over card games at the tables makes me feel like we are not mothers and children, but inmates.”

Alexander Perez, a 15-year-old from the Dominican Republic, told me about going to school at Dilley. He said classes included kids from mixed age groups, and each class allowed only 12 students and lasted for just one hour. Slots were assigned on a first-come-first-served basis. Children would line up, hoping to get in. The staff leading the class would distribute handouts and worksheets to those who made it inside.

Alexander Perez complained that the lessons were usually meant for kids who were younger than him, so he found them boring. But because there wasn't much else to do, he used to go whenever he could, until an instructor turned a social studies lesson into what felt like an interrogation about immigration policy.

“If we have recreational activities and classes designed to help us disconnect from what we're experiencing here, why the need to ask ourselves these questions?” he said during a video call with me. “I didn't think that was right.”

He, his mother and his 14-year-old brother, Jorge, said they had been detained while traveling from Los Angeles to Houston when the bus they were on was stopped by immigration agents who checked everyone's status. They'd been in Dilley for four months by the time we spoke. His mother, Teresa, told me she was in the process of appealing a judge's denial of her asylum petition, which might explain why it was a touchy subject for Alexander when it came up in class. He told me that after he gave up on attending classes at Dilley, he played basketball in the recreation area and watched a lot of Spanish soap operas on TV. Jorge, who celebrated his birthday in December at Dilley with a tiny cake made from vanilla commissary cookies, spent most of the day sleeping.

DHS said in its statement that “children have access to teachers, classrooms, and curriculum booklets for math, reading, and spelling.”

Boredom was a theme that ran through many of the letters from children at Dilley. “They told me I could only be here 21 days but I have already spent more than 60 days waking up eating the same repeated meals,” wrote a 12-year-old Venezuelan girl who signed her letter Ender, and who a fellow detainee said had settled with her mother in Austin, Texas. She wrote that when she felt sick and went to the doctor, “the only thing they tell you is to drink more water and the worst thing is that it seems like the water is what makes people sick here.”

Ariana expressed similar concerns in her letter. She wrote, “If you need medical attention the longest you have to wait is 3 hours, but to get any medicine, pill, anything it takes a while, there are various viruses people are always sick. Serious situations happen and the officers can't take them serious enough there are no consecuenses, they don't care.”

The lack of reliable medical care was perhaps the most serious concern parents and children spoke about in their interviews with me. The Texas-based nonprofit advocacy organization RAICES, which provides legal representation to many families at Dilley, said in a recent court declaration that its clients had raised concerns about insufficient medical care on at least 700 occasions since August 2025. The organization reported, “Children with medical complaints frequently experience delays, dismissals, or lack of follow-up.”

Kheilin Valero from Venezuela, who was being held with her 18-month-old, Amalia Arrieta, said shortly after they were detained following an ICE appointment on Dec. 11 in El Paso, Texas, the baby fell ill. For two weeks, she said, medical staff gave her ibuprofen and eventually antibiotics, but Amalia's breathing worsened to the point that she was hospitalized in San Antonio for 10 days. She was diagnosed with COVID-19 and RSV. “Because she went so many days without treatment, and because it's so cold here, she developed pneumonia and bronchitis,” Kheilin said. “She was malnourished, too, because she was vomiting everything.”

Gustavo Santiago, the 13-year-old boy who'd been living in Texas, said he has been sick several times since he and his mom were detained on Oct. 5 of last year at a Border Patrol checkpoint. His mom, Christian Hinojosa, said that when Gustavo had a fever, the medical staff told her he was old enough for his body to fight it off without medication, so she sat up with him all night, draping him in cold compresses. She had to take him to the infirmary for a skin rash that she believed was caused by poor water quality at the center. She said he has also experienced stomach pain and nausea, which she blamed on unsanitary food preparation.

Among logs we obtained of calls made to 911 and law enforcement about the facility since it began accepting families again last spring, I found pleas for help for toddlers having trouble breathing, a pregnant woman who passed out and an elementary-school-aged girl having seizures. Local authorities were also called in for three cases of alleged sexual assault between detainees.

DHS said in its statement, “No one is denied medical care.”

CoreCivic said that health and safety is a top priority for the company and that detainees at Dilley are provided with a continuum of health care services, including preventative care and mental health services. The company said its medical staff “meet the highest standards of care” and said the facility works closely with local hospitals for any specialized medical needs.

Ariana and her mother, Stephanie, were detained on Dec. 1, when they went for one of their regular check-ins at an ICE office in New York City's Federal Plaza, which are required as they wait for a decision on their asylum case. Stephanie had come to the U.S. with experience working as an accountant and, after securing her work permit, she had finally found a job at a local import business where she could put that experience to use. They had been regularly checking in with ICE for years without incident. But after mom and daughter showed up for their 8 a.m. ICE appointment, they were told they couldn't leave this time and were on a plane to Dilley by 6 that evening, without being given a chance to call their family. “Since the day my mom and I get detained in Manhattan NY, my life was instanly paused,” Ariana wrote in her letter from detention after our meeting. “All kids are being damage mentally, they witness how the've been treated.”

A 7-year-old Venezuelan girl named Diana Crespo was living in Portland, Oregon, when she and her parents, Darianny Gonzalez and Yohendry Crespo, were detained outside a hospital where they'd taken Diana for emergency care. The family had been granted humanitarian parole after entering the United States in 2024 and then applied for asylum when Trump revoked the parole program, saying that Biden had used it to allow immigrants to pour into the country at record levels. She said their active asylum case didn't stop the immigration agents who intercepted them outside the emergency room from detaining them.

Maria Antonia Guerra, the 9-year-old from Colombia, told me that the 10-day vacation to Disney World that she had planned with her mother and stepdad turned into more than 100 days at Dilley. She'd flown into Florida from Medellin, Colombia, where she lived with her grandmother, with a Cruella de Vil costume in her suitcase. Her mother, Maria Alejandra Montoya, was living in New York and had overstayed her visa, but had since married a U.S. citizen and was just waiting for her green card to be approved. Maria Antonia traveled regularly back and forth to the U.S. on a tourist visa, and Maria Alejandra had flown down to meet her at the airport. Immigration agents intercepted them and flew them to Texas. They both told me that it felt like a kidnapping.

“I am in a jail and I am sad and I have fainted 2 times here inside, when I arrived every night I cried and now I don't sleep well,” Maria Antonia, who wears thick glasses, wrote to me. “I felt that being here was my fault and I only wanted to be on vacation like a normal family.”

In January, shortly after my visit to Dilley, ICE released some 200 people all at once, without explanation. Among them were Ariana and her mom.

The releases came as such a surprise that Stephanie said another woman began screaming and refused to let go of her bunk, fearing she was about to be deported back to Ecuador. Stephanie was fitted with an ankle monitor, and she and Ariana were dropped off in Laredo, Texas, where they scrambled to buy a plane ticket to LaGuardia in New York.

On Jan. 22, two days after her release, I met Stephanie again, this time holding Gigi as she showed up for her first ICE check in at an office near her home. She had been so nervous that she got lost on the way to the appointment. She was given a series of instructions and shown videos that explained the purpose and cadence of her regular check-ins. She'd have one every month at the office, and every two months she would be visited at her home.

Jacob had initially refused to go to school because he was afraid his mother and sister wouldn't be there when he came home, but she'd finally gotten him to go by promising every morning that she's not leaving again.

Ariana went back to school a few days later. Her English teacher immediately hugged her and sobbed, “We really missed you.”

I called Ariana last Wednesday to check in on her. She was helping Jacob with his homework, but she took a break to give me an update. There are a lot of other immigrants at her school, but she had only told her close friends, who she sits with at lunch, about the reason for her prolonged absence. When other people asked, she just said, “I had to go to Texas for something.”

She says she's trying to put the ordeal behind her, but the toll is real.

Her mother lost her job because her boss is uncomfortable employing someone with an ankle monitor. And Ariana worries about her. She also worries about the people she met back at Dilley. Days after I asked DHS about several families mentioned in this story, five of them were released: Gustavo and his mom, Christian; Teresa and her sons, Alexander and Jorge; Kheilin and her baby, Amalia; Darianny and her daughter, Diana. Maria Antonia and her mom, Maria Alejandra, were returned to Colombia. Others are still detained. Ariana said, “I wish they got out because they shouldn't be there any longer.”

Before we hung up, Ariana said something that suggested her youthful optimism hadn't been entirely broken. She'd found that she'd gotten better at playing volleyball at Dilley and now plans to try out for her school team.

 Visions of Decline Are a Self-Fulfilling Prophecy

 Michael Singh

Shortly after U.S. special forces raided Caracas and captured the Venezuelan dictator Nicolás Maduro in early January, Stephen Miller, the White House deputy chief of staff, offered a blunt justification for the Trump administration's actions. “You can talk all you want about international niceties,” he said, “but we live in a world, in the real world… that is governed by strength, that is governed by force, that is governed by power.” Miller's comments painted the United States as a strong country, anxious about threats in a disordered world, acting aggressively and preemptively to ensure its own security.

This ethos increasingly appears to characterize President Donald Trump's broader foreign policy, which threatens or even employs force wherever and whenever the president, unconstrained by norms or alliances, so chooses. Moved by the news of protesters being killed in Iran, Trump threatened military strikes in the country. Seized by a desire to possess the Danish territory of Greenland, he brandished the possibility of tariffs and military force again, but this time made NATO allies the targets of his threats. On the surface, the United States under Trump seems the very picture of a confident and capricious hegemon, tapping its unrivaled power to deter and coerce.

But the president's second-term military adventures pose two questions whose answers belie that superficial image: Why these places, and why now? The U.S. strike on Iranian nuclear facilities in June was perhaps predictable, given Iran's progress toward a nuclear weapon, and Trump's hostility toward Tehran today is nothing new. But U.S. actions toward Venezuela and Greenland—and the administration's inconsistent explanations for them—have left many around the world alarmed and bewildered. Rather than aim his coercion at great-power peers, Trump has targeted weak adversaries and even allies. His motive for doing so lies neither in an overweening confidence nor in canny strategy. It comes instead from fear: of a loss of status on the world stage and of the decline of American power relative to that possessed by other states.

There are reasons to worry that the United States is falling behind in key measures of power. But many of the concerning trends remain reversible. With policies that enlarge and transform the U.S. military, tap into alliances to amplify U.S. power, and address Washington's budgetary woes, the United States can continue to be the world's most powerful and influential state. By continuing to expend American power in peripheral or unnecessary conflicts, however, the Trump administration will only accelerate the country's relative decline.

In his first term, Trump's leading foreign policy innovation was to focus more on strategic competition with China and security in the Indo-Pacific and less on what he regarded as pointless interventions in regions and countries without much bearing on U.S. security. It is difficult, however, to square the Trump administration's second-term interventions with that philosophy of disciplined prioritization. Some analysts have argued that there is no contradiction, portraying these military adventures as part of the larger contest between the United States and its peer adversaries, China and Russia. Yet this contention is undermined by the Trump administration's own National Defense Strategy, which characterizes the U.S. rivalry with China as limited and restricted to the Indo-Pacific—not as a new Cold War that is global in scope—and downplays Russia as a threat to an even greater extent.

Arguments that the interventions serve U.S. goals within a larger strategic competition are also belied by the choice of targets. Although Venezuela is economically dependent on China, the reverse is not true—China will not suffer significantly if cut off from Caracas. Besides, Trump has not even insisted that China be excluded from Venezuela's oil sector. And after the U.S. conducted strikes in Iran last June, Trump even stated explicitly that China could continue to purchase Iranian oil. As for Greenland, Trump's drive to possess the island appeared to promise no new military or economic benefits to the United States but did place the integrity of the NATO alliance at risk. Meanwhile, Arctic security experts have noted that a greater threat to U.S. national security lies in the Bering Strait, where Russian naval forces range near U.S. territory (Alaska) and conduct joint exercises with the Chinese navy, whereas the seas around Greenland are comparatively quiet. Russia, tellingly, applauded Washington's gambit.



Trump's characterization of the threats from China and Russia has been inconsistent, but his worries about American status and prestige date back decades. In 1987, he sponsored full-page advertisements in several major newspapers asserting that the world was “taking advantage” of the United States. “The world is laughing at America's politicians,” it read, “as we protect ships we don't own, carrying oil we don't need, destined for allies who won't help.” In 2023, Trump complained that the Biden administration was “begging” Venezuela for oil, even though U.S. domestic oil production at the time was at a historic high. In 2024, he characterized the United States as “a failing nation” and “a nation in decline” in a campaign speech, and he asserted in a presidential debate, “Throughout the entire world, we're no longer respected as a country. They don't respect our leadership, they don't respect the United States anymore. We're like a third-world nation.”

Although some might dismiss Trump's words as mere political rhetoric, he has been remarkably consistent in his public worries about U.S. prestige across a host of issues, and his top-down approach to policymaking gives even seemingly off-the-cuff comments real weight. During the postwar era, U.S. foreign policy has been built through collaboration among government agencies, which sent recommendations up the bureaucratic ladder before arriving on the president's desk for decision. Today, policy appears to begin with a presidential decision or utterance that the bureaucracy then seeks to transform into concrete action.

As the political scientist Jeffrey Taliaferro has argued, it is not unusual for great powers afraid of decline to engage in risky interventions in peripheral regions, motivated far more by worries about losing prestige or status than by any prospect of gain. The U.S. intervention in Korea in 1950, for instance, was arguably motivated in part by American concerns about a shifting global balance of power, following the first Soviet nuclear test and the triumph of communism in China. The United Kingdom's predatory efforts to cling to power and resources in Egypt and Iran—countries where it had exercised considerable influence—in the 1950s were born of similar fears. The British historian John Robert Seeley famously noted in 1890 that Britain had acquired its empire not intentionally but “in a fit of absence of mind.” Yet when faced with the prospect of losing pieces of that empire in the mid-twentieth century, London took risks to protect it that were either out of proportion to any foreseeable benefit or had no realistic chance of achieving that goal. Trump has been more explicit than most about his motives, describing ownership of Greenland as “psychologically important for success,” but his thinking in such terms is hardly uncommon.

Trump is far from alone in his worries about American power. Recent polls suggest that they are shared widely among Americans, with pessimism about the United States' prospects seeming even stronger among its youth. In a November 2025 survey conducted by YouGov and designed by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, for example, 54 percent of respondents agreed that “the United States is becoming less powerful in the world,” while 75 percent of respondents agreed that it was very or somewhat important “that America has power and influence around the globe.” These numbers, however, differ notably among age groups; whereas about 80 percent of respondents 45 and older believed it to be very or somewhat important “to [them] and [their] future that America has power and influence around the globe,” only around 70 percent of Millennial and Gen-Z respondents agreed.

Whether the United States is actually in decline, however, is another matter. In relative terms, the gap between American power and that wielded by other states has shrunk considerably. This is true both of partners, such as India and countries in Europe and much of East Asia, and of rivals, especially China—the closest thing the United States has had to a peer competitor since the end of the Cold War. But this phenomenon is less evidence of American decline than the result of the long peace over which Washington has prevailed. Just as the Germanic tribes that eventually overthrew the western Roman Empire owed their success in large part to the Pax Romana and to their service in Rome's wars, the United States' friends and rivals thrived amid the order and progress that Washington made possible.



Despite this shrinking gap, American power, in absolute terms, is by many measures as healthy as ever. The U.S. economy is almost as large as those of the world's next four largest combined. The United States' population growth rate, although slowing, far exceeds China's and Russia's, which are both negative. The United States holds a commanding lead in investment in artificial intelligence and other emerging technologies and remains the world's leading innovator in technology despite China's ability to churn out vast quantities of research papers and graduates in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) fields. The U.S. technological edge has translated directly to foreign policy gains, including in the Middle East, where leading states such as Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates are increasingly willing to curtail tech cooperation with China in order to cooperate more with the United States.

Yet not all is well. Despite highlight-reel successes against the less capable foes Iran and Venezuela, the U.S. military is not as dominant as it used to be. The United States has fewer navy ships and fewer active-duty soldiers than China does, and roughly the same number of fighter jets. Washington possesses an aging nuclear arsenal that Russia already surpasses and that China is rapidly working to catch up to: estimates from the Pentagon suggest that Beijing will have 1,000 operational nuclear warheads by 2030—more than three times as many as it had in 2020. Although the U.S. defense budget has drifted upward in recent years, it reached nearly $1 trillion in 2026 only because Congress added to the budget requested by the White House. And in any event, in real terms the budget reached that level 20 years ago, before dropping slightly in the early 2010s, according to data collected by the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments—implying net zero growth over the past two decades. That the United States would struggle to prevail in a war with China—or prevent China from taking Taiwan—has been well established in numerous war games and has been acknowledged by senior U.S. defense officials. As Elbridge Colby, the current undersecretary of defense for policy, wrote in 2019, “The era of untrammeled U.S. military superiority is over. If the United States delays implementing a new approach, it risks losing a war to China or Russia—or backing down in a crisis because it fears it would—with devastating consequences for America's interests.”

Other warning signs abound. The Government Accountability Office, which audits federal programs and spending, indicated in a 2024 report that U.S. debt will reach 200 percent of GDP by 2050 in the absence of changes in budget policy. Government spending on debt service roughly equals that on defense. Defense spending declined by a factor of three as a percentage of GDP between 1962 and 2022, whereas entitlement spending in that same period grew by a factor of three, according to the Cato Institute. The United States' lead in advanced technologies such as AI is threatened by, among other things, its decision to export advanced chips to China, which appears to place short-term trade gains over long-term national security interests.

Perhaps most concerning, the United States is likely experiencing an erosion in “power conversion,” or the ability to transform latent power into usable strength. The decline of American manufacturing, especially in dual-use sectors, which produce goods that may serve both military and civilian purposes, such as shipbuilding, is long-standing and well known. So, too, are the struggles of successive administrations to integrate advanced technologies into military platforms and to move away from an outdated focus on large, vulnerable platforms and toward cheaper, more expendable ones that would be of greater utility in a war with an advanced foe.

There is also reason to believe that this power-conversion problem has only increased during Trump's second term. Corruption and cronyism, which risk diverting government resources and energies from national interests to parochial or pecuniary ones, appear rife. The U.S. government has stripped itself of veteran expertise across multiple national security agencies and reduced the circle of policymakers to a small handful around the president. There is something to be said for streamlining bloated bureaucracies and speeding up decision-making. Yet doing so puts at risk two key advantages of American policymaking that have long protected American power: a wealth of specialized knowledge to bring to bear on devising and executing policies and a system that encourages participants to freely voice their opinions and challenge one another. The outcome Trump appears close to achieving on Greenland—slightly firmer guarantees from Denmark and Greenland regarding preferential American military and economic access to the island—could likely have been reached through quiet, expert-led diplomacy among allies. Instead, Trump leaned on his own instinctive and increasingly predictable coercive negotiating tactics, and his gains came at the cost of lost trust and credibility with NATO allies.

There is a path, albeit a narrow one, to reverse this decline of American military strength. Increasing the U.S. defense budget to $1.5 trillion in 2027, as the Trump administration has proposed, would be a good step. But it is not enough by itself. Defense spending must be tied not only to sound defense strategy but also to a capable bureaucracy and alliance system that can use the deterrent effect of American hard power to advance real-world diplomatic and military outcomes. Likewise, large increases in defense spending will be sustainable only if the United States confronts the even more rapid increases in what it spends on debt service and entitlements. Because it cannot simply spend its way to security, the United States will inevitably need to boost, rather than curtail, its cooperation with partners to address the full array of threats posed by today's world and fend off advances by revisionist and rogue states. Going it alone is too expensive and as sure a recipe for accelerating decline as any.

The risk of policymakers becoming preoccupied with fears of decline—even fears partially grounded in fact—is that such a scenario becomes self-fulfilling. The first year of the second Trump administration has provided a preview of this dangerous direction. If U.S. policymakers were truly confident in American power, for example, they would not fight European allies over Greenland but would instead task them with patrolling the waters around the island to free up scarce U.S. military resources for the higher-priority Indo-Pacific theater. By trying to assert dominance over its allies, however, Washington has alienated the very partners whose support augments American strength.

As Kori Schake has noted in Foreign Affairs, the United States has been able to amass power and influence in the postwar era in large part because it expended a portion of its wealth and power to build a cooperative international order. That cooperation has been increasingly taken for granted and even resented by U.S. policymakers because its costs are transparent while its benefits—such as the primacy of the U.S. dollar and the preeminence of the U.S. arms industry—are less visible. But hidden benefits are no less real, and the maintenance of the international order has not been a one-way street. The cooperation of allies and partners has helped stave off the decline of American power that so worries policymakers and has even helped it grow. Trump has been plenty willing to wield the power of his office. But wielding power judiciously, using it to build coalitions rather than lashing out unilaterally, is the true mark of a self-assured leader—and is the only way a superpower remains one.

 As the Battlefield Stabilizes, a Window for Negotiations Opens

 Volker Perthes

The war in Sudan is a battle for land and resources. Over nearly three years of conflict, the Sudanese Armed Forces—the country's regular army—and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces have traded territory at an unimaginable human cost. Since April 2023, more than 12 million people have been displaced within Sudan or sought refuge in neighboring countries. Half the population faces severe food shortages, and acute hunger afflicts several regions, including Darfur. Evidence of massacres has been covered up and bodies from street fighting in Khartoum are still buried under the rubble, making the death toll impossible to count; it is estimated to exceed 150,000.

Amid this brutality, more clearly defined battle lines have begun to emerge. Early in the war, the RSF had controlled most of the capital city, Khartoum, located on the Nile River in the center of the country, and most of Darfur in the west. In 2024, it also occupied most of El Gezira state, south of Khartoum. The SAF held on to the inhabited parts of the north and the east, and the SAF-affiliated government retreated from Khartoum to Port Sudan on the eastern Red Sea coast. The rest of the country remained embattled. The SAF recaptured El Gezira in January and Khartoum in March 2025, pushing the RSF west of the Nile River valley. This withdrawal from central Sudan enabled the RSF to concentrate its forces in Darfur and besiege El Fasher, the capital of Darfur and the last SAF stronghold in the west. In October, the RSF overran El Fasher. Thousands of civilians trapped in the city were massacred.

The RSF now controls the capitals of all five states in Darfur, cementing its rule across the western parts of the country, and the SAF has consolidated its control of the east and most of the central provinces along the Nile. Battles continue in the Kordofan region, located between the Nile River valley and Darfur, and in the southern Blue Nile state, which borders South Sudan and Ethiopia. From the start of the war, both the SAF under General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan and the RSF under General Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, known as Hemedti, have aimed to bring all of Sudan under their control. Both still claim that victory is possible, but the map suggests otherwise. Sudan, in effect, is now split in two.

The country's increasingly entrenched divide could pave the way for a new phase in the war. It might lead to a situation in which the frontlines are gradually frozen, as both the SAF and RSF realize that they will not be able to make significant territorial gains beyond what they control today. This could lead to a more permanent division of the country under two authorities, or to fragmentation on both sides. Or, if the regional and international players with the most influence over the warring parties apply enough pressure, the current split could be an opportunity to negotiate a cease-fire—and, in time, an end to this horrific war.

The war is often described as a conflict between two generals, the SAF's Burhan and the RSF's Hemedti. But more precisely, it is a conflict between two militaries—the regular army and a parallel force—that are each backed by national and regional constituencies and networks. The involvement of various tribal or ideological militias has, over time, turned what began as a purely military-to-military confrontation into a broader civil war.

The current conflict has roots in the war in Darfur that began in 2003, in which the Sudanese army launched a counterinsurgency campaign against non-Arab rebel groups with the help of local Arab militias, often collectively referred to as Janjaweed. The UN estimates that hundreds of thousands of people, primarily non-Arab Darfuri civilians, were killed. Large-scale war crimes allegedly committed by the Janjaweed are still under investigation by the International Criminal Court. Burhan and Hemedti know each other from that war, when both were on the side of the government fighting the rebel uprising. Burhan was a regional commander in the Sudanese army; Hemedti led a smaller militia that was one of many armed groups that supported the SAF in its fight against the rebels.

The Sudanese government under the longtime ruler Omar al-Bashir established the RSF in 2013 with Hemedti as its commander, drawing mostly from Arab militias to fill its ranks. Most RSF fighters today hail from Arab tribes in Darfur and Kordofan. And although the RSF was set up as part of Bashir's state security apparatus, Hemedti has run it like a family business—his older brother is its deputy commander, a younger brother its chief financial officer, and most of the core leadership comes from his own tribe.

Bashir was overthrown following months of popular protests in 2019. At first the military attempted to rule alone, but as protests continued, it had to accept a civilian-military arrangement. The government was led by a civilian prime minister, and an 11-member Transitional Sovereignty Council functioned as a collective head of state, with Burhan as its chair and Hemedti as his deputy. In October 2021, Burhan and Hemedti jointly staged a coup against the civilian government and assumed executive power. They fared poorly as leaders. Sudanese society resisted their rule, they lacked international support, and the economy was running aground. Eventually, Burhan and Hemedti began to reach out to civilian politicians and members of the government they had overthrown. By December 2022, they reached a preliminary agreement to return Sudan to civilian rule. In April 2023, after four months of negotiating the details in talks facilitated by the UN, the African Union, and the Intergovernmental Authority on Development, an East African regional organization, one key issue remained unresolved: how to integrate the RSF into the Sudanese army. Burhan and the SAF wanted this done as quickly and comprehensively as possible. Hemedti, however, did not want to lose control of his troops and, with it, his source of power and wealth.



The disagreement between the leaders of the SAF and RSF prevented a conclusion of these negotiations and brought the two militaries to war. Both have recruited rebel groups and various ideological, tribal, or criminal militias to their sides. The SAF, for instance, draws support from Islamist armed groups, such as the Al-Baraa bin Malik militia, and from former rebel groups that had signed a deal with the transitional government, the Juba Peace Agreement, in 2020, including the Minawi faction of the Sudan Liberation Army and the Justice and Equality Movement. The Al-Hilu wing of the Sudan People's Liberation Army-North (SPLM/N-AH), which is not a party to the Juba Agreement and has held on to substantial territory in the Nuba mountains in Kordofan, declined to take sides at first but entered an alliance with the RSF in 2025.

Ethnic divides and racism play a role in the conflict, most notably in the massacres committed by the predominantly Arab RSF against non-Arab peoples such as the Masalit and the Zaghawa. But center-periphery and ideological divides complicate the picture. There are Arab militias aligned with both the RSF and the SAF, and the same is true of non-Arab armed groups. Some militias are primarily opportunistic; several have switched sides when promised higher pay, more territorial control, or better security for their communities.

The SAF and the RSF both accuse each other of having started the war. Both had certainly geared up for it. And the military leaders on both sides undoubtedly bear responsibility for three years of violence, war crimes, and unspeakable human rights violations. RSF fighters have committed most of the on-the-ground killing, rape, and looting, while the SAF has used its air force (which the RSF lacks) to bomb markets and civilian infrastructure in towns and villages under RSF control or where the army suspected that RSF supporters were located. Both warring parties have used control over humanitarian aid as a weapon—the RSF by starving El Fasher in its military siege and the SAF by repeatedly placing bureaucratic obstacles in the way of the World Food Program, other UN agencies, and international aid organizations attempting to bring relief to people in areas under RSF control.

Most Sudanese who are not aligned with either the SAF or the RSF might see the SAF as the lesser of two evils. Sudan's people have repeatedly risen up against the armed forces during periods of military dictatorship, but the SAF has a clear chain of command and administrative experience that the RSF does not. Whenever the RSF has captured a city, it has committed mass atrocities, and waves of refugees have tried to escape its rule. When the SAF recaptured El Gezira state and Khartoum, its soldiers and allied militias also committed war crimes, such as executing captured RSF fighters and young men who, based on appearance, they suspected of supporting the RSF. Yet the residents of these areas did not flee in large numbers when the SAF arrived. Rather, many people who had previously fled returned home or began preparing to do so, obviously feeling safer under SAF rule than they did under the RSF.

What has made this war so intractable is that both sides claim to be the legitimate representatives of Sudan and both sides have foreign powers supporting their cause. Burhan's claim is the more widely accepted. In addition to his role as army chief, he has been the head of the Transitional Sovereignty Council since 2019, retaining the position even after his and Hemedti's coup. He has also maintained control over government ministries. The United Nations and most foreign countries deal with him as Sudan's de facto head of state. Most Sudanese regard him as such, too, even though a large part question the legitimacy of his position since the 2021 coup. The RSF's atrocities, including those in El Fasher, have no doubt helped Burhan and his government make the case that they represent and defend the state against a predatory militia.

Yet the RSF leadership and its limited number of civilian supporters also claim that the group is the legitimate representative of Sudan. They say that they are fighting against an unjust regime that is dominated by a small military, bureaucratic, and economic elite that originates from the Nile River valley and has exploited the peoples on Sudan's peripheries, whether Arab or African, since the country gained independence in 1956. Hemedti is certainly not a credible champion of justice, human rights, inclusive governance, or secularism. But he has managed to capitalize on a widespread sense of exclusion among large parts of the Sudanese population, as well as the resentment toward the Sudanese Islamic Movement, a variant of the Muslim Brotherhood that dominated politics under the Bashir regime and has made a comeback under Burhan, who has allowed the Islamists to rebuild and expand their influence in the army, intelligence agencies, judiciary, and administration in return for their support.

Neither the SAF nor the RSF would have been able to sustain this war and defend their political claims without external backing. Egypt, Sudan's neighbor to the north, has been the SAF's strongest supporter since the beginning of the war. Egypt's military leadership prefers a general at the helm of its southern neighbor, and Cairo has a strong interest in keeping Sudan on its side in its dispute with Ethiopia over the waters of the Nile. Since the fall of El Fasher, Cairo has increased its involvement. According to reporting in The New York Times and elsewhere, Egypt is now not only providing intelligence and material to the SAF but also, among other things, allowing drone operations against the RSF to launch from Egyptian territory. The SAF has also received arms from Iran, from Russia, and, increasingly, from Turkey. Saudi Arabia tried to position itself as a neutral mediator when the war started—together with the United States, it co-hosted negotiations between the SAF and the RSF in Jeddah in 2023—but Riyadh has gradually moved closer to the SAF side.

Saudi Arabia's growing support for the SAF is largely a response to the United Arab Emirates' support for the RSF, which Riyadh fears could bring about an RSF victory that would fragment and destabilize not only Sudan but the entire Red Sea region. The UAE has repeatedly denied supplying the RSF with weapons, but it undoubtedly supports the group politically and materially. It sees the RSF as a counterweight to Islamist influence in the SAF and its government. The UAE regards Islamist forces across the Arab world as a dangerous challenge to its own secular authoritarian model, and it does not want Sudan, a country at the center of Red Sea and East African geopolitics, to fall under the control of inimical forces.

The tragedy of El Fasher, by completing the stark division of SAF- and RSF-held territory, could end up creating the conditions for some kind of truce. The RSF has set up its own government in Nyala, the capital of South Darfur state, which it sees as its natural base. (No country, not even neighbors such as Chad, Ethiopia, Kenya, and South Sudan, which have remained neutral but lean toward the RSF, has recognized this government.) RSF authorities are now attempting, with some difficulty, to administer those areas of Darfur where Hemedti's troops have consolidated their control. RSF militants in Darfur are fighting on home turf and will be more motivated to hold on to it than they were in Khartoum. On the other side, Burhan and other top SAF generals are Sudanese nationalists who want to preserve the country's current borders and bring all its territory under the authority of one central government. But some of their Islamist allies whose main constituencies are in the north and along the Nile may prefer to give up Darfur and other peripheral areas if they cannot be controlled from Khartoum. Sudan's ruling elites in Khartoum made a similar choice before, in 2011, when they accepted a referendum that led to South Sudan's independence after decades of civil war and unsuccessful attempts to defeat the rebels in the south. Today, some of them may again choose to hold on to one part of Sudan for themselves rather than share power over all of it.

Given that both sides may now be reaching a point where further territorial gains are unlikely, both may conclude that a consolidation of their current positions is the best they can do at an acceptable cost. Both the SAF and RSF seek regional and international acceptance, and they know that participating in U.S.-led peace efforts would improve their reputations. This motive—and, presumably, a desire to deflect accusations of war crimes and genocide—is what likely drove the RSF to declare a “unilateral humanitarian cease-fire” after its capture of El Fasher, even as its offensive in the Kordofan states continued. Burhan and the SAF leadership have vowed publicly to continue the fight until the RSF is defeated or lays down its arms, but Burhan has quietly explored cease-fire options with Massad Boulos, a senior adviser to U.S. President Donald Trump. In October, too, both the SAF and the RSF sent officers to Washington for talks.

The two militaries, furthermore, have shown that they are willing to step back from fighting to serve practical goals, such as to keep oil and oil revenues flowing—even if they are not willing to exhibit such restraint to protect Sudan's people. In December, the RSF managed to drive the SAF out of Heglig, a site in West Kordofan that is home to Sudan's most important oil field and is a key position along the pipeline that connects South Sudan's oil fields to the export terminal in Port Sudan. Oil production in the Heglig field had already dropped to less than a third of what it was before the war started, but continued disruption of the pipeline would have dealt an enormous blow to South Sudan, whose economy depends on oil exports, and taken away an important source of income for the government in Port Sudan. South Sudan, wishing to avoid that outcome, brokered parallel understandings with Hemedti and Burhan whereby the RSF would withdraw from Heglig and allow South Sudanese troops, as a neutral force, to secure the oil field and the pipeline. Details of the arrangement—including whether the RSF would receive any remuneration for its withdrawal—have not been disclosed, but the RSF withdrew within days of capturing the field and South Sudanese forces have moved in.

Seizing this opportunity to reach a cease-fire agreement and, eventually, an end to the war will depend to a large extent on whether the United States and the SAF's and RSF's external backers can change the militaries' calculations. In September, the U.S.-led Quad, which also includes Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE—the regional players with the most influence on Hemedti and Burhan—agreed on a road map for peace in Sudan, starting with a three-month “humanitarian truce” and followed by a permanent cease-fire and a political process to establish a civilian-led government. The RSF has accepted the road map in principle and agreed to the humanitarian truce, but the SAF has so far refused to do so until the RSF withdraws from El Fasher and other cities and gives up its heavy arms. The SAF-affiliated government, furthermore, has objected to the UAE's participation in the Quad because of its support for the RSF.



A cease-fire may still be possible. An updated plan, which Boulos announced earlier this month at a fundraising event in Washington, aims to address some of the SAF's reservations by including provisions for the withdrawal of fighters from and the safe return of civilians to El Fasher and other sensitive areas. This will make the deal less appealing to the RSF, however, and getting both parties to agree will likely require substantial pressure. Foreign backers will need to withdraw their political and material support from the SAF and the RSF or make serious threats to do so. Being cut off from their supply of drones, for instance, would be a significant blow to both militaries' capabilities. Both sides are exporting gold to Egypt, Saudi Arabia, or the UAE; if all three countries stopped buying this gold, the warring parties would struggle to finance their war efforts. Additional coordinated sanctions by the United Kingdom, the United States, and the EU on military and militia leaders, their businesses, and anyone involved in the recruitment of mercenaries would also make the war less profitable.

International actors could offer positive incentives, too. Giving some RSF and SAF leaders personal exit options, including safe places to live, could make them more willing to end the war. Although the promise of humanitarian and reconstruction aid may not entice military leaders, it would interest civilian supporters of the SAF and the RSF. And credible plans for postwar economic engagement and investment from Gulf countries could undermine the political influence of Islamists who are inclined to reject any proposal from the Quad as undue external interference.

There is reason for the members of the Quad to push the warring armies into a truce. Trump wants his peacemaking efforts to yield a clear success, and all parties want to remain on his good side. Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE still have different long-term goals in Sudan, but they have all declared their commitment to the September road map and can all get behind its first phase, a humanitarian truce. The rising risk of a regional expansion of the conflict increases the urgency of reducing the violence in Sudan, too. South Sudan is on the verge of war itself as the war to the north strains the country's economy and deepens its political divides. The SAF is launching drones from Egypt, pro-SAF militias are training in Eritrea, and fighters allied with the RSF are staging their offensive in Blue Nile state from Ethiopian territory.

A truce is no guarantee of peace, but it is a necessary first step and could prevent a regionalization of the conflict. Sudan's people certainly need the fighting to end, and most observers agree that a majority would support an immediate cessation of hostilities regardless of where the lines of control fall. Yet although the participation of SAF and RSF leaders would be necessary to establish and stabilize a cease-fire, any peace process that follows would need to be led by civilian actors, not military ones, to be successful. If the cease-fire simply led to a division of the country between SAF- and RSF-held territory, it would only lead to further fragmentation. The alliance between the RSF and the SPLM/N-AH is unlikely to last; former rebel groups from Darfur that are now supporting the SAF against a common enemy would likely break with the SAF and the Islamists; and separatism could emerge in the east. Avoiding this outcome requires reunifying Sudan, a task that must fall to the country's civilian political leaders and its still vibrant civil society. After nearly three years of war, their work will not be easy. But a truce would give civilian forces more space to act.

            • Nine people have been killed and dozens wounded after a shooting at a school and home in northeast British Columbia, Canada on Tuesday afternoon.
    


            •  Six of the victims were found dead at Tumbler Ridge Secondary School, making it Canada's deadliest school shooting in decades. A seventh person died en route to hospital, while the bodies of two people were found at a home in the town, which has just 2,400 people.
    


            • The alleged shooter was also found dead at the school with a self-inflicted injury. Police have told CNN they are currently unable to confirm the suspect's identity.
    


            • Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney has told people in Tumbler Ridge “the nation mourns with you.” Mass shootings are rare in Canada, a country with much stricter gun laws than the US.
    


            The Peace River South School District has set up support services following the “tragic and deeply traumatic” mass shooting at Tumbler Ridge Secondary School.
    


            A support space for the school community has been established at Tumbler Ridge Community Centre, where mental health professionals will be providing support over the next few days.
    


                    “We recognize that the trauma and impact of this loss are immeasurable. There is no timeline for how each of us will process this grief and immense loss, both individually and as a community,” Christy Fennell, superintendent of the school district said in a letter to families.
                





            “While words often feel inadequate in the face of such loss, coming together can help reduce isolation and remind us that we are not alone,” she added.
    


            Canada's opposition leader Pierre Poilievre said he was devastated by the “appalling shooting” in Tumbler Ridge as he headed into a caucus meeting in Ottawa earlier this morning.
    


            “The fact that this took place at a secondary school, it makes it even more tragic,” Poilievre told reporters at Parliament Hill earlier today.
    


                    “As a father, I can't even imagine the phone calls that parents might have received. I can't imagine the heartache and hell that they're living through at this moment,” he added. 
                





            The conservative leader urged Canadians to unite to support the families and community, and said he would speak to Prime Minister Mark Carney later to offer support and work together in the wake of the tragedy.
    


            “I encourage all Canadians to pray for the community and pray for the family as we go forward and take the necessary steps to support them,” he added.
    


            Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney has cleared much of his schedule for Wednesday following news of the school shooting in Tumbler Ridge, British Columbia.
    


            Early Wednesday morning, the prime minister's office announced that his previously-announced schedule was “suspended” due to the shooting.
    


            Carney was due to travel to Halifax, Nova Scotia today to “announce new measures to strengthen Canada's security” before taking a tour of an affordable housing construction site. The prime minister also had a scheduled flight on Wednesday evening from Halifax to Munich for a major international security conference. Both trips were suspended today.
    


            Carney's new schedule retained his caucus meeting with members of his party in Parliament this morning, as well as a statement in the House of Commons this afternoon. This morning, the prime minister held back tears as he told reporters in Ottawa that “the nation mourns with” Tumbler Ridge.
    


            Although some local news outlets have reported the name of the suspect, Canadian police have told CNN they are currently unable to publicly confirm the identity of the suspect in yesterday's mass shooting in Tumbler Ridge.
    


                    “We are unable to confirm identity publicly at this time,” Staff Sergeant Kris Clark, a senior media relations officer for the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, told CNN on Wednesday.
                





            Updates will be provided as more information becomes available, she added.
    


            Police previously said they know the identity of the suspect but did not give further details, and declined to say if they were a child.
    


            Nathalie Provost, a Canadian MP who survived the 1989 École Polytechnique massacre in Montreal, has responded to yesterday's school shooting by highlighting the lasting trauma such incidents leave behind.
    


                    “I reflect with profound gravity on the suffering, sorrow, and trauma that such events leave behind – for the victims, their loved ones, and the entire community,” Provost posted on social media early Wednesday.
                





            In 1989, a gunman murdered 14 women in Montreal in a shocking incident that prompted a national reckoning about violence against women and led to tighter gun laws. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said last year that Provost “knows that guns designed to kill people don't belong on our streets.”
    


                    “This tragedy brutally shatters the sense of safety that should surround places of learning and growth, and marks a loss of innocence for many young people,” Provost said.
                





            Meanwhile, Manitoba Premier Wab Kinew said that schools “should always be places of safety and care.”
    


            “Manitoba stands with our friends and relatives in British Columbia as they grieve this heartbreaking loss,” he posted on X.
    


            Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney has told people in Tumbler Ridge “the nation mourns with you,” as Canadians wake up after a “difficult day” that saw its worst school shooting in decades.
    


                    “This morning, parents, grandparents, sisters, brothers in Tumbler Ridge will wake up without someone they love. The nation mourns with you. Canada stands by you,” Carney said at Parliament Hill in Ottawa early today, while holding back tears.
                





            Carney thanked the world leaders who have sent Canada messages of support and compassion, as well as the “first responders, the teachers, the staff, the residents, for everything they've done in this terrible situation.”
    


            He added that he was sending Minister of Public Safety Gary Anandasangaree to Tumbler Ridge.
    


            King Charles III, who is Canada's head of state, said he and his wife Queen Camilla were “profoundly shocked and saddened” to learn of yesterday's deadly attack at Tumbler Ridge Secondary School in British Columbia.
    


            “We can only express our deepest possible sympathy to the families who are grieving the unimaginable loss of their loved ones and those still awaiting news from hospital,” the King wrote in a statement published on the Royal Family's official X account.



            The monarch described Tumbler Ridge as a community where “every child's name will be known and every family will be a neighbour.” He expressed sorrow for those affected by what he described as a “senseless act of brutal violence.”
    


            King Charles thanked police officers, healthcare staff and first responders for their efforts.
    


            “In sending our most heartfelt condolences, my wife and I stand in solidarity with the people of Tumbler Ridge and all Canadians as they seek understanding, healing and strength,” he added.
    


            The Prince and Princess of Wales echoed King Charles' sentiment in a post on the Kensington Royal X account, saying, “We stand with all Canadians.”
    


            It has just turned 7.45 a.m. in Tumbler Ridge, British Columbia, where at least nine people were killed and dozens were injured in two shootings yesterday, including one at a secondary school.
    


            Police said yesterday that two people were found dead in a residence, and another six people were found dead inside Tumbler Ridge Secondary School, with one more dying while being transported to hospital.
    


            Around 27 people were also found injured, two of whom have “serious or life‑threatening injuries,” according to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP).
    


            At a news conference yesterday, RCMP Superintendent Ken Floyd said that police “are not in a place now to be able to understand why and what may have motivated this tragedy.”
    


            When asked about the shooter, Floyd said that authorities were “still trying to determine a lot about the shooter at this stage,” adding that police believed that they had identified the suspect but declined to share any more details.
    


            Police are also “working towards” determining how many of the victims were children, he told reporters, as well as “following all leads” to determine any connections between the shooter and the victims.
    


                    “I think we will struggle to determine the ‘why,' but we're gonna try and do our best to determine what transpired that day and what led up to this tragic event,” he said.
                





            We can hear now from a councillor in Tumbler Ridge, the town where Tuesday's deadly school shooting took place. He has commended the resilience of his community while asking for as much assistance as possible.
    


                    “I really appreciate the outpouring of support that we've received from a national level, international level,” Chris Norbury told CNN affiliate CBC News. “Please continue to send any support you can because as much as I believe in Tumbler Ridge – I know we will get through this – we will definitely need all the support we can get.”
                





            Norbury, whose wife is a teacher and was among those held in lockdown at the school yesterday, said he personally knew many of the children impacted.
    


            Officers did not name any of the victims on Tuesday night and would not say how many of the dead were children.
    


                    “I know these children. I've seen them grow up. I've interacted with them,” Norbury said. “Knowing that I can't see them anymore, that we won't see them anymore, that their family has to live with this incredible loss … Just the fear of something happening to my family is almost unbearable.”
                





            Norbury added that despite the challenges facing Tumbler Ridge, he knows it is a “strong” and “resilient” community.
    


            Jarbas Noronha, a teacher at Tumbler Ridge Secondary, shared a Facebook update to let his relatives know he was safe following yesterday's deadly shooting.
    


            “I never thought I'd use Facebook to say I'm okay,” Noronha wrote in Portuguese.
    


            The educator expressed disbelief at what he and his school community had endured, saying no young person should have this experience.
    


            “I don't wish on any school age child to have to go through what my students went through today,” he added. “Our society is sick.”
    


            Tuesday's deadly attack in Canada is the worst school shooting for decades.
    


            The last school shooting of this scale in the country was in 1989, when a gunman murdered 14 women at École Polytechnique in Montreal.
    


            Mass shootings are rare in Canada, but what other incidents have rocked the country in recent years?
    


            In December 2022, five people were killed in a shooting at a condominium in a Toronto suburb. A male gunman was also shot by an officer during a confrontation and died, police said.
    


            In 2020, a gunman killed 22 people during a shooting rampage in Nova Scotia, sparking a 12-hour manhunt. In the wake of the shootings, then-Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said his administration would strengthen gun laws.
    


            In 2017, six people were killed in a shooting at a mosque in Quebec City in what was described at the time as a coordinated attack. Witnesses said at least two gunmen fired indiscriminately into a crowd of worshipers.
    


            In 2016, four people were killed after gunfire erupted at a school in a small town in Canada's northern province of Saskatchewan.
    


            Some other deadly incidents have not been related to firearms.
    


            Last April, a man drove his car into a crowd at a Filipino street festival in Vancouver, killing at least 11 people. At the time, police called it “the darkest day” in the city's history, with those killed between the ages of five and 65.
    


            Police received a report at 1.20 p.m. local time (10.20 a.m. ET) Tuesday of an active school shooter at the Tumbler Ridge Secondary School. Within minutes, officers were on the scene.
    


            At around 1.30 p.m., alarms began to sound in the school, announcing a lockdown and ordering that classroom doors be closed. A student said he and his classmates used tables to barricade themselves in.
    


            The Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) soon issued a “shelter in place” warning, telling Tumbler Ridge residents to lock their doors and stay inside until further instruction. The RCMP said a suspect had been found dead, but that its officers were working to determine whether a second suspect was involved.
    


            As well as the suspect, police later said that at least nine people were confirmed dead. Six were found dead when police arrived at the school, and another person died en route to hospital. The alleged shooter is believed to have killed two more people, whose bodies were discovered at a home in the township.
    


            At 5.45 p.m., police called off the emergency alert, saying they did not believe there were any outstanding suspects “or ongoing threat to the public.” Police said the alleged shooter was found “deceased with what appears to be a self-inflicted injury.” Around 25 others were wounded, they said.
    


            Later, at a press conference, Superintendent Ken Floyd, the North District Commander of the British Columbia RCMP said the force was not yet able to say “what may have motivated this strategy.”
    


            Tumbler Ridge Secondary School, the site of Canada's deadliest school shooting in decades, will be closed for the rest of the week, according to the school district.



            The school has 160 students from Grades 7 to 12 (typically aged 12-18). This small size has led to a “tremendous sense of community, as we tend to create strong and enduring relationships among staff and students,” its website says.



            The school has a fish farm and offers various extracurricular activities including athletics and a student voice initiative. It is located in the foothills of the Rocky Mountains, according to its website.
    


            One of the school district's most recently uploaded newsletters is a guide to risk assessments for threats of student violence, which outlines the behaviors that warrant such an assessment to be initiated.
    


            A Tumbler Ridge-based journalist who attended the scene after receiving word of the incident described the worry and shock that has enveloped the town following the school shooting yesterday.
    


            Speaking to Gloria Macarenko on Canada's CBC News, Trent Ernst said residents alerted him to reports of an active shooter via Facebook. He discovered roads were blocked once he neared the address.
    


            The reporter said people in the area were advised to take shelter. “My wife works at the district office and they were locked down,” Ernst said, adding that his eldest daughter, who works at a daycare centre beside the school where the shooting took place, remained on lockdown for an extended time.
    


            Ernst said unsubstantiated reports have spread quickly, causing panic. “People are definitely worried,” he added. “There's a lot of worried parents right now.”
    


            Addressing the devastation felt throughout his community, he described an otherwise peaceful town unfamiliar with tragedy.
    


            “There's that sense of quietness, safety. These things are things that happen elsewhere, they don't happen here,” Ernst said, becoming emotional as he added, “And that's been shattered.”
    


            Canada has much stricter gun laws than the United States, and school shootings of this scale are almost unheard of.
    


            In 2023, 38% of homicides in Canada involved a firearm, while 76% of homicides in the US were firearm-related, according to an analysis by Canada's national statistics body using police-reported data from the Uniform Crime Reporting programs in both countries.
    


            Canadian law requires citizens to undergo robust background checks before obtaining a gun license. Gun laws were expanded in 2022.
    


            In Canada, there are an estimated 35 guns per 100 residents compared to 121 firearms for every 100 residents in the US, according to a 2018 Small Arms Research project report.
    


            In British Columbia, where the shooting occurred, there are 368,433 firearms licences issued, according to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police's 2024 Firearms Report. This is higher than most other provinces or territories.
    


            The alarm sounded soon after Darian Quist got to his class at Tumbler Ridge Secondary School early yesterday afternoon.
    


            When he realized it wasn't a drill, Quist, a Grade 12 student, and his classmates “got tables and barricaded the doors,” he told CBC Radio West.
    


            Quist and his classmates waited in the barricaded building for about two hours, he said. Some began to share “disturbing” photos of “what was actually happening” elsewhere in the school, “showing blood and things like that.”
    


            Police eventually arrived to escort the students out of the building.
    


            Waiting outside in the parking lot was Shelley Quist, his mother. Earlier, one of her coworkers at a nearby laboratory had asked “if I knew what was happening at the high school.”
    


            As reports trickled in, she began to realize what was unfolding. “It's one of those things where you just never think this is going to happen.” she added.
    


            Quist said she felt “panic” until she could see her son among the students safely escorted from the building.
    


            The Vancouver Canucks, the ice hockey team of British Columbia's largest city, has offered its “heartfelt condolences” to the loved ones of those affected by yesterday's shootings in Tumbler Ridge.
    


                    “While there are no words that can ease the pain or help fully process such a profound loss, please know that our thoughts and prayers are with you during this time of unimaginable grief and sorrow,” the team wrote in a post on X yesterday.
                





            The Canucks also sent “love, strength, and support to those who were injured or deeply affected by this heartbreaking tragedy.”
    


            “Our organization stands with you, as a community, as neighbours, and as friends and family, united in care and compassion,” the team said.
    


            At least nine people were killed and dozens more injured in two shootings in a remote mountain town in Canada yesterday afternoon.
    


            If you're just joining us, here's what we know about the fatal attacks so far:
    


            Canada's Prime Minister Mark Carney has said that he is devastated by the “horrific shootings” that took place in Tumbler Ridge, northeast British Columbia yesterday.
    


            Carney offered his “prayers and deepest condolences” to the loved ones of the victims, who he said were lost to “horrific acts of violence.”
    


                    “I join Canadians in grieving with those whose lives have been changed irreversibly today, and in gratitude for the courage and selflessness of the first responders who risked their lives to protect their fellow citizens,” he said.
                





            “Our ability to come together in crisis is the best of our country — our empathy, our unity, and our compassion for each other,” Carney continued, adding that the Canadian government “stands with all British Columbians as they confront this horrible tragedy.”

Live Updates


            • Detained person released: Authorities have released a person detained for questioning in Rio Rico, about 60 miles south of Tucson, CNN affiliate KNXV reported. The man, identified only as Carlos, told The New York Times, “I hope they get the suspect, because I'm not it.”
    


• New letter: TMZ reported it received a “bizarre letter” via email this morning from someone purporting to know who Guthrie's kidnapper is and demanding a single Bitcoin in exchange for the information. The email was handed over to the FBI, the media outlet said.
    


            • Surveillance video: The FBI yesterday released doorbell camera footage from outside Nancy Guthrie's front door taken the morning she disappeared on February 1, showing a masked, armed person. Separately, FBI Director Kash Patel said the agency is looking at “persons of interest” in the case, in which authorities say the 84-year-old was taken against her will from her Arizona home.
    


            A man in Rio Rico, Arizona, who says he was detained yesterday for questioning in the investigation of Nancy's Guthrie disappearance spoke to reporters outside his home again today.
    


            Asked what he wants following the interrogation, the man who identified himself as Carlos responded, “To clear my name. That's all I want.”
    


            Carlos said his mother-in-law was told by an investigator he was stopped Tuesday as a result of an anonymous tip following yesterday's release of Nest camera video from Nancy Guthrie's home.
    


            “They said that my eyes and my eyelashes looked the same,” he said.
    


            Carlos said he was shocked when the investigators told him why they wanted to question him regarding his recent whereabouts.
    


            “It's about a kidnapping,” Carlos said an FBI agent told him, to which he said he responded, “What the f**k? I didn't kidnap no one.”
    


            Carlos said after questioning him and searching his home and vehicle, investigators gave no indication they planned to return. He said he was questioned from about 4 p.m. to midnight, as he previously told CNN affiliate KXNV.



            The Pima County Sheriff's Department and FBI have declined to comment on Carlos' account or confirm he is the man who the sheriff's department said was detained for questioning yesterday.
    


            There are no news conferences planned regarding the search for Nancy Guthrie, the Pima County Sheriff's Department said today, marking nearly a week since authorities have briefed the media.
    


            Guthrie disappeared 11 days ago.
    


            Authorities' last briefing was February 5. The sheriff's office said it will call a news conference “should a significant development occur.”
    


            TMZ is reporting it received a “bizarre letter” via email earlier this morning from someone purporting to know who Nancy Guthrie's kidnapper is and demanding a single Bitcoin in exchange for that information.
    


            TMZ, along with CNN affiliates KOLD and KGUN, also received the initial ransom notes for Nancy Guthrie.
    


            “They are not saying they are the kidnappers. They are saying they know who the kidnapper is and will give that information up for one Bitcoin,” TMZ founder Harvey Levin told Fox News this morning.
    


            “They said they want one Bitcoin sent to a Bitcoin address that we have confirmed is active, a real address. And as they put it, time is ‘more than relevant,'” Levin added.
    


            “There is a $50,000 reward for information leading to the kidnappers or for the recovery of Nancy Guthrie. You could do that by calling that number and providing the information and qualifying for the reward,” CNN's chief law enforcement and intelligence analyst John Miller said. “Coming at this sideways, and using the anonymity of an anonymous email and the anonymity of ‘pay me and then I'll tell you,' leaves no guarantee.”
    


            A single Bitcoin is currently worth around $66,000.
    


            TMZ says it has handed the new email note over to the FBI.
    


            When asked by CNN about the new note, the FBI said, “Outside of our previously issued statements, we have no updates to share at this time.”
    


TMZ reports it received the note just before 8 a.m. ET, and the sender claims to have unsuccessfully tried to reach Savannah Guthrie's brother and sister via email and text.
    


            CNN has not been able to independently verify the existence or authenticity of the note and has reached out to the Pima County Sheriff's Department for comment.
    


            A makeshift tribute outside of Nancy Guthrie's home shows support for the family as the investigation into her abduction enters its 11th day.
    


            A CNN crew at the scene this morning saw a man leaving pink flowers next to the candles and signs reading ‘Please pray” and “Your neighbors stand with you.” The makeshift display has grown by a few items since a couple days ago.
    


            Investigators have still not been able to locate the mother of “Today” host Savannah Guthrie, a law enforcement source told CNN.
    


            Authorities have encouraged anyone with information or tips to contact the FBI at 1-800-CALL-FBI, 88-CRIME, 520-351-4900, or tips.fbi.gov.
    


            While releasing images and videos, like the ones of the masked person outside of Nancy Guthrie's home, can alert the suspect in the case, the payoff is putting those images in front of more people, according to CNN senior law enforcement analyst Charles Ramsey.
    


                    “When you get to a point where you just don't know who they are, you don't have any leads, that you believe at the time, will lead you directly to that person – you're going to release it to the public,” said the former chief of police for Washington, DC. “When you crowdsource something like that, it means an awful lot.”
                





            After Tuesday's whirlwind of activity in the investigation of Nancy Guthrie's disappearance, the scene is quiet this morning outside the home of the man who was briefly detained for questioning by investigators yesterday.
    


            On a serene street in Rio Rico, Arizona, the wrought iron gates were closed to the driveway of the house occupied by a man who identified himself to reporters as Carlos. He told CNN affiliate KNXV he was questioned about his whereabouts for four hours Tuesday and then released.
    


            No law enforcement vehicles were seen in the neighborhood this morning. A delivery van with a name matching the company Carlos said he works for was parked along the street next to the home.
    


            Carlos told reporters yesterday he may have delivered something to Nancy Guthrie's home at some point but did not know who she is and had no involvement in her disappearance.
    


            Investigators acknowledged detaining a “subject” for questioning yesterday but have not commented on the account given by Carlos.
    


            Obtaining video footage of a masked man outside Nancy Guthrie's home, a major breakthrough in the case, largely came down to Google's technical expertise, a person familiar with the investigation told CNN.
    


            The FBI released the images within hours of obtaining them, an official said on X. However, the process was so technically complex that investigators were unsure if it would be successful, the source said.
    


            Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos initially said there was “no video available” because Guthrie “had no subscription” to Google's video recording service, which keeps videos from Nest cameras accessible in Google's cloud.
    


            Yesterday, FBI Director Kash Patel wrote on social media that authorities, “working closely with our private sector partners,” recovered some video “from residual data located in backend systems” in the Guthrie case.
    


            Read more about how the video was recovered.
    


            FBI agents are looking at more than one individual as a “person of interest” in the disappearance of Nancy Guthrie, the bureau's director, Kash Patel, told Fox News last night.
    


                    “We are looking at people who, as we say, are persons of interest,” Patel said.
                





            Patel did not elaborate on who might be under suspicion, but said authorities were undergoing a process to eliminate anyone who may not actually be involved.
    


            Patel said the FBI's outreach to the private sector has shown “there might be persons of interest in and around the area related to this event.”
    


            The FBI's first priority is finding Guthrie, Patel said, and “right behind that is to find anyone and any others involved in this kidnapping case to make sure they're brought to justice.”

            There have been an number of developments since the FBI yesterday released doorbell camera footage from outside Nancy Guthrie's front door, showing a masked, armed person.
    


            Here's what's new this morning:
    


CNN's Helen Regan and Jessie Yeung contributed to this reporting.



            A man, who identified himself to the The New York Times only as Carlos, says he was released without charges after being detained for questioning in the Nancy Guthrie investigation and told reporters he was shocked at being connected to the case.
    


            “I hope they get the suspect, because I'm not it. They better do their job and find the suspect that did it so they can clear my name, and I'm done,” Carlos told reporters as he returned home, according to a video from New York Times reporter Nicholas Bogel-Burroughs. “Look at what I'm putting my family through. Not just them, even my parents in Tucson,” he adds, gesturing to the home behind him.
    


            The man told CNN affiliate KNXV that he was held in custody from around 4 p.m. to after midnight, and was asked questions “like where I was, what hours,” before being told, “I'm free to go.”
    


            Tuesday night, the Pima County Sheriff's Department said a man had been detained for questioning and they were executing a search warrant at a location in Rio Rico, Arizona. Hours later, the sheriff's department said the search was completed but did not provide an update on the person detained for questioning.
    


            The man who was questioned has not been identified by authorities. The FBI referred questions about him to the Pima County Sheriff's Department, which CNN has contacted for comment.
    


            When asked how he felt after investigators told him why he'd been detained as part of the Guthrie investigation, Carlos answers: “What the f**k am I doing here? I didn't do anything. To be honest, I'm innocent.”
    


            Carlos told KNXV that as a delivery driver, he might have delivered a package to Guthrie's home, but he didn't know her.
    


            Asked by a reporter if he had ever heard Nancy Guthrie's name before, he responded: “Never until today.”
    


            The abduction of Nancy Guthrie has brought national attention to the kidnapping of older Americans, but FBI statistics show such cases are rare, especially for adults over 50.
    


            In 2025, there were more than 49,000 cases of abductions and kidnappings in the United States, according to the FBI. Victims 50 and older accounted for only 10% of those cases.
    


            There were only 145 cases in Guthrie's age group — 80 to 89 years old — according to statistics. Guthrie, who is 84, is without critical medication as the search continues, officials said. Law enforcement has emphasized that her age and health concerns make finding her quickly especially important.
    


            Yesterday, officials released a video showing a person tampering with Guthrie's front door camera before she was reported missing. Her family did not recognize the individual, according to NBC.
    


            This is another factor that makes the Guthrie case so uncommon. Most abductions do not involve strangers; only about 9% of all kidnappings and abductions last year were committed by someone unknown to the victim, according to the FBI.
    


            Separately, the NCIC Missing Person and Unidentified Person Statistics report for 2024 found that of 258,849 missing persons cases that year, only 4% involved adults.
    


            A vast majority — 95% — were runaways, according to the report. About 0.9% were classified as abductions by a non-custodial parent, and 0.1% as abductions by a stranger, the statistics show.
    


            CNN's Erin Burnett talks to AI expert Kristian Hammond about how technology will be used to identify the person who abducted Nancy Guthrie.

            Officials have outlined several ways people can contact law enforcement if they have any actionable tips regarding the disappearance of Nancy Guthrie: 1-800-CALL-FBI, 88-CRIME, 520-351-4900, or tips.fbi.gov.
    


            After the FBI released new surveillance video showing a masked person at Guthrie's front door the night she disappeared, the Pima County Sheriff's Department asked the public only call 911 or their non-emergency line if they have actionable tips. Those lines, they said, the are “not the appropriate venue” for “opinions or commentary.”
    


                    “The Pima County Sheriff's Department recognizes that members of the community may have thoughts, opinions, feelings or questions regarding the Nancy Guthrie case,” the department said in a post on X
                





            Authorities have released a person who was being questioned in Rio Rico, about 60 miles south of Tucson near the Mexico border, according to CNN affiliate KNXV. Law enforcement also searched a car and a home in the town.
    


            Authorities have still not been able to locate the mother of “Today” host Savannah Guthrie, a law enforcement source told CNN.
    


Here's a timeline of all the developments since her disappearance.

            “He's running from his past, while ICE is in our communities,” the ad's narrator says.
    


            The target of the ad is Alex Bores, a congressional candidate in New York City who used to work for Palantir, the tech company with long ties to defense and intelligence agencies.
    


            An image flashes of Bores' LinkedIn page. The narrator notes Palantir's work with US Immigration and Customs Enforcement, whose operations in New York City have sparked outcry on the left.
    


            “ICE is powered by Bores' tech. Manhattan is smarter than that,” the narrator says.
    


            In a twist, the ad is backed by some of the very industry forces it condemns. The super PAC   behind it is an affiliate of a new political committee, Leading The Future, launched last summer by a group of tech giants – including Palantir   co-founder Joe Lonsdale – to confront a growing bipartisan backlash to artificial intelligence ahead of the midterm elections.
    


            “Listen, we are on the verge of something amazing for our civilization, right?” Lonsdale said on CNBC in November. “But you have a lot of crazy populists, you have a patchwork of just really intense stuff they are doing that would just break all of this. And we can't let that happen.”
    


            Palantir executives and leaders from OpenAI and venture capital are wading into the political fray, with more than $100 million already pledged by Leading the Future to boost candidates friendly to AI. They're also cutting big checks to congressional leaders and President Donald Trump's political network.
    


            The stakes are especially high this year. Congress is poised to craft the rules of the road for industry for the next decade or longer, and voters are growing increasingly worried about the consequences of AI development, from energy bills to privacy to job loss. Underscoring the tension, several Democrats have been pressured to return campaign contributions from Palantir-linked donors.
    


            “The recent surge in election-related activities of big tech companies such as Palantir and OpenAI can be understood as preemptive measures against potential fallouts from the election,” said Syracuse University professor Hamid Ekbia, the founding director of the Academic Alliance for AI Policy. “Palantir, in specific, is in a vulnerable position because of recent revelations about its heavy involvement with ICE activities.”
    


            Bores, who led one of the first major efforts to regulate artificial intelligence at the state level in New York, accused Leading The Future and its industry backers of hypocrisy.
    


            “I quit their company over its ICE contract, choosing principle over my career and millions of dollars. They profited off of it, and are now using those funds to lie to New Yorkers and attack me,” he said in a statement.
    


            Palantir did not respond to multiple requests for comment.
    


            Two prominent Palantir stakeholders have been active midterm donors: Peter Thiel, a co-founder and billionaire venture capitalist with close ties to Vice President JD Vance and others in the Trump administration, and the company's CEO, Alex Karp.
    


            Both Karp and Thiel gave hundreds of thousands of dollars last year to committees aligned with Republican congressional leadership, according to FEC records. Thiel's giving in 2025 signals reengagement after he largely sat out the 2024 election cycle. Karp has a more enigmatic donor history.
    


            FEC records show that in 2023, Karp gave $360,000 to the joint fundraising committee for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. A year later, he contributed $1 million to MAGA Inc.
    


            Artificial intelligence has been a boon for Palantir, which has seen its market capitalization skyrocket by more than 1000% since 2022. The defense tech firm has worked to leverage AI alongside its expertise organizing data and logistics.
    


            “Our rise has been, and we believe will continue to be, driven by an increasingly discerning set of companies and institutions in the United States that understand the value of artificial intelligence,” Karp wrote to shareholders this week.
    


            And he's been an outspoken advocate for AI development, framing the argument in absolutist terms.
    


            “We are going to be the dominant player, or China is going to be the dominant player, and there will just be very different rules depending on who wins,” Karp said on “The Axios Show” last year. “So, when people are worried about surveillance, of course, there are huge dangers there, but you know, you will have far fewer rights if America's not in the lead.”



            Leading the Future, the industry-funded PAC, raised more than $50 million in the second half of 2025, including $25 million from OpenAI president and co-founder Greg Brockman and his wife, Anna, as well as $25 million from the venture capital firm a16z, according to Federal Election Commission records.
    


            Jesse Hunt, a strategist working with LTF, argued that a fractured regulatory landscape is a threat to American competitiveness.
    


            The tech industry is pushing for a federal standard that would preempt state laws. Trump has voiced support for a moratorium on state regulations, signing an executive order to do so, and Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz proposed legislation to that end.
    


            “How doomer do we get here and how restrictive are the policies that one is advocating for?” Hunt asked. “Ultimately, what we don't want to do is stunt innovation and allow what is now the global leader in artificial intelligence and the innovation sector to flatline because policymakers fall prey to fringe ideology.”
    


            LTF – and its opponents – expect to face off this year across New York, California, Texas, Illinois and Ohio.
    


            Countering LTF is Public First, an organization led by former Oklahoma Democratic Rep. Brad Carson   and former Utah Republican Rep. Chris Stewart.
    


            The group is aiming to raise $50 million in funding and says it will “focus on electing candidates who champion responsible tech policies that reduce harm and protect against AI's worst risks.”
    


            “What we're trying to do at Public First is, in many ways, saving AI from itself,” said Carson. “Because left alone, this kind of no touch approach is going to lead to an incredible public backlash that is already brewing. People are already sharpening their pitchforks.”
    


            While emphasizing that “we haven't made any formal decisions about who we're going to support or not yet,” the group pointed to candidates like Bores, who sponsored the Responsible AI Safety and Education, or RAISE, Act while serving in the New York state legislature.
    


            When it takes effect in March, the legislation will require AI companies to come up with safety protocols aimed at preventing “critical harm” – such as “the creation or use of a chemical, biological, radiological or nuclear weapon,” the bill states, or the conduct of a crime – and report incidents in development and operations, like data breaches or dangerous malfunctions.
    


            Gov. Kathy Hochul, who is running for reelection this year, signed it into law last year and called out AI policy challenges in her State of the State address last month.
    


            “We will not allow technology to undermine our infrastructure, and we won't let it undermine our democracy either,” Hochul said.
    


            A Gallup survey last year  found that 80% of Americans believe the government should maintain rules for AI safety and data security, “even if it means developing AI capabilities more slowly.” And there are bipartisan concerns about AI data centers driving up utility bills along with potential job losses and industry disruptions.
    


            And a loose and politically broad coalition, from Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis to former Trump strategist Steve Bannon, both Republicans, to independent Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, is determined to preserve states' rights to make their own rules.
    


            “Let's not try to act like some type of fake videos or fake songs are going to deliver us to some kind of utopia,” DeSantis said  at a December event in Sebring, Florida,   touting his proposal for state legislation – a “Citizen Bill of Rights for AI” – providing privacy protections, national security restrictions, and regulations for data center construction.
    


            Long controversial with liberals, Palantir is already coming up in midterm debates.
    


            Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, the front-runner in the Illinois Senate Democratic primary, was challenged in a recent primary debate for his history of campaign contributions from Palantir Chief Technology Officer Shyam Sankar, totaling just over $29,000 since 2015, including $7,000 last year.
    


            “You already demonstrated that you're not going to show up when it matters – to take money from one of the ICE contractors, the Chief Technology Officer of Palantir, and that funds your campaign, that demonstrates that that's not what's your priority,” said Illinois Lt. Gov. Juliana Stratton, one of Krishnamoorthi's rivals.
    


            “As for the donation that I received from a Palantir exec, when it came to my attention, we donated it to Illinois migrant rights groups,” Krishnamoorthi responded.
    


            Other Democrats are also returning campaign contributions from Palantir as public scrutiny grows – including an online tracker highlighting top recipients of political donations linked to the company.
    


            In Colorado, where Palantir is headquartered, Sen. John Hickenlooper and Rep. Jason Crow both announced this week that, like Krishnamoorthi, they'd give tens of thousands of dollars to immigrant rights groups to offset years of  donations from Palantir employees, after the Colorado Sun made multiple inquiries about their fundraising records.
    


            The company's lightning-rod status also reflects broader concerns about artificial intelligence and its consequences.
    


            “I have yet to see AI solve cancer, and I would love to see it right now,” said Reed Showalter,   a Democratic antitrust attorney running in Illinois' 7th District. “The consequences have largely been increased costs for electricity and water and a medium-term decrease in employment and wages for the people in both the district, the state, and the country.”
    


            Stewart, the former Utah Republican congressman with Public First, acknowledged the difficulty policymakers face grappling with a poorly understood and rapidly developing technology.
    


            “All of us are trying to develop, you know, more thoughtful answers on this, because this is such a new issue,” Stewart said, adding that “it's not a partisan issue right now, and I hope it doesn't become a partisan issue.”
    


            He urged candidates to take voters' concerns seriously and offer specific solutions on how to deal with AI's immediate effects.
    


            “In all my 12 years in Congress, I don't remember ever having a conversation with someone about electrical bills, right? And it's gonna come up,” he said. “And they've got to be prepared to, you know, not just kind of shrug and say, ‘yeah, it's a problem.' We've got to be prepared to say, ‘this is what we think we should do.'”

            A Pentagon plan to use a high-energy, counter-drone laser without having coordinated with the Federal Aviation Administration about potential risks to civilian flights prompted Wednesday's unprecedented airspace shutdown over El Paso, Texas, multiple sources told CNN.
    


            Those accounts come as the Trump administration has claimed that a Mexican cartel drone crossing into US airspace is what triggered the 10-mile restriction centered on El Paso International Airport.
    


            Late Tuesday, the FAA abruptly issued a temporary flight restriction that immediately grounded all flights up to 18,000 feet around the city for 10 days, effectively shutting down El Paso International Airport.
    


            Roughly eight hours later, the restriction was lifted. By the time the FAA had lifted the flight restrictions, airlines had already issued travel waivers and notified customers of potential changes.
    


            Multiple sources from the federal government and US airlines told CNN that military activity near El Paso, including US drones monitoring cartel operations and the Pentagon's planned use of a high-energy laser designed to counter drones, raised immediate concerns for civilian traffic arriving and departing El Paso International Airport. Fort Bliss and its airfield, Biggs Army Airfield, sit just north of the commercial airport, which serves about 100 flights each day. It is not clear if the Pentagon moved ahead with the deployment of the laser system on Tuesday or Wednesday after notifying the FAA of its planned use.
    


            FAA and Pentagon officials had been scheduled to meet February 20 to review potential impacts and mitigation measures for a test of the laser system, a technology the Pentagon has been testing in more remote areas of the country, multiple sources said. But the Defense Department sought to use the system sooner around El Paso, prompting the FAA to impose the temporary flight restriction until that coordination could occur. The 10-day restriction would have expired on February 21, one day after DoD and the FAA were set to meet.
    


            The FAA's decision to close the airspace was made without telling the White House first, according to people familiar with the matter. The issue became a topic of intense focus inside the West Wing in the early morning hours of Wednesday, as Texas lawmakers pressed for answers on why the airspace was suddenly closed without first alerting them.
    


            An administration official said Wednesday morning that the shutdown was triggered by Defense Department “action to disable” cartel drones. It's unclear if the presence of drones might have led to the acceleration of the deployment of the laser system.
    


            CNN reached out to the FAA and White House for comment about the differing explanations. The Pentagon on Wednesday continued to refer to the administration official's statement about a drone breach having caused the airspace closure.
    


            Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy posted to social media crediting the FAA and Defense Department with acting “swiftly to address a cartel drone incursion.”
    


            “The threat has been neutralized, and there is no danger to commercial travel in the region,” he wrote on X.
    


            Incursions along the southern border are extremely common and historically do not prompt such airspace closures. In 2024, for example, Air Force Gen. Greg Guillot, the commander of NORTHCOM, told the Senate Armed Services Committee that the number of incursions along the US Mexico border was “over a thousand” each month.
    


            The Drug Enforcement Administration and other US security agencies have used facilities at the Biggs Army Airfield for years as part of efforts to monitor Mexico-based drug cartel operations, current and former US officials said.
    


            El Paso, with a population of nearly 700,000, is the sixth-largest city in Texas and one of the 25 largest in the United States. It is a hub of cross-border commerce alongside neighboring Ciudad Juárez in Mexico.
    


            Nearly 3.5 million passengers passed through El Paso International Airport in the first 11 months of 2025, according to its website. The airport describes itself as the gateway to West Texas, southern New Mexico and northern Mexico.
    


            The US military has been testing laser-based air defenses against drones in recent months. Last summer, the Army conducted a live-fire exercise using directed energy weapons alongside more traditional air defense systems at Fort Sill, Oklahoma. And last fall, the Army put out a request to industry for ideas on a counter-drone Enduring-High Energy Laser (E-HEL) weapon system.
    


            In the initial flight restrictions, the FAA classified the area around El Paso﻿ as “(National) Defense Airspace” and said pilots who violated the restriction could be intercepted, detained and questioned by law enforcement.
    


            It warned that additional actions could be taken for pilots who don't adhere to the restrictions, including suspension of flight certifications, criminal charges, and that the US government “may use deadly force” if an aircraft poses an “imminent security threat.”
    


            The sudden FAA restrictions seemed to catch pilots and air traffic controllers by surprise.
    


            Audio from LiveATC.net caught the moment pilots were made aware of the grounding.
    


            “Just pass it on to everybody else, at 06:30 for the next 10 days, we're all at a ground stop,” a controller said.
    


            A pilot replied, “OK, ground stop 06:30 for how long?”
    


            “Ten days,” the controller replied.
    


            “So the airport is totally closed?” the pilot said, chuckling.
    


            The controller replied, “Apparently, we just got informed about 30 minutes to an hour ago.”
    


            “So for 10 days you guys are not open,” the pilot said, in disbelief.
    


            “Well, we'll be here, but no air traffic,” the controller said.
    


            “OK,” the pilot said while laughing.
    


            Samuel, a traveler in El Paso, told CNN affiliate KFOX he was doing a book tour with a client and didn't get any notification from his airline.
    


            “I just kind of saw all the cops here and the news cameras,” he said. “I gotta figure out what's going on if there's another airport that's not in El Paso, and try to figure out and rent a car out.”
    


            Democratic Rep. Veronica Escobar of Texas told reporters Wednesday that the closure of the El Paso International Airport was solely a FAA decision and that local officials — including members of Congress — were left completely in the dark before it happened.
    


            She stressed that she was not notified in advance despite representing the congressional district that's home to the airport, Fort Bliss and the broader El Paso community.
    


            “They did not alert the El Paso city manager or the El Paso mayor,” Escobar said on a press call Wednesday morning. “Everyone locally on the ground was in the dark, and the impact, obviously, is highly consequential.”

The Federal Aviation Administration reopened the airspace around El Paso International Airport in Texas on Wednesday morning, just hours after it announced a 10-day closure that would have grounded all flights to and from the airport.

US Representatives Veronica Escobar and Tony Gonzales said they learned of the closure of airspace around El Paso in the morning, hours after the Federal Aviation Administration shut down the airspace.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Federal officials abruptly closed the airspace over El Paso, Texas, for several hours early Wednesday due to what the Trump administration said was Mexican cartel drone activity, temporarily grounding flights and angering local officials who said they were given no advanced warning.

The Federal Aviation Administration originally announced a 10-day closure of the airspace, confusing travelers at the airport in El Paso, a border city with a population of nearly 700,000 people. The order was lifted a few hours later. No Mexican airspace was closed.

Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said in a post on X that the FAA and the Defense Department “acted swiftly to address a cartel drone incursion. The threat has been neutralized and there is no danger to commercial travel in the region.” Duffy said normal flights were resuming Wednesday morning. He did not say how many drones were involved or what specifically was done to disable them.

Rep. Veronica Escobar, a Democrat whose district includes El Paso, said neither her office, the city of El Paso nor airport operations received advance notice. She said she believed the shutdown was not based on Mexican cartel drones in U.S. airspace, saying that “is not what we in Congress have been told.”

Pentagon declined to comment on Escobar's remarks and Texas Gov. Greg Abbott's office referred questions to the FAA.




“I believe the FAA owes the community and the country an explanation as to why this happened so suddenly and abruptly and was lifted so suddenly and abruptly,” Escobar said during a news conference Wednesday morning. The shutdown had been expected to create significant disruptions given the duration and the size of the metropolitan area around El Paso. 

“The information coming from the federal government does not add up,” Escobar said. 




U.S. Rep. Tony Gonzales, whose district covers an area that stretches for about 800 miles (1,300 kilometers) along Texas' border with Mexico, said cartel drone sightings are common.

“For any of us who live and work along the border, daily drone incursions by criminal organizations is every-day life for us. It's a Wednesday for us,” Gonzales said.

Asked about the drone explanation provided by U.S. officials, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said she had “no information about the use of drones on the border.” She noted that if U.S. authorities have more information they should contact Mexico's government.

Steven Willoughby, the deputy director of the counter-drone program at the Department of Homeland Security, told lawmakers in July that cartels are using drones nearly every day to transport drugs across the border and surveil Border Patrol agents. 

More than 27,000 drones were detected within 500 meters (1,600 feet) of the southern border in the last six months of 2024, he testified, mostly at night. Homeland Security has said agents have seized thousands of pounds of methamphetamine, fentanyl and other drugs in recent years that cartels were trying to fly across the border using drones.

El Paso is hub of cross-border commerce alongside Ciudad Juárez. The Mexican city is home to about 1.5 million people, and some of its residents are accustomed to taking advantage of facilities including airports on both sides of the border. That easy access to the U.S. has also made Juarez, like other border cities, attractive to Mexico's drug cartels seeking to safeguard their smuggling routes for drugs and migrants headed north and cash and guns moving to the south.

El Paso International Airport said in an Instagram post after the closure was announced that all flights to and from the airport would be grounded through Feb. 20, including commercial, cargo and general aviation flights. Local newscasts showed stranded travelers with luggage lining up at airline ticket counters and car rental desks at the El Paso airport hours after flights were grounded. 

The airport posted later Wednesday morning that its operations had resumed and encouraged travelers to contact their airlines for the most up-to-date flight information.

Mexican defense and navy secretaries will meet with Northern Command officials in Washington on Wednesday in a meeting attended by representatives of several other countries, Sheinbaum said during a news conference. Sheinbaum said the Mexican officials would “listen” in the meeting and that her government would look into “the exact causes” of the closure. 

El Paso Mayor Renard Johnson said at a news conference that he didn't hear about the closure until after the alert was issued and he called the failure to communicate that to the city unacceptable.

“Decisions made without notice and coordination puts lives at risk and creates unnecessary danger and confusion,” Johnson said. “This was a major and unnecessary disruption, one that has not occurred since 9/11.”

The airport describes itself as the gateway to west Texas, southern New Mexico and northern Mexico. Southwest, United, American and Delta all operate flights there, among others.

A similar 10-day temporary flight restriction for special security reasons remained in place Wednesday morning around Santa Teresa, New Mexico, which is about 15 miles (24 kilometers) northwest of the El Paso airport. FAA officials did not immediately explain why that restriction remained in place.

U.S. Sen. Ben Ray Lujan of New Mexico, a Democrat, said in a statement: “Keeping our communities informed and safe is critical. I'm demanding answers from the FAA and the administration about why the airspace was closed in the first place without notifying appropriate officials, leaving travelers to deal with unnecessary chaos.”

RIO RICO, Ariz. (AP) — Fresh surveillance images from Nancy Guthrie's porch the night she went missing, coupled with intense police activity across Arizona and the detention of a man had raised hopes that authorities were nearing a major break.

By Wednesday, however, the man said he had been released after questioning, leaving it unclear where the investigation stood into last week's disappearance of Guthrie, the 84-year-old mother of “Today” show host Savannah Guthrie.

Just hours after the FBI released videos Tuesday of a person wearing a gun holster, ski mask and backpack and approaching Nancy Guthrie's home in Tucson, authorities said they had stopped a man near the U.S.-Mexico border for questioning. 

The man told several media outlets early Wednesday that he was released after several hours and had nothing to do with Guthrie's disappearance last week. 

Authorities have not said what led them to stop the man and had not confirmed he was released. The sheriff's department said its deputies and FBI agents also searched a location Tuesday night in Rio Rico, a city south of Tucson where the man lives. 




It was the latest twist in an investigation that has gripped the nation since Nancy Guthrie disappeared on Feb. 1. Until Tuesday, it seemed authorities were making little headway in determining what happened to her or finding who was responsible.

The black and white images released by the FBI showing a masked person trying to cover a doorbell camera on Guthrie's porch marked the first significant break in the case. 




The videos — less than a combined minute in length — gave investigators and the public their first glimpse of who was outside Guthrie's home in the foothills outside Tucson. But the images did not show what happened to her or help determine whether she is still alive.

FBI Director Kash Patel said the videos were pulled from data on “back-end systems” after investigators spent days trying to find lost, corrupted or inaccessible images.

Even though the images do not show the person's face, investigators are hopeful someone will know who was on the porch that night.

“Even when you have a person who appears to be completely covered, they're really not. You can see their girth, the shape of their face, potentially their eyes or mouth,” said former FBI agent Katherine Schweit. 

Authorities were back near Guthrie's neighborhood on Tuesday, using vehicles to block her driveway. A few miles away, law enforcement was going door-to-door in the area where daughter Annie Guthrie lives, talking with neighbors as well as walking through a drainage area and examining the inside of a culvert with a flashlight. 

Investigators have said for more than a week that they believe Nancy Guthrie was taken against her will. She was last seen at home Jan. 31 and reported missing the next day. DNA tests showed blood on her porch was hers, authorities said.

Savannah Guthrie posted the new surveillance images on social media Tuesday. She said the family believes their mother is still alive and provided phone numbers for the FBI and county sheriff. 

The longtime anchor of NBC's morning show and her two siblings have released a series of video statements pleading for the return of their mother and indicating a willingness to pay a ransom.

It is not known whether ransom notes demanding money with deadlines that have already passed were authentic, and whether the family has had any contact with whoever took Guthrie. 

Authorities have described Nancy Guthrie as mentally sound but with limited mobility. She takes several medications and there was concern from the start that she could die without them, Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos has said repeatedly.

Grammy-winning singer Chappell Roan has left the talent agency led by entertainment industry executive and 2028 Los Angeles Olympics chair Casey Wasserman, who appears in recently released government files on Jeffrey Epstein.

Wasserman has not been accused of any wrongdoing in connection with Epstein, but documents released by the Justice Department revealed that in 2003, he exchanged flirtatious emails with Ghislaine Maxwell, who, years later, would be accused of helping Epstein recruit and sexually abuse his victims.

“As of today, I am no longer represented by Wasserman, the talent agency led by Casey Wasserman,” she wrote in an Instagram Story shared Monday. “I hold my teams to the highest standards and have a duty to protect them as well. No artist, agent or employee should ever be expected to defend or overlook actions that conflict so deeply with our own moral values.”

She did not mention Epstein in the statement.

“I have deep respect and appreciation for the agents and staff who work tirelessly for their artists and I refuse to passively stand by,” Roan continued. “Artists deserve representation that aligns with their values and supports their safety and dignity. This decision reflects my belief that meaningful change in our industry requires accountability and leadership that earns trust.”

Among the exchanges included was Wasserman telling Maxwell, “I think of you all the time. So, what do I have to do to see you in a tight leather outfit?”




Wasserman responded to the release of the files on Jan. 31, stating “I deeply regret my correspondence with Ghislaine Maxwell,” which he said occurred “long before her horrific crimes came to light.”

“I never had a personal or business relationship with Jeffrey Epstein,” he continued. 

Wasserman was among several a handful of entertainment industry figures, including the actors Kevin Spacey and Chris Tucker, who accompanied former U.S. President Bill Clinton aboard Epstein's jet for a philanthropy-related trip to Africa in 2002. In a Feb. 8 statement to the Los Angeles Times, Wasserman said it was the only time he met Epstein. 

“Following that trip, where I never witnessed anything inappropriate, I did not speak to, see him or communicate with him ever again,” he said.

At the time, there had yet to be any public reports of wrongdoing by either Maxwell or Epstein, who was first investigated by police in 2005. The records released by the government don't show any correspondence between Wasserman and Maxwell after 2003, appear to contain scant other references to him.

Maxwell was charged in 2020 with sex trafficking and is serving a 20-year prison sentence.

Representatives for Roan and Wasserman did not immediately respond to requests for comment from The Associated Press.

Roan's departure from Wasserman follows statements from other artists on the agency's roster.

— “Given the circumstances we feel strongly that we need to begin the process of extracting ourselves from Wasserman,” the alt-country band Wednesday wrote on Instagram. “Continuing to be represented by a company led by and named after Casey Wasserman goes against our values and cannot continue.”

— The indie rock band Beach Bunny wrote on Instagram, “We are demanding for Wasserman to remove himself and his name from the agency, ‘deep regrets' are not enough.”

— The New York duo Water From Your Eyes wrote on Instagram that they have “no interest in being affiliated with Casey Wasserman and have absolutely zero intention of condoning his actions by silently remaining under his namesake banner.”

— Electropop duo Sylvan Esso wrote in an Instagram Story, “We along with many other musicians, are leaving the Wasserman agency. ... We don't know where we'll be next, but it will not be anywhere he is.”

— And last week, Best Coast's Bethany Cosentino published an open letter urging Wasserman to step down from his company. “Ghislaine Maxwell is not a neutral character in a messy story — she is a convicted sex trafficker who helped facilitate the abuse of minors. ... I did not consent to having my name or my career tied to someone with this kind of association to exploitation.”

Wasserman, grandson of movie mogul Lew Wasserman and son of stockbroker Jack Myers, built a sports and talent agency that represents top players in football, basketball and baseball — along with big-name actors such as Adam Sandler and Brad Pitt, as well as musicians including Ed Sheeran, Coldplay, Kasey Musgraves and Lorde.

He's been at the center of headlines recently as the frontman for the Los Angeles Olympic effort; his lobbying played a big role in bringing the Summer Olympics back to the U.S. in 2028. Los Angeles previously hosted in 1984, and this will be the first Summer Games in the United States since Atlanta in 1996.

But as it stands, it does not appear that the International Olympic Committee is interested in putting pressure on Wasserman.

Last week, IOC president Kirsty Coventry was asked if Wasserman was still the right person to oversee the next Summer Games; she responded, “From the IOC point of view, the (organizing committee) and how they are structured is not something we are going to get involved into.”

Wasserman has faced calls from lawmakers and those in political circles in L.A. to step down as chair of the city's Olympic project he has led since it was first a hosting candidate 11 years ago.

GENEVA (AP) — The fallout from the Jeffrey Epstein saga is rippling through Europe.

Politicians, diplomats, officials and royals have seen reputations tarnished, investigations launched and jobs lost after a trove of more than 3 million pages of Epstein-related documents released by the U.S. Justice Department revealed their ties to the American financier and convicted sex offender who died behind bars in 2019.

Apart from the former Prince Andrew, none of them face claims of sexual wrongdoing. They have been toppled for maintaining friendly relationships with Epstein after he became a convicted sex offender.

Some experts note the reckoning in Europe's parliamentary democracies has been swifter and more severe — for now — than in the United States, where Epstein built his empire and hobnobbed with many American elites. 

Here's a look at some of those in the Old World caught up in the new furor.

The former Prince Andrew, one of King Charles III's two brothers, is one of the most prominent names linked to the Epstein underworld involving the recruitment of underage girls for sex. 

He has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing, but the scandalous headlines forced the king last year t o strip Andrew of his royal titles, including that of prince. He is now known as Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor. 

The recent document dump exposed the depth of ties between Mountbatten-Windsor and Epstein, revealing more unsavory details that have jolted the royal family, including an allegation that the former prince sent trade reports to Epstein in 2010. 

Mountbatten-Windsor has been forced to move out of the royal estate that he occupied for more than two decades. Buckingham Palace says that the king is ready to support police in the event of an inquiry into whether Mountbatten-Windsor gave confidential information to Epstein.

The U.K. government has been shaken by new revelations about Peter Mandelson, a longtime Labour party stalwart who Prime Minister Keir Starmer brought out of the political wilderness as U.K. ambassador in Washington.

Mandelson was stripped of that plum post in September, after Epstein emails showed that they had had closer ties than the ambassador had initially acknowledged. 

While Starmer himself isn't implicated in the files, his position has come under threat over appointing Mandelson. He has faced calls from his opponents and from within his own Labour party to resign — which he has so far refused.

Mandelson is now facing a criminal investigation, after the new files suggested that he may have shared market-sensitive information with Epstein a decade and a half ago.




The new documents showed, among other things, that Norwegian Crown Princess Mette-Marit, the 52-year-old wife of Crown Prince Haakon, borrowed an Epstein-owned property in Palm Beach, Florida, for several days in 2013. 

And in an email exchange between Epstein and Mette-Marit in 2012, he noted how he was in Paris “on my wife hunt,” but “i prefer Scandinavians.” 

She replied that the French capital was “good for adultery,” but “Scandis” were “better wife material.”

Mette-Marit apologized this month for “the situation I have put the royal family in,” and said: “Some of the content of the messages between Epstein and me does not represent the person I want to be.”

On Wednesday, the Council of Europe said that it was honoring a request from Norwegian authorities to waive the immunity from legal processes that its former secretary-general and ex-Prime Minister Thorbjørn Jagland, had enjoyed. 

The council, a human rights body based in Strasbourg, France, said that such immunity aims “to safeguard the independent exercise of official functions,” and wasn't intended for “personal benefit.”

Based on revelations in the Epstein files, Norwegian authorities opened an investigation into “aggravated corruption” involving Jagland, who is also a former chair of the Norwegian Nobel Committee. 

Emails indicate that Jagland made plans to visit Epstein's island with his family in 2014.

Mona Juul, Norway's ex-ambassador to Jordan, who was involved in Israeli-Palestinian peace efforts in the 1990s, resigned over the weekend, after reports said that Epstein left $10 million to Juul's children in a will drawn up shortly before he died. 

Foreign Minister Espen Barth Eide said that a ministry investigation into her knowledge of and contact with Epstein will continue, and Juul will continue discussions with Norwegian officials to clarify the situation.

Jack Lang, 86, stepped down as head of the Arab World Institute in Paris over alleged past financial links to Epstein that prompted a tax investigation. 

Lang was summoned to appear Sunday at the French Foreign Ministry, which oversees the institute, but submitted his resignation.

The former culture minister under President Francois Mitterrand is the highest-profile figure in France impacted by the U.S. Justice Department's release of files on Jan. 30.

Prime Minister Robert Fico's national security adviser, Miroslav Lajčák, resigned over past communications with Epstein — including text messages in which they discussed “gorgeous” girls. 

“When I'm reading the messages today, I feel like an idiot,” Lajčák told Slovak public radio. 

Lajčák, a former foreign minister and former president of the U.N. General Assembly, has denied any wrongdoing. He said that he considered Epstein a valuable contact who was accepted by the rich and powerful in the U.S.

“Those messages are nothing more than stupid male egos in action,” Lajčák said. “Nothing more than words ever came of it.”

Kid Rock details his experience headlining Turning Point USA's 2026 halftime show on ‘The Ingraham Angle.'

Kid Rock is firing back at critics who accused him of lip-syncing during Turning Point USA's halftime show.

After social media lit up with claims that his performance of ""Bawitdaba"" didn't match the video feed, the rocker took to X to shut it down.

""My halftime performance was pre-recorded but performed live. No lip-syncing like the haters and fake news are trying to report. When they synced the cameras to my performance on ‘Bawitdaba,' it did not line up as I explain in this video,"" Kid Rock wrote.

In an accompanying video, he made it clear that the controversy was because of a production glitch — not a faked performance.

""That song is chaos,"" he began to explain. ""The first thing is, if I was ever going to lip-sync — which I wouldn't — that would be the last song I would ever have to bring in the fold to do it to. We performed this song every night on tour since 1998, since the day it was released. So the Turning Point event, they sent me a first cut [after] we taped it, my comment was, ‘the sync is off.' They were trying to line up … It was very difficult for them, because somebody clearly wasn't super familiar with the song … It could have been done had we had more time.""

Turning Point USA streamed on YouTube at the same time as the Super Bowl halftime show featuring Bad Bunny.

Kid Rock — a longtime supporter of President Donald Trump — shared the stage with country stars Lee Brice, Brantley Gilbert and Gabby Barrett.

Within hours, clips of the performance were circulating online, with critics claiming the rock veteran wasn't singing live.

Kid Rock says that narrative is flat-out wrong.

""So I have nothing but good things to say — not only about Turning Point, but the production team that they work with,"" he continued. ""Nobody's perfect, gets it right every time. But for the haters and the trolls out there, that's exactly what happened. And by the way, most of you know this … Some of you in the entertainment world can look at that and be like, ‘oh, the sync is off.' But they had to lie and say, ‘Oh, he was lip-syncing.' And then the problem is people amplify this all over the internet. And I know most people don't even care, but there's certain people just keep repeating it, so people think it's a fact.""

""And this goes on on both sides,"" he added. ""They did it to Bad Bunny, in his defense, when they were saying he said ‘You have four months to learn Spanish.' He was on 'Saturday Night Live,' I think he was joking. But they do it far too often, especially in the fake news media.""

He doubled down during a previous appearance on Fox News' ""The Ingraham Angle,"" after host Laura Ingraham described the performance as ""out of whack.""

""It was out of sync,"" Kid Rock said. ""Actually, just to have some fun with the haters. I can't answer all the trolls, but it's going to be some fun. My DJ, who actually raps that song with me, he was not lit up.""

""He's coming to Nashville tonight, flying in. We're going to do that live in my living room and I'm going to post it tomorrow to show people exactly how this works,"" he continued.

If he were actually lip-syncing, he argued, the mistake wouldn't have happened in the first place.

Dr. Daniel Amen applauds proposed Trump administration dietary guidelines, detailing how sugar, low-fat diets and vaccines impact brain health.

Grabbing something sugary in the mid-afternoon can feel like an easy fix for low energy, but the timing could have an impact on brain health, experts say.

For many Americans, the most vulnerable eating decisions of the day happen between lunch and dinner, and those decisions could have long-term consequences for how the body and brain handle blood sugar later in the day, according to recent research and reports.

Experts say the timing and the type of snack matter more than most people think.

'ADDICTIVE' ULTRA-PROCESSED FOODS LINKED TO SPIKE IN CHRONIC DISEASE, RESEARCHERS WARN

""Blood sugar crashes are a big deal because our brains don't have a reserve tank,"" said Kiara DeWitt, a Texas-based certified neurology nurse and head of clinical operations at Medical Director Co.

""It's all about a steady stream of glucose,"" DeWitt told Fox News Digital.

Experts say sugary snacks between lunch and dinner can trigger blood sugar crashes that stress the brain. (iStock)

""Simple sugars and processed foods with inflammatory seed oils push your glucose higher quicker. … The less you eat these snacks, the less stress you're putting on your brain.""

Ultra-processed snacks high in added sugar can create rapid blood sugar spikes followed by sharp crashes, triggering inflammation and insulin resistance that impair how neurons function over time, she added.

Those effects may be amplified between 2 p.m. and 4 p.m., when cortisol naturally dips and energy from lunch has worn off. 

When glycogen stores are low, blood sugar highs and lows feel more extreme, which can be especially challenging for the brain, DeWitt said.

Maintaining steady blood sugar levels may help protect memory and cognitive function over time, according to experts. (iStock)

Research has shown a link between post-meal blood sugar spikes and the risk of Alzheimer's, the most common form of dementia. A large genetic analysis found that people with elevated blood sugar two hours after eating were 69% more likely to develop Alzheimer's disease.

""Over time, high blood sugars damage blood vessels in the brain, which increases the risk of memory and learning problems,"" registered dietitian Tanya Freirich of North Carolina previously told Fox News Digital.

Experts emphasize that sugar itself isn't the enemy — rather, refined, fast-absorbing sugar is.

Whole fruit, for example, behaves very differently than cookies or candy. 

A fruit salad with blueberries, strawberries, grapes and bananas, among other foods, is pictured. ""How you snack matters just as much as when you decide to snack,"" said one expert. (iStock)

Fiber slows digestion, preventing sharp glucose spikes while delivering antioxidants that protect brain cells. 

The problem, DeWitt said, is simple sugars and processed foods push glucose up quickly and crash it just as fast.

Experts recommend snacks that combine protein, fiber and healthy fats, helping glucose stay within a narrow, steady range for hours.

DeWitt's go-to options include nuts, Greek yogurt and apple slices with nut butter.

Mecklenburg County, North Carolina, Sheriff Garry McFadden says he does not know how many branches of government there are.

North Carolina Republican state Rep. Allen Chesser said he was taken by surprise when a Democratic sheriff who has long opposed cooperating with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) could not answer a basic question about how the government works.

A North Carolina House Oversight Committee hearing spurred on by the recent killing of a young Ukrainian woman, Iryna Zarutska, in Charlotte, took an unexpected turn when Chesser asked Mecklenburg County Sheriff Garry McFadden, ""What branch of government do you operate under?""

McFadden, who is the top law enforcement officer in the county where Zarutska was killed, simply answered, ""Mecklenburg County,"" prompting Chesser to repeat, ""What branch of government do you operate under, sheriff?""

The sheriff answered, ""The Constitution of the United States,"" to which Chesser responded, ""That is what establishes the branches of government; I'm asking what branch you fall under.""

After McFadden answered, ""Mecklenburg County"" again, Chesser remarked, ""This is not where I was anticipating getting stuck. Um, are you aware of how many branches of government there are?"" The sheriff quickly shot back, ""No.""

After a long pause, Chesser continued, ""For the sake of debate, let's say there are three branches of government: legislative, executive, judicial. Of those three, which do you fall under?""

The sheriff answered, ""I believe I fall under the last one … judicial.""

""You are incorrect, sir. You fall under the executive,"" said Chesser.

After that, Chesser continued to press McFadden about how he reconciles his responsibility as an officer under the executive branch to enforce the law with his opposition to cooperation with ICE. Chesser asked McFadden how he reconciled his responsibility with a previous statement in which the sheriff said, ""We do not have a role in enforcement whatsoever, we do not have to follow the rules and the laws that are governed by our lawmakers in Raleigh.""

The sheriff said that Chesser was taking his quote out of context, saying it was strictly in reference to immigration enforcement.

Though declining to offer more context on the statement, McFadden affirmed his office is now abiding by state law requiring cooperation with ICE, saying, ""We follow the law, when the law is produced, we follow the law.""

In an interview with Fox News Digital the day after the hearing, Chesser, who is an Army veteran and former police officer, said that, ""Obviously, those weren't the cache of questions that I was thinking we were going to get him on.""

""I had several statements that he had made to the media and to the local press and in different interviews that kind of conflicted with some of the testimony that he provided yesterday about following the law. We made it to [only] one of those statements because we got held up on what I thought was baseline, just kind of setting a baseline of how we were to establish that his role is to enforce the law,"" he explained, adding, ""I was not expecting to have to get into a fifth-grade civics lesson with a duly elected sheriff.""

He said that McFadden has ""decided to make himself kind of a centerpiece in the refusal to enforce immigration law here in North Carolina,"" adding, ""It's not so much the refusal to enforce immigration law, but it's the refusal to enforce state law that says he must cooperate with ICE and ICE detainers when people are in custody in his facilities.""

""Last summer, we had the unfortunate death of a young Ukrainian national that had sought refuge in our country and in our state,"" Chesser went on. ""I think that all North Carolinians, and all people who find themselves in North Carolina, should be able to count on one thing when it comes to public safety, and that is whether or not you are safe and whether or not the law will be enforced is not dependent on what county you find yourself in.""

""North Carolina is a safe state for all the people who choose to come here, and that is the point of the Oversight Committee [hearing] that we were having was, making sure that the law is equally applied and fairly applied across all imaginary lines in our state,"" he said.

The Mecklenburg County Sheriff's Office did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.

Carlos Palazuelos, a delivery driver in the Tucson area, speaks with Fox News' Matt Finn after being questioned by police in the disappearance of Nancy Guthrie.

A person who was briefly detained for questioning Tuesday evening in Rio Rico, Arizona, in connection with the disappearance of Nancy Guthrie has been released, authorities said.

The Pima County Sheriff's Department said deputies detained an individual during a traffic stop south of Tucson, near the U.S.-Mexico border, hours after the FBI released surveillance images of a masked person wearing what appeared to be a handgun holster outside Guthrie's front door the night she vanished.

The department and the FBI also conducted a court-authorized search at a home in Rio Rico, a community of about 20,000 residents roughly an hour south of Tucson and about 15 miles north of the U.S.-Mexico border. Authorities said Tuesday night the search was expected to take several hours. By Wednesday morning, investigators had left the residence, the scene was cleared, and police tape had been removed.

A man at the home identified himself to Fox News as Carlos Palazuelos. He said he was the person pulled over during the traffic stop and detained for questioning but has since been released and is back at the house.

Palazuelos told Fox News he works in Tucson delivering packages and said he had nothing to do with Guthrie's disappearance. He said investigators questioned him about his whereabouts and took his phone before ultimately releasing him.

Palazuelos said it was a ""possibility"" he may have delivered a package to Guthrie's residence.

He said law enforcement showed one of his in-laws a photo of a masked person seen in surveillance footage on Guthrie's property and that it ""supposedly looked like my eyes.""

NANCY GUTHRIE'S ALLEGED BITCOIN RANSOM COULD BE PAID IN MINUTES AS MONDAY DEADLINE APPROACHES: EXPERT

""That's it. That's all I know,"" Palazuelos said.

The FBI on Tuesday released short surveillance clips showing a masked person wearing a backpack and what appeared to be a handgun holster outside Guthrie's home the night she disappeared. At one point, the individual appears to tilt their head away from a doorbell camera, hold a flashlight in their mouth and attempt to cover the lens with a gloved hand and what looked like part of a plant pulled from the yard.

Investigators have said for more than a week that they believe Guthrie was taken against her will. She was last seen at her home on Jan. 31 and was reported missing the next day. DNA testing determined that blood found on her porch belonged to her, authorities have said.

Savannah Guthrie and her two siblings have released multiple video statements pleading for their mother's return and indicating a willingness to pay a ransom, while asking for proof that she is alive.

Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos has said Nancy Guthrie is mentally sound but has limited mobility and takes several medications, raising concerns about her health if she does not have access to them.

The FBI has begun posting digital billboards in several major cities seeking tips, and officials have urged anyone with information to contact investigators.

London researchers have reconstructed a large Roman wall plaster collection, revealing 1,800-year-old frescoes that decorated a high-status building. (Source: MOLA) 

Researchers recently unveiled proof that Romans used a surprising ingredient in their medical treatments — and it's far from sanitary.

The research focuses on a vessel that was unearthed in Pergamon, originally a Greek city that was conquered by the Romans in 133 B.C. The site is now located in İzmir Province, in western Turkey.

While the vessel appeared ordinary, it was later found to have served a medical purpose. Researchers identified ""dark brownish flakes"" in the residue — which were determined to be fecal matter.

HAUNTING ANCIENT BATTLE TRUMPET UNEARTHED IN LANDSCAPE TIED TO LEGENDARY QUEEN

In a study published in the April 2026 edition of the Journal of Archaeological Sciences, researchers argued that the residue is the first ""direct chemical evidence for the medicinal use of fecal matter in Greco-Roman antiquity.""

It's not exactly a surprise that fecal matter was used in ancient Roman medicine, said Cenker Atila, an archaeology professor at Sivas Cumhuriyet University in Turkey and co-author of the study.

The practice was ""already known from ancient sources,"" the expert told Fox News Digital.

Yet ""despite these references, there had long been debate about whether such treatments were actually used in practice. By discovering this substance in [famous physician] Galen's own city — and identifying the very remedy he described — we were able to put an end to those doubts.""

'HUGELY EXCITING' PREHISTORIC ARTIFACTS UNCOVERED DURING HUNT FOR LONG-LOST IRISH CASTLE

Atila found the vessels in the storage of the Bergama Museum in Bergama, Turkey, while doing research on a separate project.

After noticing that some of the glasses contained residue, he went back with his colleagues to collect the material.

""This find represents the first archaeological evidence of a medicine that we know was used during the Roman period.""

""While working on the Pergamon Museum glassware project, we expected we might uncover an ancient cosmetic or medicinal substance,"" said Atila.

The residue was found in a vessel called an unguentarium, typically used to contain perfumes — but Atila said that it appears to have been repurposed as a medicine bottle.

He worked with his colleagues — chemist İlker Demirbolat and medical historian Rana Babaç Çelebi — to analyze the contents further.

The residue contained human feces mixed with thyme and olive oil.

""Because we are well acquainted with ancient textual sources, we immediately recognized this as a medicinal preparation used by the famous physician Galen,"" the archaeologist said.

""We therefore proceeded to publish our findings without delay.""

The thyme was used to mask the smell of human waste, as well as for its antibacterial properties, Atila said.

Two flight restrictions were issued by the Federal Aviation Administration on Wednesday morning for airspace over El Paso, Texas, and New Orleans.

In Texas, arriving and departing flights out of El Paso International Airport in El Paso, Texas, have been suspended for 10 days, the FAA announced. The decision to halt air traffic was due to “special security reasons” and was revealed in an alert on the FAA's official “Notice to Air Missions” website.

The order was issued without advance notice and went into effect on Feb. 10 at 11:30 p.m. local time, according to multiple sources. However, NOTAM mentioned that the airspace restriction at El Paso began on “Feb. 11 at 0630 UTC.”

“No pilots may operate an aircraft in the areas covered by this NOTAM (except as described),” read information posted in an “Operating Restrictions and Requirements” section. “EXCLUDING MEXICAN AIRSPACE.”

The reason posted on the NOTAM for the closure was “Temporary flight restrictions for Special Security Reasons.” The restrictions are listed as being scheduled to end on “Feb. 21, 2026 at 0630 UTC.”

In New Orleans, a separate NOTAM was issued early Wednesday morning for five separate areas with a radius of “three nautical miles.”

“No UAS operations are authorized in the areas covered by this NOTAM (except as described),” read the alert for New Orleans. “Temporary flight restrictions for Special Security Reasons” was also the reason given for this NOTAM.

No other information has been provided about the closures at this time. 

TRUMP SOWS DOUBTS ABOUT 2026 ELECTION IN EFFORT TO SELL NATIONAL VOTER ID LAW

El Paso International Airport is considered a “major medium-hub” which services over 4 million passengers annually and nearly 98,000 “aircraft operations.” It has three runways and 15 gates in its terminal.

Law enforcement detained a person of interest on Tuesday in connection with the kidnapping of Nancy Guthrie, the mother of Today show co-host Savannah Guthrie.

The Pima County Sheriff's Department confirmed the detainment in an X post on Tuesday night, writing, “Earlier today, Pima County Sheriff's Department deputies detained a subject during a traffic stop south of Tucson. The subject is currently being questioned in connection to the Nancy Guthrie investigation. Additional information will be released as it becomes available.”

Law enforcement was preparing to search a location related to the person of interest in Rio Rico, Arizona, on Tuesday.

The Pima County Sheriff's Department and the FBI have been working on the case for over a week after Nancy Guthrie disappeared from her Arizona home on Feb. 1. The Tuesday night development in the case comes hours after the release of doorbell camera footage of a possible suspect in the disappearance.

FBI Director Kash Patel released images of a possible suspect who was tampering with the doorbell camera outside of Nancy Guthrie's home while masked, saying later in a TV interview on Tuesday night that authorities were looking at multiple “persons of interest” in the case.

Nancy Guthrie, who is 84, relies on a specific medication for her health, giving the investigation some urgency, according to her family and investigators. She also has a pacemaker.

PATEL RELEASES DOORBELL CAMERA FOOTAGE OF POSSIBLE SUSPECT IN NANCY GUTHRIE'S DISAPPEARANCE 

Savannah Guthrie reposted the images of the possible suspect caught on her mother's doorbell camera on Instagram on Tuesday afternoon.

“We believe she is still alive. Bring her home. Anyone with information, please contact 1-800-CALL-FBI (1-800-225-5324) or the Pima County Sheriff's Department 520-351-4900,” Savannah Guthrie wrote.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

The Federal Aviation Administration lifted its airspace closure over El Paso and New Orleans just hours after instituting it, following a Mexican “cartel drone incursion” into U.S. airspace.

The FAA originally instituted the shutdown for 10 days, through Feb. 21, but it was lifted after a few hours, according to the Associated Press.

“The FAA and DOW acted swiftly to address a cartel drone incursion,” Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said in a statement. “The threat has been neutralized, and there is no danger to commercial travel in the region. The restrictions have been lifted and normal flights are resuming.”

The Washington Examiner reached out to the FAA for comment.

The order was issued without advance notice and went into effect on Feb. 10 at 11:30 p.m. local time, multiple sources reported. However, NOTAM mentioned that the airspace restriction at El Paso began on “Feb. 11 at 0630 UTC.”

“No pilots may operate an aircraft in the areas covered by this NOTAM (except as described),” information posted in an “Operating Restrictions and Requirements” section said. “EXCLUDING MEXICAN AIRSPACE.”

The official reason posted on the NOTAM for the closure was “Temporary flight restrictions for Special Security Reasons.”

Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) faced a major setback on the House floor on Tuesday night after a handful of Republicans tanked a party-line vote to block resolutions looking to repeal President Donald Trump's tariffs.

The House failed to pass a procedural measure, called a “rule,” on a slate of bills that included language extending the prohibition of members calling up bills to repeal the administration's tariffs through July 31. The measure failed 214 to 217, with three Republicans — Reps. Thomas Massie (R-KY), Don Bacon (R-NE), and Kevin Kiley (R-CA) — joining all Democrats in voting against it. 

This is a blow to leadership and Johnson, making this the seventh rule failure he's faced since taking the speaker's gavel. He had narrowly avoided a rule failure multiple times over the last six months, often by flipping a handful of GOP holdouts by actively whipping them on the floor. Before Tuesday, the most recent party-line vote failure occurred in July involving cryptocurrency and appropriations bills.

The vote on Tuesday sought to extend previous language that blocked tariff repeal resolutions from getting a vote, which expired at the end of January. But Democrats and some Republicans have numerous bills disapproving of Trump's tariffs, ready to go once the prohibition is lifted, which is why GOP leadership rushed this week to try to reinstate the ban.

Because of Tuesday's rule failure, any bills tucked into that measure sit at a standstill. The rules committee voted Tuesday night immediately after voting to pass another measure that would advance the GOP's voter ID bill, the SAVE America Act.

Johnson told reporters he does not plan to put the tariff ban language nor the other bills included in Tuesday's rule on the floor again on Wednesday, wanting to focus on the SAVE America Act.

“This is life with a small majority,” the speaker said. “I need unanimity every day, and we didn't get it tonight.”

Johnson can only afford to lose one vote to still pass a bill along party lines, and he faced at least two Republican detractors heading into the vote. Votes in the House were delayed from Tuesday afternoon to the evening as leadership sought to convince nearly half a dozen GOP holdouts to vote for the measure.

The speaker successfully staved off opposition from Reps. Tom McClintock (R-CA), Victoria Spartz (R-IN), or Mike Turner (R-OH), who have previously pushed back against tariffs.

Reps. Zach Nunn (R-IA), Dan Newhouse (R-WA), and Spartz withheld their votes for a time, but all three ultimately voted “yes.” This came after Spartz said throughout the day on Tuesday that she was opposed to the measure, eventually flipping her vote as she has done on several other contentious bills this Congress.

GOP attendance also proved to be an issue, with Rep. Greg Murphy (R-NC) not voting this week. He has been recovering from surgery and has missed several votes since the start of the year. But Rep. Wesley Hunt (R-TX), who has missed several votes while campaigning in the Texas GOP Senate primary, was present on Tuesday night and voted for the rule.

The vote was held open for nearly an hour, with Democrats calling on Republicans to close it after it was clear that Massie, Bacon, and Kiley were not returning.

Massie's opposing vote was unsurprising, as he often votes against party-line measures. He told the Washington Examiner that leadership “didn't try” to whip him. 

“You're gonna have to quit spending millions of dollars against me,” Massie said, “before I'll even consider compromising my principles.”

Kiley had told reporters earlier in the day that he would only vote for the measure if the tariff restriction language was removed.

“My main issue here is, this isn't the purpose of a rule,” Kiley said. “The rule is meant to bring a bill to the floor, set the parameters for debate. It's not meant to smuggle in unrelated provisions that expand the power of leadership at the expense of our members. That's the reason I oppose it. I don't understand why this keeps coming up.”

Bacon voted no and quickly left the Capitol. He told reporters he was not swayed by pressure from leadership.

“I have to answer to Article 1,” Bacon said.

He later said in a post to X that he doesn't like stalling the House, but “Congress needs to be able to debate on tariffs.”

“Article I of the Constitution places authority over taxes and tariffs with Congress for a reason, but for too long, we have handed that authority to the executive branch,” Bacon said. “It's time for Congress to reclaim that responsibility. I also oppose using the rules votes to legislate. I want the debate and the right to vote on tariffs.”

Johnson has tried to avoid, as much as possible, putting contentious bills on the floor that could be politically damaging during the 119th Congress, particularly ahead of a competitive midterm election year. But a bill to undo Trump's tariffs against Canada passed the Senate in a bipartisan manner in October 2025.

REPUBLICANS LOOK TO USHER THROUGH VOTER ID LEGISLATION FOR THIRD TIME WITH SAVE AMERICA ACT

Democrats are expected to force a vote to repeal tariffs on Canada on Wednesday. A resolution to repeal tariffs on Mexico “ripens,” or is allowed to be called up for a vote, on Wednesday, and a resolution to repeal tariffs on Brazil ripens next week.

Trump would almost certainly veto any measure to repeal his tariffs, putting GOP leadership in both chambers in a difficult position.

A grand jury has refused to indict several former military and intelligence lawmakers who made a video urging military members to disobey illegal orders, according to multiple reports.

The U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Columbia, under Jeanine Pirro, sought an indictment related to a video featuring six U.S. lawmakers, including Sens. Elissa Slotkin (D-MI) and Mark Kelly (D-AZ). It was not immediately clear which of the lawmakers were targeted in the failed indictment.

“Today, U.S. Attorney Jeanine Pirro attempted to persuade a Grand Jury to indict me. This was in response to me organizing a 90-second video that simply quoted the law. Pirro did this at the direction of President [Donald] Trump, who said repeatedly that I should be investigated, arrested, and hanged for sedition. Today, it was a grand jury of anonymous American citizens who upheld the rule of law and determined this case should not proceed,” Slotkin wrote on X. 

The Washington Examiner reached out to Pirro's office for comment.

Slotkin said last week that she would not sit down for a Department of Justice inquiry with Pirro and Attorney General Pam Bondi over the video. In mid-January, Slotkin revealed she was under investigation over the video.

“Today, I sent a letter to Attorney General Pam Bondi and U.S. Attorney Jeanine Pirro informing them that I will not be sitting down with them for their inquiry over a 90-second video I filmed in November,” Slotkin wrote on X last week.

Kelly also posted on X regarding the indictment effort and the grand jury's decision, writing on Tuesday that “the most patriotic thing any of us can do is not back down.”

“This is an outrageous abuse of power by Donald Trump and his lackies. It wasn't enough for [War Secretary] Pete Hegseth to censure me and threaten to demote me, now it appears they tried to have me charged with a crime — all because of something I said that they didn't like. That's not the way things work in America,” Kelly wrote. 

Kelly brought a lawsuit against Pete Hegseth in mid-January over the war secretary's decision to initiate rank reduction proceedings against the Arizona senator and retired Navy captain. Hegseth and Kelly have feuded over the past several months over the video. 

Trump initially called attention within his administration to the video by posting the Washington Examiner's story about the video on Truth Social and writing, “SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR, punishable by DEATH!”

Reps. Jason Crow (D-CO), Maggie Goodlander (D-NH), Chris Deluzio (D-PA), and Chrissy Houlahan (D-PA) were also featured in the video. In mid-January, Crow said the six lawmakers had each been contacted by the DOJ.

“Today an American grand jury honored our Constitution by standing up to an outrageous abuse of presidential power and taxpayer dollars. No matter the threats, I will keep doing my job and upholding my oath to our Constitution,” Goodlander said in a statement to Axios.

President Donald Trump called former President Ronald Reagan “bad on trade” in a Tuesday interview, pointing to a moment when he said Reagan “folded” to Japan in auto industry negotiations.

“I liked Ronald Reagan, but Ronald Reagan was bad on trade,” Trump told Larry Kudlow in a Fox Business interview. “He had the big shootout with Japan, and he folded, and they came in and took our car market.”

Reagan famously negotiated voluntary export restraints with Japan to put a quota on their automobile exports to the United States, which many trade analysts argue led to a spike in car prices for consumers. Trump, who favors tariffs, told Kudlow that “everybody has problems” and Reagan “was not good on trade.”

“I'm a fan of his, and I thought he just sort of had a great presence. But on trade, if you look at every president we have over the last 50 years was bad on trade. Every single one. But I'm not bad on trade. I'm real good on trade,” Trump said.

In October 2025, Trump and Reagan's opposing viewpoints on trade took center stage after a Canadian advertisement aired showing Reagan endorsing free trade, causing Trump to pause his trade talks with the U.S.'s northern neighbor. Last May, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick also criticized Reagan's trade policies.

In his Tuesday evening interview, Trump also spoke about a conversation he had with the “prime minister” of Switzerland, likely referring to then-President Karin Keller-Sutter, during which she was “very aggressive” and kept saying they were a “small country” as she discussed the impact of tariffs on her nation. Trump said it was after that phone call that he raised their tariff percentage from 30% to 39%.

“It was a 30% and I didn't really like the way she talked to us. So instead of giving her a reduction, I raised it to 39%,” Trump said. “Then, I got inundated by people from Switzerland, and I figured, you know what, we'll do something that's a little bit more palatable, at least now.”

After raising the reciprocal tariff rate on Switzerland to 39% in August, Trump lowered it to 15% in November as part of a joint deal between the two countries and Liechtenstein.

They say they want to save democracy. First they'll need to get out of their own way.

Ken Martin has one of those resting dread faces, as if he's bracing for someone to dump a bucket of rocks on his head. His nervous eyes make him look chronically unsettled—which is probably appropriate for someone trying to run the Democratic National Committee these days.

“The political equivalent of being a fire hydrant” is how Martin describes his job, and then helpfully explains the image to anyone not grasping it: “You get pissed on by everyone.” This is a favorite line and recurring theme: the put-upon chairman, always being hassled by his easily triggered constituencies.

Check out more from this issue and find your next story to read.

The first time he said this to me, the week before Thanksgiving, the triggered included Martin's own employees. He had been dealing with a staff revolt following his November 12 announcement that the DNC would be ending its generous work-from-home guidelines. Everyone would be expected to return to headquarters full-time, Martin told his staff, starting in February.

This did not go over well. Thumbs-down emoji filled the Zoom screen. Employees pelted Martin with questions. He told me that he sympathized, but observed that most major public- and private-sector organizations had long since compelled their employees to return to their offices.

“If it's unbearable and it's a quality-of-life thing for you, I'm happy to help you find another job,” Martin said he told his staff. The complaints persisted.

“Shocking” and “callous,” the DNC's employee union said of the chairman's directive in a statement to The New York Times.

The squabble underscored how the Democrats can't help but keep playing to a stubborn stereotype—a soft and pampered bunch, unwilling to make the gritty sacrifices (such as getting dressed) necessary to prevail in their “existential” campaign to save democracy.

“The Democrats treat their fucking people like kindergartners,” Sarah Longwell, a former Republican consultant who quit the party over Donald Trump, told me. Longwell can get exasperated by her new allies on the left. When I mentioned the DNC's in-person-work kerfuffle, it set her off.

“Republicans are over here being straight-up mercenaries,” Longwell said. “Democrats give everybody Fridays off and talk about work-life balance.” She apologized for yelling into the phone. Democrats “are not built for when the fascists come,” she concluded.

Martin has invited similar doubts about himself. A former head of the Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party, he won an election in February 2025 for the privilege of leading the divided, despondent, and destitute committee. He barely survived the summer after Politico received a leaked audiotape of a May 15 meeting in which an anguished Martin can be heard describing the toll of his job to DNC officers: “The other night I said to myself for the first time, I don't know if I want to do this anymore.”

But things were looking up. Martin and I were sipping Diet Cokes at the National Democratic Club, next to the DNC headquarters, on the south side of Capitol Hill. The place was bustling, even festive, for a late Monday afternoon. Assorted House members, Hill staffers, Democratic donors, and lobbyist types clustered around tables of drinks and hors d'oeuvres. Representative Gwen Moore of Wisconsin stopped by to say hello to Martin. Others waved as they passed our table, and a few congratulated him. It had been a while since he'd been congratulated for anything.

Despite Martin's rough start in the job, the party's spirits had brightened considerably after November 4, when Democrats scored double-digit wins in the Virginia and New Jersey governor's races. Although both candidates—former House members Abigail Spanberger in Virginia and Mikie Sherrill in New Jersey—had been favored to win, their impressive margins, along with other overperformances by Democrats across the country, were viewed as hopeful signs for the 2026 midterms.

A veteran party apparatchik, Martin arrived in Washington just as Trump was returning to the White House. Even more than during his first go-round, Trump has enjoyed near-unanimous complicity from supine Republican majorities in Congress, as well as meek resistance from a dazed opposition. Martin, 52, is the harried face of this meek resistance.

I had been checking in with him periodically since the summer as part of my attempt to assess how the Democrats had managed to so thoroughly marginalize themselves. No matter how eager they were to resist Trump, they kept living up to their worst image as an overly sensitive, out-of-touch, and terminally online band of myopic and overindulged factions.

Martin himself has a knack for reinforcing these caricatures. Just as I was starting this project, he presided over the DNC's summer meeting in Minneapolis to begin the urgent work of rebuilding the Democratic coalition and making the party palatable to American voters again. Soon after calling the assembly of more than 400 party officials to order, Martin relinquished his mic to a representative of the Saginaw Ojibwe Nation for the DNC's “land acknowledgment” ritual. Switching between English and her tribal language, the Indigenous woman affirmed that Minneapolis had been stolen from its native Dakota Oyate Tribe (“the original stewards of the lands and waters”).

The interlude took only a minute or two but received outsize attention—and ridicule—as an example of how Democrats remain overly concerned with performative pandering to various small identity groups. “It is difficult to imagine more than a handful of people looking out over the current hellscape of U.S. policy and thinking to themselves: You know what we need to be sure to address today? The Dakota War of 1862,” Andrew Egger wrote in The Bulwark.

“What is Ken Martin doing?” the Democrats' crank emeritus, James Carville, wondered aloud on his Politics War Room podcast. It is not the DNC's job to right the well-documented wrongs of American history, Carville said. “It doesn't exist to make people feel good. It exists—get this through your head—to win elections.”

I asked Martin if gestures like land acknowledgments were worth the trouble. He bristled. “I've always felt that it's important to be an inclusive party,” he told me. This suggested that the land acknowledgments would continue.

“We're not going to abandon who we are,” Martin said. “People can call it ‘woke' as much as they want.” He disputed the notion that he was focused on anything other than winning in 2026.

“It's all gas, no brakes,” Martin insisted. And imperative that “we do the work between now and November.”

Although it seems that many people at the DNC would prefer to “do the work” from home.

The DNC's mini-mutiny over the return-to-office mandate ruined the brief elation of the off-year victories. Candidates running for office rely on massive numbers of volunteers, Virginia's now-Governor Spanberger told me. They work their day jobs and then offer up their spare time because they believe in the cause. So it is not a good look for paid party staff to be talking publicly “about how hard it is to go into an office to get paid to do things that campaign workers do in their volunteer time,” Spanberger said.

But perhaps the deeper issue is that Democrats have historically focused too much on keeping their many constituent groups as happy as possible, sometimes at the expense of their principal goal: triumphing in elections so they can implement their policies. “First and foremost, Democrats need to get much more ruthless about winning,” Senator Elissa Slotkin of Michigan told me. This, she said, is not always compatible with the “weird consensus-based leadership” that their leaders tend toward.

As Trump has rampaged Caligula-like through his second term—draping federal buildings with massive likenesses of himself and renaming them in his honor; razing an entire wing of the White House; deploying masked agents to snatch brown-skinned people from sidewalks; running roughshod over constitutional norms, NATO, Minneapolis, and Venezuela alike—rank-and-file Democrats have shown a clear preference for Team Ruthless. Unleash the alpha dogs, they keep saying—the more rabid, the better.

“They want to win so fucking bad,” said Longwell, who has convened hundreds of focus groups across the political spectrum. Democratic leaders and political strategists need to understand that anything that does not lead to winning elections is extraneous, she said. “If you watch the DNC, you still see the pronouns on the name tags and the land acknowledgment at the start, and the voters are like, Get that stuff out of here.”

My assignment was to pick through the Democrats' post-2024 debris. I wanted to see if this once-confident multiracial coalition of working-class men and women could somehow get itself together in time for the midterms. Could the Democrats make themselves a viable alternative to the bumbling but dangerous autocrats on the other side? Are they capable of regaining some measure of power, despite themselves?

I traveled around the country and interviewed about four dozen Democratic candidates, elected officials, party leaders, operatives, and voters I met at rallies, town halls, and other gatherings. What I encountered was a political party on a search: for a winning message; for a fresh identity; for new leaders; for the elusive white knight, whatever that might look like. In the past, saviors have occasionally materialized, but rarely how a broken party imagined them. No one saw Barack Obama coming, sweeping in to define a winning coalition of Democrats in 2008. Nor, for that matter, did anyone envisage Donald Trump doing the same for Republicans eight years later. Fortunes can turn fast.

But Democrats have remained stuck in their funk for an unusually long stretch. For much of 2025, their doldrums felt much worse than the typical rough patch that parties endure after bad election defeats. They were staggered, self-pitying, and seemingly traumatized by the denouement of the Joe Biden years. They have wallowed and feuded.

They have also analyzed themselves to death. If sheer tonnage of voter case studies and white papers could rescue a party, Democrats would be set for years. My inbox overflowed with the latest theories on how Democrats had lost their way and what was needed to revive them. Dueling autopsies were produced by various advocacy groups.

“How Democrats Lost the White House,” from RootsAction, blamed party leaders. “The Working Class Project,” from American Bridge 21st Century, determined that the party's traditional coalition of blue-collar voters has come to “perceive Democrats to be woke, weak, and out-of-touch, too focused on social issues.” “Deciding to Win,” a data-based dissection published by WelcomePAC, argued that as Democrats have moved left on issues such as crime and immigration, self-identified moderates and conservatives have abandoned the party. For good measure, the centrist group Third Way produced “Was It Something I Said?,” a guide to help Democrats avoid speaking “like the extreme, divisive, elitist, and obfuscatory enforcers of wokeness.” It included a handy compendium of 45 words and phrases (dialoguing, microaggression, stakeholders, LGBTQIA+) that the party should not use, because they create “a wall between us and everyday people.”

From the April 2023 issue: George Packer on how banning words won't make the world more just

Of all the autopsy porn I luxuriated in, the most compelling was “How the Democrats Lost America: Making Sense of the 2024 Election and the Future of American Politics,” by Scott Ferson, a longtime Democratic campaign strategist. The exhaustive report—which will be published as a book in April—is based on more than 1,000 interviews that Ferson and his team conducted during the Trump and Biden years.

Ferson argues that in recent decades the Democratic Party has developed an “elitist problem” that has caused it to lose its connection to many Americans. The migration of low-income, non-college-educated voters to the GOP has accelerated: Scores of Black and Latino Americans joined Trump's coalition in 2024. Recent research suggests a significant shift in how voters perceive the parties; more people now believe that Republicans best represent the interests of the poor and working class, while Democrats are coming to be viewed as the party of rich elites. (Ken Martin has called this reversal “a damning indictment” of the Democrats “that's got to change.”) Recent presidential-election trends illustrate this turnabout. In 2012, Mitt Romney carried voters earning more than $100,000 a year by 10 percentage points; in 2024, Kamala Harris won them by four points. In 2012, Obama won voters making less than $50,000 a year by 22 points; in 2024, Trump won those voters by two points.

In his report, Ferson describes conversations he had with people in the districts in and around Canton, Ohio, which have been decimated by plant closures and job losses. “I think the Democrats' message to people in Canton, Ohio, is You should move,” Ferson told me, adding that many Canton residents think Democrats feel superior to them and their hometown. His research also confirmed how effective conservative media have been in reducing Democrats to caricatures. “By the time we knock on their door in Pennsylvania,” Ferson said, quoting a line from the Democratic media consultant Joe Trippi, “we're a pedophile space alien who created AI to take their job away.”

Shortly after Martin became chair, he announced that the DNC would be producing its own report on the lessons of 2024. He purposely called it an “after-action review” and not an autopsy, to emphasize that the party is “not dead.” That was reassuring.

Whatever they're called, the various post-2024 analyses all posed the same unavoidable questions: How had the party lost the working-class voters who were once the backbone of its coalition? Would Democrats be better served by running more moderate candidates to court persuadable swing voters? Or by running more firebrand, populist types, who are better at creating excitement?

The off-year results of 2025 offered something for everyone. “Your task is going to be not to impose litmus tests,” Obama told a room of giddy Democrats during a live Pod Save America podcast a couple of days after the victories. “We had Abigail Spanberger win, and we had Zohran Mamdani win, and they are all part of a vision for the future.” But Spanberger and Mamdani, who won the New York City mayor's race, were well situated culturally and ideologically for the very different electorates they were running in. It is hard to imagine the Democratic Socialist Mamdani winning a statewide race in Virginia.

In October, Democrats nominated Aftyn Behn, a Tennessee state representative and former progressive activist, in a special election for a U.S. House seat in a heavily Republican district in the Nashville area. Behn, who once described herself as a “radical” and campaigned with the very progressive Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, was portrayed by her opponent as extreme. She wound up losing by nearly nine points to the Republican Matt Van Epps. Though Democrats celebrated this as another overperformance (Trump had carried the district by 22 points in 2024), a more moderate candidate, one not nicknamed “AOC of Tennessee,” likely would have done better. “The problem is that the left just is unalterably dedicated to this proposition that if you are more radical, you will turn out more voters,” Matt Bennett, of Third Way, told Politico. “And it keeps being disproven over and over and over.”

But parties are stuck with whomever their voters decide to nominate. “We have to stop acting like we're casting parts in a play,” Spanberger told me. “Like, Oh, this person should run in Virginia, or this person feels like a good Texas Democrat.” Candidates are going to run regardless of whether some political operative or professional opinion-haver thinks they're sabotaging the party's chances. And primary voters tend to vote for the candidate they personally prefer, regardless of whether that candidate has the best chance of winning a general election.

Consider the scenario playing out in Texas, where Representative Jasmine Crockett, an unrestrained liberal media magnet, is running for the Senate seat held by the Republican John Cornyn. Crockett's gift for profane insult comedy aimed at Republicans has made her a celebrated sound-bite warrior on the left. But it is not clear that she would have a better chance of winning in red Texas than State Representative James Talarico, a 36-year-old former seminarian and aspiring minister, whose viral speeches have raised his profile, as well as a stunning amount of cash. Talarico's faith and his relative political moderation could make him more palatable to Texans than Crockett in a general election. In January, an Emerson College poll had Talarico performing slightly better against Cornyn than Crockett in a general-election matchup.

But what if the main divide among Democrats today is not, as so many assume, progressive versus moderate? Slotkin told me that “Is it Mamdani or is it Spanberger? ” is “kind of an outdated approach.” The more consequential split, she said, is between leaders willing “to fight and go on offense” and those content to wait Trump out.

Since Trump's reelection, Democratic voters have shown a strong preference for the former. They've also made it clear that they think their current leaders have been soft and timid. Seventy-one percent of Democrats and 78 percent of all Americans believe that the party has been ineffective in standing up to Trump, according to a June CBS News/YouGov survey. And 62 percent of Democrats say the party needs new leadership, a Reuters/Ipsos poll found, also in June.

If Democratic voters perceive a candidate to be principled and unrelenting, they have been more than willing to look beyond acres of red flags. Graham Platner, a gravelly voiced oyster farmer who is running for Senate in Maine to supplant the Republican forever-incumbent, Susan Collins, offers a case in point: Platner, a political neophyte at 41, spent much of his adult life in the combat thickets of Iraq and Afghanistan before pivoting to mollusks. His campaign started off like gangbusters in August, attracting huge crowds and millions in donations. Reporters flowed to Sullivan, Maine, for an audience with the burly oysterman (just as soon as they were done with the Jesus-loving Democrat in Texas).

“My plan is to just bribe reporters with oysters,” Platner told me as he shucked a few fleshy ones from a cage he'd pulled in. It was a windy morning in early September, and we were out on the white-capped waters of Sullivan Harbor, near Acadia National Park. “Working-class populist” is how Platner described himself. “I'm a small-business owner. And I also own an immense amount of firearms.”

If this was a casting call, Platner nailed it: flannel shirts, weathered caps, a pro wrestler's voice. “I'm a fucking oyster farmer from Sullivan, for God's sake,” he told me at one point, which might as well go on a bumper sticker.

Platner seemed a far more compelling character than Maine's 78-year-old governor, Janet Mills, the candidate preferred by the party establishment. To his excited supporters, Platner might just be the Democrats' perfect populist insurgent for Maine.

Well, maybe not perfect. Okay, not at all perfect.

Like shellfish, political newcomers only stay fresh for so long before they start to smell. Old Reddit posts can surface. Such as the one where the candidate remarked that some white rural Americans were stupid and racist. Or the ones that were homophobic or misogynistic. Or the anti-police one. Platner, who called his Reddit comments “indefensible,” attributed the “dark feelings” reflected in them to his time in the infantry. Chairman Martin called the old posts “hurtful” but not “disqualifying.”

Next came a swell of questions about the large tattoo that Platner had on his chest, a skull and crossbones widely recognized to be a Nazi death's-head. He claimed that he had been ignorant of the insignia's Third Reich associations, and that he had gotten the ink done in Croatia following a drunken night out with his Marine pals in 2007. When the tattoo became a campaign issue, he hastily got it covered over.

It would be nice if Democrats could find a working-class-hero candidate who was not sullied by, say, a Nazi tattoo. But Platner's early support has proved durable. His supporters blame the surfacing of his old comments on a smear campaign engineered by the establishment and the party's rich patrons, who are scared of an unfiltered populist outsider who owes them nothing.

“I think he's running a really good campaign,” Senator Bernie Sanders told me. “It saddens me very much that instead of engaging in a real debate about the future of America, we have some people in the Democratic leadership trying to destroy him.” Sanders said he believes that Platner “stands an excellent chance to be the next senator from Maine.”

As he navigated the choppy waters in his boat, Platner splashed from topic to topic. He talked about the finer points of oyster farming, his love of soccer and of Maine's native osprey, how therapy had saved him after his return from combat, and various other things.

“I do love gays,” he said at one point. (Good to know!) “Somebody asked me where do I stand on LGBTQIA+,” Platner added.

“What does IA+ stand for?” I asked him.

“That's actually a good question.”

Platner said that in an earlier speech, he'd just said “LGBTQ.” After thinking for a moment, he posited that the Q, I, and A stand for “queer, intersex, and androgynous.”

“But what's the plus?” I asked.

“Everything else,” he said.

Platner's broader argument is that although his campaign is focused on the “material conditions that people are living in”—hospital closures, housing shortages, affordability—he is not willing to compromise on social issues at the expense of vulnerable populations. “I don't think there is any value, both morally but also politically, in selling people out,” Platner said.

His aide interjected with a correction: In fact, the A in LGBTQIA+ stands for “asexual,” not “androgynous.” The candidate regretted the error.

“It's asexual, sorry,” Platner said. “It's asexual.”

Though the Democrats may have been buoyed by November's elections, it is hard to overstate how far the party had fallen.

At the start of August, the DNC had $13.9 million cash on hand, compared with $84.3 million for the Republican National Committee. A New York Times analysis found that from 2020 to 2024, Democrats lagged Republicans in new-voter registrations in all 30 states that track registrations by party. Polls kept drawing a bleak picture of the party's popularity. Over the summer, Gallup measured the party's approval rating at 34 percent, its lowest point since Gallup began tracking partisan approval ratings, in 1992; a Wall Street Journal poll had the Democrats at 33 percent approval; a CNN poll put their approval rating at a wretched 28 percent.

Representative Jason Crow of Colorado, who co-leads the Democrats' candidate-recruiting efforts for the House, told me Democrats need to project confidence in their policy positions: “People respond to confidence, and they respond to strength.” But because Trump and the Republicans have been so effective in slapping extreme liberal caricatures on their opponents, Democrats are gun-shy. “We can't be apologetic for our own positions, and second-guessing ourselves, and being weak and timid about it,” Crow said.

“I've never seen the party so unsure of itself, and so kind of lacking its own footing,” Colin Allred, the former NFL player and representative from Texas who lost the 2024 Senate race to Ted Cruz, told me. Allred, who is running for a Dallas-area House seat, described the state of the Democratic Party's brand as “terrible.”

“We are living through hell right now, let's be honest,” Mallory McMorrow, a Democratic candidate for U.S. Senate in Michigan, told me. But McMorrow, a 39-year-old state senator and former bartender, sounded oddly buoyant, perhaps because she sees the 2026 midterm campaigns as a chance to clear out the old bones of the party establishment. The party “has not been prepared for this moment,” McMorrow said. “It is inexcusable to go on national television and say things like ‘Well, Democrats aren't in charge right now, so we can't do anything.' Why would anybody vote for you?”

And yet, despite the Democrats' abysmal approval ratings—and their repeated, self-parodying demonstrations of why they might deserve them—voters have shown a consistent preference for them in recent months. Since Trump took office, Democrats have flipped 25 state legislative seats that had been held by Republicans, while Republicans have flipped zero seats held by Democrats. For all their dysfunction and malaise, Democrats have this key dynamic going for them: The party in power tends to overreach, mess up, and then take most of the blame when voters get cranky. This is a far more reliable blueprint for a party's resurrection than anything drawn up at a think tank.

True to form, voters have overwhelmingly blamed Republicans for what they see as a gloomy state of national affairs. Americans broadly disapprove of how Trump has handled the economy, immigration, and the cost of living—the three issues most responsible for putting him back in the White House. The Republican policy agenda has proved disastrously unpopular: A November Gallup poll put Trump's approval rating at 36 percent, a low for his second term, and at just 25 percent among independents.

But none of this should be confused with a national wave of love for the opposition party. On the contrary, Democrats in Congress scored a particularly dismal 18 percent approval rating in a Quinnipiac University poll released in mid-December, a record low.

Yet the DNC apparently prefers to tune this out. The day after the Quinnipiac poll was published, Martin announced that the committee's deep-dive review of the 2024 debacle would not be released after all. In other words, while the Democratic brand continued to flatline, the autopsy itself was declared dead in the cradle—this despite DNC officials having conducted more than 300 interviews and Martin having previously called the autopsy a crucial exercise.

I'd spoken with several Democratic politicians and operatives who hoped that the memorandum, which would benefit from the DNC's resources and access to party officials, could be an important addition to the canon of wonkery. It could help determine, for instance, which candidate profiles would work best in certain districts and states, how much blame Joe Biden deserved for 2024, and what, if anything, Kamala Harris could have done differently. But what the DNC essentially declared at the end of 2025 was Never mind. Releasing the DNC report, Martin suggests, would distract from the party's work. Martin also seemed intent on cramming as many buzz phrases (and banned words) as possible into his official statement about the decision to scuttle the project: “In our conversations with stakeholders from across the Democratic ecosystem, we are aligned on what's important, and that's learning from the past and winning the future.” He continued, “Here's our North Star: does this help us win? If the answer is no, it's a distraction from the core mission.”

Here is Martin's north star, based on his first year at the DNC: proceed with extreme caution and commit no microaggressions.

Read: Democrats can't stop talking about their problems

Martin's decision to bury the DNC's findings invited suspicion and derision. Simon Bazelon, the lead author on the “Deciding to Win” project, told The New York Times that the aborted autopsy is sadly consistent with the Democratic leadership's general penchant for complacency, risk aversion, and avoidance.

“It's reflective of a broader problem within the party,” Bazelon said. “We are scared of ever making anybody in our coalition upset.”

“Democrats are pussies.” 

Senator Ruben Gallego of Arizona was on the phone, and I was telling him what I kept hearing about his party. Gallego, a former Marine and an Iraq War veteran, did not disagree. This was no surprise, because he has cultivated a reputation for bluntness, and the media have held him up as the Democrats' ambassador to the regular-bro types who supported Trump by large margins.

During his winning Senate campaign in 2024, Gallego held events in boxing gyms and touted the appeal of a “big-ass truck” (apparently his attempt to buck the perception that Democrats drive only puny-ass Priuses and Jettas). Gallego is confident that none of the pejoratives affixed to Democrats—weak, feckless, timid—applies to him.

“I just called the president an idiot on national TV, so I'm not exactly the person to talk about it,” he told me.

Gallego, who is 46, prevailed in his Senate race despite a rough performance by Democrats nationally. Latino men supported him by 30 points, despite Trump carrying about half that group across the country. Everyone was asking who the Trump-Gallego voters in Arizona were, Gallego said. “A lot of them were just men who said, ‘Ruben Gallego is a fighter.' ”

Or, not a pussy.

I intentionally used that word because I'd heard so many others use it to describe Democrats, typically while conveying how impotent their elected leaders have been in standing up to Trump's serial abuses. “Yes, exactly, I totally agree,” Gallego said. But he was hesitant to be quoted using that word specifically, and he asked to go off the record.

Back on the record, Gallego told me he'd won in Arizona because those Trump-Gallego voters said, “Ruben is not a wussy like these other Democrats.” One could see why a politician would not want to utter pussy on the record, given its crass anatomical connotation (Gallego wussed out). These are sensitive times, after all, even for big-ass-truck-loving fight-fans.

Being a Democrat can be exhausting sometimes. So many considerations, so many shifting sensitivities and cancelable offenses.

Trump's steamrolling of anything, including the Constitution, that might impede his authoritarian project has made the limpness of the Democratic opposition more conspicuous.

“What we've allowed to become normalized is completely deviant,” California Governor Gavin Newsom told me in the fall. “This is code red.” Newsom said that although he longs for the “When they go low, we go high shit,” this is no time for the usual political bromides and tactics. Democrats need to go beyond writing a concerned “op-ed that lands in The New York Times,” he added, which “we can retweet—to the 12 of us—and say how proud we are about our prose.”

Newsom said the Democrats need to get out of their own heads and enclaves and start acting with a desperation commensurate with the moment. If the Democratic Party remains weak, “we will get rolled,” Newsom said. “Weakness is the toxicity of our brand.”

Among nationally known Democrats, it is Newsom's political standing that may have risen the most amid the dark Trumpian doings of 2025. The governor's willingness to mock the president through aggressive social-media parody elevated him to de facto resistance leader. Given voter impatience with wimpy party leaders, a righteous showdown with Trump is not a bad situation for an ambitious Democrat to be in. Newsom was also willing, at great risk to himself politically, to counter GOP efforts to gerrymander red-state House districts. He blew up California's nonpartisan redistricting laws and led a successful ballot initiative to redraw the state congressional map to favor the Democrats.

As I spoke with Newsom, I realized that pretty much everything he said was some variation of “Desperate times call for desperate measures.” Conversations with him on this topic tend to be a bacchanal of profanity and exasperation. “Wake the fuck up; wake the fuck up,” he kept saying. “This thing is being torn down.”

Newsom's aggressive trolling of Trump has helped combat the long-standing view of him as a slick opportunist and has won him new admirers. “When people see someone fighting, they get really, really excited, and when they see someone folding, they get really, really demoralized,” Beto O'Rourke, the former representative from Texas and onetime presidential candidate, told me. “Gavin Newsom, who frankly I just wasn't necessarily a big fan of before, I'm a big fan of right now. That guy's a fighter.”

There's a need for fighters, O'Rourke said, because Trump is now a “cornered animal”—one that happens to be “the most powerful animal in the country, who controls the House, the Senate, the White House, the Supreme Court, the National Guard, and has a secretary of defense who is in concert with him on using American cities as the training grounds for the military. So this is some dark stuff.”

I couldn't help noticing that O'Rourke's voice acquired a kind of dreamy cadence as he described the darkness. Nothing like a potential Armageddon for American democracy to get a graying former golden boy—he is now 53—excited. “It's also this extraordinary moment,” O'Rourke continued, “where all of us who are alive today get this chance to save the country. We're going to be tested in a way I don't think you and I can even imagine.”

One recurring resentment among Democratic voters is the disconnect between the party's red-alert anti-Trump rhetoric and the musty vehicles—Biden and Harris, as well as Hakeem Jeffries, Chuck Schumer, and the various other dust-gatherers—it keeps deploying to resist him. “People continue to say, ‘Oh my God, Trump is an authoritarian; the world's going to end,' all this stuff,” David Hogg, the 25-year-old gun-control activist and advocate for recruiting young progressive leaders, told me over the summer. Hogg, who had a brief and tumultuous stint as a DNC co–vice chair in early 2025, is contemptuous of the party's lingering cohort of elder leaders.

“It's like, ‘Okay, look who your members of Congress are: Some of them literally cannot stand for a press conference,' ” he said. “You cannot credibly tell the American people that democracy is in danger and the world is ending, and the people that you are putting up on the front lines of fighting back against that genuinely belong in a nursing home.”

On that note, I headed to a Bernie Sanders rally.

“We are living in a moment that is unprecedented in the modern history of this country,” Sanders roared. The socialist senator from Vermont was speaking to a packed theater of about 3,000 people in Wheeling, West Virginia. “We have got to act in an unprecedented way in response.”

Sanders, who turned 84 in September, seems to have earned immunity from the party's anti-gerontocratic agitators. When I saw him this past summer, he was making a stop on the Fighting Oligarchy tour, which has consistently drawn fiery hordes across the country. At times, he's been joined by Democratic Socialists of America luminaries such as Mamdani and Ocasio-Cortez. The three of them filled a stadium in Queens for a raucous rally in October, which featured chants of “Tax the rich.” Two of the Senate candidates drawing the most enthusiasm from the left—Platner in Maine and Abdul El-Sayed in Michigan—are Sanders acolytes.

These days, the far left is attracting a lot of the party's money, media attention, and crowds. But whether this energy on the left represents the Democrats' path to restoration or to electoral doom depends on whom you ask (or which white paper you read). A remarkable 66 percent of Democrats say they have a positive view of socialism, compared with only 42 percent for capitalism, according to an August Gallup poll.

Sanders strolled onstage in Wheeling to protracted applause and chants of “Bernie!” “I was told that West Virginia was a conservative state,” Sanders said as he hunched over a small podium. It was certainly a Trump state: The president won 70 percent of the vote there in 2024, his second-biggest margin in the country, behind Wyoming.

But West Virginia is a proletarian locale that until not long ago was a Democratic stronghold. Bill Clinton carried it twice in the '90s; in 1988, it was one of the 10 states that Massachusetts Governor Michael Dukakis won in his otherwise thumping defeat at the hands of the patrician George H. W. Bush.

“We are losing working-class voters—the core of our coalition since the New Deal—to a corrupt billionaire with a gold toilet,” Dan Pfeiffer, a former top Obama adviser, wrote in his Message Box newsletter. A critical mass of working-class voters has deemed said gold-toilet user to be their kind of tough; they like that he professes to fight for them, and they don't care that he fights dirty.

A lot of working-class voters prefer Trump, Graham Platner told me, because they believe he intuitively understands that they feel screwed by the world, just as Trump—the billionaire president—himself does. But running against a “rigged deal” was once the main Democratic message. Sanders had been delivering it for decades before Trump came along; the Fighting Oligarchy speeches are essentially the same ones Sanders has been giving for five decades. What's happening in America today, Sanders declared, with several million working-class people at risk of losing their health care, is an acceleration of what has gone on for half a century: Life gets better and better for the wealthiest Americans—and worse for everyone else.

“You know what happens when people can't go to a doctor when they need to?” Sanders asked the crowd.

“They die!” the crowd responded.

Keep hope alive this is not. But the audience was on its feet and in full frenzy as Sanders revved up his rhetorical bus and set his sights on … Kamala Harris. Why had she lost?

“One of the reasons,” Sanders said, “is she had too many billionaires telling her not to speak up for the working class of this country.”

The line drew the loudest cheer of the evening.

A big thing for Democratic politicians these days is to swear a lot, as if by appearing pissed off and profane, they will show how raw and real they are. Since February 2025, they have sworn more often than their Republican counterparts, according to a Washington Post analysis of social-media posts and public remarks. (The big wins, they just keep piling up for the Democrats.)

One detects in this penchant for profanity a whiff of overcompensation—an effort by Democrats to prove that they can talk working-class. Ken Martin says that the party needs to stop being so cautious. “The problem we have as Democrats is we throw a punch, and then we pull it back,” he told me. “We don't want to get canceled by someone in our party.” I was eager to test this proposition, given that Martin is steeped in the cautious language of the Democratic big tent; God forbid he ever utter something hurtful or make someone feel (double God forbid ) unsafe or triggered.

So I asked Martin: What about Biden? Specifically, his fiasco of a presidential campaign. Didn't he wait too long to bow out, and wasn't it dumb for him to have run in the first place?

“It's an academic exercise,” Martin said, ducking the question. “Do you have a time machine?”

I do not.

“The point is,” Martin continued, “we don't know for sure whether he should've or shouldn't have, and we can't change it.”

“He was too old,” I said.

“What I'm interested in are things that will inform the next election.”

A few minutes later, Martin was back to talking tough about the importance of speaking freely and not caring about whom he antagonizes.

“I don't give a fuck who I offend,” Martin declared.

Except Biden, I noted.

“Listen, that has nothing to do with offending him or not,” Martin said. He reiterated that he is not in his job for glory. “All you do is get pissed on all the time,” he reminded me.

I was struck by how often Biden came up in my conversations with Democrats around the country. Specifically, people mentioned that his refusal to step away despite his obvious decline—and the refusal of Democratic leaders to acknowledge this decline until it was too obvious to ignore—was a betrayal that the party has yet to reckon with or recover from. “If their line was As long as the president's not senile—I just have a higher bar than that,” James Talarico said.

“When you tell people that the thing that they are seeing isn't true,” Graham Platner said, “they're going to stop fucking believing you. Because you're obviously lying.”

The lie has become a proxy for distrust of Democratic leaders on issues across the board. It's a big reason Democrats have lost significant ground with a constituency that was once solidly theirs—the youth vote. “When we told them the president is too old, they told us, ‘No, he's not; look how strong he is,' ” David Hogg told me.

To his supporters, Trump approximates what “strong” looks like and what a “man” looks like (and even what a “strongman” looks like). Despite his constant whining and incessant lies, Trump embodies for his base blunt honesty and brutish masculinity.

Let's pause for a second to appreciate the richness of the irony here: Nearly every elected Republican in Washington who is not named Trump has allowed himself or herself to be effectively neutered by him. Republican “leaders” might fashion themselves as a pack of alpha dogs, but in fact they have proved themselves to be a pack of panting poodles. “They love to call us cucks,” Ken Casey, the lead singer and bassist for the punk band the Dropkick Murphys, told The Atlantic this past summer. “Which I find ironic because there's a good portion of MAGA that would probably step aside and let Donald Trump have their way with their significant other if he asked.”

Ruben Gallego said that “if I was bullied as much as these Republicans are by President Trump and his followers, I would be so ashamed to see my family.”

The gap between how Trump is perceived by some Republicans (strong and confident) and his actual persona (overwrought and histrionic) is large. “He has built this sort of whole infrastructure around assuaging an insecurity that he has,” Abdul El‑Sayed, the Senate candidate from Michigan, told me. “He is so fragile that he builds this simulacrum of strength.”

I asked El‑Sayed what he meant by that. “It looks strong, and it's enforced by other people thinking it's strong,” he explained. “But if you actually got in a physical fight with Donald Trump, you'd kick his ass.”

For the record, El‑Sayed, who is 41, looks like he could kick most people's asses, certainly mine. A former high-school wrestler and football player, he attended the University of Michigan, and then Oxford on a Rhodes Scholarship; he was later appointed executive director of Detroit's health department. He ran for governor in 2018, losing in the Democratic primary to the eventual winner, Gretchen Whitmer.

We were sitting in a café not far from El‑Sayed's home in Ann Arbor. Fresh from his Saturday-morning workout, beads of sweat on his forehead and massive arms bulging through a tight black T-shirt, he was sipping a weird energy concoction containing espresso and wheat germ or something. El‑Sayed speaks bluntly about the need for a more muscular Democratic Party that fights harder, shows less mercy, and refuses to cede “masculinity” to the cartoonish version modeled by a president who plans to host an Ultimate Fighting Championship bout next summer at the White House. “If they go low, we don't go high,” El‑Sayed told the crowd at a rally with Sanders that day in Kalamazoo. “We take 'em to the mud and choke 'em out.”

El‑Sayed is one of the many Democratic candidates and officials I spoke with who readily acknowledged that their party has been actively, albeit inadvertently, repelling men. “Every time you heard the word masculinity in Democratic spaces, it was always preceded by a particular adjective—toxic,” he said. “And if you condemn a whole group of people as toxic, don't expect them to be like, Yeah, I want to be part of that.”

“When we say ‘The future is female,' I get where that's coming from,” Talarico told me. “But to a young guy, that kind of sounds like the future is not for them.”

It was the middle of October, and Talarico and I were talking in the lobby bar of a hotel in Arlington, Texas. Part of his political momentum has been grounded in novelty—Look, Democrats have found a guy they think can talk to Christians in Texas—but Talarico is legitimately talented. Even though he is in many ways more moderate than his primary opponent, Jasmine Crockett, if Talarico wins the nomination, Republicans will inevitably do what they've become so adept at: turn him into a one-dimensional embodiment of a radical Democrat and make the race a referendum on “woke” pronouns, DEI, and transgender issues.

Talarico might be especially vulnerable to this because of a remark he made in 2021, during a legislative debate. “God is nonbinary,” Talarico said, in a video clip that resurfaced this past fall. (Josh Barro, a political commentator who left the Republican Party in 2016 and is now a centrist Democrat, promptly weighed in with a Substack essay titled “The First Step to Winning Back the Senate: Don't Nominate Anyone Who Said ‘God Is Non-Binary.' ”)

When I mentioned to Talarico that statements such as “God is nonbinary” could present a problem for him, he said he thinks Republicans would have a much harder time turning his race into a referendum on divisive cultural issues in the way they did in 2024, because the dominant issues of 2026 will be the economy and the cost of living. “We're always focused on what happened in the last election,” Talarico said. Especially, he noted, the stream of out-of-town reporters in their shiny new cowboy boots. Talarico said he can predict what the national press is going to ask: “It's trans athletes, the ‘God is nonbinary' thing.” (I felt seen. Or exposed.)

Focusing on cultural issues would be akin to “fighting the last war,” Talarico concluded, perhaps wishfully. But Spanberger's campaign in Virginia last year provided validation for this. More than half of Republican ad money in her race was spent on anti-trans themes. “The attack ads were trying to do some sort of othering, right?” Spanberger told me. “It worked with Harris, and so then they presumed it could work with me.”

It didn't. Spanberger figured—correctly—that every ad Republicans ran “talking about a bathroom, or trying to vilify kids, was a moment that they weren't talking about the economy.” A poll conducted in the final weeks of the campaign found that transgender issues in schools were the top concern for only 4 percent of voters.

Talarico argued that Democrats should not curse the uncertainty they have endured, or treat this period as pointless. “There's an opportunity here to redefine the Democratic Party,” he told me. “And you can't do that if the brand is super set, or if there's a strong leader at the top of the party.” This, he said, should excite anyone who wants to see the party grow and evolve. “The wilderness is where new ideas and new leaders and new movements come forth.”

As Talarico and I talked, a woman from the hotel front desk approached our table to warn us that a coyote had been spotted on the patio earlier. She showed us a picture of the creature on her phone, and we assured her that we would be careful.

Talarico remarked that the nasty interloper would provide good color for my story, and then recalled the time that former Governor Rick Perry had encountered a coyote while running outside Austin—and shot it dead.

“He jogs with a gun” was Talarico's takeaway.

You never know what you'll come across in the wilderness.

Although quantifying morale and momentum is hard, by the end of 2025, the Democrats were enjoying an upturn in both. Their message felt more focused, and their resolve stronger, than it had in a long time. Those off-year election wins helped, and so did Trump's ongoing obfuscation of the Jeffrey Epstein files, which gave Democrats a righteous fight to engage in.

The president helped by continually serving up gold-plated symbolism: He demolished the East Wing of the White House so he could build a $400 million ballroom, and threw a Great Gatsby–themed party at Mar-a-Lago in the midst of a protracted government-shutdown fight that jeopardized health-care subsidies and SNAP benefits for tens of millions of Americans.

At the same time, Trump's National Guard deployments and immigration-enforcement offensives in Democratic-run cities became more aggressive—and more unpopular. Social media served up a daily video deluge of heavily armed agents randomly manhandling dark-skinned people. Opposition to these incursions catalyzed a more determined resistance than Democrats had shown before. Trump's approval ratings on immigration, which had been his strongest issue, have tanked.

In early November, I traveled to Chicago, the first midwestern blue city Trump had targeted for his immigration crackdowns. J. B. Pritzker, the Illinois governor and a potential Democratic presidential candidate in 2028, found himself in an ongoing Chicago beef with federal authorities, trying to serve as resistance leader against Trump while keeping a volatile situation from exploding in America's third-largest city.

The president had recently called for Pritzker to be jailed—a status symbol among high-profile Democratic governors who might run for president. (Pritzker and Gavin Newsom could wind up sharing both a jail cell and a debate stage.) I visited him on a sparkling fall day in Chicago. Or, as Trump called it, a “war zone” and “the most dangerous city in the world.”

Read: J. B. Pritzker's dark visions

At the time we spoke, Pritzker had been urging citizens to blow whistles when they saw federal agents in the area so potential targets could flee. (Really? I thought. Has it come to this? ) He was spending his days fielding insults from the president (the sturdy governor endured a lot of fat jokes) while suggesting that Trump himself was “suffering dementia.”

A former venture capitalist and an heir to the Hyatt-hotels fortune, Pritzker kept spitting out dire admonitions. He predicted that the presence of Trump-controlled security forces in Chicago and other cities might foreshadow federal tampering with the 2026 elections. “I think that all the pieces of something nefarious seem to be occurring, and I'm just putting the pieces together,” Pritzker said. “I'm hopeful I'm wrong, but I don't think we can assume that I'm wrong.”

He was disappointed that it had taken so long for a robust resistance to Trump to coalesce. “My complaint is not about regular folks,” Pritzker said. “What I've been frustrated by is people who hold leadership positions. And I'm not talking about elected Democrats only. I'm talking about CEOs of companies. I'm talking about boards of universities. I'm talking about people who have influence, who have the ability to stand up, but are afraid.”

Pritzker talks a lot about Nazis. He does not hesitate to compare Trump's authoritarian gambits to the rise of the Third Reich. A descendant of Jewish refugees whose family fled Ukrainian pogroms, Pritzker was talking like this even before the Chicago raids. In February 2025, he gave a speech about how “it took 53 days for the Nazis to tear down a constitutional republic,” he told me. “Authoritarianism happens fast.”

Pritzker is a billionaire—not exactly a beloved species among Democrats these days. Other than Trump and his court-flatterers, billionaires are probably the most agreed-upon class of boogeyman that Democrats have. In his 2018 run for governor, Pritzker said, one challenge was “overcoming” that.

“Overcoming being a billionaire?” I asked.

This seemed to irritate him. “In a Democratic primary,” he said, yes. He asked me to consider the challenges he'd surmounted in running for governor two years after Bernie Sanders had gotten half the vote in the Illinois Democratic primary with a “Billionaires are evil” message. Pritzker had weathered his billionaire status to defeat Republican Governor Bruce Rauner. If he ran for president in 2028, Pritzker said, he would have to face that “obstacle.”

Pritzker said he's proud of the fact that many of Sanders's 2016 supporters in Illinois have become strong supporters of his, despite his wealth. Like Newsom, Pritzker exemplifies how using competence and combativeness against Trump plays well with constituents—and can wipe out all kinds of political deficiencies.

While in town, I stayed at the Hilton Chicago, a 1,544-room landmark, built in 1927, on South Michigan Avenue. The hotel overlooks Grant Park. The last time I'd been there was 2008, when I covered Obama's Election Night rally, one of the most unforgettable experiences of my career. The wholesome pride in Chicago was palpable that night: hometown pride and American pride, as well as a strong sense—or illusion, it turned out—of national unity. The Ethiopian cabdriver who drove me to O'Hare the next morning kept bursting into tears because, he said, he never expected that the people of his adopted country would elect a Black president.

Obama's ascendancy that night also represented a 21st-century high point for the Democratic Party. Hope, change, all of those things. (As well as the racial backlash, prominently abetted by Trump.) That was a long time ago, and feels longer. The arc of the moral universe is complicated.

My last stop on the tour was a café in Toledo, Ohio, about two weeks before Christmas. Former Democratic Senator Sherrod Brown was hosting a roundtable featuring seven Ohioans sharing stories about the financial pain that bloated health-care costs had inflicted on their families, compelling them to scale back their medical care.

One after another, the participants described, at times tearfully, how their struggles had been exacerbated by the Trump administration's policies, especially the so-called big, beautiful bill that Republicans passed over the summer.

This was a classic Democratic campaign event, centered on the party's most solid policy terrain—health care. It was also classic Sherrod Brown, a now-rare breed of working-class progressive who had managed to get himself elected three times to the Senate and seven times to the House, in a state that veered to the right during the Trump years. Brown, 73, finally saw his luck run out in 2024, when he lost his campaign for a fourth term to Bernie Moreno, a MAGA disciple.

When he lost, he assumed that his political career was over. “I really was not going to do this again. My wife didn't want me to do it again, and my kids didn't want me to do it again,” he told me. But when Trump returned to office and started wreaking even more havoc than he had in his first term, Brown saw an opening. He is now running for a seat held by a Republican incumbent, Jon Husted. “I'm going to win this race because the state is so different,” he said.

“Different from what?” I asked.

“Different from what it was last year,” Brown said, when Trump 2.0 was more popular, the Democrats were a mess, and it looked like Brown's brand of nuts-and-bolts liberal politics was cooked. Now Trump is so much less popular that the abiding Democratic disarray might not matter.

I wanted to end this journey with Brown because he is not flashy or a media magnet or a handwringer or (bless the man) someone who gets hung up on white papers about why Democrats are adrift. He is simply seizing an opportunity the Republicans have handed him: Large majorities of voters are losing patience with Trump.

Last year, James Carville was criticized in some circles for his argument that Democrats would be best served by staying out of the way, suppressing their penchant for self-harm, and simply waiting for Trump and the Republicans to self-immolate. Which is essentially what they've done. Carville's theory was and remains controversial—his critics point to the lasting damage Trump has inflicted everywhere since his rapacious return to office while the Democrats have looked on haplessly. But as the 2026 midterms approach, Carville's advice seems likely to be vindicated.

Essentially: Do no harm, strive to remain at least in the ballpark of “normal,” and bank on one huge built-in advantage—opposition parties typically do well in midterms. Also, the past 10 years have shown repeatedly that Republicans vote far less reliably when Trump is not on the ballot. Finally, for all the blundering, there remain just two viable political parties in the United States, and the Democrats are still one of them, despite themselves. No party wants to “lose America,” as the white papers put it. But when the other side is destroying it, there are worse things to be than the alternative.

You've become more replaceable.

It's February 2020 again.

An exponential process is in motion — one that will inevitably shake the world to its core — and upend our economy, politics, and social lives. Yet most people are still going about their business, oblivious as dinosaurs to a descending asteroid.

This is what many in and around the AI industry believe, anyway.

Except, in this telling, the invisible force that's about to change our world isn't a virus that will rip through the population and then ebb. Rather, it is an information technology that will irreversibly transform (if not extinguish) white-collar labor, accelerate scientific progress, destabilize political systems, and, perhaps, get us all killed.

Of course, such apocalyptic chatter has always hummed in the background of the AI discourse. But it's grown much louder in recent weeks.

This week, Matt Shumer, the CEO of HyperWrite, an AI productivity company, published a viral essay arguing that we're on the cusp of “something much, much bigger than COVID.” Over the past year, Shumer wrote, tech workers had watched AI go from “helpful tool” to “does my job better than I do” — and that “is the experience everyone else is about to have.”

Meanwhile, SemiAnalysis, a prominent chip industry trade publication, declared last Thursday that AI progress had hit an “inflection point.” At Cisco Systems' AI summit that same week, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman declared, “this is the first time I felt another ChatGPT moment — a clear glimpse into the future of knowledge work.” Not long before these remarks, Altman's rival, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei, wrote that recent breakthroughs had made it clear that we are only “a few years” away from the point when “AI is better than humans at essentially everything.” In a succinct summary of the tech-savvy's new zeitgeist, the effective altruist writer Andy Masley posted on X, “I know everyone's saying it's feeling a lot like February 2020 but it is feeling a lot like February 2020.”

Critically, tech pundits and executives aren't alone in thinking that something just changed. In recent weeks, software firms saw their stock prices plunge, as traders decided that AI would soon render many of them obsolete.

• AI “agents” like Claude Code can autonomously complete complex projects — not just answer questions — making them potential substitutes for skilled workers.• Investors are now treating agentic AI as an existential threat to many incumbent software and consulting firms.• If AI's capabilities keep improving at an exponential rate, things could get really weird by 2027.

Not long ago, the conventional wisdom around AI's near-term effects sounded radically different. For much of last year, industry analysts and journalists warned that AI had become a bubble ripe for popping.

After all, major labs' capital expenditures were far outpacing their earnings; OpenAI alone was slated to invest $1.4 trillion in infrastructure over the ensuing eight years, even as it collected only $20 billion in annual recurring revenue. These gargantuan investments would only pay off if demand for AI services skyrocketed.

And the technology's commercial potential looked uncertain. Even as venture capitalists waxed rhapsodic about AI's transformative powers, official economic data showed its impacts on productivity and employment were marginal, at best.

So, what changed? Why do so many investors, entrepreneurs, and analysts — including some who'd subscribed to the “AI bubble” thesis mere months ago — now believe that artificial intelligence is living up to its hype?

The answer, in three words, is the “agentic” revolution.

Until recently, public-facing AI systems were fundamentally passive. You typed a question to ChatGPT and the robot replied, then awaited your next instruction. The experience was a bit like texting with an infinitely vast and sycophantic encyclopedia — one that could streamline your presentation, fix your code, diagnose your rash, or validate your belief that a malevolent cabal had implanted a camera in your mother's printer.

These chatbots had real economic utility. But they also had strict limitations. Gemini could draft your email, but it couldn't send it. Claude could generate code, but it could not run it, see what broke, revise the program, and then give it another shot.

In other words, the chatbots could automate tasks but not complex, time-intensive projects. To complete the latter, they needed a human to hold their figurative hands and issue instructions at each step in the process.

Then, last year, commercially viable AI agents hit the market.

These new systems are more autonomous and dynamic than their predecessors. Rather than answering one discrete prompt and then awaiting further orders, Claude Code or OpenAI's Codex receives a broad objective — such as “detect and fix the bug that's crashing our app” or “monitor regulatory filings and flag anything relevant to our business” or “make a 3d flying game” — and then figures out how to achieve its mission.

Put differently, these AIs function less like souped-up search engines and more like junior staffers. They can independently decide which steps to take next, utilize tools (like code editors, spreadsheets, or company databases), test whether their plan worked, try another approach if it fails, and continue iterating until its job is done.

This is what the big labs had long promised but failed to deliver: Machines that could not only complement high-skilled workers but — at least in some cases — dramatically outperform them.

Over the course of 2025, AI agents only grew more capable. By year's end, awareness of the tools' power had broken containment: Influencers with no engineering skills realized they could “vibe code” entire websites, apps, and games.

This month, CNBC provided a particularly vivid illustration of the new systems' transformative potential. Two of the outlet's journalists — each without any coding experience — set out to build a competitor to Monday.com, a project management platform then valued at $5 billion. They told Claude Code to research Monday, identify its primary features, and recreate them. Within an hour, they had built a functional replacement for the firm's software. Since CNBC's story published last week, Monday's stock price has fallen by roughly 20 percent.

So, this is one reason why many technologists and commentators are predicting massive, near-term AI-induced disruption: Even if AI progress stopped today, the adoption of existing systems would abruptly devalue many businesses and white-collar workers.

As SemiAnalysis put the latter point:

One developer with Claude Code can now do what took a team a month.

The cost of Claude Pro or ChatGPT is $20 dollars a month, while a Max subscription is $200 dollars respectively. The median US knowledge worker costs ~350-500 dollars a day fully loaded. An agent that handles even a fraction of their workflow a day at ~6-7 dollars is a 10-30x ROI not including improvement in intelligence.

What's more, as Monday.com recently discovered, it isn't just the knowledge economy's workers who are at risk of displacement. At first, investors had largely assumed that AI agents would benefit incumbent software companies and consulting firms by increasing their productivity: They would now be able to roll out more apps and audits with fewer workers.

But in recent weeks, many traders realized that agentic AI could just easily render such businesses irrelevant: Why pay Gartner for a research report — or Asana for work management software — when Claude Code can provide you both at a fraction of the cost? Such reasoning has led to a selloff in software and consulting stocks, with Gartner and Asana each shedding more than one-third of their value over the past month.

At the same time, AI agents have eased Wall Street's fears of an artificial-intelligence bubble: The idea that demand is poised to soar for Claude, ChatGPT, and Gemini — and the data centers that support them — seems less far-fetched than it did six months ago.

Still, the primary driver of Silicon Valley's millenarian rhetoric isn't agentic AI's existing capacities, but rather, its prospective future abilities.

No companies are embracing AI agents more vigorously than the top labs themselves. Engineers at Anthropic and OpenAI have said that nearly 100 percent of their code is now AI-generated.

To some, this suggests that AI progress won't proceed in a steady march so much as a chain reaction: As AI agents build their own successors, each advance will accelerate the next — triggering a self-reinforcing feedback loop in which innovation compounds on itself.

By some measures, AI's capacities are already growing exponentially. METR, a nonprofit artificial-intelligence research organization, gauges AI performance by measuring the length of coding tasks that models can complete with 50 percent success. It finds that this length has been doubling every 7 months.

The human mind struggles to internalize the implications of exponential change. At the start of March 2020, COVID cases were doubling every two-to-three days in the US. Yet the absolute number of cases remained tiny at the start of the month; on March 1, there were only about 60 confirmed cases in the whole country. Many Americans were therefore caught aware when, by April 1, more than 200,000 of their compatriots were struck ill by the virus.

Those bullish on AI progress believe Americans are once again sleeping on the speed and scale of what's to come. In this view, as impressive as AI agents' current capabilities are, they'll pale in comparison to those at the fingertips of everyone with an internet connection this December. As with the pandemic, the full consequences of an instant industrial revolution are bound to be both immense and unforeseeable.

There's little question that agentic AI is going to reshape the white-collar economy. Whether it has brought us to the cusp of a brave new world, however, is less certain.

There are many reasons to think that AI's near-term impacts will be smaller and slower than Silicon Valley's bulls (and catastrophists) now believe.

First, AI still makes mistakes. And this fallibility arguably constrains its potential for replacing human workers in the here and now. An autonomous agent might be able to execute the right trade, send the desired email, and replace the errant line of code nine times out of 10. If that other time it stakes all your firm's capital on Dogecoin, tells off your top client, and introduces a security vulnerability into your app, however, you're probably gonna retain a lot of human supervision over your highest-stakes projects.

Second, institutional inertia tends to slow the adoption of new technologies. Although generators became common in the late 19th century, it took decades for factories to reorganize around electric power. Similarly, while tech firms may have little trouble integrating agentic AI into their workflows, legacy corporations may take longer to adjust. And in some key sectors — such as healthcare and law — regulations may further constrain AI deployment.

Most critically, it's not clear whether AI's capabilities will continue growing exponentially. Plenty of past technologies enjoyed compounding returns for a while, only to plateau.

Nevertheless, the bulls' case has gotten stronger. Today's AI systems are already powerful enough to transform many industries. And tomorrow's will surely be even more capable. If celebrations of the singularity are premature, preparations for something like it are now overdue.

How election officials are thinking about Trump's threat to the midterms.

President Donald Trump seemingly cannot let the 2020 election go. Despite winning convincingly in 2024, including, for the first time in his political career, the popular vote, he remains fixated on the idea that he also won four years prior, against former President Joe Biden.

Now, a year into his second term, Trump's director of national intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, has reportedly dedicated months to finding new “evidence” that 2020 was stolen from him (it was not).

Trump's continued preoccupation, along with a raid on an Atlanta-area elections office last month, has raised concerns about what Trump could have planned for the 2026 midterms this November. As CNN's Marshall Cohen told Today, Explained co-host Astead Herndon in a recent episode, Trump's desire to avoid another defeat could result in a “worst-case scenario”: “He might try to put his thumb on the scales, use government powers, use federal authorities to try to influence the process,” Cohen said.

Below is an excerpt of their conversation, edited for length and clarity. There's much more in the full episode, so listen to Today, Explained wherever you get podcasts, including Apple Podcasts, Pandora, and Spotify.

What has Trump been saying about the midterms? 

He made a lot of news just a few days ago when he went farther than he's ever gone before. Trump told a radio host that:

The Republicans should say, “We want to take over. We should take over the voting, the voting in at least many — 15 places.” The Republicans ought to nationalize the voting.

He said 15 states. He didn't say which ones, but we can guess. He said that he was talking about the states that have the big “fraud problem,” which presumably is a lot of the states that he lost in 2020, many of them run by Democratic governors. He's [also] been saying that [elections] should be nationalized. That's really not constitutional or even practically viable, but it shows you where his mind's at.

How did Democrats respond to Trump's claims?

Democrats pretty swiftly, by and large, came out and said that this is crazy and unconstitutional. I was at a conference, the National Association of Secretaries of State, in [Washington,] DC. They do it every year, but the vibes were completely different this year because all of the Democratic secretaries are terrified and strategizing for this potential assault by Trump on the integrity of the midterms.

We spoke to a lot of officials. Some of them didn't want to tell us what possibilities they were planning on preparing for; they said, I don't want to give [Trump] any ideas. But they're very afraid about possible troop deployments, which we've seen in California and Chicago. They're also scared about ICE and [other] immigration enforcement agencies possibly being sent at the last minute when it might be too late to stop, but early enough to cause chaos and possibly intimidate or disenfranchise [voters].

The Republicans we talked to by and large are not afraid. They don't think Trump's going to do anything terrible. They applaud his efforts to clean up the voter rolls. They are supporting his efforts to require voter ID. They're supporting his legislative priorities in terms of requiring proof of citizenship for voter registration.

There might be an air of intimidation that could play into 2026. Is there concern about that and do we know if that's an explicit strategy from the White House?

When you talk to nonpartisan election experts, folks that are former election administrators, that is what they bring up. [Trump] doesn't actually have to do all this stuff to make an impact. He can just threaten it because it is scary. People might ask themselves, Is it really worth it to go vote for some senator that I think is a bum or some member of Congress that I might not even remember? Like, What have they done for me lately? Am I going to risk getting detained for them, to vote for them? I could imagine that is going through people's minds.

Are there other ways that you think Trump could influence or interfere with the midterms?

The Justice Department has sued more than a dozen states for access to their voter rolls — private data belonging to American citizens that the states are in charge of. The feds think that they have the power to access it, but so far they've been losing. There have been at least two cases — one in California, one in Oregon — where federal judges have rejected those attempts by the DOJ to get that data and the Democratic officials in those states say, we are not giving you this data.

The Republican officials that we've talked to in the states have said, We're doing a very good job already keeping a very clean voter roll. We've purged a lot of people. They're trying to make the case politely to the administration that we love the idea of what you're doing, but please let us do it.

DOJ is not just in court. They have really ratcheted things up. A few weeks ago, Attorney General Pam Bondi made waves when she sent a letter to officials in Minnesota, basically offering a quid pro quo that the administration would pull back ICE from Minnesota in exchange for the voter rolls from Minnesota, which most election officials that we spoke to and nonpartisan experts say is bananas, like a hostage [threat]. The Minnesota secretary of state called it a “ransom note.”

How legitimate do you think the concern that Donald Trump will steal the midterms is?

Everyone should take this seriously, not because people should be conspiracy theorists, but because we've lived through this before.

I wouldn't have necessarily said this in 2017, in the first year of Donald Trump's presidency, but we have the benefit of 10 years' [experience]. Donald Trump claimed the Iowa caucuses were rigged when he lost to Ted Cruz in 2016. He claimed that the popular vote was rigged against him when he lost the popular vote to Hillary Clinton, also in 2016. He tried to overturn the 2020 election, which led to a violent insurrection.

That being said, the nonpartisan experts in election administration say that despite all this noise, despite all the fears, despite what you've been told that our system is garbage, it's actually quite resilient. There are many safeguards. There are hardworking, Democratic and Republican officials and nonpartisan staff that run these elections. There are judges and courts that take this seriously as a firewall when people do try to get involved with some funny business, and that you should rest assured that your vote will be counted and will be counted fairly, despite all the drama.

The US shut down a major city's airport, and nobody is quite sure why.

The El Paso International Airport will apparently not be closed for 10 days, despite an earlier announcement that set off an overnight panic. But the reasons why the closure was announced in the first place are still not quite clear, nor is whether this was a fluke or the prelude to a national security crisis.

On Tuesday night, the Federal Aviation Authority announced the closure of the airspace over El Paso, Texas, and a pause to all operations at the city's airport starting at 11:30 pm.

According to the initial announcement, which took local and state authorities by surprise, the closure was to have lasted until February 20. But in a tweet on Wednesday morning, the FAA announced that the “temporary closure” had been lifted and that there was “no threat to commercial aviation.”

Early reports on what went wrong seemed to agree that drones were a part of the explanation, but exactly what role they played was a matter of confusion.

Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy tweeted on Wednesday that “the FAA and DOW [Department of War] acted swiftly to address a cartel drone incursion.”

However, Rep. Veronica Escobar, a Democrat who represents the El Paso area in Congress, told reporters on Wednesday morning that an incursion by Mexican drones was “not the information that we in Congress have been told” and that the current explanations were still muddled.

“There's no threat. There was not a threat, which is why the F.A.A. lifted this restriction so quickly,” she said, according to the New York Times. “The information coming from the administration does not add up.”

Even if there was a drone incursion, this is not something that would normally prompt such a drastic response. US Northern Command has reported around 1,000 drones crossing the US-Mexico border per month.

CNN reported that the closure was due to “US military activity related to drug cartels,” including “unmanned aircraft operations and laser countermeasure testing,” citing an administration official.

But another source also told the New York Times that it was “a test of new counter-drone technology by the military at Fort Bliss, a nearby Army base.” Ft. Bliss is home to a major drone base.

The Texas Tribune suggested a different angle: The military botched its communication with other agencies, triggering the shutdown. Citing an industry source, it reported that the Department of Defense had “been operating unmanned aircrafts, or drones, against drug cartel operations from a base near El Paso's airport without sharing information with the FAA.”

None of this quite explains why the closure was supposed to last for 10 days, which would be by far the longest security interruption to a major city's air service since 9/11.

The mysterious incident comes at a time of heightened speculation that the US will take direct military action against Mexican drug cartels. It's an idea that President Trump has repeatedly suggested since his first term, but that he threatened again in the wake of January's Venezuela raid. Direct US military action on Mexican soil is strongly opposed by the Mexican government.

Last summer, Trump signed an order directing the US military to take action against several drug cartels. The US military regularly conducts surveillance flights along the US-Mexico border without entering Mexican airspace. The CIA has reportedly stepped up secret drone flights over Mexico itself.

There was previously speculation that some sort of action was about to begin in mid-January, when the FAA warned aircraft flying over the eastern Pacific to “exercise caution” due to US military facilities.

If this is not, in fact, the prelude to a new military operation, but simply the result of miscommunication between the Pentagon and the FAA, it will call to mind the January 29 crash in Washington, DC, between an Army Black Hawk helicopter on a training mission and an American Airlines jet that killed 67 people. A National Transportation Safety Board investigation that concluded last month blamed that incident “deep, underlying systemic failures” in regulation and communications.

How a small innovation lab resurrected itself.

Every great new discovery has to start somewhere.

Penicillin was born out of moldy petri dishes followed by years of experimental testing. The Spice Girls started with an open audition, months of rehearsals in a shared house, and demo tapes stolen in the name of girl power. When it comes to US foreign aid, the engine behind new discoveries tackling enormous global challenges was a tiny program called Development Innovation Ventures, or DIV.

Like the rest of the US Agency for International Development, DIV — which cost less than 12 cents per American per year to run — was dismantled within the first few months of the second Trump administration. Many vital projects, like a new low-cost, electricity-free respiratory kit for helping babies breathe, were cut off from support even as they “were moments away from the finish line,” said Sasha Gallant, who led DIV under USAID.

Sign up here to explore the big, complicated problems the world faces and the most efficient ways to solve them. Sent twice a week.

As broad swaths of global health architecture plunged into survival mode, the world also lost a cutting-edge clearinghouse for finding out what works and what doesn't work in foreign aid. It was one of the only programs in the world laser-focused not only on saving people's lives now, but also on learning how to save many more lives in the future.

But now, one year later, DIV is back — and under new management. Instead of being an entity under USAID, former leaders have spun the program into a newly-formed independent nonprofit called the DIV Fund. Backed by private philanthropy, including a $45 million grant from Coefficient Giving, the slow and steady work of building a brighter future can continue.

”It was hard to even think about innovation early in the year. It was like the house was on fire, and we've just got to get the kids out of the house,” said Gallant, who co-founded the new fund. But ultimately, “you also have to have better houses. We have to have better tools to extinguish the fires.”

For one possibility, look to Guatemala, where corn figures into almost every meal. DIV-backed program Semilla Nueva is literally seeding a new treatment for malnutrition by connecting local farmers with maize bred to contain higher levels of zinc, iron, and protein. There's also Uganda — where Health Access Connect is building a fleet of motorcycle taxis to bring health professionals to remote villages — and Bangladesh, where the ARCED Foundation is fighting air pollution using data and satellite imagery.

DIV's work differs from other NGOs that tend to fund solutions that are already standard practice, and only rarely invest in incubating and testing out brand new approaches. DIV supports organizations as they pilot and pressure test those projects to see if they really work in practice. If the evidence says they do, then — and only then — will DIV then help those organizations scale up.

This model served DIV — and by extension, the world — very well during its 15-year stint at USAID. In 2021, a group of economists including Gallant and Nobel-winning cofounder Michael Kremer estimated that the $19.2 million DIV spent in its first three years generated $281 million in social benefits, which is a fancy way of saying that DIV helped an extraordinary number of people live longer, healthier, more prosperous lives. That wouldn't have been possible without careful investments in research and development.

“People come to know the programs that are tremendously effective,” like investing in teachers, handing out malaria nets, or getting kids vaccinated, said Gallant. “But somebody had to figure out that those worked.”

As an independent nonprofit, the DIV Fund won't have nearly as much money or resources as it did at USAID. This year, the fund will grant out about $25 million per year, just under half of what it could give before. You can help them overcome that gap by donating to their work here.

But even so, DIV's real potential has always come from punching above its weight, especially in moments when the good ideas it finds eventually catapult into the mainstream. Gallant said the fund's ultimate goal is to continue connecting with partners — including philanthropists, national governments, and multilateral organizations — to ensure that innovation is “not just happening in an R&D shop” but rather “meaningfully influencing” decisions about where to steer funds in the real world.

And if the US government ever comes knocking again, she says they'll welcome it with open arms. The doors are “entirely open,” said Gallant, and “will remain open to any partner trying to think about how to integrate evidence-driven innovation into large-scale programming.”

Prediction markets are hot — and about to get even hotter, says Robinhood's CEO.

On Tuesday's earnings call, Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev called prediction markets the fastest-growing business in the fintech company's history.

""We're just at the beginning of a prediction market supercycle that could drive trillions in annual volume over time,"" he said. ""This year is going to be a big year. Olympics are going on right now, World Cup coming in the summer.""

Supercycles refer to sustained, long-term periods of expansion spurred by high demand for a product. Companies like Kalshi, Polymarket, and, recently, Robinhood let users bet on the outcomes of events such as elections, sports matches, and pop culture events. The industry has seen an exponential surge in interest in the past year.

In August, Robinhood launched its prediction markets offering, which lets users trade on the outcome of popular NFL and college football games. It has since expanded into bets on categories like the Oscars and elections.

""You're also seeing relevant non-sports contracts generating significant volume,"" he said. ""For example, in the week after the NFL season ended, the government shut down contract on our prediction markets platform was driving significant volume.""

Prediction markets are a small but quickly growing slice of Robinhood's overall revenue. Tuesday's financial results showed that ""other"" revenue, which includes prediction markets, rose from $72 million to $147 million between the third quarter and fourth quarter of 2025.

Event trading volumes are rising steadily, too: The company received 3.4 billion event contracts in January, compared to 2.9 billion in December, 3 billion in November, and 2.5 billion in October.

Overall, Robinhood's fourth-quarter earnings missed Wall Street expectations. Revenue rose 27% year over year in the quarter to $1.3 billion. Net income fell to $605 million, from $916 million in the same quarter in 2024.

Shares of the investing platform fell over 7% in after-hours trading on Tuesday. It's down 24% so far this year because of worries of a decline in crypto revenue and competition from more established brokerages.

The Seattle Seahawks won Super Bowl 60 and so did NBC — but not by as much as they would have liked.

An average of 124.9 million people tuned in, per NBC Sports. NBC generated the second-most-watched Super Bowl — behind 2025's game on FOX Sports — in its broadcast of the Big Game. It ended a two-year streak of record-breaking Super Bowl viewership.

Telemundo, however, delivered a record with the most-watched Super Bowl in US Spanish-language history with an average of 3.3 million viewers. That viewership peaked during Bad Bunny's halftime show performance, with an average of 4.8 million viewers.

Overall, viewership was an average of 128.2 million from 8:15 to 8:30 p.m. ET during Bad Bunny's performance.

An all-time record 137.8 million viewers watched across NBC, Peacock, and Telemundo during the second quarter, according to NBC Sports.

A more detailed breakdown will be available from Nielsen later this week, NBC Sports said in its press release.

Many major sporting events — including last year's Super Bowl — have seen their ratings increase since Nielsen changed its ratings calculation in late January 2025 to better account for out-of-home viewing, such as people watching at restaurants and bars.

The college football National Championship Game drew in just over 30 million people, up about 36% from last year's mark of 22.1 million and close to the all-time record of 33.9 million in 2015.

Under Nielsen's prior ratings methodology, this year's college football championship would have generated just over 28 million viewers. That's based on an ESPN spokesperson telling The Athletic that the game's ratings would have risen 27% year over year under the old format. In other words, out-of-home viewing appeared to add 2 million viewers to the game's total.

So while Nielsen's revamped viewership calculations may have affected Sunday's ratings, it might not have made a massive difference.

Correction: February 11, 2026 — An earlier version of this story mistated the viewership of Bad Bunny's halftime show performance on Telemundo. It averaged 4.8 million viewers.

XAI cofounder Jimmy Ba said he left Elon Musk's startup on Tuesday.

""It's time to recalibrate my gradient on the big picture. 2026 is gonna be insane and likely the busiest (and most consequential) year for the future of our species,"" Ba wrote on X.

Ba reported directly to Musk. He ran a large portion of the company until late last year, when several of his responsibilities were split between two other cofounders, Tony Wu and Guodong Zhang, people with knowledge of the move told Business Insider.

Ba also previously ran the team that oversaw more than a thousand AI tutors, according to an org chart from earlier last year. That role was given to Diego Pasini in September, Business Insider previously reported.

Ba is the second cofounder to depart the company in less than 48 hours. Wu announced he'd resigned from the AI startup on Monday night. Wu's Slack account was deactivated shortly before the announcement, Business Insider previously reported.

Ahead of Wu's departure, xAI underwent another restructuring, and several of his responsibilities were shifted under Zhang.

Musk launched the AI company in 2023 with 11 other founders. Six have now left the company — five of them within the last year.

In addition to his work at xAI, Ba is an assistant professor at the University of Toronto in the computer science department. He received his Ph.D. from the school while studying under Nobel Prize winner Geoffrey Hinton, often referred to as the ""godfather of AI.""

Musk has said he built xAI as an alternative to what he's called ""woke"" chatbots, like OpenAI's ChatGPT. Over the past year, the company has become known for pushing the envelope. Last July, xAI launched a sexy digital avatar called ""Ani,"" and its Grok chatbot went on an antisemitic rant.

Most recently, xAI has come under fire after Grok began generating nonconsensual sexual images of real people in response to X user prompts. The backlash eventually prompted the company to restrict Grok's image-generation features on X.

Last week, Musk announced that xAI would merge with his rocket company, SpaceX. The company is reportedly gearing up for an initial public offering this year that could value SpaceX at $1.5 trillion.

Ba and xAI did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Amazon is one of Anthropic's largest investors and a key partner in bringing the startup's AI models and products to customers.

Inside Amazon, however, employees aren't allowed to use Anthropic's Claude Code for production code or for live products without formal approval.

That disconnect became more visible last fall, when Amazon rolled out internal guidance steering teams toward Kiro, its in-house AI coding assistant, according to internal messages from that period seen by Business Insider. 

The guidance encourages using Kiro over non-approved third-party tools, including Claude Code, for production code. Kiro runs on Claude models, though with Amazon Web Services-built tooling, which makes it different from Claude Code. Employees still need formal approval to use Claude Code for production code.

The policy prompted criticism across internal Amazon forums. In one discussion thread, roughly 1,500 Amazon employees endorsed the formal adoption of Claude Code, according to the messages.

The restrictions have been particularly awkward for engineers who help sell AWS Bedrock, Amazon's platform that offers customers access to third-party AI services, including Claude Code. Some questioned how they could credibly promote a product they are not permitted to use themselves in official work.

""Customers will ask why they should trust or use a tool that we did not approve for internal use,"" one employee wrote.

The episode highlights the complexity of Amazon's relationship with Anthropic. While Amazon is racing to build and promote its own AI tools, it is also marketing a partner's competing technology. Amazon is one of Anthropic's largest investors, with a stake valued at more than $60 billion. Anthropic, in turn, is a major AWS customer, committing to use Amazon's cloud services and at least one million of Amazon's Trainium chips.

""We are seeing incredible improvements in efficiency and delivery from Kiro, our customer growth is rapidly accelerating, and we want to make sure our internal employees all take advantage of this capability to deliver faster for our customers,"" an Amazon spokesperson said. ""While we continue to support existing tools in use today, we do not plan to support additional, third-party AI development tools.""

Amazon maintains ""a strong strategic partnership with Anthropic,"" and while there's no explicit ban on Claude Code, the company applies ""stricter requirements for the tools used to develop production code specifically,"" the spokesperson said, noting that Amazon provides a process for seeking exceptions.

An Anthropic spokesperson didn't respond to a request for comment.

In one of the internal forums, an Amazon sales engineer flagged the irony of being asked to sell Claude Code even though it isn't formally supported inside the company. The employee wrote that they need to be able to ""use, demo, and build"" with Claude Code to support Amazon's directive to get more customers to use it through AWS Bedrock.

Other Amazon engineers also debated whether the emphasis on Kiro was hindering productivity. Some argued that Claude Code outperformed Amazon's in-house tool and warned that forcing adoption of a weaker product could slow development.

""A tool that can't keep pace with rivals offers no real innovation,"" one of the Amazon employees wrote. ""And without competitive strength, Kiro's only survival mechanism becomes forced adoption rather than genuine value.""

Claude Code has become one of the most widely used AI coding services, and it underpins many other similar offerings from other providers. An Amazon spokesperson said about 70% of the company's software engineers used Kiro at least once in January.

In one forum thread, a manager overseeing Amazon's internal developer tools said he understood the ""frustration"" and ""significant"" interest in Claude Code, citing about 1,500 internal endorsements calling for its formal adoption.

Some employees said frustration deepened after Amazon had previously indicated that Claude Code had cleared security and legal review for production use, according to an internal guideline and messages reviewed by Business Insider. That language was later edited and removed, employees said.

Others criticized the lack of transparency around the decision not to formally adopt Claude Code, asking what data informed the decision.

""The trend is clear,"" one employee wrote internally. ""More and more people would like to start using Claude Code and be officially supported by Amazon.""

Elon Musk has long framed SpaceX's mission in sweeping terms: to send humans to Mars and make humans interplanetary.

Along the way, the moon has played an inconsistent supporting role.

SpaceX is under contract with NASA, for example, to send people to the moon, and that funding plays a key role in some of SpaceX's major projects. However, Musk's main messaging for years has been to build cities on Mars, not the moon.

On Sunday, that messaging seemed to take a hard 180.

""For those unaware, SpaceX has already shifted focus to building a self-growing city on the Moon, as we can potentially achieve that in less than 10 years, whereas Mars would take 20+ years,"" Musk wrote on X. ""The mission of SpaceX remains the same: extend consciousness and life as we know it to the stars.""

""The overriding priority is securing the future of civilization and the Moon is faster,"" Musk added.

The latest from Musk has sparked debate on forums about whether he has changed his mind about the moon. A closer look at his statements over the years suggests a more nuanced picture.

Musk has simultaneously had his eyes on missions to both the moon and Mars, but has treated lunar missions as a shorter-term objective within his broader push toward Mars.

That reframing was most explicit in the Sunday post on X, where Musk said SpaceX would prioritize building lunar infrastructure before sending people to Mars.

""It is only possible to travel to Mars when the planets align every 26 months (six month trip time), whereas we can launch to the Moon every 10 days (2 day trip time). This means we can iterate much faster to complete a Moon city than a Mars city,"" Musk wrote. ""That said, SpaceX will also strive to build a Mars city and begin doing so in about 5 to 7 years.""

For those unaware, SpaceX has already shifted focus to building a self-growing city on the Moon, as we can potentially achieve that in less than 10 years, whereas Mars would take 20+ years. The mission of SpaceX remains the same: extend consciousness and life as we know it to…

The message also echoed language from an internal SpaceX memo on February 2 that announced the company's acquisition of Musk's AI startup, xAI.

The science nerd-coded memo described futuristic plans such as extending ""the light of consciousness to the stars,"" floating AI-generating data centers — and permanent lunar bases that weren't on Earth.

Both the memo and Musk's recent post came roughly a year after he appeared to dismiss some lunar missions as a ""distraction,"" writing that SpaceX was ""going straight to Mars.""

No, we're going straight to Mars. The Moon is a distraction.Mass to orbit is the key metric, thereafter mass to Mars surface. The former needs to be in the megaton to orbit per year range to build a self-sustaining colony on Mars.

In his 2025 post, Musk said the key constraint to building on Mars is how much payload you can routinely launch into orbit.

He has repeatedly argued that long-term moon exploration could help. But ultimately, Musk's past quotes suggest he wants moon missions to push momentum toward the peak goal of establishing a Mars colony.

Public statements dating back to at least 2017 also show Musk making a distinction between limited activity on the moon and a full-scale human civilization on Mars.

It is high time that humanity went beyond Earth. Should have a moon base by now and sent astronauts to Mars. The future needs to inspire. https://t.co/6HjDQnRSA5

What has seemingly changed is SpaceX's timeline for reaching the red planet.

The company has repeatedly missed self-imposed deadlines for reaching Mars. Now, the intra-planetary timeline appears bound to be even more prolonged.

Musk — who has admitted he can be overly optimistic when it comes to timelines — initially said SpaceX would fly humans to the red planet by 2024. In 2021, he pushed that timeline back to 2026. Now, he's saying SpaceX would have to wait until at least 2030 for its first Mars mission — if the lunar city is successful.

At the same time, SpaceX is under contractual pressure from the government to reach the moon.

In 2021, NASA hired the company to develop a reusable version of its Starship vehicle capable of ferrying astronauts to the moon as part of the Artemis program. Those contracts, worth billions of dollars, helped fund Starship's development.

NASA expects the SpaceX-built rocket will take off for the moon's South Pole in 2028, according to the agency's website.

Starship can enable a permanently crewed science station on the Moon, which would be super cool!Moonbase Alpha!!

Overall, what looks like a change in philosophy might actually be a doubling down on SpaceX's initial plans to fly to the moon and Mars. Details for those missions may just be coming years later than initially expected.

Musk, who plans to launch data centers in space, has also talked about the manufacturing opportunity that the moon represents.

""The biggest opportunity on the moon is to make solar cells and radiators, and then, you're manufacturing on the moon anything that weighs a lot, chips maybe still come from Earth, they weigh very little,"" Musk said during a December 30 X Spaces conversation.

""And then you can use a mass driver to put a billion tons of AI powered satellites into orbit per year. You could set a scale to 100 terawatts of AI compute per year from the moon,"" he added.

SpaceX, which is preparing for a possible 2026 IPO and recently acquired Musk's AI company, xAI, is looking to scale up its compute resources to power increasingly powerful AI models. Musk has argued that space offers a more attractive medium to build out data centers than the Earth.

Musk also suggested earlier this week that SpaceX would build a ""system that allows anyone to travel to the moon,"" without providing more details.

Musk has previously said he'd like to travel to Mars — and possibly die on the planet. ""Just not on impact,"" he joked.

Kyiv officials warned that Ukrainians might be coerced into registering Starlink terminals for the Kremlin's forces after a recent block on Russia's access to the service.

Ukraine's auxiliary body for handling prisoners of war posted a notice on Tuesday saying that it had learned of multiple instances where families of Ukrainian prisoners were threatened and told to enroll such terminals.

The warning comes after Ukraine's defense ministry reached a deal with SpaceX earlier this month to cut off Russia's access to Starlink by blocking general connectivity across Ukrainian territory.

""Looking for a way out of the difficult situation in which they found themselves, the occupiers turned their attention to the families of the prisoners,"" the Coordination Headquarters for the Treatment of Prisoners of War wrote in a statement. 

""Cases of threats and demands to officially register Starlink terminals have been recorded,"" it added.

To maintain Starlink access, Ukrainian troops, civilians, and businesses must register individual terminals to a ""whitelist,"" either online or at municipal centers.

The sweeping move aimed to curb a black-market loophole that Russian forces were exploiting. In compliance with US sanctions, SpaceX doesn't do business with Russia, but Ukraine has repeatedly said that Russian troops were obtaining terminals and using them to guide attack and reconnaissance drones.

In its latest statement, the Coordination Headquarters for the Treatment of Prisoners of War said that officials could trace the registration of terminals that were later used by Russian forces because enrollment requires an ID.

""If the terminal is used to control drones that destroy infrastructure and take lives, the fact of registering the terminal by a citizen of Ukraine is grounds for criminal prosecution,"" the agency added.

Russia is not known to have a satellite internet service that compares to Starlink's in terms of speed, availability, and stability.

""For the enemy, Starlink is so important that they have deployed a whole network to search for traitors who are ready to register Starlink for themselves in the Central Administrative Service,"" wrote Serhii ""Flash"" Beskrestnov, a drone analyst and an advisor to Ukraine's defense ministry, in a Telegram statement on Sunday.

In some cases, Russian troops were offering up to $230 to register a single terminal, Beskrestnov added. That's roughly a third of the median monthly salary in Ukraine.

For the Kremlin's forces, the service disruption has been significant enough that pro-Russian military bloggers have reported that most Russian units now lack internet access. Some have blamed Moscow for what they called a reliance on Western technology, even as the US and Europe explicitly back Ukraine.

""It's about to suddenly become clear that units cannot operate effectively without communications. That'll be news to some in high places,"" one blogger, under the handle Belarusian Silovik, wrote.

Denying Russian access to Starlink had long been a priority for Ukraine's new defense minister, Mykhailo Fedorov, who had previously advocated such measures while serving as minister for digital transformation.

One year before he was charged with sex trafficking, Jeffrey Epstein was planning a major renovation of his private islands, Little St. James and Great St. James, documents newly released by the Department of Justice reveal.

Hundreds of pages of emails, contracts, and renderings in the Epstein files give insight into his plans for the islands, one of which has become notorious for the sexual abuse that prosecutors allege occurred there, as well as an inside look into his exacting nature.

Over the course of eight months, Epstein paid at least $150,000 to Florida-based design firm Radyca for architectural and interior plans.

The remit: ""My employer owns 2 islands in the Caribbean off of St. Thomas that he would like completely redone,"" one of Epstein's assistants wrote the firm in November 2017.

The work was supposed to begin in January 2019 and take two years, according to a December 2017 agreement. Epstein fired the firm in June 2018, emails show.

Ramon Alonso, the president of Radyca and Epstein's main point of contact for the work, declined to comment on the project or the island. He visited the island at least twice, according to emails and travel information included in the files.

Various schematics, proposals, and designs — as well as the correspondence about them — reveal how Epstein imagined the properties.

The plans for the two islands included a ""ladies' residence"" and master retreat in proximity, as well as a cinema, a ""funhouse point,"" and various other guest pavilions and outbuildings.

The ladies' residence was of particular interest to Epstein and the subject of dozens of emails between Epstein and Alonso, who discussed the appropriate structure for ""the girls.""

Epstein also gave several notes on the 7,700-square-foot master retreat. In one email, Alonso wrote that ""we completely isolated the bedroom from any noise or daylight as requested."" In another, Epstein said he didn't want guests above his bedroom and that his bedroom windows didn't need to open any more than to ""air out the place.""

The designs were inspired by luxury hotels, including the Soori Hotel in Bali and the Amanera in the Dominican Republic.

Throughout the process, tensions arose between the disgraced financier and his design team.

""i might add that the cost incurred to date. are mine. with virutally nothing to show for it,"" Epstein wrote in a May 2018 email, with his usual idiosyncratic punctuation.

In other emails, he called the designs ""silly,"" said he was ""shocked and disappointed,"" and told Alonso that the firm had created ""nothing at all . of any use. ZERO.""

By June 2018, relations appeared to reach a tipping point.

""Please understand that I don't mind changing direction as many times as it's needed to your full satisfaction and I also really like you and working with you but I don't appreciate when you diminish our work,"" Alonso wrote in an email to Epstein.

Two weeks later, Alonso was fired.

""this is silly sorry i have no more time for this,"" Epstein wrote on June 30, 2018. ""I wish you well.""

It was the last correspondence between the pair in the files. About one year later, Epstein was arrested, and the FBI raided the island. Photos taken at the time show the redesign never occurred.

Little St. James was central to the disgraced financier's sex-trafficking operation, according to witness testimony included in the US's 2019 case accusing Epstein of sexual abuse and trafficking of underage girls. Epstein pleaded not guilty and died by suicide in jail that year while awaiting trial.

The US Virgin Islands, where the properties are located, sued Epstein's estate following his death, accusing him of sex trafficking and abusing underage girls on the islands. They reached a settlement in 2022, with the estate agreeing to pay the government of the Virgin Islands $105 million in cash, half the proceeds of a planned sale of Little St. James, and other damages. The settlement did not include any admission of guilt.

Epstein purchased the 72-acre Little St. James in 1998 for $7.95 million. In 2016, he added the 162-acre Great St. James to his portfolio for $22.5 million, according to deeds included in the Epstein files. Epstein's islands sold in 2023 for $60 million — less than half of the initial $125 million asking price. The buyer, billionaire Stephen Deckoff, has said he plans to transform them into a luxury resort.

Throughout his decades on the Little St. James — often referred to as Little St. Jeff's — Epstein hosted famous and powerful figures.

LinkedIn cofounder Reid Hoffman, Google cofounder Sergey Brin, and Howard Lutnick had plans to visit Little St. James, according to emails in the latest batch of Epstein files.

The island had a reputation for parties and, in Epstein's words, ""a ratio"" of men to women that could make women ""uncomfortable.""

""What day/night will be the wildest party on your island?"" Musk asked Epstein in 2012 about the possibility of a visit that Musk said never occurred.

Over the years, Epstein embarked on several redesign projects, documents and emails included in the Epstein files show, hiring architects, surveyors, and decorators.

The renovations and redecoration of the islands were also a subject of the 2021 testimony of Ghislaine Maxwell's former executive assistant, Cimberly Espinosa, with one detail so unexpected that the judge had to follow up

""We even shipped in sand and palm trees and all kinds of things to get the island to what he wanted it to be,"" she said, answering the judge's questions about the scope of her work on the island.

""To be clear,"" the judge said, ""you shipped in sand to a tropical island, why was that?""

""He wanted more sand on the beach,"" the former assistant said.

Wall Street may be getting the AI trade wrong, says Dan Ives, a Wedbush analyst and longtime tech bull.

Ives said on CNBC's ""Closing Bell"" published Tuesday that the recent investor pessimism toward software companies is 'the most disconnected call that I've ever seen.""

While much of the AI excitement has centered on data centers, chips, and GPUs, Ives said software will be the ""heart and lungs of the AI revolution.""

The infrastructure buildout is still in its early innings and could stretch over the next decade. But software is where the real use cases and monetization will emerge, he added.

Ives said it is wrong to assume that big software companies like Salesforce and ServiceNow are ""structurally broken"" or set to be replaced by AI-native tools.

These companies are deeply embedded in enterprise stacks, with hundreds of thousands of customers, Ives said, adding that their AI use cases could unlock incremental revenue over the next six to 18 months that investors are not yet pricing in.

Large, entrenched platforms should not be compared to smaller players that serve small and medium-sized businesses. ""You cannot paint all of them with the same brush,"" Ives said.

Ives also defended Microsoft's role in the AI revolution. While acknowledging near-term concerns around capital spending and Azure growth, Ives said the broader AI rollout cannot succeed without Microsoft's software and cloud ecosystem.

Ives' comments came after software stocks tumbled last week amid investor fears that AI could disrupt large swaths of the industry.

Not all tech and finance leaders think AI will replace traditional software companies. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang dismissed that idea at a Cisco AI event last week.

""There's this notion that the tool industry is in decline and will be replaced by AI,"" Huang said. ""You could tell because there's a whole bunch of software companies whose stock prices are under a lot of pressure because somehow AI is going to replace them. It is the most illogical thing in the world and time will prove itself,"" he added.

Huang said AI depends on the tools software offers and pointed to ServiceNow, SAP, Cadence, and Synopsis as examples of software firms well-positioned in the AI era.

Ives also wrote in an industry note published last week that the ""software armageddon"" can be regarded as a tech stock ""garage sale.""

""We believe the market is baking in a doomsday scenario for software companies in the near-term, which we believe is extremely overblown, as many customers won't be willing to put their data at risk to capitalize on AI implementation strategies until there is less risk with these migration projects,"" Ives and his analysts wrote.

Ives has long urged investors to buy tech dips, even as critics caution that AI enthusiasm may be running ahead of earnings and real-world adoption.

The police have detained a person linked to the disappearance of ""Today"" show host Savannah Guthrie's mother, Nancy Guthrie.

In a statement on X on Tuesday, the Pima County Sheriff's Department said that earlier in the day, officials had detained an individual ""during a traffic stop south of Tucson.""

""The subject is currently being questioned in connection to the Nancy Guthrie investigation,"" the statement said.

This development came hours after the FBI and the sheriff's department released videos of an individual in a full-faced ski mask arriving at Nancy Guthrie's home in Tucson, Arizona, on the morning of her disappearance.

Officials described the individual as being armed and said that they had tampered with the camera on Nancy Guthrie's front door. The videos were taken via her Google Nest doorbell.

The sheriff's department's X statement did not specify whether the detained individual was the one filmed in the Nest doorbell video. It added that additional information will be released as it becomes available.

Nancy Guthrie, 84, has been missing since February 1. Chris Nanos, the sheriff of Pima County, told the media that officials believe she was ""taken out of her home against her will.""

Officials confirmed that the blood found on the porch of Nancy Guthrie's home belonged to her.

A week after her disappearance, Savannah Guthrie said her family had received a message linked to her mother's disappearance, and the family was willing to pay a ransom to get her back.

""We beg you now to return our mother to us so that we can celebrate with her,"" Savannah Guthrie said in a video she posted on Instagram. ""This is the only way we will have peace. This is very valuable to us and we will pay.""

CNN reported on Tuesday night that the FBI was searching a home in Rio Rico, about 60 miles from Tucson, in connection with Nancy Guthrie's disappearance.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","Here are the key xAI figures who have departed in the recent exodus","https://www.businessinsider.com/xai-key-departures-list-elon-musk-startup-cofounders-exodus-2026-2","Wed, 11 Feb 2026 13:25:00 GMT","

xAI is facing an exodus of top employees.

Two cofounders and several other employees have announced their departures from Elon Musk's AI startup in the past few days.

It comes after Musk announced last week that xAI would merge with his rocket company, SpaceX, in a deal the billionaire said would help the joint entity build a network of AI data centers in space.

SpaceX is reportedly gearing up for a massive public offering later this year that could value the company at as much as $1.5 trillion. That could be a major boost for xAI, which reportedly burned through billions of dollars last year.

The departures are the latest turmoil to hit the startup since Musk founded xAI in 2023 with the aim of taking on Google and OpenAI.

Since then, around half of the company's cofounders have left, and xAI has faced global backlash over sexual images of real people generated on X by Grok, the startup's AI chatbot.

Here's everyone who has left xAI in the company's most recent exodus. Business Insider has contacted xAI and each of the following employees for comment.

xAI cofounder Tony Wu announced his resignation from the company on Tuesday. In a post on X, the former Google researcher said it was time for his ""next chapter"" and thanked Musk for ""the ride of a lifetime.""

Business Insider's Grace Kay previously reported that Wu began reporting directly to Musk last year and led xAI's reasoning efforts.

Jimmy Ba became the second xAI cofounder to announce his departure from the company in less than 48 hours on Tuesday.

The executive, who previously oversaw the startup's AI tutoring efforts, also thanked Musk for the opportunity and said he was proud of what xAI had accomplished in a post on X.

Ba's departure means that six out of the 11 cofounders who launched xAI with Musk in 2023 have now left the company.

Hang Gao, a member of technical staff, also announced in an X post on Tuesday that he had left xAI.

The Berkeley alumnus, who worked on xAI's Grok Imagine AI video generator, described his time at the company as ""unique and memorable.""

Vahid Kazemi, a member of xAI's technical staff, said on X on February 11 that he had left the company a few weeks prior. ""That was short! IMO, all AI labs are building the exact same thing, and it's boring. I think there's room for more creativity,"" he wrote, adding that he was starting ""something new.""

Kazemi joined xAI last year and, before that, worked at OpenAI. He also previously worked at Google and Apple.

Ayush Jaiswal worked on Grok at xAI and announced on February 6 that it was his last week at the company. ""Will be taking a few months to spend time with family & tinker with AI,"" he wrote in a post on X. Jaiswal joined xAI in September 2025, according to his LinkedIn profile. Before that, he was head of growth at Scale AI.

Shayan Salehian said on February 7 that he was leaving after a seven-year stint across Twitter and X to build something new.

He worked on the X timeline as well as various Grok models, he wrote in a post on X. He added that he is leaving to work on something ""focused on accelerating science.""

""Working closely with Elon across X and xAI, I saw what happens when you refuse to accept impossible as an answer,"" he wrote on X.

Simon Zhai, a member of the xAI technical staff, joined the company in October 2025 and announced his departure on February 9.

""Today is my last day at xAI, feeling very fortunate about the opportunity. It has been an amazing journey,"" he wrote in a brief departure post on X. Before xAI, Zhai was a research scientist at Google DeepMind.

Over the last half-decade, perhaps no one has personified the archetype of a finance bro more than Mark Moran.

His cuff-links pop out of tailored suits. He posts on X about his preferred loafers. In 2024, he told Business Insider about his love for Zyn.

Now, he's leaving it all behind — or, rather, he's bringing it all to the world of politics.

Moran is launching a bid for Senate in Virginia, running as a Democrat against incumbent Mark Warner. He'll try to build off the online popularity he's generated in recent years as a Wall Street culture personality.

After stints at investment banking like Lazard and Centerview Partners, Moran first gained notoriety after being selected as a contestant on HBO's Fboy Island reality dating show in 2021. He then became the first employee of the popular financial meme account Litquidity before launching his own investor relations firm, Equity Animal, in 2022.

Despite being a prominent face for millennials in finance, the 33-year-old said his experience is fueling his move away from the industry and into politics.

He ended up leaving his first two jobs because of moral issues he had with some of the deals he worked on. Now, Moran, who calls himself a populist, is running on a platform that, in many ways, is a rebellion against his old line of work.

""I'm like, wait, these people are the quote-unquote titans of the universe?"" he told Business Insider, reflecting on his first impressions of working on Wall Street.

One of his proposals is to ban corporations from owning single-family homes, similar to an executive order President Donald Trump recently signed to curb home ownership by institutional investors.

Another proposal is to reform campaign finance laws to keep Wall Street and corporate money out of politics.

""We have a captured legislative branch,"" he said. ""I'm very much against the control that Wall Street has been able to have over politicians.""

Moran also wants to take on a Wall Street darling right now: AI data centers, which are fueling the AI buildout that's helped drive the S&P 500 up by 94% since late 2022.

He's proposing a tax on data centers that would fund community colleges.

""Someone is gonna come in, pay for the campaign of a Republican who's quote-unquote business-friendly, and they're gonna give designation as critical infrastructure to win our war of AI against China — which I want to happen, but the people are not going to get anything in return,"" Moran said.

""If we were to put a compute tax on the data centers, over the next 10 years, that could be $100 billion, if not more,"" he continued. ""That would be enough to entirely change the community college system to make it so that we could have universal community college.""

AI disruption fears sparked a tech sell-off last week, with the software sector getting slammed, but JPMorgan thinks the big drop has created an opportunity to buy the dip in a handful of stocks.

Analysts highlighted several software names they believe are well-positioned despite AI disruption concerns that have dragged the sector to ""deeply pessimistic levels.""

""Within Technology, this perceived risk of disruption has driven sell-offs in both Quality and Speculative Growth Software names indiscriminately,"" the analysts wrote.

The analysts say the reasons investors should buy the dip include:

The House is scheduled to vote Wednesday on a resolution disapproving of President Donald Trump's tariffs against Canada, in what could amount to a blow to Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., and a rebuke of the president's signature economic policy.

The tariff resolution, introduced by Rep. Gregory Meeks, D-N.Y., will be considered a day after a procedural vote on a rule that would have barred House challenges to Trump's tariffs failed with the support of three Republican members.

""The Speaker continues to abdicate his responsibilities, ceding Congress's Article I authority to Donald Trump,"" Meeks, the top Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said in a statement posted to X on Tuesday. ""Republicans now face a clear choice: go on the record and join Democrats in ending these cost-raising tariffs, or keep forcing American families to pay for them.""

A vote on Trump's tariffs will force House Republicans to choose between loyalty to the president and striking down economic policy that many in the GOP conference do not like.

Reps. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., Kevin Kiley, R-Calif., and Don Bacon, R-Neb., bucked Trump and GOP leaders on Tuesday by voting with every Democrat to defeat a rule that would have blocked House votes on Trump's tariffs through July 31.

""I don't like putting the important work of the House on pause, but Congress needs to be able to debate on tariffs. Tariffs have been a 'net negative' for the economy and are a significant tax that American consumers, manufacturers, and farmers are paying,"" Bacon posted to X after the Tuesday vote.

Because of the razor-thin GOP majority in the House, Johnson can afford to lose only one Republican vote if all Democrats are present and vote in favor of the resolution to end Trump's Canada tariff.

Still, the effort is likely symbolic. Even if the Senate approved Meeks' resolution, Trump would likely veto the legislation.

""This is life with a razor-thin majority,"" Johnson said in a Wednesday morning appearance on Fox Business. ""I think it's a big mistake. I don't think we need to go down the road of trying to limit the president's power while he is in the midst of negotiating America-first trade agreements with nations around the world.""

In this article

The Federal Aviation Administration abruptly grounded all flights in and out of El Paso International Airport in Texas for 10 days starting Wednesday morning, citing ""special security"" instructions — and then lifted the order hours later.

A Trump administration official said the Department of Defense disabled Mexican cartel drones that had breached U.S. airspace and that there was no threat to commercial air travel currently.

""The temporary closure of airspace over El Paso has been lifted,"" the FAA said in a post on X. ""There is no threat to commercial aviation. All flights will resume as normal.""

The airport sits next to Biggs Army Airfield and is near the Mexican border, about 12 miles from Juarez, Mexico. 

Flights were initially halted until late Feb. 20 and the ban applied to a 10-nautical-mile area around the airport. The FAA hadn't immediately disclosed the security reasons for the temporary sudden halt or why it was set for so long. 

While the FAA regularly halts flights at airports for weather, traffic or even rocket launches, a security issue is highly unusual, as is announcing such a long effective airspace closure.

El Paso Mayor Renard Johnson called the temporary grounding a ""major and unnecessary disruption"" and called for better communication from the federal government. 

Some lawmakers criticized the Trump administration for how the sudden order played out.

Rep. Rick Larsen of Washington, the ranking member of the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, and Rep. André Carson of Indiana, ranking member of the subcommittee on aviation, called it ""unacceptable.""

""While we're not happy with the disruption, we commend the FAA for taking swift action to protect travelers and ensure the safety of U.S. airspace,"" they said in a joint statement. ""We look forward to pursuing a bipartisan solution that strengthens interagency coordination and ensures that the Department of Defense will not jeopardize safety and disrupt the freedom to travel.""

U.S. Rep. Veronica Escobar, a Texas Democrat whose district includes much of El Paso, said the move to suddenly close airspace was ""unprecedented.""

""There was no advance notice provided to my office, the City of El Paso, or anyone involved in airport operations,"" she said in a statement. 

Nearly 3.5 million passengers passed through the airport in the first 11 months of 2025 and it is served by Southwest Airlines, Delta Air Lines, American Airlines, United Airlines and Frontier Airlines, according to airport data.

There were 1,314 departures scheduled for the El Paso airport this month, according to aviation data firm Cirium, including about 40 departures on Wednesday.

Southwest has 23 flights scheduled at the airport Wednesday, out of more than 3,000 systemwide. The airline said Wednesday it is resuming operations to and from El Paso and encouraged travelers to check its website for updated information.

""Nothing is more important to Southwest than the Safety of its Customers and Employees,"" it said.

United said it didn't cancel any flights and that it canceled an earlier travel waiver.

In this article

Kraft Heinz on Wednesday said it is pausing work on its previously announced plans to split the company. 

CEO Steve Cahillane, who joined Kraft Heinz in January, said in a statement that many of the company's issues are ""fixable and within our control.""

""My number one priority is returning the business to profitable growth, which will require ensuring all resources are fully focused on the execution of our operating plan,"" he said. ""As a result, we believe it is prudent to pause work related to the separation and we will no longer incur related dis-synergies this year.""

Kraft Heinz also plans to invest $600 million to fuel a turnaround of its U.S. business. The company plans to spend the money on its marketing, sales, and research and development. The investment will also go toward ""product superiority and select pricing,"" according to Cahillane.

In September, the company announced plans to break up, reversing much of the blockbuster $46 billion merger from a decade ago that created one of the biggest food companies in the world. 

While investors originally cheered the merger, the luster faded as the combined company's U.S. sales slipped, and it wrote down many of its iconic brands, like Oscar Mayer and Maxwell House. For at least six years, Kraft Heinz has been in turnaround mode, trying to revive its U.S. business.

Warren Buffett, who helped mastermind the deal, said he was disappointed in the decision to split. Berkshire Hathaway, under new CEO Greg Abel, has since taken a formal step toward unwinding its 28% stake in Kraft Heinz.

""We support CEO Steve Cahillane and the Kraft Heinz Board of Directors' decision, under Steve's new leadership, to pause work on the company's previously planned separation. As a result, management can commit to strengthening Kraft Heinz's ability to compete and serve customers,"" Abel said in a statement. 

For years, Kraft Heinz has underinvested in its brands, and executives appeared unwilling to change that strategy, Piper Sandler analyst Michael Lavery wrote in a note to clients on Wednesday. 

""This appears to have changed with the hiring Steve Cahillane, who has reshaped KHC's 2026 plans (and proposed split) much more significantly than we had expected in just the six weeks since he started as KHC's CEO,"" Lavery said. ""We still believe this remains a 'show me' story, and that this is only the first step in getting KHC in a position for sustainable growth, which still looks unlikely to come soon.""

Kraft Heinz announced Cahillane's hiring in December. He previously led Kellogg through its own breakup and then headed Kellanova, itself a spinoff, until its sale to Mars. 

Not everyone on Wall Street was sold on the reversal Wednesday. Shares of Kraft Heinz fell as much as 5% in early trading before rebounding to trade essentially flat. 

""Investors will view this negatively because it indicates that the businesses are not in strong enough condition to operate on a standalone basis, and it is uncertain when they will,"" TD Cowen analyst Robert Moskow wrote in a note to clients on Wednesday.

The announcement Wednesday came alongside Kraft Heinz's quarterly earnings release. The company's earnings topped Wall Street's estimates, but its revenue fell short of analysts' projections.

Oil prices gained about 2% on Wednesday, buoyed by potential supply risks should tensions between the U.S. and Iran escalate, while draws of crude from key stockpiles suggested stronger demand.

Brent crude oil futures were up $1.39, or 2.02%, at $70.19 a barrel by 10:09 a.m. ET. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude rose $1.34, or nearly 2.1%, to $65.30.

""Ongoing tensions in the Middle East continue to support prices, although so far there has been no supply disruption,"" said UBS oil analyst Giovanni Staunovo.

U.S. President Donald Trump said on Tuesday he was considering sending a second aircraft carrier to the Middle East, even as Washington and Tehran prepare to resume negotiations aimed at averting a new conflict.

""While rhetoric remains belligerent at times, there are no signs, at least for now, of escalation, and the U.S. President believes that Iran will ultimately want to strike a deal on its nuclear missile programme,"" PVM Oil Associates analyst Tamas Varga said in a note.

A slightly weaker dollar was helping prices higher as well. A stronger U.S. currency hurts demand for dollar-denominated crude from foreign buyers.

Crude draws from the stocks held independently in the Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp (ARA) refining and storage hub and from Fujairah suggested a tight market, UBS' Staunovo said, which was also supporting prices.

In the wider market, OPEC left its supply-demand expectations for the oil market largely unchanged in its monthly report, but highlighted that global oil demand for the wider group's crude will drop by 400,000 bpd in the second quarter compared to the first.

Russian oil production edged down around 0.6% in January from December, per the report.

Egypt has directed international oil companies to double production by 2030, with existing contracts due to be revised to spur new investment, Energean International's country manager for Egypt told Reuters on Tuesday.

Traders are also waiting for weekly U.S. oil inventory data from the Energy Information Administration on Wednesday. U.S. crude inventories rose by 13.4 million barrels in the week ended February 6, market sources said, citing American Petroleum Institute figures on Tuesday.

In this article

Shopify on Wednesday reported fourth-quarter results that beat on the top line and gave strong guidance to start the year. The stock slid more than 10%.

Here's how the company did, compared with estimates from analysts polled by LSEG: 

The Canadian e-commerce company said it expects first-quarter revenue to expand at a ""low-thirties percentage rate"" year over year, which is higher than the 25.1% growth forecast by analysts, according to FactSet. 

Shopify projected its free-cash-flow margin to be in the ""low-to-mid teens"" in the first quarter, which is slightly lower than a year ago. CFO Jeff Hoffmeister told analysts that it reflects the company's continued investment in AI tools. 

The company's board of directors also approved $2 billion in share buybacks.

Shares of software companies have sold off heavily in recent weeks as investors grew increasingly concerned about the potential threat of artificial intelligence tools. 

Shopify, which sells software to help businesses launch and run their online storefronts, has tried to position itself at the forefront of emerging AI shopping tools. The company was an early partner of OpenAI when it launched its Instant Checkout feature, and it helped Google develop a protocol for AI shopping bots to facilitate transactions across the web.

Shopify President Harley Finkelstein said in an interview with CNBC's ""Squawk on the Street"" on Wednesday that the company has ""laid the rails"" for AI shopping and is poised to benefit from how it disrupts e-commerce.

Some fears of an AI-driven software wipeout are overblown, Finkelstein said. 

""I think there's an incredible opportunity coming with AI, but I think you have to look at the companies that are acting as infrastructure, as platforms, vs. ones that are just features,"" Finkelstein said. ""Shopify is internet infrastructure.""

The company's revenues were lifted by the key holiday shopping period, which saw ""record"" spending in 2025, according to Adobe Analytics. Online spending from Nov. 1 through Dec. 31 increased 6.8% to $257.8 billion, Adobe said, beating its forecast of $253.4 billion. 

Shoppers remained resilient during the holiday shopping season despite a dour economic backdrop dominated by weakening consumer confidence, President Donald Trump's sweeping tariff policies and a slowing job market.

The Commerce Department reported Tuesday that retail sales in December were flat after increasing 0.6% in November, capping off the year on a downbeat note after a period of otherwise solid shopping activity.

Shopify's gross merchandise volume, or the total volume of merchandise sold on the platform, came in higher than expected. GMV surged 29% year over year to $123.8 billion, surpassing analysts' estimated $121.3 billion, according to FactSet.

Uber Eats is bringing artificial intelligence to your next grocery shopping list.

The ride-hailing company said on Wednesday that its food delivery platform is debuting a new AI assistant that lets customers build a shopping cart using text or images, like handwritten grocery lists. 

Uber is offering the feature through dozens of large retailers, including Safeway, Albertsons and Kroger. The tool accounts for item preferences and store availability and allows users to edit selections, the company said.  

""Cart Assistant reflects how we think about AI at Uber: starting with real customer needs and building practical solutions within the app,"" said Praveen Neppalli Naga, Uber's technology, said in a release. ""By grounding these features in real user behavior, we can build tools that feel helpful and intuitive.""

Uber and its rivals in food delivery and ride-hailing have been adding more AI features to enhance their platforms for customers and businesses. In July, Uber launched new tools for restaurants, including AI-powered menu descriptions and customer review summaries.

Uber and DoorDash have launched aggressive expansions into grocery delivery, in a direct challenge to Instacart. Both companies started offering the service in 2020 during the height of the Covid pandemic. In recent months, Uber has been introducing more partners, including Aldi and FreshDirect. 

Gross bookings in the delivery business grew 26% from a year earlier to $25.4 billion in the fourth quarter. 

Uber's tool is also the latest example of AI innovation in the retail industry, which is emerging as a significant testing space for the technology. Last year, Instacart debuted AI tools for grocers. Amazon and Walmart have also introduced AI agents.

French AI startup Mistral said on Wednesday it will invest 1.2 billion euros ($1.43 billion) into digital infrastructure in Sweden, including AI data centers.

The announcement comes as Europe scrambles to build out the infrastructure needed to power rapidly developing AI tools, as it seeks to build tech sovereignty amid rising geopolitical tensions.

The funds will facilitate the development of AI data centers, advanced compute capacity and localized AI capabilities, Mistral said.

Founded in 2023, Mistral has emerged as one of Europe's leading AI companies and raised a 1.7 billion euro funding round in September, hitting an 11.7 billion euro valuation. Dutch chip equipment maker ASML contributed 1.3 billion euros to the round.

The company also counts big tech giants Nvidia and Microsoft as investors, alongside DST Global, Andreessen Horowitz, Bpifrance, General Catalyst, and Index Ventures.

""This investment is a concrete step toward building independent capabilities in Europe, dedicated to AI"", said Arthur Mensch, Mistral CEO, in a statement.

""By delivering a fully vertical offer with locally processed and stored data, we are reinforcing Europe's strategic autonomy and competitiveness,"" he added. ""This lays the foundation for a European AI cloud that can serve industries, public institutions, and researchers at scale.""

Initially focused on building large language models (LLMs), the company has since expanded its offering to the infrastructure needed to power AI. 

In June, it launched Mistral Compute, which the company says can provide an integrated stack, including graphics processing units (GPUs), application programming interfaces (APIs) and services like fully managed platform-as-a-service.

The Nordic countries are considered prime locations for compute facilities in Europe, boasting cooler temperatures and some of the lowest energy costs in the region. 

In July, OpenAI announced it would launch an AI data center in Norway, as part of its ""Stargate"" initiative. 

As part of the investment, Mistral will partner with Swedish company EcoDataCenter to deploy ""large-scale"" AI compute, marking the French startup's first AI infrastructure investment outside of its home market. 

The facility is scheduled to open in 2027 and will support the development and operation of Mistral's next-generation AI models.

While Mistral is the best-funded LLM-builder in Europe, raising $2.9 billion, according to deal-counting platform Dealroom, it has lagged behind U.S. rivals, which have mammoth private funding rounds.

OpenAI is looking to wrap up what could be a $100 billion funding round, sources told CNBC this week, and Anthropic signed a term sheet for a $10 billion funding round in January.

New analysis of U.S. Census data shows that states across the U.S. where key midterm elections will take place this year paid over $134 billion in tariffs in the period since President Donald Trump began implementing widespread trade duties in March 2025 through last November. In all, the U.S. Census data compiled by Trade Partnership Worldwide showed a total of $199 billion in tariffs paid by states during that time period. 

Trump has called affordability a ""Democratic hoax,"" and in recent testimony before Congress, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said the tariffs ""do not cause inflation."" 

But Trump's tariffs and affordability are expected to be factors in the upcoming midterm election cycle.  Recent CNBC survey data from the American consumer and pricing data show that the affordability issues are real and many voters have soured on the economy. A January poll from The New York Times and Siena University found that 54% of voters oppose Trump's tariffs. Some members of the GOP are starting to break with their leaders over the tariffs issue, joining Democrats on Tuesday in a vote to defeat a rule that would have prohibited the House from challenging tariffs issued by Trump. The House is expected to vote Wednesday on a measure to overturn Trump's tariffs on Canada introduced by Rep. Gregory Meeks, D-N.Y.

""Americans struggling with affordability rightly blame tariffs for higher prices on many everyday purchases,"" said Dan Anthony, executive director of the We Pay the Tariffs small business coalition and president of Trade Partnership Worldwide. ""The president could eliminate tens of billions in taxes in the states that will determine the 2026 elections. He just doesn't want to,"" Anthony said.

This year, all 435 districts in the U.S. House of Representatives and 33 seats in the U.S. Senate are up for election. The Republicans hold slim majorities in both chambers of Congress. Democrats need to gain four seats to win a majority in the Senate. To keep control of the House, the Republican Party cannot afford to lose more than two seats. 

Midterm elections primary season begins March 3 with voters heading to the polls in Arkansas, North Carolina, and Texas. 

Small business owners across U.S. states are speaking out about the impact the tariffs have had on their businesses, some as part of a new YouTube video-led campaign called Small Businesses Against Tariffs that launched on Wednesday in an effort to raise awareness.

Many small businesses are seeking to counter rhetoric about tariffs being paid by other companies rather than on Main Street, as well as the idea tariffs are being paid back to Americans, making their case on how tariffs actually work and who pays the price — in their view, American small businesses, workers, and consumers.

Chris Gibbs, a Shelby County, Ohio, farmer of corn, soybeans, wheat, alfalfa hay, and a 90-head cow-calf operation, said the tariffs have hit him two-fold. ""My operating costs are soaring,"" said Gibbs. ""Tariffs on steel, aluminum and lumber raised the cost on anything I do. From building buildings, barns, buying machinery, trailers, wheels, and parts, and even my fertilizer,"" he said.

Gibbs said the trade war has also impacted his ability to sell his crops. 

""In 2018, this president destroyed trade relationships, and at that moment, just like Carter in 1980 with the Russian embargo, we became an unreliable supplier. This is where we're at, and we have not recovered,"" Gibbs said. ""Brazil is now the lead supplier of soybeans to China. Trump pushed President Xi into the arms of Brazil and they never left.""

Promised agricultural buys were a big part of the first trade war between the U.S. and China. China failed to meet its obligation in agricultural purchases. In 2025, China promised to increase orders, but trade data show there has been no significant pickup.

Noel Hacegaba, CEO of the Port of Long Beach, told CNBC it saw a 95% decline year-over-year in soybean exports to China. 

""China is now consuming most of its soybeans from places like Brazil,"" said Hacegaba. ""The United States produces about 20 percent of the world's soybeans. Brazil is now at 40 percent, largely in part because China shifting its buys to Brazil. We're doing everything that we can as a major export gateway to help our exporters move their product more efficiently, but we need certainty and clarity on trade policy to make sure that that product can move,"" he said.

Gibbs said the tariff aid Trump has promised to farmers is a slap in the face to all farmers and Americans. ""If these checks ever do come, it is money paid I spent on the tariffs as well as all American consumers,"" Gibbs said. 

At Saline, Michigan-based Hiblow USA, which specializes in linear air pumps for wastewater treatment and septic aerators used broadly across the U.S. on residential wastewater treatment systems serving rural and suburban homes, the company's tariff bill reached $1.2 million in 2025. Tim Smith, president, said the uncertainty about the longevity of the tariffs has forced him to stop expansion plans. The southeast Michigan company has 10 employees, and the additional location would have created three to four new jobs. ""We are a small business, and while some may think it's not a lot of jobs, they are good-paying jobs,"" said Smith. 

""We have only passed on 40 percent of our costs to customers,"" Smith said. ""It has become a competitive battle between companies to see who can hold out and burn through more cash and absorb these tariffs. But I think no one can keep holding out and absorb the tariffs over the long-term,"" he added.

The company imports its product from the Philippines. The country has yet to strike a deal on tariffs with the U.S. though on Monday, a 19% tariff on Philippine goods was discussed in Manila by representatives for the countries. 

Smith said changing tariff rates have also put additional strain on his customs brokers. ""We had to renew our Customs bonds two or three times, because we needed to add more funds to the bonds,"" said Smith. ""That delayed us from getting some of our containers, because the bond was in limbo. You can't process anything without your Customs bonds.""

Customs bonds, also known as surety bonds, provide coverage to importers guaranteeing the payment of duties and taxes levied on imported goods. The value of these bonds and related collateral has soared alongside the steepening tariffs levied by the Trump administration. If a bond has insufficient funds, the importer cannot take ownership of their freight. 

Even if the Supreme Court rules that many of Trump's tariffs are illegal and requires refunds paid to businesses, with a decision possible on Feb. 20, Smith says he knows that the Trump administration has another set of tariffs waiting, so there will be no cash flow relief.

""We have always gotten our money refunded through Customs with no problem,"" Smith said. ""Sometimes it took up to a year, but there certainly is a framework there to do so. But what I can tell you is we are certainly not making any business plans based on a ruling that we could get our money back. There are more tariffs on the way if they are ruled illegal.""

In New York, toy store owner Jennifer Bergman closed her West Side Kids, which was founded by her mother, after 44 years of operation because of the tariffs. ""The majority of our toys are manufactured in China, so the tariff costs took over our business,"" said Bergman. ""We were constantly getting emails from our vendors on price increases, and as a result, we had to increase our prices.""

One example was her scooter orders. Bergman said the business normally sold $50,000 in scooters every year. After the tariffs, she didn't have a scooter priced under $200, which not only impacted her sales but her inventories. ""Scooter prices went up $30,"" Bergman said. ""I got a phone call from my scooter company, and they told me they were rerouting their containers to Canada because of the tariffs, and they were no longer bringing them in until the tariffs were lower,"" she added.

At the end of May, Bergman said she started looking at her numbers and realized she would not be able to make July rent. ""June was typically one of my busiest months ... but June was just deadly. I couldn't afford the inventory to sell. I called my landlord, and luckily, we had a 44-year-old relationship with my landlord, and I said, I have to close."" 

Bergman's store closed at the end of July.

In Tempe, Arizona, Brick Road Coffee opened during the pandemic in 2021. Gabe Hagen, co-founder and CEO of the coffee shop and roasting company, said he is thankful now that the tariffs on coffee have been eliminated, but he still has coffee at the higher tariff price.

""We order 4,000 pounds of coffee monthly, primarily for two shops, and face increased costs due to tariffs on green coffee and other supplies,"" said Hagen. ""Despite absorbing costs at the coffee shop, unfortunately for our roasting business, we had to raise prices.""

Before the tariffs, Hagen said wholesale customers were paying around $10 a pound for roasted coffee beans. Now, customers are paying around $13.50 a pound, and he hopes it has peaked.

Coffee tariffs have seen significant, rapid shifts. Initial 10%–50% duties ranged from the higher end on Brazil (50 percent), to lower tariffs on India (25 percent), Vietnam (20 percent), and Indonesia (19 percent). 

In a November 2025 executive order, most of these tariffs, including those on Brazil, were removed, but Hagen said the tariffs have created lingering effects. His company has mitigated tariff expenses by delaying store expansion and purchasing roasting equipment before the tariffs went into effect. ""We were going into a time where cash is going to be king, and as a small business, I just don't have a ton of it,"" Hagen said. ""So I had to cut to try to preserve and give me the longest runway possible to navigate the uncertainty.""

Hagen says consumers are weakened based on his company's sales activity. ""We are seeing our average ticket go down,"" he said. ""Even though our foot traffic is staying relatively stable year over year, our gross is actually lower year over year. Consumers are tightening their wallets, and they are not buying the add-ons like the muffins. Our Q4 was terrible. It was the worst in the four years that we have been open,"" he said.

Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer of One Point BFG Wealth Partners, says the ""PTSD from the prior spike in inflation has flared up again. And if not fully passed on to consumers, businesses have absorbed it through lower profit margins. ... The tariff pain is real, just ask any business and/or consumer. Inflation is the main economic pain point so I think it definitely will be a key issue.""

In this article

Bitcoin's short-lived bounce faded on Wednesday as the volatility in the world's largest cryptocurrency continued.

Bitcoin was trading at around $66,166 at 10:21 a.m. ET on Wednesday, down roughly 4% on the day. 

The digital coin has been on a downward trajectory since hitting an all-time high above $126,000 in October with the sell-off intensifying over the last month. Bitcoin dropped below $70,000 on Feb. 5 and slid to hold just above $60,000, which is seen as a key level.

Bitcoin then recovered from those lows and was back above $70,000, but has struggled to push higher from that, remaining in the range of $66,000 and $72,000.

On Thursday, bitcoin was around 47% lower than its record high.

Several factors have weighed on crypto markets, including volatility in technology stocks in the U.S., with which crypto assets often move in tandem with. 

Meanwhile, the Feb. 5 sell-off was triggered by a wave of liquidations — when traders are forced to close positions if the price of bitcoin hits a certain point. This has a cascading effect, which can exacerbate selling. Those liqudiations have since slowed down.

Investors are also considering whether there will be a shift in U.S. monetary policy following U.S. President Donald Trump's nomination of Kevin Warsh for Fed chair late last month. 

Selling from issuers of bitcoin exchange-traded funds, or ETFs, which are large holders of the digital coin,  led to outflows from these ETFs. That added to the pressure on the digital coin. However, in the last three days, bitcoin ETFs have recorded net inflows.

Market participants are looking at whether bitcoin's typical cycle is intact. This refers to the historical pattern after an event known as halving, which often leads to new all-time highs for the cryptocurrency and a subsequent crash before new highs.

Bitcoin's halving — an event written into its code that happens every four years —reduces the rewards given to bitcoin miners and effectively slows down the supply of bitcoin on the market. The supply squeeze typically precedes rallies to fresh record highs for bitcoin. The most recent halving took place in April 2024. 

There has been a debate as to whether the typical bitcoin cycle is over or if the patterns are breaking. But investors and analysts suggest the cycle is very much intact. 

""2026 I expect to be a bear leg to the four-year cycle,"" Steven McClurg, CEO of Canary Capital, told CNBC on Wednesday. ""We have experienced several four-year cycles since bitcoin has launched and this is no different than any other."" 

McClurg added that he expects bitcoin to fall to as low as $50,000 in the summer before ""things turn around in the fall."" 

Markus Thielen of 10X Research told CNBC last week that bitcoin could fall to the $50,000 level.

In this article

The CEO of French energy major TotalEnergies said it was ""too expensive and too polluting"" to return to Venezuela, despite calls from U.S. President Donald Trump for Big Oil to invest billions in the country. 

The company quit Venezuela in 2022 but the Trump administration has urged oil majors to return since the U.S. military operation to seize the country's president, Nicolás Maduro, on Jan. 3.

Speaking on Wednesday, TotalEnergies CEO Patrick Pouyanné told reporters the company quit the country ""because it clashed with our strategy. It was too expensive and too polluting and that is still the case."" The comments were reported by Reuters.

A spokesperson for TotalEnergies was not immediately available for comment when contacted by CNBC.

The Trump administration has called on U.S. energy giants to invest $100 billion to rebuild Venezuela's oil industry.

Trump has pledged to support American oil companies that invest in Venezuela with government security assistance, saying last month that energy firms previously had problems ""because they didn't have Trump as a president.""

Venezuela boasts the world's largest oil reserves but some U.S. oil firms have expressed caution about rushing to re-enter — including Exxon Mobil.

Exxon CEO Darren Woods recently made headlines for saying at a White House meeting with Trump that the Venezuelan market is ""uninvestable"" in its current state.

Trump subsequently lashed out at Woods, threatening to sideline the oil giant and accusing the company of ""playing too cute."" 

TotalEnergies started operating in Venezuela in the 1990s. Its departure followed a strategic shift away from heavy and high-sulfur crude and amid safety concerns. Pouyanné has previously said that Venezuela is not high on the firm's agenda.  

""There are infrastructure constraints, a lot of them,"" Amar Singh, global crude oil markets analyst at Barclays, told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Europe"" on Wednesday, when asked about Venezuela's investment case. 

""But even before we get to that point of the conversation, we first need to see what is going on with the regime change. How quickly can we transition to a democratic system?"" Singh said.

""We have seen some reforms already, but this is a long process and, in our view, even if everything goes smooth, the most optimistic scenario we only see Venezuelan output growing by 200,000 to 300,000 barrels per day by the end of this year,"" he added.

TotalEnergies on Wednesday reported a slight drop in fourth-quarter profit and reduced share buybacks amid a weaker crude price environment.

Shares of the Paris-listed company rose nearly 2% during morning deals, notching a new 52-week high.

CNBC is now accepting nominations for the 2026 Disruptor 50 list. Submit a nomination before February 23.

In this article

Apptronik has raised $520 million in funding at a $5 billion valuation as the startup aims to commercialize its humanoid Apollo robots, potentially beating Chinese competitors and Tesla's Optimus to the market.

The new funding, announced on Wednesday, brings Apptronik's series A funding round to $935 million. B Capital, chaired by Howard Morgan, co-led the deal with Google.

Located in Austin, Texas, where Tesla is also headquartered, Apptronik is reeling in cash to refine and start producing more of its Apollo humanoids, CEO Jeff Cardenas told CNBC. 

Early versions of the company's Apollo robots are currently working within designated areas in factories and warehouses run by Apptronik strategic partners, including Mercedes-Benz, GXO Logistics and Jabil.

The designated areas are defined by external sensors and so-called light curtains, Cardenas said, meaning an Apollo in the area will pause if a human steps across a boundary. Cardenas said that in the future, the Apollo will be engineered for ""collaborative safety,"" so the humanoids can slow down, stop, or maneuver alongside other people, just as a human would, while performing tasks like transporting components, sorting and lifting.

Apptronik's competitors include a wide array of humanoid developers, such as China-based Unitree, Figure, Agility Robotics and 1X. Tesla has grand ambitions with Optimus, one of the reasons it's planning to shell out $20 billion on capex in 2026. 

Tesla said it has to ramp up spending to start manufacturing its robots and self-driving cars. But in a recent earnings call, CEO Elon Musk said the Optimus humanoids remain in an early, research and development stage.

Cardenas said that within the field of automation, the allure of humanoids is their versatility, which allows ""one robot to do thousands of tasks, versus a thousand robots doing a single task."" From pilot deployments, Apptronik is able to observe its Apollo in action, gather data from its fleet and use that to refine its systems and the way they work. 

The new funding comes after Apptronik locked in a partnership with Google DeepMind and began working with its Gemini Robotics AI models, which underpin Apollo's capabilities.

Apptronik ranked 33rd on the 2025 CNBC Disruptor 50 list. The company began in the Human Centered Robotics Lab at the University of Texas in 2016, well before Tesla began talking up humanoid robotics. Apptronik now has 300 employees. 

Cardenas said the company will use some of the fresh capital to expand its footprint in Austin, and open a new office in California later this year, while working to get its robots and facilities ready for mass production.

Unlike Musk, who's known for making lofty promises, Cardenas prefers not to make many public predictions about Apollo. He declined to say when the robots will be widely produced and what capabilities they will have when they first ship. 

Apptronik will reveal more later this year about what its robots will and won't be able to do, Cardenas said.

Morgan was more forthcoming about his expectations for the company, and said demand for the Apollo is already apparent. He said he expects orders for $1 billion worth of robots starting in 2027, when he hopes the company will be delivering Apollo in high volumes for roughly $80,000 a year, about the price of a luxury car.

""Think about a factory worker doing three or four shifts, and on any weekend,"" Morgan said. ""Eighty-thousand is cheap!""

Morgan also said he expects Apptronik to hire at least another 200 people in the next year, and that the company needed to lock in the new funds now given the excitement around humanoid robotics. 

""You do need to have enough so you can be taken seriously by everybody,"" Morgan said. ""Google is spending a lot and we're partnering with them, so we'll get the benefit of that.""

In this article

Dutch brewer Heineken is planning to lay off up to up to 7% of its workforce, as it looks to boost efficiency through productivity savings from AI, following weak beer sales last year. 

The world's second-largest brewer reported lackluster earnings on Wednesday, with total beer volumes declining 2.4% over the course of 2025, while adjusted operating profit was up 4.4%. 

The company also said it plans to cut between 5,000 and 6,000 roles over the next two years and is targeting operating profit growth in the range of 2% to 6% this year. Heineken's shares were last seen up 3.4%, and the stock is up nearly 7% so far this year. 

Outgoing CEO Dolf van den Brink told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Europe"" on Wednesday that the results were due to ""challenging market circumstances,"" but performance was overall well-balanced. 

Heineken's outlook for 2026 comes in below the usual range but ""is in line with buyside expectations and consistent with peer Carlsberg, and prudent in light of a new incoming,"" UBS analysts said in a note on Wednesday. 

Regarding the cuts, Van den Brink said: ""Productivity has been a top priority in our evergreen strategy... we committed to 400 to 500 million euros ($476 million to $600 million) of savings on an annual basis, and this is a first operationalization of that debt commitment."" 

The job reductions will help the brewer to invest in growth and in its premium brands, he said.

Van den Brink acknowledged that the cuts came ""partly also due to AI, or let's say digitization."" 

""That's a very big part of our EverGreen 2030 strategy, with around 3,000 roles moving to our business services, where technology digitization in general, and AI specifically, will be an important part of ongoing productivity savings,"" he said.

The EverGreen 2030 strategy focuses on three core areas, including accelerating growth, increasing productivity, and future-fit. 

The company, headquartered in the Netherlands, has 87,000 employees and operates in over 70 countries. 

Van den Brink is due to step down from his leadership position in May after six years at the helm. Heineken is currently searching for a successor. 

AI layoffs have dominated headlines over the past year, and remain a top focus for businesses and leaders going into 2026. 

In the U.S., AI contributed to nearly 55,000 layoffs in the U.S. in 2025, according to December data from consulting firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas. 

Firms that cited AI in layoffs in 2025 range from Amazon, which announced 15,000 cuts last year, to Salesforce, with CEO Marc Benioff saying he let go of 4,000 customer support workers as AI was supposedly doing 50% of the work at the company.

Some European companies that cited AI in restructuring strategies were airline group Lufthansa and tech consultancy firm Accenture. 

Kristalina Georgieva, managing director at the International Monetary Fund, told CNBC at the World Economic Forum in January that AI is  ""hitting the labor market like a tsunami"" and warned that ""most countries and most businesses are not prepared for it."" 

— CNBC's Steve Sedgwick, Karen Tso, and Ben Boulos contributed to this report.

Correction: This story has been updated to correct the U.S. dollar conversion of Heineken's planned annual savings.

In this article

Shares of French software giant Dassault Systèmes plummeted as much as 21% in early trade on Wednesday, putting the stock on track for its worst trading day ever. 

By 9:30 a.m. in London, the Paris-listed shares pared deeper losses to trade around 18% lower, after trading of the stock was briefly suspended at the open. 

It came after the company published its fourth-quarter earnings on Wednesday morning, which showed revenues from software dropped 5% in the final three months of last year. 

For the full year, total revenue was flat at a weaker-than-expected 6.24 billion euros ($7.43 billion), and software revenue also showed little growth at 5.64 billion euros. 

Analysts had been expecting total revenues to hit 6.3 billion euros, according to LSEG data. 

The company also set guidance of revenue growth in the range of 3% to 5% for 2026. 

Dassault Systèmes ""will lead the Industrial AI transformation"" through its industrial AI offering 3D UNIV+RSES,"" CEO Pascal Daloz said in a statement alongside the results. 

""This is not a short-term goal. It is a long-term commitment to redefine how industries innovate, operate, and compete,"" he said. ""In 2025 and 2026, we are focused on disciplined execution, aligning resources around our strategic priorities to deliver measurable, industry-defining impact.""

Software companies were at the center of markets' AI fears last week, as new artificial intelligence tools from Anthropic triggered a sell-off of software-as-a-service and data provider stocks. Over the course of the week, Dassault Systèmes shares shed more than 4% of their value. 

Aoifinn Devitt, senior investment advisor at Moneta, said that Dassault Systèmes' sharp fall on Wednesday is just the latest example of the so-called ""SaaS apocalypse"" trade. 

""There is really a concern right now around some of those winners that led the charge last year,"" Devitt told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Europe.""

The earnings report was ""a weak finish and a weak guide,"" for the company, analysts at UBS said in a Wednesday note.

""[Dassault] talks of 'aligning the organisation to focus' on execution,"" they said. ""Having set a goal to grow at least 7% pa from 2024-29, the guidance means [the company] now needs to grow 8.2-8.9% in 2027-29.""

Oops, something went wrong

(Bloomberg) -- Bitcoin has just drawn fresh support from some of its largest holders, though the return of demand remains narrow enough to raise doubts about whether it marks a recovery or mere damage control.

So-called whale wallets accumulated about 53,000 coins in the past week, their biggest buying spree since November, after weeks of heavy selling. Those kinds of purchases helped steady prices after a steep drawdown, even as most other investors stayed on the sidelines.

Data from industry research firm Glassnode show that wallets holding more than 1,000 Bitcoin added more than $4 billion worth of the token over the period, interrupting months of divestment that have left Bitcoin roughly 40% below its October peak.

“It does slow down any downfall,” said Brett Singer, head of sales at Glassnode. “But we still need to see more money coming into the market.”

That caveat matters. While large holders have stepped back in, the broader trend still points to caution. Excluding exchange-traded funds and exchanges, large Bitcoin-holding players have been net sellers over the past year, with more than 170,000 coins — worth some $11 billion — leaving these wallets since mid-December, according to Glassnode.

Bitcoin's price action reflects that uneven support. Since reaching a record high in October, the token slid last week to around $60,000, before rebounding to roughly $70,000. It was trading above $69,100 at 9 a.m. in Singapore on Wednesday.

The stop-and-start behavior among large holders has sharpened a familiar question hanging over the market: who, exactly, is left to power the next sustained rally?

Many investors who bought Bitcoin through newly launched exchange-traded funds are now sitting on losses, making them less inclined to add aggressively. At the same time, publicly listed companies that had embraced Bitcoin as a reserve asset have slowed their purchases as their own share prices have come under pressure.

Without a fresh source of demand, the latest accumulation looks more like damage control than renewed conviction — a pattern that has supported short-term rebounds in past cycles but rarely produced lasting momentum on its own.

“When the storm clears, we'll be buying again, as we sold some before the end of last year,” said Bruno Ver, a long-time crypto investor. “But we're still in the storm now.”

The Glassnode data track clusters of Bitcoin wallets rather than individual traders, and can include large private investors, custodial firms and institution-linked accounts. Past rallies that went on to gather strength were typically marked by steadier accumulation and broader participation across investor types — something that remains notably absent in the current downturn.

The initial note sent by Nancy's kidnappers demanded $6 million to be paid to the Bitcoin account by Feb. 9

Savannah Guthrie/Instagram

 Activity has been observed in the Bitcoin account connected with a ransom note sent following the disappearance of Nancy Guthrie, the mother of Today co-host Savannah Guthrie, who has been missing for 10 days.


 A source confirms to PEOPLE that a small amount of money, in the ""hundreds of dollars,"" has been transmitted to the Bitcoin wallet connected with the initial ransom note, which was sent to multiple media outlets, including local news outlet KGUN and TMZ. TMZ was first to report the activity in the Bitcoin wallet on Tuesday, Feb. 10.


 The activity in the wallet is ""less than $300,"" according to KGUN.


 An individual was also detained by police for questioning in connection with Nancy's abduction, police said on Tuesday.


 The Pima County Sheriff's Department detained the individual in a location south of Tucson. Officials are preparing to search a location linked to the individual, per ABC News, which was first to report the news. The subject was detained during a traffic stop south of Tucson, the Pima County Sheriff's Department said in a statement.


Pima County Sheriff's Department

 As previously reported by PEOPLE, the first alleged ransom note was sent on the evening of Feb. 2, one day after Nancy was reported missing. It included a description of a damaged floodlight and the location of an Apple Watch left behind in her house, along with a demand for $4 million to be paid to the Bitcoin account by Feb. 5.


 If the initial demand was not met, the ransom note allegedly demanded $6 million, to be paid by Feb. 9.


 On Feb. 9, after the 5 p.m. local time deadline had passed, an FBI spokesperson said that the agency was ""not aware"" of any ""continued"" contact between the Guthrie family and the alleged kidnappers.


 News of activity in the Bitcoin account follows an extensive search earlier on Feb. 10, in which multiple law enforcement agencies combed the neighborhood where Savannah's sister, Annie Guthrie, lives.


 The search came hours after authorities released multiple images and video of an armed subject believed to be involved in Nancy's disappearance. In the images, a person can be seen with a mask over their face wearing gloves, Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos said in a post on X, noting that the subject appears to have tampered with the victim's doorbell camera.

 ""Working with our partners — as of this morning, law enforcement has uncovered these previously inaccessible new images showing an armed individual appearing to have tampered with the camera at Nancy Guthrie's front door the morning of her disappearance,"" Nanos' post continued.


 Nancy was last seen at her Tucson, Ariz. home after being dropped off by her family at 9:48 p.m. on Saturday, Jan. 31. The mother of three is believed to have been taken against her will in the early morning hours of Sunday, Feb. 1, authorities said previously.

South Korea's Bithum admitted Wednesday that severe flaws left the trading platform's internal system wide open to potential sabotage and that it failed to prevent the mistaken transfer of $40 billion in bitcoin to customers, according to Reuters.

The blunder, which triggered the price of bitcoin to plunge by 17% on Bithumb, according to Reuters, consisted of the country's second-largest crypto trading platform accidentally giving away 620,000 bitcoins to customers instead of just 620,000 won (roughly $428).

The Financial Supervisory Service said Sunday it will start investigations into “high-risk” practices that undermine market order, including large-scale price manipulation by so-called whales, trading schemes tied to suspended deposits and withdrawals and coordinated pump tactics fueled by social media misinformation. The watchdog also said it plans to build tools that automatically extract suspicious trading patterns at the second and minute levels, alongside text-analysis systems using artificial intelligence to flag potential market abuse.

Bithumb CEO Lee Jae-won said the giveaway amounted to 15 times the crypto trading platform's 42,000 bitcoins, mainly due to a 24-hour lag in processing transactions and delayed updates to its crypto holdings balance. ""We are acutely aware of the deficiency in internal system control,"" Lee told a parliamentary committee hearing recently.

The CEO admitted that Bithum's policy of ensuring the volume of assets to be transferred matched its actual holdings failed, and that the amount was not earmarked in a separate account to ensure the transfer's safety.

The exchange has recovered most of the bitcoin, although 1,786 that were sold within minutes before the exchange froze customers' accounts are still missing, the Reuters report added. The customers who sold those missing bitcoin are legally bound to return them.

Members of parliament expressed dismay at the lack of government and corporate oversight in the country's virtual assets market, which is one of the most active in the world by trading volume. According to a recent report, cryptocurrency has become a primary investment asset in South Korea, with investor numbers rising to 10 million and exchanges such as Upbit and Bithumb generating revenues in the trillions of won.

Robinhood said on Tuesday that developers will begin experimenting with applications on its Ethereum layer-2 network, alongside the debut of a public testnet for Robinhood Chain.

That will create a low-stakes environment for developers to assess the network's technical merits as it's folded into the retail brokerage's business, according to a press release.

Robinhood's vision for embracing decentralized finance is broad, but the company is particularly interested in how compatible so-called stock tokens are with traditional workflows, according to Johann Kerbrat, senior vice president and general manager of Robinhood Crypto.

“We don't want to make it another [layer-2 network] that is just about scaling,” he told Decrypt. “We're actually using this underlying technology to actually rebuild some of our systems.”

Layer-2 networks have been traditionally viewed as a way to improve Ethereum's overall performance, yet Robinhood is embracing the technology as a way to expand its services, while carving out its own corner of the broader crypto ecosystem to engage customers in.

Kerbrat said the testnet phase is aimed at developers familiar with building products like perpetual futures exchanges and lending platforms, but also institutions, who may be interested in eventually using Robinhood's networks to offer products of their own.

Eight months ago, the company rolled out stock tokens for customers in Europe, which provide investors with synthetic exposure to U.S. stocks, as well as private companies. Kebrat said Robinhood wants to expand that service to as many jurisdictions as possible.

Still, investors currently have limited access to tokenized assets in the U.S., with the Securities and Exchange Commission currently crafting guidance around digital representations of real-world assets. Coinbase is among crypto-natives racing to bring similar products to market.

“We are going to be pretty careful about the rollouts,” Kerbrat said.

Following the stock tokens rollout last year, Kerbrat described the testnet phase as a critical step. It will inform the company's vision for facilitating round-the-clock trading, with crypto serving as a backbone, he said.

“We're using [Robinhood Chain] for stock token trading, which is really the way to mimic what we are doing in the U.S.,” he added. “We are not stopping at crypto trading.”

Coinbase and Kraken have developed layer-2 networks using a tech stack offered by OP Labs, the team behind Optimism. Robinhood is taking a different approach, by modeling its network on an Ethereum scaling network created by Offchain Labs called Arbitrum.

“With Arbitrum's developer-friendly technology, Robinhood Chain is well-positioned to help the industry deliver the next chapter of tokenization,” Offchain Labs co-founder and CEO Steven Goldfeder said in a statement.

Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Ripple (XRP) show signs of cautious stabilization on Wednesday after failing to close above their key resistance levels earlier this week. BTC trades below $69,000, while ETH and XRP also encountered rejection near major resistance levels. With no immediate bullish catalyst, the top three cryptocurrencies continue to show no clear signs of a sustained recovery.

Bitcoin retested the daily resistance at $73,072 on Sunday and has declined slightly by 2.24% through Tuesday. As of Wednesday, BTC is trading below $69,000.

If BTC continues its downward trend, it could extend the decline toward the 78.6% Fibonacci retracement (drawn from the August 2024 low of $49,000 to the October 2025 all-time high of $126,199) at $65,520.

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the daily chart is at 31, pointing downward toward the oversold territory, suggesting bearish momentum is gaining traction. In addition, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) in the same period shows a bearish crossover, suggesting a continuation of the downward trend.

On the contrary, if BTC recovers, it could extend the advance toward the daily resistance at $73,072.

Ethereum retested and was rejected by the 78.6% Fibonacci retracement level at $2,149 on Monday, and declined nearly 4% the next day. As of writing on Wednesday, ETH is trading at $2,012.

If ETH continues its downward trend, it could extend the decline toward Friday's low at $1,747.

Like Bitcoin, Ethereum's RSI and MACD also support a bearish outlook.

However, if ETH breaks and closes above $2,149 on a daily basis, it could extend the advance toward the next resistance at $2,500.

XRP revisited the broken trendline boundary of a falling wedge on Friday and has been facing rejection around this level through Tuesday. As of Wednesday, XRP is trading below $1.40.

If XRP continues its downward trend, it could extend the decline toward the weekly support at $1.30.

Like Ethereum, XRP's momentum indicators (RSI and MACD) are also projecting a bearish outlook.

If XRP breaks and closes above the lower boundary of this pattern, it could extend the rally toward the 50-day Exponential Moving Average at $1.79.

Token launches influence demand and adoption among market participants. Listings on crypto exchanges deepen the liquidity for an asset and add new participants to an asset's network. This is typically bullish for a digital asset. 

A hack is an event in which an attacker captures a large volume of the asset from a DeFi bridge or hot wallet of an exchange or any other crypto platform via exploits, bugs or other methods. The exploiter then transfers these tokens out of the exchange platforms to ultimately sell or swap the assets for other cryptocurrencies or stablecoins. Such events often involve an en masse panic triggering a sell-off in the affected assets.

Macroeconomic events like the US Federal Reserve's decision on interest rates influence crypto assets mainly through the direct impact they have on the US Dollar. An increase in interest rate typically negatively influences Bitcoin and altcoin prices, and vice versa. If the US Dollar index declines, risk assets and associated leverage for trading gets cheaper, in turn driving crypto prices higher.

Halvings are typically considered bullish events as they slash the block reward in half for miners, constricting the supply of the asset. At consistent demand if the supply reduces, the asset's price climbs.

Ripple (XRP) is edging lower around $1.36 at the time of writing on Wednesday, weighed down by low retail interest and macroeconomic uncertainty, which is accelerating risk-off sentiment.

Bitcoin is down 15% in February and looks poised to extend its losses toward the yearly low of $60,000. Ethereum and Ripple are following in Bitcoin's footsteps, weighed down by a weak derivatives market. 

Hyerliquid (HYPE) drops to its 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at $28.85 at the time of writing on Wednesday, extending a decline of roughly 10% so far this week. 

Stellar is trading below $0.160 at the time of writing on Wednesday, extending its correction for the fifth consecutive day. The bearish price action is further supported by rising short bets and declining Open Interest in the derivatives market. 

Bitcoin (BTC) is wrapping up 2025 as one of its most eventful years, defined by unprecedented institutional participation, major regulatory developments, and extreme price volatility.

Bitcoin (BTC) price recovers slightly, trading at $65,000 at the time of writing on Friday, after reaching a low of $60,000 during the early Asian trading session. The Crypto King remained under pressure so far this week, posting three consecutive weeks of losses exceeding 30%.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=ethereum","Ethereum ETF holders still ‘diamond-handing' despite hurting more than their bitcoin counterparts","https://sherwood.news/crypto/ethereum-etf-holders-still-diamond-handing-despite-hurting-more-than-their/","Wed, 11 Feb 2026 16:36:38 GMT","

Holders of spot ethereum ETFs are in more pain than bitcoin investors. 

The price of ethereum stands around $1,940 as of Wednesday morning, representing about a 45% drop from $3,500, the average cost basis of spot ethereum ETF holders, according to Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart. 

The losses of ethereum ETF holders are larger than bitcoin fund investors based on available data. Bitcoin is trading at $68,822, representing an 18% slide from the the cost basis for all its ETFs of $83,983, data from Glassnode shows. 

While facing larger losses than their bitcoin ETF peers, the vast majority of ethereum ETF buyers have stayed put. “The net inflows into the ETH ETFs have gone from about $15 billion down below $12 billion. This is a much worse selloff than the Bitcoin ETFs on a relative basis, but still fairly decent diamond hands in grand scheme (for now),” Seyffart said on Tuesday on X.

Bitcoin is resting on a 200-week EMA, “a key level that systematic and momentum trading strategies look at.”

Over the last 12 years, Bill Barhydt has lived through “multiple 70% bitcoin drawdowns.”

Despite having an early lead in year-to-date gains, meme coins have round-tripped and bled even more. 

For example, frog-based token pepe was up 75% in the first four days of January, but is now about 8% lower than where it started the year. Dogecoin, shiba inu, bonk, pengu, dogwifhat, and trump tell a similar story: posting a positive gain and then slumping into the red. 

Meme coins, cryptocurrencies based on internet jokes that are often critiqued for lacking utility, are reflexive: they can lead gains during bullish market conditions, but see sharper declines in bearish ones. The entire category of meme coins has shed 25.8% of its valuation in the year so far, data from blockchain analytics firm Artemis shows.

The price action of meme coins comes amid a broader market decline that saw bitcoin drop to $63,000 last week as its peers revisited cycle lows.  

“The market has, in large, been bleeding, whether major, altcoin, or meme,” according to Nicolai Søndergaard, research analyst at on-chain data firm Nansen. “It is not surprising to me to see that larger memes as well have been trending down.”

He told Sherwood News, “If we also consider the fact that there are less active wallets now compared to a few months ago, it also makes sense that larger ‘household' memes would decline as money shifts around to the next shiny thing.” 

Another analyst noted that at a price level of $70,000, 9.3 million bitcoin are now underwater, the highest level since January 2023.

XRP is seeing the strongest relief bounce on Friday among its peers following the broad market downturn in crypto.  

XRP hit its lowest mark since 2024 on Thursday, but the price of the cryptocurrency has increased roughly 20% in the last 24 hours, outpacing Bitcoin and ethereum, which have seen 6.5% and 5.2% gains, respectively. Dogecoin has climbed 8% and  solana is up 5% in the same period, data from CoinGecko shows.

XRP's “price tends to amplify market movements,” Kaiko research analyst Thomas Probst told Sherwood News. “Markets are experiencing a phase of liquidity contraction with increasing volatility. Therefore, rebounds can be frequent, even if they are rarely sustained over the long term.”

The relief comes amid increased activity on the XRP Ledger. Crypto analytics firm Santiment flagged that, during the dip, XRP Ledger saw a four-month high of “whale transactions” over $100,000 and a six-month high of unique addresses on the network in one eight-hour candle. “These are both major signals of a price reversal for any asset,” the firm said. 

Ripple, the company closely tied to XRP and its largest holder, said in a Thursday blog post that XRP is “at the heart of every institutional use case,” such as stablecoin payments, tokenized collateral, and lending markets. 

In an updated road map for the XRP Ledger, the firm outlined upcoming features that act as a “building block for composable financial ecosystems.” These features include a lending protocol, confidential transfers using zero-knowledge proofs, and a new layer of programmability to escrow primitives. 

Meanwhile, spot XRP ETFs absorbed $5.9 million worth of inflows on Thursday, helping the week remain in the black at nearly $24 million.","{'href': 'https://sherwood.news', 'title': 'Sherwood News'}","cryptocurrency"

After several consecutive days of trading sideways between $68,000 and $72,000, bitcoin's floor gave in hours ago and the asset dipped below $67,000 for the first time since Friday.

Most altcoins have joined the ride south, with ETH dumping beneath $2,000, XRP trading below $1.40, and BNB struggling to remain above $600.

It's safe to say that the past couple of weeks have been highly unfavorable for the crypto bulls. On January 28, exactly two weeks ago, bitcoin stood tall at $90,000. However, it charted a notable price correction since then that lasted days and culminated, at least for now, last Friday.

At the time, the cryptocurrency plunged by approximately $17,000 in just over 24 hours and dumped to $60,000 on Friday morning. This became its lowest price point since before the US presidential elections in November 2024. The bulls were quick to intervene at this point and helped BTC rebound to $72,000 on that same day.

The weekend was calmer, with bitcoin trading sideways between $68,000 and $72,000. It tried to take down the upper boundary but failed on Monday and Tuesday and the subsequent rejection drove it south to under $67,000 where it currently struggles as well.

Its market capitalization has declined to $1.340 trillion on CG, while its dominance over the alts has dropped below 57%.

Most alts have suffered even more over the past day. Ethereum has lost the $2,000 support after a 3.2% decline. A 4.1% drop from XRP has driven it to well below $1.40, while BNB is down to $600 after a 5% decrease.

SOL, ADA, HYPE, DOGE, LINK, LTC, and many other larger-cap alts are also in the red, while XMR has defied the trend today with a 3% increase to over $340.

Pi Network's native token has charted another all-time low, while MYX is down by over 12%. BGB is next in terms of daily losses with a 9% drop. In contrast, ZRO has entered the top 100 alts after skyrocketing by 20%.

The total crypto market cap has shed over $50 billion daily and is down to $2.350 trillion on CG.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=blockchain","Robinhood starts testing its own blockchain as crypto and tokenization push deepens","https://www.coindesk.com/business/2026/02/11/robinhood-starts-testing-its-own-blockchain-as-crypto-and-tokenization-push-deepens","Wed, 11 Feb 2026 12:36:03 GMT","

HONG KONG — Robinhood launched its public testnet for its own Ethereum layer-2 blockchain on Wednesday with plans for broader launch later this year as the brokerage app aims to move more trading activity onchain.

The new network, called Robinhood Chain, is built on Arbitrum and is designed to support tokenized real-world assets, including equities, exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and other assets. Developers will be able to publicly build on the network for the first time after six months of private testing, ahead of a future mainnet launch, the company announced at CoinDesk's Consensus Hong Kong conference.

With the chain, Robinhood aims to allow users to trade 24/7 and self-custody their assets in Robinhood's own crypto wallet. Users will also be able to bridge across different chains and to decentralized finance (DeFi) applications on Ethereum ETH$1,950.42, the company said in a press release.

The timing comes as Ethereum's core roadmap shifts more attention back to the base layer. Certain upgrades have already lowered transaction costs, and further improvements are expected to continue easing congestion, a development that weakens the case for layer-2s as a pure scaling necessity.

Robinhood's approach suggests it is already operating under that assumption.

“I think Vitalik [Buterin, the co-founder of Ethereum] was always pretty clear on this, that L2s were not just here to scale Ethereum,” said Johann Kerbrat, Robinhood's senior vice president and general manager of crypto, in an interview with CoinDesk.

“For us, it was never really about scaling Ethereum or doing faster transactions,” Kerbrat added.

The move builds on Robinhood's earlier steps into tokenization. Last year, the company rolled out token versions of U.S. stocks and ETFs for European users with dividend payments and extended market hours.

Those assets — almost 2,000 stocks and ETFs, according to data by Entropy Advisors on Dune Analytics — were initially issued on Arbitrum. However, the $15 million in total value of the equity tokens Robinhood minted is lagging behind leading issuers xStocks and Ondo Global Markets.

When rollups — ways of processing transactions on layer-2 networks to ease congestion on the base network — first gained traction, they were widely framed as Ethereum's answer to high fees and limited throughput. As Ethereum's layer-1 capacity improves, that narrative is giving way to a different one: layer-2s as customizable, application-specific environments that can embed features difficult to implement on Ethereum itself.

“What we wanted was the security of Ethereum, the liquidity that is available on EVM chains and the Ethereum ecosystem,” Kerbrat said. “But we were also wanting to have a way to customize the chain and to make it really optimized for traditional assets being tokenized.”

Rather than competing with other high-speed trading-focused rollups, Robinhood Chain is being designed around tokenized equities and other regulated financial products, where compliance requirements vary by jurisdiction.

“The complexity to recreate the entire financial system, and on top of that to bring more things on it, makes it that I think chains are going to specialize,” Kerbrat said. “You'll see chains that are more specialized for payments, and you'll see chains like ours that are going to be more specialized around tokenized equity.”

Buterin has recently argued that some rollups may need to accept different decentralization trade-offs, particularly when compliance or real-world assets are involved, a view that has stirred debate across the ecosystem.

For Robinhood, Kerbrat said, that shift does not materially change its strategy.

“It doesn't really change anything for us,” he said. “We've always been building with the idea that there are different compliance requirements based on the jurisdiction, and all these things can be embedded into the chain.”

Robinhood first announced plans for its own blockchain in June 2025, positioning the project as part of a broader push into tokenization and onchain finance. Since then, development has largely taken place out of public view.

With the testnet now live, developers can access network entry points, documentation, and standard Ethereum development tools. Ahead of mainnet, Robinhood plans to expand testnet functionality to include test-only assets, including stock tokens, along with deeper integrations with its wallet and other onchain financial tooling.

Las Vegas, Nevada, February 11th, 2026, Chainwire

Ault Capital Group today announced the public testnet launch of Ault Blockchain, a Layer 1 network designed for trading, settlement, and institutional-grade onchain infrastructure. This launch marks the first public release of the protocol and opens access to developers, infrastructure operators, and early network participants.

Ault Blockchain is built as a Cosmos-based Layer 1 with full Ethereum Virtual Machine compatibility, enabling Ethereum-native smart contracts and tooling to run without modification. The network is governed by Ault DAO, which oversees protocol rules, economic parameters, and long-term upgrades through onchain governance.

The public testnet provides a live environment for evaluating core network functionality, validator performance, and infrastructure design. This early access seeks community engagement and feedback by contributors who add value to the network's development and stability. 

In contrast to typical launch models, Ault Blockchain will not conduct a public token sale. Instead, the native AULT token will be distributed exclusively through a protocol-controlled emissions schedule tied to measurable network participation, including consensus security and licensed infrastructure operations rather than speculative activity.
		



Milton “Todd” Ault III, founder and executive chairman of Ault Capital Group, said: “Ault Blockchain was built the opposite way most networks are built. We started with real financial use cases and then designed the blockchain to support them. Participation is based on defined roles and verifiable work, not speculation, with transparent economics that are meant to support long-term network health from day one.”

The network launch is supported by a group of established infrastructure and development partners. B-Harvest serves as Ault Blockchain's primary development partner, contributing to protocol engineering and core network architecture. Xangle focuses on development of Ault's official explorers and relevant hubs.QuickNode provides RPC infrastructure to support network access and reliability. Finally Protofire supports Safe-related tooling across EVM environments. 

Ault Blockchain introduces a licensed participation framework for infrastructure operators. Licensed Mining Nodes are authorized to perform defined off-chain services, beginning with cryptographic randomness at launch. In parallel, Proof-of-Stake validators and delegators secure network consensus and collect transaction fees under transparent, DAO-governed economics. After launch, the core team will shift its focus to the core team's roadmap including spot trading on decentralized exchanges, lending services, perps trading, and other advanced workloads are being explored and may deploy over time as the network evolves. 

Ault Blockchain's testnet launch follows the completion of an initial protocol security audit and precedes further validator onboarding and ecosystem testing. Ault Blockchain's mainnet launch will occur after additional testing milestones are met. At genesis, the chain will launch with its core protocol modules, EVM compatibility, an initial validator set, and onchain governance in place, marking a new era for institutional finance.

Cloud mining, on the other hand, eliminates the need for physical hardware by allowing users to rent mining power from remote data centers. This method is more accessible to beginners, as it requires no technical expertise or equipment management. Users simply purchase a mining contract, and the service provider handles the mining process, including hardware maintenance and electricity costs. While cloud mining offers convenience, it often comes with lower profitability due to service fees and potential risks, such as unreliable providers or fluctuating cryptocurrency prices.

The key difference between the two lies in control and responsibility. Software mining provides complete control over the mining operation but demands significant effort and investment. Cloud mining offers a hands-off approach but comes with less control and potential risks. Choosing between the two depends on your technical skills, budget, and willingness to manage the complexities of mining.

Selecting the right crypto mining software is a critical step in setting up a successful mining operation. The software you choose will directly impact your mining efficiency, profitability, and overall experience. Whether you are a beginner or an experienced miner, understanding the key factors to consider can help you make an informed decision. Below are concise points to guide your choice:

Crypto mining is considered a taxable activity in most jurisdictions, and understanding the tax implications is essential for miners. The income generated from mining is typically classified as taxable income and must be reported to the relevant tax authorities. The value of the cryptocurrency at the time it is mined is used to determine the taxable amount. This is often referred to as the fair market value and is calculated in the local currency based on the cryptocurrency's market price on the day it is received.

Miners may also be subject to capital gains tax when they sell or exchange the mined cryptocurrency. The capital gain or loss is calculated based on the difference between the cryptocurrency's value at the time of mining and its value at the time of sale or exchange. If the cryptocurrency is held for a longer period, some jurisdictions may offer reduced tax rates for long-term capital gains. It is important to keep detailed records of all mining activities, including the date, amount mined, and the fair market value at the time of receipt, to ensure accurate tax reporting.

Crypto mining demands careful selection of software, hardware, and adherence to tax regulations. Efficient tools and accurate record-keeping are critical for optimizing operations. Staying informed on industry developments ensures miners can adapt to changes and maintain profitability. Success in mining relies on strategic planning and consistent execution.

The most profitable crypto mining software depends on your hardware and the cryptocurrency you are mining. Popular options include CGMiner, NiceHash, and Awesome Miner.

Crypto mining software is legal in most countries, but regulations vary. Always check local laws before starting.

Cryptocurrency mining software optimizes hardware performance, increases mining efficiency, and provides tools for monitoring and managing operations.

Crypto mining software ranges from free options to subscription-based services, with costs depending on features and support.

The best software for mining Bitcoin includes CGMiner, BFGMiner, and EasyMiner, depending on your hardware and experience level.

You can mine crypto on a laptop, but it is not recommended due to low efficiency, high energy consumption, and potential hardware damage.

India's largest micro drama platform ropes in cricketer to script next innings.

Published

on

By

MUMBAI: From googlies to plot twists, Yuzvendra Chahal is ready to spin a different kind of story. Story TV, positioned as India's largest micro drama platform, has appointed the Indian cricketer as its chief story officer, marking an unconventional crossover between sport and snackable storytelling. The move signals the platform's ambition to blend pop culture with its rapidly expanding short format content ecosystem.



In his new role, Chahal will collaborate closely with the Story TV team to shape fresh ideas, concepts and narratives across genres. Drawing on his experience as a celebrated sportsperson and public figure, he is expected to bring an insider's lens to stories spanning romance, love, sports, thriller and beyond.



The appointment comes as micro drama continues to gain traction among younger, mobile first audiences who prefer compact, high impact storytelling over long format viewing. Story TV currently boasts a library of more than 600 micro dramas, covering a wide spectrum of themes designed for quick consumption without sacrificing emotional punch.Advertisement
While details of how Chahal's involvement will unfold are expected to be shared soon, the platform has hinted that his association could influence both content development and the broader storytelling approach within the format.



For Chahal, known as much for his on field flair as for his off field personality, the role offers a fresh innings. And for Story TV, bringing a cricketer into the writers' room may just be the twist that keeps viewers hooked for the next episode.

On February 3, 2026, the UK Information Commissioner's Office (“ICO”) publicly confirmed that it has launched formal investigations into X Internet Unlimited Company (“XIUC”) and X.AI LLC (“X.AI”). The Grok artificial intelligence system is the focus of the ICO's investigation, prompted by reports that it was used to create non-consensual sexual imagery involving individuals, including children.

The ICO's inquiry will assess whether Grok's design and deployment adequately considered the risk of generating synthetic images that may result in harm, particularly to children. The ICO indicated that the potential for Grok to generate and distribute sexualized images without permission raises urgent questions about privacy and public safety.

The ICO is now examining the extent to which XIUC and X.AI ensured the lawful, fair and transparent processing of personal data, and whether they incorporated adequate safeguards into Grok's design to prevent misuse leading to harmful manipulated content. As part of its investigation, the ICO will gather evidence from XIUC and X.AI, analyzing their legal justifications and technical design choices, assessing the safeguards in place around the Grok system and closely liaising with the Office of Communications (“Ofcom”), the UK's online safety regulator, and other relevant authorities. The ICO stated that no determination has been made yet regarding potential infringements, and any regulatory action will be based on the evidence and representations received from the companies.

This latest development builds on the ICO's previous engagement with XIUC and X.AI. The ICO had already reached out to XIUC and X.AI for urgent information in January and is collaborating with Ofcom and other international authorities.

A little over a year on from their initial letter to the Prime Minister, Chancellor and Business Secretary on how they are working to promote economic growth, the ICO have issued an update. 2026 will be a pivotal year for the regulator as they look to complete their restructuring to become the Information Commission. This will include the publication of the next multi-year corporate strategy and the appointment of a new Board. 

The letter provides an update on how the ICO are performing against their commitments set out in HM Treasury's Regulatory Action Plan: 

As the ICO look to develop their next multi-year corporate strategy this year, the publication also outlines some additional milestones for the year ahead: 

techUK Response 

techUK welcomes the ICO's ongoing work to promote the Government's growth agenda and eagerly awaits further information of their AI code of practice, review of PECR consent requirements, and efforts to improve their regulatory sandbox. Our members work across the sectors the ICO seek to regulate; techUK is therefore well equipped to facilitate direct industry engagement for the ICO to test proposals and to collate industry feedback and inputs.  

techUK would like greater clarity on how the estimate that the ICO generated £233m of economic value for UK businesses over the past five years was reached. As the ICO point out, the UK's data economy represents 7.4% of GDP, and as a result we would expect the figure to be significantly higher.  

We encourage the ICO to continue engaging with techUK and our members throughout their policymaking journey, as regular meaningful industry engagement is the best mechanism to ensure their regulatory proposals are truly supporting growth. 

Summary: ICO Updated Guidance on International Transfers 

As aforementioned, the ICO have also published their finalised guidance on international transfers, which  outlines how Data Protection Offices (DPOs) can transfer personal information abroad. The guidance is timely as the “not materially lower” standard introduced under the Data (Use and Access) Act (DUAA), has now (much of the data protection amendments under the DUAA came into force on 5th February 2026) replaced the EU's “essentially equivalent” standard to bring more flexibility to UK international data sharing. 

Key Takeaways: 

An international transfer refers to either: 

Should the following precepts apply, a transfer is considered “restricted”: 

For restricted transfers, these must be covered by either UK adequacy regulations, appropriate safeguards, or an exception:   

At present, all countries in the European Economic Area (EEA) have full adequacy, as well as Andorra, Argentina, Faroe Islands, Gibraltar, Guernsey, Isle of Man, Israel, Jersey, New Zealand, Switzerland, Uruguay, and the Republic of Korea. The United States only has partial adequacy, which covered information transferred under the UK extension to the EU-US Data Privacy Framework. 

If an organisation decides to use an appropriate safeguard, they must first fill out a Transfer Risk Assessment (TRA). The ICO have developed a template document, known as their TRA Tool, to guide this process for businesses. 

For sight of techUK's response to the ICO's consultation on the draft guidance or to raise any questions about this work, please contact Dani (Daniella.bennettremington@techuk.org).

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=ico","The ICO steps up on protecting children online","https://www.lewissilkin.com/insights/2026/02/11/the-ico-steps-up-on-protecting-children-online-102mi48","Wed, 11 Feb 2026 10:42:32 GMT","

Organisations offering online services likely to be accessed by children in the UK must meet clear duties aimed at protecting minors online. The ICO's Children's Code (Age Appropriate Design Code) translates these duties into practical ""design principles and privacy features"" (for more information see our article here). A key requirement under the Children's Code is appropriate age assurance i.e. tools and approaches that estimate or verify a user's age so that safeguards can be tailored or access restricted where necessary. Alongside this, the Online Safety Act 2023 imposes a ""legal duty to protect children online"" such as ""using effective age assurance"" methods. Together, these approaches place the child's best interests at the forefront of online services. 

The ICO's probe into Imgur 

Against this regulatory backdrop, the ICO launched a review on 3 March 2025 into how social media and video sharing platforms were using children's personal data. As part of this, the ICO examined Imgur, an image sharing and hosting platform owned by MediaLab.AI Inc (MediaLab). The review identified several concerns with Imgur's approach to age verification. 

By 10 September 2025, the ICO had issued MediaLab with a notice of intent to impose a penalty. Shortly after, on 30 September 2025, Imgur blocked UK access to its platform. The ICO described this as a ""commercial decision"" by MediaLab, although the timing clearly reflected the seriousness of the regulator's findings. On 5 February 2026, the ICO confirmed that MediaLab had failed to protect children's personal data between September 2021 and September 2025 and imposed a fine of £247,590. 

Despite Imgur's own terms and conditions stating that children under 13 years could only use the platform with parental supervision, MediaLab had no safeguards in place to determine a user's age or to obtain parental consent when accessing Imgur. Specifically, the ICO found that MediaLab had:

In practice, the absence of age assurance meant that children using the site were at risk of encountering harmful content including material related to ""eating disorders, homophobia, antisemitism and images of a sexual or violent nature"". 

When determining the penalty, the ICO considered the number of children affected, the degree of harm, the duration of the breach, and MediaLab's global turnover. The regulator also acknowledged MediaLab's cooperation and commitments to address its compliance gaps, but noted that failure to implement the necessary measures could lead to further regulatory action.

The timing and outcome of the investigation naturally give rise to further reflections. The breaches date back to 2021, yet meaningful enforcement action has only materialised now,  more than a year after the ICO began its investigation. The relatively modest level of the fine, particularly when set against the global scale of Imgur and its millions of users, may raise eyebrows. MediaLab's cooperation will undoubtedly have influenced the final figure, but whether the company will appeal the penalty remains to be seen.

Key takeaways 

With age assurance becoming increasingly central to digital regulation, particularly in light of the government's recent consultation exploring a ban on social media use by children following Australia's approach, scrutiny of online platforms is only likely to increase. This is especially true given the ICO's strengthened governance and enforcement powers under the Data (Use and Access) Act 2025. Even where financial penalties appear modest, the reputational and operational consequences for online services can be significant. This latest decision serves as a clear reminder that compliance cannot be an afterthought.

The highest US tariffs in almost a century have had a muted impact so far on global growth, but Asian policymakers aren't lulled by the calm. They're taking their cues from jumpy markets and plotting what appears to be a mutiny against King Dollar. Those searching for evidence of it in payment flows are looking in the wrong place. For years to come, de-dollarization will remain hidden in alterations to financial plumbing. The cumulative effects will take time to show.


With little fanfare, China's e-CNY, its official digital currency, has gone from being interest-free cash to a yield-bearing product of commercial banks. It's a profound change. Until now, the problem with e-CNY adoption was that even Chinese state workers who received their salaries as tokens in e-wallets would immediately swipe them into their bank accounts.


 Now they don't need to. For them and their banks, e-CNY is no different from a regular deposit account. Payment apps like Alipay and WeChat Pay work with both.





This move won't dent the greenback's dominance: The dollar is the preferred global payments currency with a 50%-plus share, more than twice that of the euro and way ahead of the yuan's 3%. But an e-CNY that's more widely used in China lowers the threat of further dollarization in a scenario where local savers switch to dollar stablecoins. 


Paying interest on e-CNY is a defensive step because last year's US Genius Act prohibits stablecoin issuers from offering yields. But a moat against stablecoins won't be enough.


To take on the dollar's hegemony more directly, China will have to attack it overseas. But outside of Hong Kong, where banks are making yuan-denominated trade finance available to clients in Indonesia and Cambodia, there isn't a deep enough pool of offshore liquidity in the Chinese currency.


Enter mBridge. When I wrote about it 2022, it was just a pilot project of the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) and the monetary authorities of China, Hong Kong, Thailand and the UAE. Some of their financial institutions had come together on a shared blockchain where they swapped prototype digital currencies issued by their central banks to settle cross-border claims of their corporate clients.





In 2024, Saudi Arabia joined the experimental payments platform. Yet, it hardly attracted any attention before Russian President Vladimir Putin identified the underlying technology as a tool to circumvent sanctions and potentially undermine the dollar. 


The BIS withdrew from the project in 2024, but its partner countries ran with it. According to a recent Atlantic Council report, activity has swelled to more than 4,000 cross-border transactions since inception with a cumulative value of about $55.5 billion, a 2,500-fold increase from 2022. The e-CNY accounts for more than 95% of the settlement value. 


There are reports that mBridge could morph into something larger. India, which has developed its own central bank digital currency, is looking to propose linking the CBDCs of so-called Brics+ grouping of emerging markets, according to Reuters. 


The idea will be anathema to Washington. And since New Delhi has agreed to stop buying Russian oil to get out of the Trump administration's tariff prison, it's hard to say if its enthusiasm for a payments corridor that includes Russia and Iran will last.





Even if a viable anti-dollar coalition takes time to emerge, Beijing will keep pressing. A few years ago, China's President Xi Jinping's emphasis on its need to build a “powerful currency"" that's “widely used in international trade, investment and foreign exchange markets, and attain reserve currency status"" would have been dismissed by investors as empty boast.


That's no longer the case. Markets are already questioning the dollar's exceptionalism. Looking under the hood of what caused the unusual spike in US bond yields after US President Donald Trump launched his tariff war, New York University professors Viral Acharya and Toomas Laarits conclude that “investors lost confidence specifically in the long-term safety properties of Treasuries while still valuing their near-term benefits."" They found evidence of a flight towards gold. 


But gold cannot be a payments currency. In the $9.6 trillion-a-day foreign exchange market, the greenback shows up in 89% of all trades. About two-fifths of this outsize share has been chalked up to its vehicle-currency status: Funds are first converted into dollars and then reconverted into whatever currency the payee's bank account will accept. 


An interest-paying e-CNY, settling transactions within China and around the world, will bypass the dollar—and Swift messaging—entirely. Now that superior plumbing have been invented, it won't be allowed to gather rust. ©Bloomberg

SALT LAKE CITY (KUTV) — The investigation into Nancy Guthrie's kidnapping has continued with new images showing an armed person at her house.

Her family agreed to pay the ransom — $6 million allegedly in Bitcoin — for her return.

As of Tuesday evening, it's reportedly still unpaid. But if it is paid, can law enforcement track it?

Brandon Amacher, the Director of the Emerging Tech Policy Lab at Utah Valley University, said most crypto transactions are publicly available, meaning you can see where they go.

But at the same time, they can be done anonymously.

There's probably a reason why the ransom was asked for in cryptocurrency.

""Dark web and the criminal underground, they were way ahead of the curve when it came to cryptocurrency. Because of the decentralized nature of it,” Amacher said.



Amacher said criminals like cryptocurrency because it allows them do deals online anonymously.

""So, does that mean there's no way to track the ransom if it's paid?"" 2News asked.

""It depends on how savvy this person is,” Amacher said. “Sometimes you'll find people think they're more savvy than they actually are.""

Amacher said they could be caught by accidentally associating with a wallet that isn't anonymous or if investigators tie together multiple wallets being used to launder the funds.

However, if the kidnapper takes the proper security measures, it's possible to get away with it.

But what do those measures entail and how hard is it to get them right?

“If you know where to look, and you've been in this world long enough, you can probably develop the know-how,” Amacher said.

However, he thinks the likelihood of them slipping up and getting caught is high just because of how many eyes are on this case.

As for the video of the armed person released on Tuesday, the FBI said it was recovered from ""residual data located in backend systems.""

""In this case, it seems like what happened she was not paying for the camera company to store that video, so by default, they probably weren't storing it where they typically store things. It apparently was somewhere,” he said.

Amacher said it could have been in short-term storage that gets cleared out every few days or weeks.

He's impressed they were able to find it at all and says he's he'd love to see the details on how they recovered it.

The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has launched formal legal proceedings against global crypto exchange HTX after concluding the firm repeatedly published illegal financial promotions in the UK.

Formerly known as Huobi, the firm offers trading in over 700 digital assets, including Bitcoin, Ethereum and its native token HT.

Under rules that came into force in October 2023, all firms marketing cryptoasset services to UK consumers must either be authorised by the FCA or ensure their promotions are approved by an FCA-authorised firm.

Advertising crypto products on social media or websites in breach of these requirements is a criminal offence.

The regulator said that despite repeated warnings, HTX continued to display financial promotions on platforms such as TikTok, Facebook, Instagram and YouTube, as well as its own website, without complying with the UK's financial promotions regime.

The FCA added that its attempts to engage with HTX and secure a commitment to stop unlawful marketing were ignored, claiming the firm operates through an ""opaque"" organisational structure that hides the identities of its owners and website operators.

To protect consumers, the regulator has also asked major tech platforms to block HTX's social media accounts and to remove the company's apps from the Google Play and Apple App Stores for UK-based users.

HTX is currently on the FCA's Warning List, a public register of firms that are operating without proper authorisation in the UK.

Consumers dealing with firms on this list do not have access to the Financial Ombudsman Service, and are unlikely to recover their money if the firm fails.

Steve Smart, joint executive director of enforcement and market oversight at the FCA, said that its rules are designed to support a sustainable and competitive crypto market in the UK, ensuring that consumers have what they need to make informed decisions.

“HTX's conduct stands in stark contrast to the majority of firms working to comply with the FCA's regime,” he added. “This is the first time we've taken enforcement action against a crypto firm illegally marketing their products to UK consumers and we'll continue to act against firms who ignore our rules.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=crypto+technology","Grayscale says Bitcoin mirrors tech stocks not gold","https://www.cryptopolitan.com/grayscale-says-bitcoin-mirrors-tech-stocks/","Wed, 11 Feb 2026 01:36:00 GMT","

The American digital currency asset management company Grayscale says Bitcoin is behaving less like gold and more like a tech stock, as its price has recently dropped sharply, prompting investors to quickly sell their holdings. 

In its latest research report, Market Byte: Bitcoin Trading More Like Growth Than Gold, Grayscale says Bitcoin's short-term movements are more like those of growth-oriented markets than those of precious metals like gold.

The price of Bitcoin dropped to about $60,000 on Feb. 5 before rising again. While this trajectory is normal for the token, it's worth noting that the coin reached its peak in October at prices above $126,000, and has since dropped by more than 50%. 

Because Bitcoin is one of the largest and most closely monitored cryptocurrencies worldwide, investors will naturally ask questions about the forces driving its price movements. They want to know the causes and how BTC behaves during stressful market periods.

And that's where Grayscale's new research comes with answers. The firm quickly dismantled the claim that BTC and gold are both safe havens for investment, saying the crypto asset is risky and that people rush into it only during periods of high hype. 

The company also mentioned that the same investors will quickly sell off their holdings when fear enters the market, so instead of absorbing the shock and standing still like gold, the token moves with it.

Grayscale explained that more traders don't view Bitcoin as a safe investment that can withstand market pressure. According to the report, as the stocks of high-growth software companies dropped, investors also pulled funds out of Bitcoin. 

Also, the report revealed that Bitcoin's price has been moving with the performance of the stocks of software companies with extremely high valuations over the last 12 months. This simply indicates that the market expects significant future growth from the companies, as their stock is heavily influenced by confidence and risk-taking. It therefore declines quickly if investors suddenly become wary.

The firm also stated that investors have expressed concerns that AI could disrupt or even replace traditional software services, which has led to the decline in technology stocks. As a result of this close association between Bitcoin and technology stocks, Bitcoin has fallen almost in step with them.

In its report, Grayscale still said that Bitcoin hasn't reached its full potential yet and that it has several long-term features that make it a strong store of value and worthy of the title “digital gold.”

For example, Bitcoin's limited supply helps protect its value even as demand rises, and because it runs on a decentralized network, investors see it as different and more favorable than traditional money, whose control is not with the holder. 

However, Grayscale has also indicated that Bitcoin does not behave like gold at the moment, at least not in the short term. According to Zach Pandl, the report's author, the recent movements in Bitcoin price have not closely correlated with those of gold and other precious metals.

While gold and silver have seen strong rallies over the past few months, Bitcoin has not behaved the same way and has actually fallen alongside riskier growth assets rather than holding steady as a safe haven. Therefore, while Bitcoin may be “gold-like” in some ways, the market does not treat the cryptocurrency the same way at the moment.

This difference, according to Pandl, should not be surprising, as Bitcoin is still in its infancy compared to gold. Gold has been used as money for thousands of years and was the foundation of the entire monetary system up until the early 1970s. 

Today, gold is still held by central banks and governments as one of the world's largest reserve assets. Bitcoin is still just 17 years old and is still proving itself as a global monetary asset.

                            “Privacy is not about hiding. It's about choice.” | Image credit: CCN
                        

Privacy has become one of the most contested design questions in blockchain. Public ledgers offer transparency and auditability, but they also expose user data, transaction histories, and behavioral patterns. 

Fully private blockchains promise confidentiality, yet often clash with regulatory requirements and real-world compliance needs.

That tension has shaped a decade of experimentation, skepticism, and stalled adoption. In this CCN interview, Dr. Lorena Nessi speaks with Fahmi Syed, president of the Midnight Foundation, about how Midnight approaches privacy as a programmable choice rather than a binary feature.

The conversation examines how zero-knowledge proofs (ZKP) function in real-world systems, why privacy must operate at the application layer rather than the protocol level and where compliant privacy infrastructure fits into the next phase of blockchain adoption.

Watch the full interview here:

Syed frames Midnight's mission around a core contradiction in blockchain design. Distributed ledgers delivered decentralization, disintermediation, and automated transactions through smart contracts. At the same time, they made every action permanently visible.

“One of the troubling aspects of the industry as a whole is that everything you do on a blockchain is transparent,” Syed said. 

“Everything you do on a blockchain is not only transparent, but also immutable.”

He contrasts that reality with everyday digital behavior. People routinely decide what information to share, when to share it, and with whom. That judgment applies to cookies, location data, identity, and financial activity. Blockchain systems, however, rarely allow that discretion.

With Midnight, Syed argues the goal is not secrecy, but rational disclosure.

“What we are bringing is the core principles of blockchain technology, but then putting on top of that the ability not only to fully shield data and metadata, so who you are, what you're doing and where you're doing it, but also with the use of our smart contract language, Compact, to also then enable selective disclosure of that information,” he said.

Blockchain privacy models typically fall into two categories. Fully private chains encrypt all transactions by default. Permissioned systems restrict access within closed environments. Both approaches introduce trade-offs.

“When you think about privacy by design, then what you're looking at is blockchains where everything is private,” Syed said. “Think of Zcash, Monero, that's privacy, full privacy by design.”

Those systems limit programmability and often struggle with regulatory compliance, particularly around know-your-customer and anti-money-laundering requirements. 

Permissioned blockchains address compliance, but undermine decentralization by restricting who controls data access.

Midnight attempts to merge those models without inheriting their constraints.

“With Midnight, we're sort of blending or merging those two worlds,” Syed said. “The blockchain has both a public state and a private state. So the choice is at the application level.”

Developers determine whether transactions run publicly or privately. If private, applications can still require disclosures through zero-knowledge proofs without revealing underlying sensitive data.

Syed uses age verification as an example.

“You do not need to give your date of birth to prove that you're over a certain age,” he said. “I can prove mathematically through a zero-knowledge proof that I'm able to participate.”

The same logic applies to jurisdiction, accreditation, and regulatory eligibility without exposing identity or transaction history.

Control over privacy does not sit solely with application developers. Syed explains that Midnight allows execution rights to be delegated, shifting authority to users when needed.

“The ability to execute a private transaction can be delegated from one party to another,” he said.

Applications can either run private transactions themselves or delegate execution resources to users. 

When delegated, users retain control over encryption keys and disclosure choices. The application facilitates access but cannot view private data.

That flexibility introduces multiple service models. Applications may offer free services with less privacy or paid services where users retain full control. 

According to Syed, the design intentionally allows that trade-off to remain explicit rather than hidden.

Midnight's design also opens a path for regulated decentralized finance (DeFi), an area many institutional actors avoid today.

“Within Midnight, you could end up building a DeFi where people can prove their identities,” Syed said. “They can prove they are of a certain jurisdiction, of a certain creditworthiness or net worth.”

Only participants who meet predefined criteria would access specific liquidity pools. Compliance requirements become enforceable without publishing identity data on-chain.

“That's not the Midnight Network's choice,” Syed added. “That's a choice we give to the application and the developers.”

 

The Midnight Foundation does not operate as a protocol gatekeeper. Instead, its role centers on ecosystem stewardship.

“The foundation's role is to grow the ecosystem,” Syed said. “To be the custodians of that network and the ecosystem.”

That includes supporting developers, attracting partners, and positioning Midnight as a privacy layer that can integrate with other blockchains rather than compete with them.

“We're not tribalists,” Syed said. 

“We want other chains and other applications to come and work with us.”

While financial use cases dominate blockchain discussions, Syed points to healthcare as one of Midnight's most immediate real-world applications.

“We have a partner who is bringing proof of patient data to the Midnight Network,” he said.

In Turkey, clinics serving millions of patients use the system to share clinical data securely without exposing personal information. In California, a children's hospital is exploring Midnight for inter-clinical trials across competing institutions.

Supply chain applications offer another example, particularly in forensic evidence management.

“If you think about forensic evidence around criminal cases, they tend to be very sensitive,” Syed said. “Very important to track that without exposing sensitive data publicly.”

A trial in Uttar Pradesh, India focuses on maintaining chain-of-custody records while protecting victim and investigator identities.

Syed argues that readiness begins with individuals before institutions. Public awareness of data exploitation has grown alongside concern over manipulation, surveillance, and platform dominance.

“People recognize there are browsers out there like Brave who do put privacy first,” he said.

Institutions face similar pressures, particularly around compliance costs, data breaches, and legal exposure.

“If you're a large financial institution, the cost of compliance is very expensive,” Syed said.

Private blockchains replicate existing Web2 control structures. Midnight, by contrast, allows enterprises to share proofs without surrendering data ownership.

“That's where a privacy-enabling solution like Midnight allows those enterprises to think differently about how they build their technology stacks,” he said.

Midnight separates ownership from utility through a dual-token model.

“NIGHT  will be publicly visible,” Syed said. 

“It gives you access and ownership of the Midnight Network.”

Ownership of NIGHT  generates DUST, a secondary resource used to execute private transactions.

“NIGHT is your power station,” he said. “DUST is your electricity.”

That separation allows users and enterprises to lock in transaction costs without consuming speculative assets. 

It also enables transaction delegation, allowing institutions to use Midnight without holding crypto assets on their balance sheets.

Midnight launched its ownership token as a Cardano-native asset to leverage existing infrastructure.

“So therefore we instantly benefit from Cardano's access to liquidity,” Syed said.

The Midnight Network itself rolls out in stages through 2026, allowing the team to prioritize stability, governance, and privacy protections independently of market pressures.

Syed rejects the notion that privacy implies wrongdoing.

“Privacy is not about hiding,” he said. “It's about choice.”

Midnight's goal is to let users decide what to reveal, when to reveal it, and for what purpose. That choice, he argues, aligns more closely with how people already interact with digital systems.

“In the future with Midnight, you may have a choice of having a transparent DeFi solution or a private accredited solution,” he said.

He expects Midnight to become infrastructure rather than a headline.

“Good technology normally is hidden away,” Syed said. 

“The best outcome for me in the next two, three years is that Midnight is so widely used that we become invisible.”

UPDATE (Feb. 11, 13:25 UTC): Rewrites headline, body to reflect company's response that the exchange is switching to a decentralized model. An earlier version of this story said it was being closed.

Arkham Exchange, the cryptocurrency trading platform built by data analytics company Arkham Intelligence, is switching from a centralized to a fully decentralized model, the firm's boss said.

""The Arkham Exchange is becoming a fully decentralized exchange rather than a centralized exchange,"" founder Miguel Morel said in an email after CoinDesk, citing a person familiar with the matter, reported the company planned to close it down. 

""The future of crypto trading is decentralized, and that's what we're building towards,"" Morel said.

Asked how many staff would lose their jobs as a result of the move, Morel declined to comment.

Arkham's backers include OpenAI CEO Sam Altman. The company, which was founded in 2020 and now boasts over 3 million registered users, floated the idea of adding a crypto derivatives exchange back in October 2024. The plan was to compete with giants such as Binance for retail investors. 

Morel took the opportunity to have a pop at the centralized exchanges he attempted to compete with. 

""Centralized incumbents have become bloated and unresponsive to user needs, becoming worse than the traditional financial systems they pretend to improve on. We don't want to invest in that,"" he said.

By early 2025, Arkham Exchange had added spot crypto trading in a number of U.S. states. But volumes appear to have been a challenge, despite the firm adding a mobile trading app in December. 

Binance, the largest crypto exchange by volume, had almost $9 billion of daily trading, according to CoinGecko data. Coinbase (COIN), the No. 2, had $2 billion. Akrham recorded just under $620,000 in the past 24 hours.

In addition to Altman, Arkham's backers include Draper Associates, Binance Labs and Bedrock.

Arkham hosts its own native crypto token, ARKM, which has fallen 3.6% in the past 24 hours to $0.1133, according to CpomDesk data.

South Korea's Bithum admitted Wednesday that severe flaws left the trading platform's internal system wide open to potential sabotage and that it failed to prevent the mistaken transfer of $40 billion in bitcoin to customers, according to Reuters.

The blunder, which triggered the price of bitcoin to plunge by 17% on Bithumb, according to Reuters, consisted of the country's second-largest crypto trading platform accidentally giving away 620,000 bitcoins to customers instead of just 620,000 won (roughly $428).

The Financial Supervisory Service said Sunday it will start investigations into “high-risk” practices that undermine market order, including large-scale price manipulation by so-called whales, trading schemes tied to suspended deposits and withdrawals and coordinated pump tactics fueled by social media misinformation. The watchdog also said it plans to build tools that automatically extract suspicious trading patterns at the second and minute levels, alongside text-analysis systems using artificial intelligence to flag potential market abuse.

Bithumb CEO Lee Jae-won said the giveaway amounted to 15 times the crypto trading platform's 42,000 bitcoins, mainly due to a 24-hour lag in processing transactions and delayed updates to its crypto holdings balance. ""We are acutely aware of the deficiency in internal system control,"" Lee told a parliamentary committee hearing recently.

The CEO admitted that Bithum's policy of ensuring the volume of assets to be transferred matched its actual holdings failed, and that the amount was not earmarked in a separate account to ensure the transfer's safety.

The exchange has recovered most of the bitcoin, although 1,786 that were sold within minutes before the exchange froze customers' accounts are still missing, the Reuters report added. The customers who sold those missing bitcoin are legally bound to return them.

Members of parliament expressed dismay at the lack of government and corporate oversight in the country's virtual assets market, which is one of the most active in the world by trading volume. According to a recent report, cryptocurrency has become a primary investment asset in South Korea, with investor numbers rising to 10 million and exchanges such as Upbit and Bithumb generating revenues in the trillions of won.

SkyBridge Capital's founder, Anthony Scaramucci, said on Wednesday that he is buying bitcoin BTC$66,944.44 during the market downturn and described Donald Trump as a “crypto president.""

""So 10 days ago, we were buying Bitcoin at 84,000 last week, we're buying Bitcoin at 63,000 bitcoin this week, we're buyers of Bitcoin in this market, again,"" Scaramucci said during a conversation with Bullish's CEO Tom Farley at Consensus Hong Kong.

He added that buying bitcoin in a downward-trending market is akin to catching a falling knife.

Bitcoin recently crashed to nearly $60,000, after hitting a peak of over $126,000 in October this year. Prices have recovered slightly to $69,000 since then amid signs of capitulation in the bitcoin ETF market.

Scaramucci called President Donald Trump a much better President for crypto than his predecessor, but added that Trump's geopolitical shenanigans, such as his Greenland ambitions, embolden rival Democrats to oppose him on various policies, including those that affect digital assets.

""I'll just say to you that, like, the Greenland stuff, believe it or not, is actually tied to the industry.

Speaking of Layer 1s, Scaramucci said that programmable blockchain Solana will be one of the biggest market share gatherers.

Heated Rivalry: The linguistics behind Ilya's Russian

How a Russian dialect coach helped Heated Rivalry star Connor Storrie master challenging Russian sounds and build a believable accent

By Kendra Pierre-Louis, Allison Parshall, Fonda Mwangi & Alex Sugiura 

Harold Feng/Stringer/Getty Images

Kendra Pierre-Louis: For Scientific American's Science Quickly, I'm Kendra Pierre-Louis, in for Rachel Feltman.

So I have a confession that I need to get off my chest, and I'm bringing in my friend, SciAm's very own Allison Parshall, to help.

Allison Parshall: What is it, Kendra?

If you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today.

Pierre-Louis: I'm obsessed with the TV show Heated Rivalry.

Parshall: Wait, me, too! [Laughs.]

Pierre-Louis: The romance, the hockey, the tension ...

Parshall: It's so good!

Pierre-Louis: The yearning!

Parshall: The Russian? I mean, one of the things that both you and I have talked about so much is how the American actor Connor Storrie, who co-starred as the Russian character Ilya Rozanov, pulled off speaking so much Russian and perfected his accent.

Pierre-Louis: Yeah, it was shocking, and to help us understand the linguistics behind the hit TV show, we talked to Heated Rivalry's Russian dialect coach, Kate Yablunovsky.

Thank you for joining us today.

Kate Yablunovsky: Thank you so much for having me.

Parshall: Can you tell us a little bit more about dialect coaching? Like, what is it, and how did you get into doing this work?

Yablunovsky: Well, dialect coaching, I specialize specifically in Russian, Russian, Ukrainian, and it's about preparing an actor to speak with as much of an authentic accent, which it's not always what it sounds like. It's not always just to be authentic. Sometimes, actually, it's the opposite; sometimes it's to take the perfection out of the accent so that the character feels authentic.

This is something that I got into very unexpectedly. It started when a smaller production in my city, they had some Russian-speaking characters, and they couldn't find a local Russian dialect coach. And I was casting that film, and they were like, “Maybe you should coach them as well.”

And I jumped into the water, and it took me on a journey because I learned so much through that very first experience. And I had to start to develop all kinds of techniques and exercises and try to understand speech therapy and everything that goes into it to be able to get [the] best of a result for them as possible.

And from there on I went to work on [a] few other productions and started working with actors. And I think it was, like, a mutual evolution for [the] actors and for myself.

Pierre-Louis: Before we get into the work that you did on Heated Rivalry, what are some of the hardest sounds in Russian for English speakers to pick up?

Yablunovsky: Well, it's funny because when I coach actors to speak Russian there's always this comment that comes up that, that they say, “Oh, my God, you have so many sounds.” [Laughs.] “You have so many sounds.”

Pierre-Louis: [Laughs.]

Yablunovsky: And I joke with them—I'm telling them, like, “Okay, I'm gonna open you up to a whole new world of sounds.”

It's usually the vowels that kind of, you know, in English, they would feel like they're two letters, but it's actually [a] one-letter vowel that you have to pronounce with other consonants. So there's the sound “ы,” like when we say the word “ты.”

Pierre-Louis: E.

Parshall: E.

Yablunovsky: Yeah. [Laughs.]

Parshall: E.

Pierre-Louis: [Laughs.]

Yablunovsky: That's a hard one. [Laughs.]

Now, imagine, the way we say in Russian “you” is “ты.” So imagine now adding T to the sound “ы.” It's “ты.”

Parshall: So it's, like, one of the hardest vowels for English speakers to pick up, but it's—is it one of the most common?

Yablunovsky: Very common because every time we say “you,” you know, ты, is a very common word in speech.

“Yo” as well. So yo is a vowel, and if you wanna add consonants before it, you have to make it sound like they're merged, not to make it sound like you're saying the consonant and the vowel separately.

Parshall: Is there an example of that one?

Pierre-Louis: That sound, “yo,” isn't that in “I love you”?

Yablunovsky: I love you in Russian is: “я тебя люблю.”

But here's an example. I said, “я тебя люблю,” which has the vowel “ya” in it. So “ya” is similar. Like, you have to—in the word “тебя” you have to merge the “b” with the “ya” and say “ti-BYAH,” not “tib-YAH.”

Parshall: Mm.

Yablunovsky: This is the example, right? Not “tib-YAH,” but “ti-BYAH.” And this is something that's very hard for non-Russian speakers to learn.

Parshall: I noticed this when I was trying—like, even Ilya, one of the main character's names, is that the case with his name, too? Because I feel like English speakers are often pronouncing it like “Il-ee-YAH” rather than the way it's supposed to be. But I don't know if I can do the way it's supposed to be.

Yablunovsky: No, no, actually, that one is very serious. It's “Il-YAH.”

Parshall: Oh, okay. That one's easier, then.

Yablunovsky: And if we go into, into accent coaching, it's just that the l in the name Ilya is softer in Russia. So it's not “IL-yah”; it's “Il-YAH.”

Parshall: There's so many nuances that you kind of don't know until you get into it.

Yablunovsky: [Laughs.] No, totally. It's a whole world. But, you know, a lot of actors kind of misunderstand Russian, so they come with this kind of idea that it has to be aggressive.

Parshall: Mm.

Yablunovsky: But it's actually not aggressive at all. It's not harsh. It's compressed.

Parshall: Can you say more about what you mean about compressed?

Yablunovsky: Yes, it—it's just that the stresses are not about making it, like, harsh or aggressive, right? It's just about restraining a bit the expression, restraining a bit the emotion behind the words. But it's still lyrical, you know? It's still humorous. There is still warmth. There's irony. There's all kinds of things. It's not just, like, this kind of a monotone, harsh expression.

Parshall: I did wanna ask a little bit about what you were brought on to do specifically for Heated Rivalry. Like, what was the challenge that you were presented with when you started? Is it pretty normal for the kinds of work you often get as a dialect coach, or was it a little bit out of the ordinary?

Yablunovsky: So what was out of the ordinary on Heated Rivalry is just the amount of Russian that an American actor had to do. I was lucky to work with Connor Storrie because he was incredible and he really took the challenge, like, head-on. And it was very stressful.

But I was hired on the project before Connor was cast, so I just looked at the script, I saw all of this Russian, and to be honest for a moment I got nervous because the timing was short. We were, like, a couple of weeks before principal photography, and it's a very short time to start practicing Russian at that level for such an amount.

When Connor got cast, when we had our first call, I told Connor, you know, “If you're willing, I'm willing that we show up every day and work on the Russian, and that's the best way that we're gonna make it work.” And he totally went into it, and we were meeting every day, including weekends. And we kept on working even after the principal photography started, you know, so on days off or after the shoot, on breaks, whatever. We kept on working as much as possible.

Pierre-Louis: What were some of the struggles that Connor encountered? Like, what was he really good at, and what did he find especially challenging?

Yablunovsky: So the beauty with Connor is that he came with a very good base. So first of all, he speaks French, too, and that's a great tool because it gives him another tool bag of other pronunciations. If someone speaks only English, they are only aware of English pronunciation. French pronunciation is very different from Russian, but it still stretched his elastic, right?

Pierre-Louis: Mm-hmm.

Yablunovsky: It's like his muscle was already stretched as far as working with accents.

And then he was always very interested in Russian culture. He was listening to Russian music, Russian rap. It was fun to work in that way 'cause we would exchange, like, music ideas and cultural anecdotes. So he had some insight into the Russian culture, and that helped a lot.

I think the challenges with Connor were not the usual challenges that I've had with other actors I've trained. The challenge with him was just how much he had on the plate because he had a very short time. He had to not just learn Russian—and we're talking about not only learning Russian but eventually memorizing it, putting a character on it, acting it out and everything—but he also has to prepare all the rest of the script, all the English parts of it. He had to learn to skate. He had to prepare for hockey. You know, there was just so much.

So I felt like, with Connor, it's not that he had challenges, necessarily. The hard sounds that we talked about before, everybody struggles with it, and we always had to work a little bit extra on it. But I think he was, like, miles ahead of anybody, and with everything that he had on his plate, you know, the challenge was just to run that marathon—and stay sane.

Parshall: Something that people have noticed is when Connor speaks Russian in the show it seems like his face looks very different than the way it does when he's just kind of himself, Connor Storrie. And I know this—in accents there's this thing called oral posture, which is, like, how you hold your mouth and your tongue and everything. And speaking other languages I feel like my mouth changes shape entirely. And we were just kind of curious, like, do you coach people on changing the shape of their mouths in order to help understand how to make sounds? Is that part of anything? Or does it just come along with making the sounds correctly?

Yablunovsky: So what I do coach people is more about the insight into the culture of how people speak, the way a Russian speaker would pronounce, would enunciate, and the way their body language would go.

However, the facial expression is, actually—it's more the placement of the speech, right? So for example, in English—English is very forward, right: the lips, the teeth, the breath. Well, Russian is more in the far back in the mouth, and there's a heavier tongue base. So once you change all that it alters psychology. And that's why, actually, you can hear different people who speak more than one language, when they speak different languages the sound of their voice changes because of how differently they intonate and possibly also their face.

So Connor's facial expressions is something that he brought to the table; that's his creation. But it's inspired from the fact that all of those things that I've explained, you know, they alter your psychology, and it's part of the character.

Parshall: One of the most impressive scenes, I think, for many people is the monologue that Connor does when he's talking to Hudson [Williams]'s character, Shane, in Russia. Can you talk a bit about how that scene came together?

Yablunovsky: Yes, this monologue was something that we were stressed about because it was a few pages long; it was very emotionally charged. So it was not only to learn it, memorize it, but also hit the emotional mark. And here it was very important, you know, where he would place the stress, where he would pronounce it the right way. This is what makes all the difference.

And it started with—I make sure that when I teach actors Russian or prepare them for a Russian text, that they actually know what they're saying. So they're not memorizing Russian lines without understanding what they're saying—to the word, right? It's not like, “This line, it says this.” I translate every word for them, even if it doesn't make sense. So meaning if in Russian the placement, the order of the words, is different than in English, I would translate it as is so that they understand each word that they're saying and understand where the stress has to come and how do they enunciate this whole sentence.

Parshall: Is there an example—I don't know if I remember how it was in the monologue.

Pierre-Louis: Oh, when he says that “I love Svetlana, but not the way that I love you”?

Yablunovsky: Well, he was saying—I'm just giving a free translation word by word into English. Let's say, of the line, “I love you so much, and I don't know what to do about it”: “I so strong you love.” (“Я так сильно тебя люблю.”) So just to show you, you know, how the order is different.

Parshall: Well, I could see how they need to know that 'cause otherwise the stress might fall on the wrong spot. Like, you wouldn't really know how to feel it.

Yablunovsky: Right, because you'll notice that in the monologue Connor did it perfectly. It was very beautiful and very touching. I was touched on set as well. But he said, “Ya tak SIL'no tebya lyublyu,” you know? He put this stress on, like, on the “so much”: “I love you so much.” And he put this stress in Russian, and the “сильно” is, like, “strongly”—you know, “so much” is what it means—he knew perfectly what he was doing.

Pierre-Louis: Some of the reaction to Connor's accent on the show is that many of us have attempted to learn foreign-to-us language and struggled with accent and pronunciation, and it often feels like we're sort of left to own devices to sort of, like, figure it out on how to, like, speak like a local. Do you have any tips for language learners sort of generally who aren't in a position to hire a dialect coach?

Yablunovsky: I think when you learn a language, if you're doing it by yourself, you can try the same principles of dialect coaching: listen to the pronunciation, and understand the sounds, and try to understand what's happening in the mouth when you're trying to pronounce that sound. And at first it won't work, right, but then you have to kind of move the needle to find that sweet spot where you can make the sound, right?

Parshall: I mean, I think one of the interesting things about language learning is what you said earlier of thinking of having learned any language as, like, stretching your elastic. I thought that was, like, a nice metaphor. It seems like we're hard on ourselves because we wanna sound, quote, unquote, “correct,” but I think of all the people who I know and love in my life who speak a different accent of English than mine, and it's only, like, more beautiful flavors of English, so.

Yablunovsky: Totally.

Parshall: It's about communication.

Yablunovsky: Exactly. And it's different for actors because actors seek to attain a perfect accent. But the problem is that sometimes trying to attain a perfect accent is actually counterintuitive; it makes the character not real.

And when there's a struggle I actually tell the actors, “Drop the accent.” And they panic. [Laughs.] But then when they say it in their own voice they kind of start hearing, like, where is the accent logic behind that language, in my case, Russian, right? Like, where's the logic? Where's the stress? Where's the restraint? And then they hear it. They understand it. They're able to do it, like, a bit more calmly, you know?

The accent has to live on top of the character, right? You can't come and just perform it. It has to be part of the feeling.

Parshall: This has been so interesting, Kate. Thank you so much. I really appreciate you taking the time.

Yablunovsky: Thank you so much.

Pierre-Louis: That's all for today. Tune in on Friday, when we explore how kissing came to be.

It may sound like an oxymoron, but this massive nanoparticle made up of 7,000 sodium atoms is the largest to exhibit such quantum behavior.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

This story is a collaboration with Biography.com.

According to our best understanding of the universe, life appears bifurcated into two overarching realms. The first is the realm of classical physics and the intuitive laws that govern our everyday lives. Then, there's the quantum realm—the domain of the extremely small where those classical rules appear to break down. One of the biggest head scratchers, at least from a classical perspective, is the idea of superposition, wherein atoms (as well as photons and other small particles) can exist as both particles and a waves.

The most famous expression of superposition dates back to 1935 when Austrian physicist Edwin Schrödinger devised a thought experiment in which a sealed box contains a cat and a radioactive element whose rate of decay has a 50% chance of killing the cat. Under those conditions, the theoretical cat is simultaneously both alive and dead—that is, until the box is opened and the cat can be observed. However, we don't observe this strange “there and not there” uncertainty on a macroscopic level because at some size threshold, such quantum superposition no longer holds. So, in search of that threshold, scientists have devised experiments to find the “fattest Schrödinger's cat” that can exist in classical macroscopic space.

Now, a new study led by physicists at the University of Vienna have discovered that a massive nanoparticle measuring eight nanometers (roughly the size of modern transistors) still displays a level of quantum superposition. While a “massive nanoparticle” sounds like an oxymoron, scientists created various clusters of sodium atoms, ranging from 5,000 to 10,000 atoms in size, and found that a cluster measuring around 170,000 atomic mass units maintained quantum superposition. This amounted to a macroscopicity (a unifying measurement across various quantum experiments) of μ = 15.5—ten times higher than any other similar experiment to date. The results of the study were published in the journal Nature. 

“Intuitively, one would expect such a large lump of metal to behave like a classical particle,” lead author Sebastian Pedalino, a doctoral student at the University of Vienna, said in a press statement. “The fact that it still interferes shows that quantum mechanics is valid even on this scale and does not require alternative models.”

To discover this evidence of quantum superposition in such a large clump of metal, scientists relied on the MUlti-Scale CLuster Interference Experiment (MUSCLE) interferometer at the University of Vienna, which sends the sodium clusters through three diffraction gratings composed of ultraviolet laser beams. When crossing the first beam, the location of each cluster can be predetermined within a period of one ten-thousandth of a millimeter. But by virtue of squeezing the cluster through this tiny opening with incredible precision, the researchers can also measure whether the cluster subsequently loses its “solid” identity by spreading out from the first beam like a wave. If so, what started out as a single particle will pass through multiple gaps in the laser-light grating simultaneously, effectively being in many places at once until it is measured. If a sodium nanoparticle indeed spreads out like a wave, it will produce an interference pattern at the end of its trip through the interferometer—a telltale sign of superposition.

“That moment was unbelievable,” Pedalino told Live Science. “It was already late in the night, and I called my professor. And he came back to the lab, and we took measurements until 3 a.m., when we ran out of the sodium.”

Pedalino and his team set out to discern why the quantum world is filled with unintuitive weirdness while the classical one is just so “normal,” and at what point the world of the very small fades into our everyday, macroscopic one. Understanding that quantum superposition can occur at sizes comparable to modern-day transistors could open the door to the discovery of even larger nanoparticles with quantum properties, as well as improving current nanotechnologies.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Your cat's purr says more than you think","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/02/260210040619.htm","Wed, 11 Feb 2026 12:24:12 GMT","

A new study from researchers at the Museum für Naturkunde Berlin and the University of Naples Federico II has uncovered an unexpected truth about cat communication. A domestic cat's purr reveals much more about its individual identity than its meow. Meows change widely depending on context, while purring stays consistent enough to clearly distinguish one cat from another.

To reach this conclusion, scientists used automatic speech recognition techniques and analyzed recordings from the Animal Sound Archive at the Berlin Natural History Museum. They examined vocalizations from both domestic and wild cats and found that domestication has especially increased how much a cat's meow can vary.

Why Meows Change but Purrs Stay the Same

""People pay most attention to meowing because cats mainly use these vocalizations toward us,"" explains the study's first author, Danilo Russo. ""But once we examined the acoustic structure closely, the even, rhythmic purr turned out to be the better cue for identifying individual cats.""

The research team, which also included bioacoustician Mirjam Knörnschild from the Museum für Naturkunde Berlin, applied sound analysis tools originally designed for human speech. They asked a straightforward question: can a computer correctly match a vocal sound to the cat that produced it using sound alone? While both meows and purrs contained individual traits, purrs were far more reliable.

The Many Roles of Purring and Meowing

""Every cat in our study had its own characteristic purr,"" says co-author Anja Schild. ""Purring often occurs in relaxed situations, such as during petting or close contact with a familiar person. It also is used for communication between the mother and her kittens shortly after birth. Meowing, on the other hand, is famous for its versatility.""

Cats use meows in many different situations, especially when interacting with humans. They may meow to ask for food, demand attention, or even ""complain."" This behavioral flexibility showed up clearly in the data, with meows displaying much greater variation within the same individual cat.

Domestication Changed the Cat's Voice

To better understand how evolution shaped these sounds, the researchers compared domestic cat meows with those of five wild cat species: African wildcat, European wildcat, jungle cat, cheetah, and cougar. These comparisons also relied on recordings from the Animal Sound Archive at the Museum für Naturkunde.

Domestic cats stood out immediately. Their meows varied far more than those of their wild relatives, suggesting that life alongside humans reshaped how cats use their voices.

""Living with humans -- who differ greatly in their routines, expectations, and responses -- likely favored cats that could flexibly adjust their meows. Our results support the idea that meows have evolved into a highly adaptable tool for negotiating life in a human-dominated world,"" says senior author Mirjam Knörnschild.

What Cat Sounds Reveal About Communication

Overall, the findings offer a detailed look at how cats communicate. Purrs, which are low-frequency and highly consistent, act as dependable identity signals that help cats and humans recognize familiar individuals in close social settings. Meows serve a different purpose. Rather than signaling identity, they emphasize adaptability, allowing cats to express a wide range of needs and emotions to the people they live with.

Together, these results highlight how domestication shaped the modern cat's voice, turning the meow into a flexible communication tool while leaving the purr as a steady marker of individuality.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Depression may be the brain's early warning sign of Parkinson's or dementia","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/02/260210040623.htm","Wed, 11 Feb 2026 12:18:57 GMT","

While there is currently no cure for Parkinson's disease or Lewy body dementia, addressing depression early could improve quality of life and overall care for patients as these diseases develop.

 

Drawing on comprehensive Danish national health registers, the researchers conducted a retrospective case–control study including 17,711 individuals diagnosed with PD or LBD between 2007 and 2019. Researchers compared these patients with people of similar age and sex who were diagnosed with other long-term conditions, including rheumatoid arthritis, chronic kidney disease, and osteoporosis.

 

The results showed a clear pattern: depression occurred more often and earlier in people who went on to develop Parkinson's disease or Lewy body dementia than in those with other chronic illnesses. In the years leading up to diagnosis, the risk of depression rose steadily, peaking in the three years before diagnosis. Even after diagnosis, patients with Parkinson's disease or Lewy body dementia continued to experience higher rates of depression than the comparison groups.

 

Importantly, this pattern could not be fully explained by the emotional burden of living with a chronic illness. Other long-term diseases that also involve disability did not show the same strong increase in depression risk. This suggests that depression may be linked to early neurodegenerative changes in the brain, rather than being only a psychological reaction to declining health.

 

The findings were especially striking for Lewy body dementia, where rates of depression were even higher than in Parkinson's disease, both before and after diagnosis. Researchers note that differences in disease progression and brain chemistry may help explain this trend.

 

""Following a diagnosis of PD or LBD, the persistent higher incidence of depression highlights the need for heightened clinical awareness and systematic screening for depressive symptoms in these patients."" first author Christopher Rohde noted ""Thus, our main conclusion—that PD/LBD are associated with a marked excess depression risk preceding and following diagnosis when compared with other chronic conditions—remains valid.""

 

The authors emphasize that this does not mean everyone with depression will develop Parkinson's disease or dementia. Instead, they recommend greater awareness and closer monitoring when depression appears for the first time in older adults.

 

While there is currently no cure for Parkinson's disease or Lewy body dementia, addressing depression early could improve quality of life and overall care for patients as these diseases develop.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","A bonobo's pretend tea party is rewriting what we know about imagination","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/02/260210040605.htm","Wed, 11 Feb 2026 04:05:28 GMT","

In a set of playful experiments modeled after children's tea parties, researchers at Johns Hopkins University have shown for the first time that apes can use imagination and take part in pretend play. This ability was long believed to belong only to humans.

Across three carefully designed experiments, a single bonobo interacted with imaginary juice and pretend grapes in a consistent and repeatable way. The results push back against traditional ideas about animal intelligence and suggest that some animals may think more flexibly than previously assumed.

The researchers say the ability to understand pretend objects appears to fall within the cognitive range of at least one enculturated ape. They also suggest this mental skill may have deep evolutionary roots, possibly stretching back 6 to 9 million years to a shared ancestor of humans and modern apes.

""It really is game-changing that their mental lives go beyond the here and now,"" said co-author Christopher Krupenye, a Johns Hopkins assistant professor in the Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences who studies how animals think. ""Imagination has long been seen as a critical element of what it is to be human but the idea that it may not be exclusive to our species is really transformative.

""Jane Goodall discovered that chimps make tools and that led to a change in the definition of what it means to be human and this, too, really invites us to reconsider what makes us special and what mental life is out there among other creatures.""

The study was published in Science.

How Pretend Play Develops in Humans

Human children typically begin engaging in pretend activities, such as tea parties, by around age two. Even younger infants show early signs of understanding make-believe. At just 15-months-old, babies often react with surprise when someone pretends to empty a cup and then acts as if they are drinking from it.

Despite these well-documented behaviors in children, no controlled experiments had previously tested whether nonhuman animals could understand or track pretend situations. This gap existed even though there have been many anecdotal observations from both the wild and captive settings.

In nature, young female chimpanzees have been seen carrying sticks and treating them like infants. In captivity, at least one chimpanzee appeared to drag imaginary blocks across the floor after playing with real wooden ones.

Designing a Controlled Test of Ape Imagination

Krupenye and co-author Amalia Bastos, a former Johns Hopkins postdoctoral fellow who is now a lecturer at Scotland's University of St. Andrews, set out to examine pretend play under controlled conditions.

They designed experiments similar to children's tea parties and tested Kanzi, a 43-year-old bonobo living at Ape Initiative. Kanzi had previously been reported to show signs of pretend behavior and could respond to spoken questions by pointing.

During each test, Kanzi sat across a table from an experimenter. The table was arranged with empty cups and pitchers or with bowls and jars, all set up to resemble a playful social activity.

Tracking Invisible Juice and Imaginary Grapes

In the first experiment, two empty transparent cups sat beside an empty transparent pitcher. The experimenter pretended to pour juice into both cups, then acted out dumping the juice from one cup, shaking it to show it was empty. The experimenter then asked Kanzi, ""Where's the juice?""

Most of the time, Kanzi pointed to the cup that was meant to still contain the pretend juice. He continued to do so even when the experimenter moved the cups around.

To rule out the possibility that Kanzi believed real juice was hidden inside the cup, the researchers ran a second test. This time, one cup contained real juice and the other contained pretend juice. When asked what he wanted, Kanzi almost always pointed to the real juice.

A third experiment followed the same logic but used grapes instead. The experimenter pretended to eat a grape from an empty container and then placed it into one of two jars. After pretending to empty one jar, the experimenter asked, ""Where's the grape?"" Once again, Kanzi indicated the jar holding the pretend object.

Kanzi did not respond correctly every time, but his answers were reliably accurate.

What the Findings Mean for Animal Minds

""It's extremely striking and very exciting that the data seem to suggest that apes, in their minds, can conceive of things that are not there,"" Bastos said. ""Kanzi is able to generate an idea of this pretend object and at the same time know it's not real.""

The researchers say these findings open the door to further studies. Future work may explore whether other apes, or even other animals, can engage in pretend play or track imaginary objects. The team is also interested in testing related mental abilities, such as thinking about the future or understanding what others might be thinking.

""Imagination is one of those things that in humans gives us a rich mental life. And if some roots of imagination are shared with apes, that should make people question their assumption that other animals are just living robotic lifestyles constrained to the present,"" Krupenye said. ""We should be compelled by these findings to care for these creatures with rich and beautiful minds and ensure they continue to exist.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Astronomers shocked by how these giant exoplanets formed","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/02/260211073019.htm","Wed, 11 Feb 2026 14:10:27 GMT","

Gas giants are enormous planets made primarily of hydrogen and helium. They may contain dense central cores, but unlike Earth, they do not have solid surfaces you could stand on. In our solar system, Jupiter and Saturn are classic examples. Beyond our neighborhood, astronomers have identified many gas giant exoplanets, some far larger than Jupiter. The most massive of these worlds begin to resemble brown dwarfs, substellar objects sometimes called ""failed stars"" because they do not fuse hydrogen.

This overlap raises a major question in astronomy. How exactly do these massive planets form? One possibility is core accretion, the same process believed to have created Jupiter and Saturn. In this scenario, a solid core slowly builds up inside a disk of dust and ice, gathering rocky and icy material until it becomes massive enough to pull in surrounding gas. Another possibility is gravitational instability, where a swirling cloud of gas around a young star collapses quickly under its own gravity, forming a large object more like a brown dwarf.

A research team led by the University of California San Diego set out to investigate this mystery using data from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). By studying the HR 8799 star system, they uncovered evidence that offers a surprising answer. Their findings were published in Nature Astronomy.

The HR 8799 System and Its Super Jupiters

HR 8799 lies about 133 light years away in the constellation Pegasus. It hosts four massive planets, each between five and ten times the mass of Jupiter. These worlds orbit at distances ranging from 15 to 70 astronomical units, meaning even the closest planet is 15 times farther from its star than Earth is from the sun. The planet masses range from 5−10 MJup, so even the smallest of them outweighs Jupiter by a factor of five.

In some ways, HR 8799 resembles a scaled-up version of our solar system, which also features four outer giant planets stretching from Jupiter to Neptune. However, the sheer size of the HR 8799 planets and their wide orbits puzzled scientists. Earlier models based on our solar system suggested that planets forming through core accretion would not have enough time to grow so massive before the young star dispersed the surrounding disk of gas.

JWST Spectroscopy Reveals Sulfur Clues

To dig deeper, astronomers used spectroscopy, a technique that analyzes light to reveal the chemical makeup and physical properties of distant planets. Before JWST, researchers relied on ground-based telescopes to measure molecules such as water and carbon monoxide in exoplanet atmospheres. Over time, scientists realized that carbon and oxygen-based molecules are not ideal for tracing how planets form because their origins are difficult to pinpoint.

Instead, the team focused on more stable materials known as refractory elements. These elements, including sulfur, exist in solid form within the protoplanetary disk where planets take shape. Detecting sulfur in a gas giant atmosphere points strongly toward formation through core accretion.

""With its unprecedented sensitivity, JWST is enabling the most detailed study of the atmospheres of these planets, giving us clues to their formation pathways. With the detection of sulfur, we are able to infer that the HR 8799 planets likely formed in a similar way to Jupiter despite being five to ten times more massive, which was unexpected,"" stated Jean-Baptiste Ruffio, a research scientist at UC San Diego and first co-author of the paper.

HR 8799 is relatively young at around 30 million years old (for reference, our solar system is about 4.6 billion years old). Younger planets still retain heat from their formation, making them brighter and easier to analyze with spectroscopy.

JWST's high resolution spectrograph allows scientists to examine exoplanet light without interference from molecules in Earth's atmosphere. For the first time, astronomers detected detailed signatures of several rare molecules in the atmospheres of the system's three inner gas giants that had previously gone unseen.

Detecting Hydrogen Sulfide on Distant Worlds

Extracting this information was challenging. The planets are roughly 10,000 times fainter than their host star, and JWST was not originally optimized for such extreme contrasts. Ruffio developed new data analysis techniques to isolate the planets' faint signals. Jerry Xuan, a 51 Pegasi b Fellow at UCLA, built sophisticated atmospheric models to compare with the telescope's spectra and determine whether sulfur was present.

""The quality of the JWST data is truly revolutionary and existing atmospheric model grids were simply not adequate. To fully capture what the data were telling us, I iteratively refined the chemistry and physics in the models,"" he said. ""In the end, we detected several molecules in these planets -- some for the first time, including hydrogen sulfide.""

Clear signs of sulfur were found on the third planet, HR 8799 c, and the researchers believe it likely exists on the other two inner planets as well. The team also discovered that these planets contain higher amounts of heavy elements such as carbon and oxygen compared to their star, additional evidence that they formed as planets rather than as brown dwarf-like objects.

Rethinking Planet Formation Models

""There are many models of planet formation to consider. I think this shows that older core accretion models are outdated,"" stated UC San Diego Professor of Astronomy and Astrophysics Quinn Konopacky, another co-author of the paper. ""And of the newer models, we are looking at ones where gas giants can form solid cores really far away from their star.""

So far, HR 8799 remains the only directly imaged system known to contain four massive gas giants. However, other systems have been found with one or two even larger companions whose origins remain uncertain.

""I think the question is, how big can a planet be?"" Ruffio stated. ""Can a planet be 15, 20, 30 times the mass of Jupiter and still have formed like a planet? Where is the transition between planet formation and brown dwarf formation?""

Researchers continue to explore these questions, studying one star system at a time.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Ultra-processed foods linked to 47% higher risk of heart attack and stroke","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/02/260210040602.htm","Wed, 11 Feb 2026 03:33:20 GMT","

Ultra-processed foods (UPFs) are heavily altered industrial products that contain added fats, sugars, starches, salts, and chemical additives such as emulsifiers. Common examples include sodas, packaged snacks, and processed meats. During manufacturing, many natural nutrients are removed, leaving foods that are very different from their original form. These products often include ingredients the human body has not historically encountered. Today, ultra-processed foods make up nearly 60% of the average adult diet in the United States and about 70% of children's diets.

Previous research has shown that people who eat large amounts of ultra-processed foods are more likely to develop metabolic syndrome. This condition includes overweight and obesity, high blood pressure, abnormal cholesterol levels, and insulin resistance. High consumption of UPFs has also been linked to elevated levels of high sensitivity C-reactive protein, a marker of inflammation that is considered a strong predictor of future cardiovascular disease (CVD), which mainly includes heart attacks and strokes. Until now, however, limited data have directly examined whether higher intake of ultra-processed foods is associated with increased cardiovascular disease risk.

Why the Link to Heart Disease Matters Now

As ultra-processed food consumption continues to rise and cardiovascular disease remains one of the leading causes of death in the United States and worldwide, understanding any connection between the two has become increasingly important. Insights into this relationship could influence how doctors advise patients and how public health policies are shaped to protect broader populations.

A National Study Examines the Evidence

Researchers from Florida Atlantic University's Charles E. Schmidt College of Medicine investigated this possible link using data from the U.S. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Their findings, published in The American Journal of Medicine, suggest that high consumption of ultra-processed foods may carry serious cardiovascular consequences.

""The findings from our study, based on a large, nationally representative sample of 4,787 U.S. adults, show that those with the highest intake of UPFs suffer a statistically significant and clinically important 47% higher risk of cardiovascular disease,"" said Charles H. Hennekens, M.D., FACPM, FACC, senior author, First Sir Richard Doll Professor of Medicine and Preventive Medicine, and senior academic advisor, FAU Schmidt College of Medicine. ""These results have major implications for future research as well as clinical care and public policy.""

How the Study Was Conducted

The research team analyzed NHANES data from 4,787 adults aged 18 and older collected between 2021 and 2023. All participants had at least one day of detailed dietary records and provided information about whether they had ever experienced a heart attack or stroke. Participants documented everything they consumed over two days, allowing researchers to calculate what percentage of each person's total calories came from ultra-processed foods. Using a validated and widely used food classification system, individuals were then divided into four groups based on their level of UPF intake, ranging from lowest to highest.

A 47% Higher Risk of Cardiovascular Disease

Cardiovascular disease in the study was defined as a self-reported history of heart attack or stroke. Researchers adjusted their analysis to account for factors such as age, sex, race and ethnicity, smoking status, and income. The average participant age was 55 years, and 55.9% were women. After these adjustments, individuals in the highest group of ultra-processed food consumption had a statistically significant and clinically important 47% higher risk of cardiovascular disease compared with those in the lowest intake group.

Parallels to Tobacco and Public Health Challenges

The researchers note that growing awareness of the health risks associated with ultra-processed foods may follow a pattern similar to tobacco in the last century. Just as it took decades for the dangers of smoking to become widely accepted, reducing reliance on ultra-processed foods may take time. This is partly due to the influence of large multinational companies that dominate the food market. In addition, many people face limited access to healthier food options, underscoring the need for broader public health solutions.

""Addressing UPFs isn't just about individual choices -- it's about creating environments where the healthy option is the easy option,"" said Hennekens. ""Clinical guidance and public health education are necessary to make nutritious foods accessible and affordable for everyone.""

Links to Colorectal Cancer and Other Diseases

The researchers also point to rising rates of colorectal cancer in the United States, especially among younger adults. Many of the risk factors for colorectal cancer overlap with those for cardiovascular disease, including dietary patterns.

""The increasing consumption of UPFs may be a contributing factor, along with other dietary and lifestyle influences that affect a range of common and serious gastrointestinal diseases,"" said Allison H. Ferris, M.D., FACP, co-author and professor and chair of the Department of Medicine at the FAU Schmidt College of Medicine. ""Awareness is the first step toward prevention.""

Guidance for Patients and Clinicians

While large scale randomized trials are still needed to confirm these findings, the researchers emphasize that health care providers can take action now. They recommend advising patients to reduce their intake of ultra-processed foods alongside other proven lifestyle changes and appropriate medical therapies.

Study co-authors include Yanna Willett, an undergraduate student at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University; Chengwu Yang, M.D., Ph.D., professor of biostatistics; John Dunn, FAU medical student; Tim Dye, Ph.D., professor and chair of the Department of Population Health; Katerina Benson, FAU student, all from FAU's Schmidt College of Medicine; and Kevin Sajan, medical student at Geisinger Commonwealth School of Medicine.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Almost every forest bird in Hawaiʻi is spreading avian malaria","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/02/260211073016.htm","Wed, 11 Feb 2026 13:05:57 GMT","

A sweeping new study led by a researcher at the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa reveals that almost every forest bird species in Hawaiʻi can transmit avian malaria. That widespread ability to spread infection helps explain why the disease shows up nearly everywhere mosquitoes live across the islands.

The findings, published February 10 in Nature Communications, detected avian malaria at 63 of 64 locations tested statewide. These sites included forests with very different mixes of bird species. The illness is caused by the generalist parasite Plasmodium relictum and has played a central role in the steep declines and extinctions of native Hawaiian honeycreepers.

""Avian malaria has taken a devastating toll on Hawaiʻi's native forest birds, and this study shows why the disease has been so difficult to contain,"" said Christa M. Seidl, mosquito research and control coordinator for the Maui Forest Bird Recovery Project, who conducted this research as part of her PhD at the University of California, Santa Cruz. ""When so many bird species can quietly sustain transmission, it narrows the options for protecting native birds and makes mosquito control not just helpful, but essential.""

How Avian Malaria Harms Native Birds

Avian malaria attacks red blood cells, which can lead to anemia, organ failure, lower survival rates and, in some species, death. The consequences have been severe for Hawaiʻi's iconic birds. Studies show that ʻiʻiwi, also known as the scarlet honeycreeper, face a mortality rate of about 90 percent if infected. The ʻakikiki, a honeycreeper native to Kauaʻi, is now considered extinct in the wild largely because of the disease.

Many infectious diseases rely on just a handful of species to keep spreading. This research shows that avian malaria operates differently in Hawaiʻi. Most forest birds, whether native or introduced, are at least moderately capable of infecting southern house mosquitoes, which serve as the disease's primary vector. Even birds carrying very small amounts of the parasite were able to infect mosquitoes. That means a wide range of bird communities can maintain ongoing transmission.

""We often understandably think first of the birds when we think of avian malaria, but the parasite needs mosquitoes to reproduce and our work highlights just how good it has gotten at infecting them through many different birds,"" Seidl said.

Chronic Infections Drive Ongoing Transmission

Researchers examined blood samples from more than 4,000 birds across Kauaʻi, Oʻahu, Maui and Hawaiʻi Island. They paired those field data with laboratory experiments to measure how readily mosquitoes became infected after feeding on birds. The results showed that native and introduced birds often had similar levels of infectiousness, meaning both groups contribute to spreading the parasite.

The study also found that birds can carry chronic infections for months or even years. During this extended period, when birds may appear only mildly infected, they remain capable of passing the parasite to mosquitoes. The researchers estimate that this long-lasting, low to moderate infectious stage accounts for most transmission statewide.

Climate Change Shrinks Safe Havens

The parasite's ability to infect many bird species likely explains why avian malaria is so widespread across Hawaiʻi. The findings suggest that few mosquito-infested habitats remain free of transmission risk. Conditions are becoming even more challenging as warming temperatures allow mosquitoes and avian malaria to expand into higher elevation areas that once served as refuges for vulnerable native birds.

Seidl and the Maui Forest Bird Recovery Project are members of Birds, Not Mosquitoes, a collaboration of academic, state, federal, non-profit and industry partners working to advance mosquito control in support of Hawaiian bird conservation.

The Maui Forest Bird Recovery Project operates under the Pacific Cooperative Studies Unit in the College of Natural Sciences. All birds in the study were captured and handled by trained ornithologists under state/federal permits.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Life may have started as sticky goo clinging to rocks","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/02/260211073052.htm","Wed, 11 Feb 2026 14:41:27 GMT","

How did life begin? A team of scientists from Japan, Malaysia, the United Kingdom, and Germany believes the answer may involve sticky gels that coated surfaces on early Earth long before the first true cells appeared.

Their work, published in ChemSystemsChem, offers a fresh way to think about the origin of life on our planet and even raises new possibilities for finding life elsewhere in the universe.

For centuries, people have wondered how life first emerged. Although no one can observe those earliest moments directly, researchers continue to reconstruct what might have happened using clues from chemistry, physics, and geology.

""While many theories focus on the function of biomolecules and biopolymers, our theory instead incorporates the role of gels at the origins of life,"" said Tony Z. Jia, professor at Hiroshima University and co-lead author of the paper.

The Prebiotic Gel-First Hypothesis

The researchers propose what they call a ""prebiotic gel-first"" framework. In this scenario, life's earliest steps took place inside surface-attached gel matrices, which are sticky, semi-solid materials similar in some ways to modern microbial biofilms. Biofilms are the thin layers of bacteria that commonly grow on rocks, pond surfaces, and even human-made structures.

Using concepts from soft matter chemistry and insights from modern biology, the team suggests that these primitive gels could have created the right physical setting for simple chemical systems to grow more complex, well before the first cells formed.

These gels may have helped solve major challenges faced by early chemistry. By trapping and organizing molecules, they could have increased molecular concentration, held onto useful compounds, and shielded delicate reactions from environmental changes. Within such protected spaces, early chemical networks might have developed proto-metabolic activity and even basic self-replication, laying important groundwork for biological evolution.

""This is just one theory among many in the vast landscape of origin-of-life research,"" said Kuhan Chandru, research scientist at the Space Science Center, National University of Malaysia (UKM) and co-lead author of the study. ""However, since the role of gels has been largely overlooked, we wanted to synthesize scattered studies into a cohesive narrative that puts primitive gels at the forefront of the discussion.""

Implications for Alien Life and Astrobiology

The idea does not stop with Earth. The researchers suggest that comparable gel-like systems might exist on other planets. These hypothetical structures, described as ""Xeno-films,"" could function like biofilms but be built from entirely different chemical ingredients available in other environments.

This shift in thinking could expand how scientists search for extraterrestrial life. Instead of focusing only on familiar biological molecules, future missions might also look for organized, gel-like structures that create life-friendly environments.

Testing the Gel Model

The team plans to test their hypothesis in the lab. They intend to examine how simple chemicals under early Earth conditions might have formed gels and to study what properties those gels could have offered emerging chemical systems.

""We also hope that our work inspires others in the field to further explore this and other underexplored origins-of-life theories!"" said Ramona Khanum, co-first author of the paper and a former intern at UKM.

The University of Leeds Research Mobility Funding, the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation, the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, and the Mizuho Foundation for the Promotion of Science supported this research.

Pregnant people and their health-care providers often rely on limited or indirect data to weigh the risks of taking medications. Credit: Salvador Melendez/AP/Alamy

In 2021, amid the COVID‑19 pandemic, Kristin Wall became pregnant with her second child. Her physician told her that little was known about the COVID-19 vaccine's safety and effectiveness in pregnant people. Observational data — collected from those vaccinated before they knew that they were pregnant — suggested that the vaccine was safe, so she could have it. Still, she'd have to weigh up the risks and benefits herself.

Women's health research lacks funding — these charts show how

Women's health research lacks funding — these charts show how

Wall is an epidemiologist at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia, and is therefore unusually qualified to assess health risks. But her experience is a common one — and far from unique to COVID-19. When it comes to pregnancy, people must often make important medical decisions with limited or imperfect information, says Wall. Pregnancy changes the body, including how it metabolizes and distributes medications, so a drug with a predictable effect in a non-pregnant person might work very differently in someone who is pregnant.

There is now solid evidence from the huge numbers of people vaccinated, and subsequent clinical trials, that the COVID-19 vaccines that use messenger RNA (mRNA) — as well as influenza vaccines and others that do not use live viruses — are generally safe and effective during pregnancy. Safety is also well established for certain other medications: some anti-allergy drugs, some antidepressants and some antibiotics are considered safe for use in pregnancy. Paracetamol (acetaminophen) — the main ingredient in Tylenol — is also considered safe, despite claims to the contrary by US President Donald Trump. Other drugs, however, are known to carry risks. An example is the anti-epilepsy drug sodium valproate, which can cause severe developmental disorders when taken during pregnancy.

Most people take medications during pregnancy — more than 90% in the United States according to some tallies1. Despite this, the safety and effectiveness of many drugs — including some anti-nausea treatments, some anti-inflammatories and the vast majority of medicines approved over the past decade — remain uncertain because they have never been tested in pregnant people. Fears over adverse consequences and associated policy restrictions mean that pregnant people have been largely excluded from clinical trials. That leaves public-health officials and health-care providers basing recommendations on indirect evidence, including animal studies, trials in non-pregnant people and observational studies of pregnant people taking a drug after it is already on the market.

“The gap is huge,” says Wall. She and others have designed trials that have successfully tested treatments for Ebola, HIV and some pregnancy-specific conditions in pregnant people — collecting reliable data while protecting the health of study participants and their babies. Based on that experience, they have developed tools and guidance to help other researchers to include pregnant people in studies, too. But despite these advances, logistical, regulatory and ethical barriers remain.

What happens if pregnant women stop taking Tylenol?

What happens if pregnant women stop taking Tylenol?

There's no evidence yet that Trump-era policies, such as the ‘Make America Healthy Again' movement, have reduced the inclusion of pregnant people in trials, Wall says. But she adds that the broader increase in anti-pharmaceutical rhetoric might reinforce long-standing hesitancy to study medications in pregnancy — slowing efforts to close evidence gaps.

For Denise Astill, who took sodium valproate during pregnancy before clear guidance advised against its use, real progress “is about equity”. Her twin daughters were diagnosed at the age of four with a wide range of health conditions, including cognitive difficulties, hearing problems, kidney impairment, autism and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.

Her experience led her to found the charity Foetal Anti-Convulsant Syndrome New Zealand in Auckland, which offers guidance on taking anti-seizure medications in pregnancy. Pregnant people should have the same access to evidence-based care as everyone else, she says. “Can we truly make an informed choice when our health system and research are based on men?”

Much of the caution around research in pregnancy stems from a mid-twentieth-century medical disaster. In the late 1950s, a drug called thalidomide was marketed in 46 countries as a morning-sickness treatment, although it had not been tested in pregnant people. Physicians soon saw a surge in the number of babies with missing or shortened limbs born to mothers who had taken the drug during pregnancy.

In the early 1960s, after studies confirmed that it was linked to congenital disorders in more than 10,000 children, thalidomide was withdrawn. The disaster reshaped drug regulation, leading to stricter testing standards that ended up excluding pregnant people.

In 1964, the Declaration of Helsinki — a document on ethical principles for medical research involving humans — classified pregnant people as a ‘vulnerable population', grouping them with people who are unable to give informed consent, such as children or those with severe cognitive impairments.

In 1977, the US drug regulator barred not only pregnant people but also ‘women of childbearing potential' from participating in clinical trials. Although this policy began to shift in the late 1980s and early 1990s — when the US National Institutes of Health required women to be included in research — pregnant people continued to be sidelined because they were considered to be a vulnerable group.

Over the past decade, some of these restrictions have eased. The World Health Organization (WHO) now says that pregnant people should be considered ‘complex' rather than ‘vulnerable' and be included in trials when possible. But progress remains slow: an analysis of US drug trials between 2008 and 2023 found that fewer than 1% specified that they included pregnant participants2 (see ‘Enrolment gap'), and fewer than 0.4% of trials submitted in the European Union include pregnant people.

Once a therapy is approved, it can take a long time for evidence to accumulate. In the case of COVID-19 vaccines, so many people were having the shot that evidence built up quickly. By the end of the pandemic, most countries recommended vaccination for pregnant people. But a review of medicines approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) found that when a drug's safety in pregnancy is unknown at the time of approval, it takes, on average, 27 years before there's enough evidence to confidently rate its safety3.

This evidence gap leaves physicians and pregnant people with a difficult choice: treat a condition with drugs for which the risks are uncertain, or leave it untreated, says Alyssa Bilinski, a statistician at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island. “Sometimes ‘ask your doctor' is really good advice, because your doctor has a lot of information,” she says. “But ‘ask your doctor' cannot substitute for underinvestment in research over decades.”

Bilinski's work suggests that excluding pregnant people from randomized controlled trials can do much more harm than good. In a study last year, she and her colleagues looked at two kinds of risk: testing a drug in pregnant people if the drug turns out to cause harm, and not testing it in pregnant people at all. Their model estimated that if thalidomide had been tested in a trial with 200 pregnant participants, about 33 children would have been harmed1. But such a trial could have prevented about 8,000 congenital disorders, according to the model, or 99.6% of all thalidomide-related cases between 1956 and 1962.

The fraught quest to account for sex in biology research

The same model also suggested that lives would have been saved if pregnant people hadn't been excluded from early COVID-19 vaccine trials. When the US drug regulator first authorized the vaccines in December 2020, no pregnancy-specific data were available. Although access wasn't restricted, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention did not strongly recommend the vaccine in pregnancy until August 2021 — by which point uptake by pregnant people already lagged behind uptake in the general population.

If pregnancy-specific data from clinical trials had been available, the resulting vaccine uptake and reduction in infections would have prevented about 20% of COVID-related maternal deaths and stillbirths in the United States between March and November 2021, totalling more than 200 deaths, the study concluded.

Many people assume that risk comes only from taking medications, but doing nothing can be even more dangerous, leaving both the pregnant individual and their baby exposed to uncontrolled disease or serious infections, Bilinski says. “What happens absent a trial is quite possibly the worst of both worlds.”

Some of the barriers to including pregnant people in clinical trials are real and others are perceived, says Anna David, an obstetrician and maternal–fetal medicine specialist at University College London. A common myth is that pregnant people won't volunteer, David says. Her experience shows the opposite: when they are given as much information as possible about a trial, they are able to give informed consent, and many are willing to participate.

Another perceived barrier, says David, is the idea that fetal health can't be assessed during a trial, which would be essential to identify adverse effects. “That's completely wrong, because as a fetal medicine specialist, I do that all the time,” she says.

To make it easier to track and compare risks in trials including pregnant people, David and her colleagues developed standardized definitions and grading scales for problems that can affect the person and the fetus, including issues detectable with fetal imaging, such as growth problems and fluid build-up4. Published in 2021, these measures have been incorporated into drug trials in pregnant people, cited in dozens of papers and are being validated by regulatory agencies, David says.

Despite these resources, she adds, pharmaceutical companies are often hesitant to test drugs in pregnant people. That's partly owing to fear of reputational damage from adverse outcomes. “Imagine headlines saying, ‘new drug has bad outcome' — you wouldn't want that,” she says.

Another barrier is the difficulty that researchers face in securing insurance, David says. When deciding whether to cover a trial, insurers often rely on data from past clinical trials to assess risk, including complications such as congenital disorders. But because so few trials are conducted in pregnant populations, there is little information to guide these assessments. That uncertainty leads insurers to decline coverage or to charge high premiums.

Even when insurance is in place, clinical trials in pregnant people are typically more expensive than those in other people, requiring specialized expertise and infrastructure. One estimate by the non-profit organization the Concept Foundation in Geneva, Switzerland (see go.nature.com/4tdnvtm) suggests that developing a medicine specifically for use during pregnancy could cost an extra US$5.7 million compared with drugs for use in other therapeutic areas, with most of the added cost due to safety and efficacy studies.

Aqueous zinc-ion batteries offer strong potential for high-energy grid storage but rely on acidic conditions that cause severe zinc corrosion. Now, a hybrid eutectic aqueous–organic electrolyte is reported that suppresses side reactions and enables highly reversible, durable Zn‖MnO2 cycling without added acid.

The spin supersolid—a magnetic analogue of the supersolid that simultaneously exhibits solid and superfluid orders—has emerged as a promising sub-Kelvin refrigerant with strong low-energy fluctuations and associated entropic effects1. However, the stringent prerequisites have so far confined its presence to certain magnetic insulators. Here we report the discovery of a metallic spin supersolid in a rare-earth compound EuCo2Al9 (ECA), which is a good metal with excellent electrical and thermal conductivity. The high-spin Eu2+ ions form a three-dimensional lattice with stacked triangular layers, in which the spin-supersolid state is stabilized through a mechanism involving both Ruderman–Kittel–Kasuya–Yosida (RKKY) and dipolar couplings. Neutron diffraction shows microscopic evidence of spin supersolidity, demonstrating the coexistence of out-of-plane and in-plane spin orders in this alloy. Our RKKY–dipolar model successfully captures the metallic spin-supersolid Y and V phases in ECA, along with the 1/3 magnetization plateau. The observed nonclassical magnetization behaviours within these phases point to significant quantum fluctuations, probably enhanced by the conduction electrons. The resistivity measurements provide a transport probe for the spin-supersolid transitions, because of scattering of conduction electrons from local moments. Through the adiabatic demagnetization process, ECA achieves ultralow cooling to 106 mK, exhibiting a giant magnetocaloric effect that manifests sharp anomalies in the magnetic Grüneisen ratio. ECA emerges as one of the first metallic spin supersolids, combining low cooling temperature, large magnetic entropy and ultrahigh thermal conductivity for high-performance sub-Kelvin refrigeration.

The DFT calculation was performed at the PBE+U level, with U = 7.1 for Eu and U = 4.0 for Co. The energy cut-off for the plane-wave basis set was 600 eV. We used 20 k points along the high symmetry lines in Brillouin zone to calculate the electronic band structure of ECA. c, Bulk Brillouin zone of ECA.

The Fermi level is set to be 0 eV. The itinerant electrons near the Fermi level primarily originate from the Co 3d and Al 2p orbitals. In contrast, the 4f electrons of Eu, which are responsible for its magnetic moments, are localized within an energy range of approximately -3.5 eV to -2 eV. This localization leads to weak hybridization between the 4f electrons and the itinerant electrons. The band structures were calculated using the PBE+U method.

a, The RKKY interaction profile based on the free-electron approximation. The corresponding RKKY interactions for the 1st to the 5th nearest neighbours (N1-N5) are evaluated using a Fermi surface defined by \({k}_{F}^{a}\simeq \) 0.318 Å−1 in the ab plane and \({k}_{F}^{c}\simeq \) 0.3 Å−1 along the c-axis. Their relative positions on the stacked triangular lattice are shown in the inset, with the two inequivalent sublattices colour-coded in khaki and blue. b, Magnetization curves from Monte Carlo simulations at various temperatures for the minimal model and the full RKKY-dipolar model that includes all long-range dipolar terms. These interactions are considered using the Ewald summation method within the SpinToolkit simulation package55 to account for all relevant length scales. c, Field-temperature phase diagram from Monte Carlo simulations of the full RKKY-dipolar model. Open circles mark the phase boundaries determined from the peak locations of calculated specific heat data, showing remarkable agreement with experimental phase diagram in Fig. 2b. d-f, Magnetic configurations of: d, Y-state, e, UUD-state, and f, V-state. g-i, Statistical distributions of f-h, in-plane (ϕxy ≡ mx + imy) and j-l, out-of-plane (\({\phi }_{z}\equiv ({m}_{z}^{(1)}+{m}_{z}^{(2)}{e}^{i(4{\rm{\pi }}/3)}+{m}_{z}^{(3)}{e}^{i(-4{\rm{\pi }}/3)})/\sqrt{3}\)) magnetic order parameters, where \({m}_{z}^{(i=1,2,3)}\) denotes the z-axis magnetization of three sublattices and mx/y denotes the uniform in-plane components. Statistical distributions for the Y-, UUD-, and V-states are calculated at 0.9 K, 0 T; 2.8 K, 1.5 T; and 0.4 K, 2.2 T, respectively. As shown in g and i, even when full Ewald summation is involved, we observe U(1)-symmetric in-plane statistical distributions of the Y and V states at low temperatures. This phenomenon aligns with established research on systems with six-fold degenerate ground states, where the anisotropic terms become irrelevant with increasing temperature, leading to effective U(1) symmetry. Meanwhile,ϕz can only take three (or six at zero field) discrete spots, signifying the breaking of discrete symmetry along the z-axis as shown in j and l. In contrast, within the UUD phase, ϕxy shows disordered—evident as a single spot at the origin in its statistical distribution—while ϕz breaks the threefold discrete symmetry, appearing as three distinct bright spots.

The data are obtained with a magnetic field sweep rate of 0.3 T/min. c, A comparative summary of the reported metallic magnetocaloric materials for the sub-Kelvin refrigeration. The key parameters are defined as follows: S is the spin number, ρm is the magnetic ion density, and Sm is the magnetic entropy density. The magnetic ordering temperature is given by Torder, while the lowest cooling temperature in ADR measurements is \({T}_{\min }\), obtained from an initial temperature T0 under an initial field μ0H0. \(R={T}_{{\rm{order}}}/{T}_{\min }\) measures the ratio of the minimal versus ordering temperatures. Finally, the transport properties including resistivity ρ and thermal conductivity κm are listed. We note that the rare-earth-based compounds in the table are Kondo-like metals with low-temperature thermal conductivities akin to oxide insulators like NBCP36, which are much lower than that of the good metal ECA reported in the main text.

Both the \(\frac{{\rm{U}}}{2}\frac{{\rm{U}}}{2}\)D and 0UD configurations produce fits of the same quality, with RF = 1.60 % and χ2 = 4.58 % for 0.3 K and RF = 1.28 % and χ2 = 2.71 % at 2 K. These values are significantly better than those obtained for the in-plane state, which are RF = 2.57 % and χ2 = 8.30 % for 0.3 K and RF = 2.14 % and χ2 = 5.34 % for 2 K. For the Y-shaped spin configuration, the fitting results at 2 K are comparable to those of the collinear states (\(\frac{{\rm{U}}}{2}\frac{{\rm{U}}}{2}\)D and 0UD), with RF = 1.29 % and χ2 = 2.73 %, whereas a significant improvement of fitting with Y-state is observed at 0.3 K, corresponding to RF = 1.44 % and χ2 = 3.58 %. Therefore, our neutron data provide microscopic evidence for the Y-state at 0.3 K, with a large local moment of 7.01μB. At 2 K, the system shows fluctuating collinear states, exhibiting a \(\frac{{\rm{U}}}{2}\frac{{\rm{U}}}{2}{\rm{D}}\), 0UD, or superimposed spin configurations.

From the results, we find the single-crystal diffraction data are effective reproduced by the proposed theoretical model, and the 3.7 Å magnetic peak (indexed as (1/3, − 2/3, 1) and (1/3, 1/3, 1)) get significantly enhanced at 0.3 K. These results collectively reveal the development of in-plane spin components below TN2, providing direct evidence for the Y-state order at 0.3 K.

Source data

a,b, Zero-field (ZF, panel a) and longitudinal-field (LF, parallel to the c-axes of co-aligned crystals and at 0.3 K, panel b) muon decay asymmetry spectra of ECA across a range of temperatures and magnetic fields. Solid lines show fitted results using the function: \(Asy(t)={A}_{1}\cdot {e}^{-{\lambda }_{1}\cdot t}+{A}_{2}\cdot {e}^{-{\lambda }_{2}\cdot t}+{A}_{bg}\), where λ1 and λ2 are the relaxation rates corresponding to the fast and slow depolarization components, and Abg represents a flat background term originating from the muons stopping in the silver sample holder. The two measurement paths crossing CLO*-MSY and UUD-MSY phase boundaries are indicated by the vertical and horizontal arrows, respectively, in the inset of a. Upon lowering the temperature from 1.7 K to 1.2 K, we find the relaxation rate increases significantly, and enhanced spin fluctuations are observed near the spin-supersolid thermal transition (at about 1.1 K). At lower temperature of 0.3 K and within the MSY phase, the missing initial asymmetry (“A0 lost”) implies increasingly strong spin fluctuations. In panel (b), at μ0H = 0.35 T (in the UUD phase), we find entire decoupling; however, as the field decreases to 0.3 T (supersolid QCP) a well-defined, faster depolarization appears at early times (t < 2μs). This component vanishes again when entering the MSY phase. The field dependence of the muon-spin depolarization rules out that the loss of A0 in the MSY phase arises from muon spin decoupling. Muon spin relaxation experiments are performed in ZF and LF configurations using the ARTEMIS spectrometer at the S1 area of the Materials and Life Science Experimental Facility (MLF), J-PARC under a user program (Proposal No. 2024B0263), Japan. A 3He cryostat provides a base temperature of 0.3 K, and co-aligned single crystals are mounted on a thin silver plate with their c-axes oriented parallel to both the initial muon-spin polarization and the applied longitudinal magnetic field.

Cyberbullying is an increasingly prevalent issue as social media becomes heavily integrated into daily life from a young age. Cyberbullying can have substantial impacts on the well-being of victims, perpetrators and observers. For example, research has linked cyberbullying to depression, anxiety and suicidality. Consequently, most studies of cyberbullying have aimed to understand risk or protective factors for victimization and motivations for perpetration.

However, cyberbullying is influenced by a range of systemic factors such as regulation, accessibility and legal frameworks, as well as individual factors such as social media literacy, personality and online experiences. Thus, reductionist approaches focused on individuals cannot comprehensively capture the dynamics of cyberbullying. A focus on individuals also places responsibility on perpetrators or victims to combat the problem, for example, through education, deterrence via legal sanctions or other forms of behaviour change intervention. However, targeting systemic influencing factors might be more effective for addressing or preventing complex behaviours.

Sleep is viewed typically through a brain-centric lens, with little known about the role of the periphery1,2. Here we identify a sleep function for peripheral macrophage-like cells (haemocytes) in the Drosophila circulation, showing that haemocytes track to the brain during sleep and take up lipids accumulated in cortex glia due to wake-associated oxidative damage. Through a screen of phagocytic receptors expressed in haemocytes, we discovered that knockdown of eater—a member of the Nimrod receptor family—reduces sleep. Loss of eater also disrupts haemocyte localization to the brain and lipid uptake, which results in increased brain levels of acetyl-CoA and acetylated proteins, including mitochondrial proteins PGC1α and DRP1. Dysregulation of mitochondria, reflected in high oxidation and reduced NAD+, is accompanied by impaired memory and lifespan. Thus, peripheral blood cells, which we suggest are precursors of mammalian microglia, perform a daily function of sleep to maintain brain function and fitness.

Sleep is a behavioural state shared by almost all animals. It is defined as a quiescent state associated with reduced consciousness that is different from coma or anaesthesia because it is rapidly reversible with a stimulus. The circadian system regulates sleep on a 24-h cycle, but sleep is also regulated by homeostatic mechanisms, whereby the pressure to sleep increases with extended periods of wakefulness1. The importance of sleep is recognized widely, but the underlying mechanisms and functions are still debated1,2.

Whereas studies of sleep focus on the brain, sleep loss also has an effect on the periphery3. In addition, there is now reason to believe that peripheral tissues can affect sleep4,5. For instance, the immune system is implicated in the control of sleep, particularly during sickness. In Drosophila, the nuclear factor kappa B protein Relish acts in the fly fat body (functional equivalent of the liver) to regulate sleep following infection6. Sleep, in turn, influences recovery from bacterial and viral infections in both mammals and flies7,8. Sleep deprivation increases the expression of sleep-promoting cytokines, such as tumour necrosis factor (TNF) or interleukin (IL)-6 and it may do so in the same way as inflammation, by increasing levels of the glucocorticoid hormone through the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis or noradrenaline through the sympathetic nervous system7. TNF is also implicated in Drosophila sleep through its expression in astrocytes, but it can act systemically as well9. In general, interactions between sleep and the immune system have focused largely on signalling molecules, and not on regulation by immune cells in the periphery. Little is known about the role of peripheral mechanisms in the function of sleep.

Using Drosophila as a model system, we addressed a sleep function for circulating blood cells called haemocytes, 95% of which are macrophage-like plasmatocytes10 that function in immune responses. We show that, at times of high sleep, haemocytes localize to the brain and take up lipids accumulated in cortex glia. As lipid droplets (LDs) in cortex glia reflect the transfer of wake-associated oxidative damage from neurons11, this uptake by haemocytes is expected to ease metabolic stress in the brain. Indeed, loss of the Eater receptor, which mediates lipid uptake by haemocytes, causes increased acetylation in the brain, along with mitochondrial oxidation and reduced NAD+ levels. Thus, haemocytes, and Eater in particular, act in a sleep-dependent fashion to maintain metabolic homeostasis in the brain.

To explore a possible interaction between haemocytes and the brain, we first used a tissue-clearing method12 to visualize circulating haemocytes in the fly head (Fig. 1a and Extended Data Fig. 1a). We used the HmlΔ-LexA fly line to label haemocytes, and detected their localization throughout the head area including the proboscis (pb), maxillary palp (mp) and ocellar (oc) regions, but not in the eyes or antenna (at) (Fig. 1a). To determine whether these populations of haemocytes mostly circulate or actually contact the brain, we dissected fly brains and visualized haemocytes using various markers (Fig. 1b,c and Extended Data Fig. 1b–d). Consistent with previous studies, Hml+ haemocytes were located mostly near the dorsal part of the brain13, especially in the dorsally located pars intercerebralis region (Extended Data Fig. 1c). These Hml+ cells were also positive for other haemocyte markers14 such as Srp-Hemo (Fig. 1b) and NimC1 (Fig. 1c). Moreover, they were observed with other haemocyte Gal4 drivers14, such as Srp-Gal4, Ppn-Gal4 and Srp-Hemo-split-Gal4, and they expressed eater-dsRed, which is specific to haemocytes (Extended Data Fig. 1b). Haemocytes were not detected near the ventral nerve cord or inside the brain (Extended Data Fig. 1d). Based on these observations, we conclude that haemocytes circulate in the fly head cavity and possibly interact with the brain at specific sites.

The fly brain is separated from the periphery by the blood–brain barrier (BBB)15. To assess whether haemocytes near the pars intercerebralis region interact with the BBB, we visualized haemocytes together with the BBB-specific Gal4 line that marks both perineurial glia (PG) and sub-perineurial glia (SPG) cells of the BBB15 (Fig. 1d and Extended Data Fig. 1b), or using Gal4 lines that individually mark PG (NP6293-Gal4) or SPG (moody-Gal4) cells (Fig. 1e and Extended Data Fig. 1e). We found that Srp-Hemo+, eater+ or NimC1+ haemocytes were located adjacent to the BBB (Fig. 1d,e and Extended Data Fig. 1b,e). Moreover, when we visualized haemocytes together with PG markers, we observed that extensions of the PG membrane physically contact haemocytes (Fig. 1e and Extended Data Fig. 1f). Although SPG and haemocytes are separated by PG cells, haemocyte membranes are also in contact with SPG cells (Fig. 1e). Indeed, we used the green fluorescent protein (GFP) reconstitution across synaptic partners (GRASP) technique16 to confirm direct physical interaction between haemocytes and SPG cells (Extended Data Fig. 1g,h). Similar direct interaction of SPG cells with haemocytes was observed in pupal stages by electron microscopy17. A previous study found that cortex glia cells contact or share membranes with SPG18 cells, so it is possible that haemocytes also directly contact cortex glia cells but we did not detect a GRASP signal (data not shown). Based on these findings, we conclude that haemocytes exist within the fly head cavity and interact physically with glial cells, particularly glia of the BBB.

We also asked whether haemocyte recruitment to the brain is influenced by the sleep:wake cycle (Fig. 1f,g). At Zeitgeber time (ZT) 8 and ZT20 (ZT0 = lights on, in circadian terms), which are times of the afternoon siesta and night-time sleep, respectively, the number of haemocytes in the head was higher than at other times of day (Fig. 1f,g). To confirm sleep-dependent haemocyte recruitment to the fly head, we compared haemocyte numbers following sleep deprivation or gaboxadol feeding to induce sleep (Fig. 1f,h). Sleep deprivation reduced haemocyte numbers in the head, but the numbers recovered during rebound sleep (Fig. 1f,h). By contrast, feeding gaboxadol increased haemocyte numbers in the fly head, with no significant differences across ZT time points (Fig. 1f,h). These results were supported by manipulations of neuronal activity to increase/decrease sleep (Fig. 1i,j). Thermogenetic stimulation of wake-promoting neurons (C584-Gal4 UAS-TrpA1or TH-Gal4 UAS-TrpA1)19 decreased haemocyte number in the fly head, whereas similar stimulation of sleep-promoting neurons (R23E10-Gal4 UAS-TrpA1)20 increased haemocyte recruitment to the head (Fig. 1i,j). From these results, we surmise that the interaction between haemocytes and the brain is increased during sleep.

Given that haemocytes circulate in the fly head and are more abundant during sleep than wake, we hypothesized that the function of haemocytes may be relevant for sleep. To use an unbiased approach towards such function, we examined recent single-cell RNA sequencing data21 for transcripts expressed highly in haemocytes. Analysis of the biological functions of the top 100 genes in haemocytes through g:Profiler22 revealed significant annotations for defence response against other organisms, phagocytosis and immune system processes. As the phagocytosis of Gram-positive or Gram-negative bacteria in Drosophila is mediated typically by Nimrod receptor family genes23, we focused on a possible role for this family (NimA, NimB1-5, NimC1-4, drpr, eater, Col4a1, PGRP-LC) in the regulation of sleep. In addition, because we observed that more haemocytes are localized in the head cavity during the sleep state in flies (Fig. 1f–j), we also added genes previously identified as being involved in haemocyte migration. These include activin-β signalling factors (babo, put, Smox) that are important for sessile localization of haemocytes24, or the platelet-derived growth factor/vascular endothelial growth factor signalling receptor that functions in embryonic blood cell migration25. Finally, we included genes associated with lipid uptake (Lsd-1, Lsd-2, GLaz, Karl, Nplp2, Apoltp, Acsl, LpR1, LpR2, eater, crq, apolpp), as previous studies have shown that haemocyte functions are linked to lipid uptake26, processing27 and clearance28, which are critical for immune system activation, animal growth and metabolism.

We then knocked down each of the genes above using RNA interference (RNAi) and assayed effects on sleep. Knockdown of the gene eater reduced sleep, as validated using two different eater RNAi lines (Extended Data Fig. 2a) with two distinct haemocyte Gal4 drivers (Extended Data Fig. 2b,c). To further confirm the eater knockdown phenotype, we assessed the sleep patterns of eater null mutants. Both male and female eater mutant flies exhibited reduced daytime and night-time sleep (Fig. 2a,b), with shorter sleep bout lengths and more sleep bouts during the night-time but no reduction in activity counts during waking time (Fig. 2b). This phenotype indicates that the reduced sleep of the eater mutants is also fragmented and not associated with motor activity impairment. Reduction of sleep was not observed in eater heterozygous flies (Extended Data Fig. 2d), indicating that the effect is recessive. Transgenic expression of eater in haemocytes rescued the mutant sleep phenotype, confirming that the phenotype maps to the eater gene (Fig. 2c). We attempted to also rescue eater with a homologous mammalian protein, MEGF11 (ref. 29), but this was not successful (Extended Data Fig. 2e).

White and black bars below graph represent day and night, respectively. Daytime sleep, night-time sleep, mean activity counts per minute, mean sleep bout length and number of night-time sleep bouts in male (top, dark green) and female (bottom, purple) flies were quantified (b). Two-sided Mann–Whitney test was performed for data analysis; n = 32, 32, 32 and 30 for CantonS male, female, eater1 male and female, respectively. c–e, Rescue of sleep reduction in eater mutants through haemocyte-specific eater expression. Sleep time was quantified in eater mutants (c) (green and purple dots) and following eater expression in mutants (yellow and pink dots) (n = 15, 16, 15, 16, 16, 15, 15 and 16 from left to right on the graph, male) (n = 16, 16, 15, 15, 15, 15, 16 and 15 from left to right, female). Sleep time was assessed during and after sleep deprivation in male and female flies (d). Numbers above the each array of dots represent the total sleep time (in minutes) over 6 h for each genotype; n = 15, 16, 16, 15, 16 and 15 for CantonS male, female, eater1 male, female and HmlΔ>eater; eater1 male and female, respectively. Rebound sleep was quantified as gain in sleep ZT0–6 after sleep deprivation relative to the same period before sleep deprivation (dark green and purple) (e). Two-sided Tukey's multiple comparisons test was performed for data analysis in c and e. Two-sided paired t-test was performed for data analysis in d.

To exclude the possibility that the reduced sleep phenotype comes from developmental effects, we used a temperature-sensitive Gal80 (HmlΔ-Gal4 UAS-GFP, Tub-Gal80ts) to block Gal4 expression during development. Knocking down eater in the adult stage only was enough to decrease sleep, indicating that the phenotype is not due to developmental effects (Extended Data Fig. 2f). Furthermore, lack of a circadian phenotype under constant dark conditions (Extended Data Fig. 2g) demonstrated that the decreased sleep amount in eater mutants is not driven by circadian rhythm alterations, indicating that eater affects sleep more directly.

To assess whether eater mutants exhibit rebound sleep, flies were subjected to sleep deprivation, and the amount of sleep gained during recovery was compared with that in control flies (Fig. 2d,e). Although the total sleep during a 6-h recovery period was lower in eater mutants than in controls, the percentage of sleep gain was comparable across groups (Fig. 2d,e). These results indicate that homeostatic regulation of sleep is intact in eater mutants. Altogether, we conclude that eater in haemocytes is required to maintain daily sleep in adult flies.

Although eater is known to be expressed specifically in haemocytes30, we further tested whether the mutant sleep phenotype derives from haemocytes by transferring wild-type haemocytes to eater mutant flies to determine whether this could restore their normal sleep pattern. Due to the challenge of obtaining pure haemocytes from adult flies without any enzymatic treatment, we used larval haemocytes for the transfer experiment (Extended Data Fig. 3a). Using the tissue-clearing method, we confirmed that transferred labelled haemocytes were circulating properly throughout the body and head regions of wild-type and eater mutant flies 4 h after injection (Extended Data Fig. 3b,c).

We then assessed whether the haemocyte transfer rescued the sleep phenotype in eater mutants. We injected haemocytes at the beginning of the day, ZT2, to minimize wound-induced increases in sleep that occur with injection at night6. In wild-type flies, transfer of either wild-type or eater mutant haemocytes did not alter sleep amount or patterns (Fig. 3a,c). In eater mutants, injection alone (for example, with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)) elicited a small, but insignificant, increase in sleep. However, injection with wild-type haemocytes produced the most robust sleep increase—significantly higher than in flies injected with PBS or eater mutant haemocytes (Fig. 3b,c). The fact that both wild-type haemocyte transfer to eater mutants (Fig. 3b,c) and genetic restoration of eater expression in the haemocytes of eater mutants (Fig. 2c) are able to rescue the sleep loss phenotype confirms that eater function in haemocytes is necessary and sufficient to regulate sleep.

The Eater protein, which contains 32 epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like repeats, is known to be involved in three key functions: (1) phagocytosis of Gram-positive bacteria31, (2) cell-to-cell adhesion32 and (3) low-density lipoprotein (LDL) uptake30. These functions are also conserved in mammalian proteins containing EGF-like repeats33. Because we did not deliver bacterial challenges to the fly, we investigated the other two functions of Eater.

First, we assayed the number of circulating haemocytes in the fly head cavity in the eater knockdown background and found that the number was reduced relative to wild type (Fig. 4a,b). The number of head haemocytes was rescued when sleep was increased by gaboxadol feeding but with high variability from fly to fly (Fig. 4a,b), which could reflect impaired localization to glial cells. Thus, we also examined whether the loss of eater in haemocytes affects their proximity to glial cells at the brain surface (Extended Data Fig. 4a–c). Both with eater knockdown and eater mutants, fewer haemocytes were observed near glial cells, consistent with the reduced number in the head cavity (Extended Data Fig. 4a–c), and this was rescued by re-introducing eater expression in haemocytes (Extended Data Fig. 4c). Given that this manipulation was also sufficient to rescue sleep, together with the brain association of haemocytes at times that correspond to sleep (Figs. 1f–j and 4a,b and Extended Data Fig. 4a–c), we conclude that haemocyte recruitment and localization to glial cells influences sleep in flies.

Haemocytes in a were quantified (b); n = 34, 18, 33 and 20 from left to right. c,d, LDs in haemocytes of wild-type, eater mutant and eater rescue backgrounds.

Oil-Red O areas from e were quantified (f); n = 14, 18 and 17 from left to right on the graph.

Two-sided Tukey's multiple comparisons test was performed for b, d and f and two-sided unpaired t-test for h. Two-sided Mann–Whitney test was performed for j.

Scale bars, 100 μm (a, e); 10 μm (c, i); 20 μm (g).

Next we investigated whether haemocytes take up LDs through Eater. First, we visualized LDs using a GFP-tagged LD domain34 in haemocytes (Extended Data Fig. 4d). We found that haemocytes were positive for Oil-Red O staining, and that this staining co-localized with LD-GFP (Extended Data Fig. 4d). Furthermore, we confirmed that lipids in the haemocytes were positive for BODIPY (Extended Data Fig. 4e). Oil-Red O staining in haemocytes was reduced significantly in eater mutants (Fig. 4c,d). This reduction in Oil-Red O staining in haemocytes was restored when Eater was rescued in haemocytes (Fig. 4c,d), indicating that eater is important for LD uptake into haemocytes.

We showed previously that LD accumulation in glial cells changes over the sleep–wake cycle and increases following sleep deprivation11. Given that eater mutants exhibit reduced sleep compared with wild-type flies and less lipid accumulation in haemocytes, we examined LD accumulation in brains (Fig. 4e,f). Compared with wild type, Oil-Red O-positive LDs were increased in glial cells of eater mutants (Fig. 4e,f) or with eater knockdown in haemocytes (Extended Data Fig. 4f–g), and their accumulation was reduced when eater was rescued in haemocytes (Fig. 4e,f). Consistent with a previous report11, we found that most LDs accumulate in cortex glia, with lower levels in the BBB (Fig. 4g,h and Extended Data Fig. 4h–i). LD accumulation in the BBB also appeared to be higher in eater mutants, suggesting that these cells are also affected by loss of Eater.

We next tested the hypothesis that LDs in haemocytes are derived from glia. We expressed GFP-tagged lipid storage droplet2 (LSD2) (UAS-LSD2::GFP)35 in glial cells using the pan-glial driver (Repo-Gal4) and checked whether LSD2::GFP was transferred to haemocytes. More than 80% of haemocytes displayed a glial cell derived LSD2::GFP signal, demonstrating that haemocytes take up LDs from glial cells (Extended Data Fig. 4j–k). To determine which glial subpopulations transfer LDs to haemocytes, we used specific glial drivers. Given that LDs are known to accumulate in cortex glia, it was not surprising to find that approximately 75% of haemocytes were LSD2::GFP-positive when using a cortex glia driver (NP2222-Gal4)—a level comparable to that observed with the pan-glial driver (Extended Data Fig. 4j–k). This suggests that cortex glia are the predominant glial cells transferring LDs to haemocytes. By contrast, when using drivers specific for other glial subpopulations, approximately 50% of haemocytes were LSD2::GFP-positive with an astrocyte-like glia driver (Alrm-Gal4), around 20% with an ensheathing glia driver (MZ0709-Gal4) and about 10% with a BBB glia driver (9-137-Gal4) (Extended Data Fig. 4j–k). When LSD2::GFP was expressed with the cortex glia driver (NP2222-Gal4) in the eater mutant background, fewer LSD2::GFP droplets were observed in haemocytes (Fig. 4i,j). Overall, we conclude that haemocytes interact with glial cells, particularly cortex glia, to uptake LDs through the Eater protein. If the cell-adhesion or LD-uptake function of Eater is diminished, then excess lipids accumulate in cortex glia.

Using a multiple reaction monitoring (MRM)-based lipidomic screening approach36,37, we screened lipid species in haemocytes isolated from the head cavity (Extended Data Fig. 5a–c). Phospholipids, including both diacyl and lyso-species such as phosphatidylcholines, lysophosphatidylcholines, phosphatidylethanolamines and phosphatidylserines, had the highest average intensity across all replicates (Extended Data Fig. 5b,c). Among these, lysophosphatidylcholines and phosphatidylcholines exhibited the highest individual intensities. Although these experiments are not fully quantitative, the data indicate that phospholipids are the predominant lipid components in haemocytes, consistent with previous findings38. By contrast, other lipid classes, including carnitines and cholesteryl esters, contributed lower signal intensities, which could reflect reduced relative abundance. Cholesteryl ester species, which are a principal component of LDL39,40, displayed a broad intensity distribution in head haemocytes. Probably because of the high sensitivity of MRM-screening approaches, we successfully detected cholesteryl esters in head haemocytes, whereas previous studies did not38. We hypothesize that cholesteryl ester results from LDL uptake by haemocytes from glia and is processed when they leave the head cavity (Extended Data Fig. 5b,c). We further focused on the LDL uptake function of Eater in haemocytes.

In previous in vitro experiments, domains 1–199 of the Eater protein were found to interact with acetylated LDL or oxidized LDL30. To test the affinity of haemocyte-expressed Eater for acetylated or oxidized LDL versus neutral LDL, we used an ex vivo system where wild-type or eater mutant haemocytes were cultured with neutral, acetylated or oxidized LDL. Consistent with previous studies30, neither wild-type nor eater mutant haemocytes exhibited any affinity for neutral LDL (Extended Data Fig. 5d,e). However, wild-type haemocytes bound more oxidized (Extended Data Fig. 5f,g) and acetylated (Fig. 5a,b) LDL than eater mutants. Most of the acetylated LDL remained outside the haemocyte (Fig. 5a,b), whereas oxidized LDL was observed intracellularly (Extended Data Fig. 5f,g). This suggests that haemocytes have different affinities or uptake properties for these modified forms of LDL. Oxidized LDL is taken up predominantly by the CD36 homologue croquemort (Crq) in Drosophila26, but knockdown of crq in Hml+ haemocytes or crq mutants did not show a strong sleep phenotype (Extended Data Figs. 2a and 5h). On the other hand, haemocyte Eater affects sleep and affects uptake of both oxidized and acetylated lipids.

We considered the possibility that acetylated lipoproteins, rather than acetylated lipids per se, are targeted by Eater. LD transfer is mediated typically by apolipoproteins41, one such being GLaz—the Drosophila orthologue of apolipoprotein E/D. GLaz is known to be acetylated and knockdown of GLaz decreases sleep in flies11. However, immunoprecipitation assays indicated that levels of acetylated GLaz are similar between wild-type flies and eater mutants (Extended Data Fig. 5i,j and Supplementary Fig. 1), suggesting that it does not contribute to the eater phenotype. We found that eater mutants exhibit an overall increase in acetylated proteins compared with wild-type (Fig. 5c,d and Supplementary Fig. 1).

Numerous proteins undergo acetylation, and this modification is conserved across a wide range of species, from nematodes to humans42,43. Acetylation regulates various cellular processes, including mitochondrial metabolism, protein translation, protein folding and DNA packaging42. It can be catalysed by enzymes such as histone acetyltransferases, or it can occur non-enzymatically when acetyl-CoA levels are elevated in the cell42.

Given the increase of acetylated proteins in eater mutants (Fig. 5c,d and Supplementary Fig. 1), we investigated whether the levels of acetyl-CoA were elevated compared with wild-type flies. Notably, the concentration of acetyl-CoA in eater mutants was more than twice that of wild-type flies (Fig. 5e). We sought to identify candidate proteins that may be targeted by the high acetyl-CoA, and so considered PGC1α and DRP1, which regulate mitochondrial biogenesis and mitochondrial fission, respectively, and whose acetylation affects proper mitochondrial activity44,45. To determine whether PGC1α or DRP1 is more acetylated in the eater mutant brain, we immunoprecipitated acetylated lysine and immunoblotted for the PGC1α and DRP1 proteins (Fig. 5f,g and Supplementary Fig. 1). We found that acetylation of both spargel (srl; Drosophila homologue of PGC1α) and DRP1 is increased in eater mutants (Fig. 5f,g and Supplementary Fig. 1). As compromised mitochondrial activity can affect NAD levels, we measured these in eater mutants and found that NAD+ and NADH levels were lower than in the controls (Fig. 5h and Extended Data Fig. 5k).

To determine whether reducing acetylation could rescue sleep in eater mutants, we overexpressed the deacetylase enzyme sirtuin46 in glia; however, this intervention did not restore total sleep in eater mutants, and instead reduced sleep by itself (Extended Data Fig. 5l). As sirtuin activity depends on NAD+, the depleted NAD+ levels in eater mutants may explain the lack of rescue by sirtuin overexpression. Indeed, supplementing fly food with 10 mM nicotinamide—a precursor for NAD synthesis that can restore NAD+ levels and thereby enhance endogenous deacetylase activity—partially rescued the eater sleep phenotype. Feeding nicotinamide had no effect on sleep in wild-type flies (Fig. 5i,j).

Given the acetylation of key mitochondrial proteins, we assessed mitochondrial integrity by measuring reactive oxygen species (ROS). As a first step, we visualized ROS in the brain using two different fluorescent probes: MitoSox and DHE47 (Extended Data Fig. 5m). Because we were particularly interested in cortex glia, we co-localized with a cortex glia marker and compared ROS levels between wild-type and eater mutant flies (Extended Data Fig. 5m); eater mutants exhibited higher ROS levels than wild-type flies (Fig. 5k,l), with no apparent cell death in the brain (Extended Data Fig. 5n). Altogether, our results indicate that when lipids are not cleared from glial cells by haemocytes, the resulting lipid accumulation in glia leads to metabolic stress, including increased acetyl-CoA, reduced NAD+, mitochondrial dysfunction caused by DRP1 or PGC1α acetylation and elevated ROS levels. This metabolic stress probably contributes to sleep loss in eater mutant flies.

The reduced sleep and dysregulated metabolic processes in eater mutants led us to ask whether memory and lifespan were affected. As seen in some other sleep mutants48,49, eater mutant flies exhibited deficits in both short-term and long-term memory (Fig. 6a,b) and shorter lifespan compared with wild-type flies (Fig. 6c). To determine whether memory loss in eater mutants derives from reduced sleep, we treated flies with gaboxadol for 2 days before the memory experiment. Gaboxadol feeding had no effect on wild-type flies, but in eater mutant flies it was enough to rescue short-term memory but not long-term memory (Fig. 6b).

LDs can be eliminated in two distinct pathways: one involves lipid catabolism through beta oxidation in the cortex glia, the other involves the uptake of LDs from the cortex glia by haemocytes through Eater. When haemocyte-mediated lipid uptake is disrupted, LDs accumulate in cortex glia, leading to increased protein acetylation and ROS levels while reducing NAD+ levels. This metabolic regulation between glia and haemocytes is crucial for maintaining proper brain lipid metabolism. Sleep promotes this metabolic regulation and is reduced when the process is disrupted. Two-sided unpaired t-test (a), two-sided Tukey's multiple comparisons test (b) or log-rank (Mantel–Cox) test (c) were performed for data analysis. n are based on biologically independent experiments. Each dot represents more than 100 flies per experiment. Bars in graphs: the mean with s.d. Images were generated by Illustrator. NS, P > 0.01; *P < 0.1; **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, ****P < 0.0001. Detailed statistics in Supplementary Table 1.

We show here that haemocytes are recruited to the brain during periods of increased sleep and that they clear lipids by means of the Eater protein. If Eater function is impaired, glia accumulate more lipids, and the lipid burden induces metabolic stress with an increase in protein acetylation. This causes mitochondrial dysfunction and metabolic imbalance in the brain (Fig. 6d). In addition to disrupted sleep, memory is impaired and lifespan is shortened. These findings highlight a critical role of brain–periphery interaction, specifically glia–haemocyte lipid transfer, in maintaining brain metabolic health during sleep.

Most studies of immune–sleep interaction have focused on active immune states like inflammation, specific disease or sleep deprived conditions7. In our study we aimed to investigate the interaction between the immune system and sleep in normal daily conditions, where the immune system is not active. We focused on the role of immune cells. To achieve this, we used the simple model organism Drosophila and found that macrophage-like immune cells—haemocytes—in the circulation track to the head during sleep. Notably, these haemocytes are quite localized in the brain, and are not found in the ventral nerve cord, perhaps because they require specialized regions of the BBB. Peak recruitment is during times of high sleep, with head recruitment falling off later in the night. This may indicate that sleep homeostatic drive has been discharged, and is seen with other sleep-dependent processes—for example, endocytosis through the BBB and proboscis extension, which start to decline even earlier in the night50,51. It is also possible that haemocyte recruitment to the brain occurs during specific stages of sleep, which have now been described in the fly.

Screening genes expressed in haemocytes for effects on sleep identified the gene eater, which encodes a protein with 32 EGF-like repeats that is involved in cell–cell adhesion, LDL uptake and phagocytosis of Gram-positive bacteria30. eater mutant flies show reduced total sleep and increased sleep fragmentation (Fig. 2a,b) along with memory defects and reduced lifespan (Fig. 6a–c). We were able to completely rescue sleep as well as localization and lipid uptake phenotypes of eater mutants by expression of eater in haemocytes (Fig. 2c,d).

We find that haemocytes take up lipids from brain cortex glia by the Eater receptor. The lipids taken up are probably those that are transferred to cortex glia from neurons to prevent wake-induced damage to neuronal mitochondria11. Thus, the whole process relieves oxidative burden on the brain, which is supported by the increased oxidation seen in the absence of Eater. Although transporters that mediate neuron–glia transfer have been identified11, how exactly lipids are transferred from cortex glia to haemocytes is unclear. Our data confirm physical contact between haemocytes and glial cells, supporting direct haemocyte–glia interactions. Given the direct contacts we see between BBB glia and haemocytes, we speculate that LDs from cortex glia are transferred through the BBB to haemocytes; direct contacts between haemocytes and cortex glia may also occur, but would require validation. Although LD accumulation occurs predominantly in cortex glia, we note that other glial subpopulations, in particular astrocytes, also transfer LSD2::GFP-labelled lipids to haemocytes. It is possible that astrocytes process lipids without accumulating LDs or, alternatively, that they transfer droplets or fatty acids through lipoprotein particles to other glia37. Ultimately, many of these lipids end up in haemocytes. However, some are probably also processed in glia by beta-oxidation, thereby generating energy. Likewise, we speculate that the lipids transported in haemocytes are processed, either within the haemocytes themselves or in the fat body. Specific lipid binding/processing molecules have been implicated in the regulation of sleep52.

In addition to increased LDs, eater mutant brains had higher levels of acetylated proteins, increased acetyl-CoA levels and reduced NAD+ levels. Although the sequence of these changes remains uncertain, we propose that loss of lipid uptake by Eater leads to an accumulation of LDs, triggering metabolic stress characterized by elevated acetyl-CoA, increased acetylation of key mitochondrial proteins and impaired mitochondrial function. Increased acetyl-CoA levels are also indicative of less beta-oxidation and lower energy production. This fuels a vicious cycle of metabolic stress, oxidative damage and LD accumulation. The consequently reduced levels of NAD+ may further contribute to increased acetylation by impairing NAD-dependent deacetylase enzymes, such as sirtuins46. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that increased acetyl-CoA levels are a consequence of reduced uptake of acetylated lipids by Eater. Alternatively, lower NAD may be an early outcome of metabolic stress and, by reducing activity of deacetylases, could account for higher acetylation of DRP1 and PGC1α. Acetylation of PGC1α is known to inhibit its function44 whereas acetylation of DRP1 increases its activity but induces metabolic stress and cellular dysfunction45. Haynes et al. previously demonstrated that knockdown of Drp1 in neurons or glia decreases sleep, as does knockdown of beta-oxidation-related genes, such as Mcad11. Similar impairments of mitochondrial function probably result from acetylation of DRP1 and PGC1α, the latter being a transcription factor that promotes mitochondrial biogenesis and the expression of beta-oxidation-related genes45.

Protein acetylation (beyond histones) has been studied mostly in the context of metabolic syndromes such as alcoholic liver disease, high fat diet or atherosclerosis53, with less known about its role in other biological processes. We found that eater mutants have elevated acetylated proteins and lower NAD+ levels. Recent research on short sleep mutants has identified decreased NAD+ levels in the brain54 but, to our knowledge, protein acetylation has not been examined in the context of sleep regulation. These findings, including the reduced sleep produced by SIRT1 overexpression, suggest that the interplay between NAD+ levels and protein acetylation in the brain may have a critical role in sleep control and function.

Although brain–periphery interactions are currently receiving attention, the role we report here for haemocytes is unprecedented. Our findings suggest that oxidated and acetylated lipids need to be removed from the brain by haemocytes to prevent oxidative damage and preserve the integrity of brain mitochondria. In mammals, microglia are key glial cell types that take up lipids from neurons, and are particularly important in the context of neurodegeneration55. As Drosophila lack microglia, circulating haemocytes may serve an analogous function, acting as intermediaries for lipid uptake and transport/storage and combating stress by accumulating LDs. We find that this is a sleep-dependent process. Although sleep is thought to promote clearance in the brain, the idea that peripheral blood cells contribute to this process represents a critical new perspective.

All flies for experiments were maintained at 25 °C in a 12 h–12 h light–dark cycle, except for the temperature-sensitive Gal80 experiment in which Gal80 flies were kept at 18 °C until the experiment and activated Gal4 at 30 °C for 2 days. For the gene switch experiment, 500 μM mifepristone (RU486, sigma, catalogue no. M8046) was added to sucrose/agar food. For the RU486 control food, the same amount of 80% ethanol was added to sucrose/agar food.

For the fly sleep recording, mated 5- to 7-day-old flies were loaded into glass tubes containing 5% sucrose with 2% agarose. At least 2 days after loading into the monitors, sleep was analysed for 3  days. Single beam monitors were used for RNAi screening and the sleep deprivation experiment, but other sleep recordings were performed with multibeam monitors. Sleep was defined as failure of the fly to cross the red beam in the monitor for 5 or more minutes, analysis of data was performed with an in-house built code as described previously56.

We used mechanical sleep deprivation. To achieve deprivation, flies in single beam monitors were fixed to a vortex machine and shaken randomly for 2 s every 20 s over a 12-h period (from ZT12–ZT24). To estimate rebound sleep, 6 h of sleep after sleep deprivation was compared with sleep on the pre-deprivation day at the same ZT time (ZT0–ZT6). Analysis of per cent sleep gain was as described previously57. In short, 6 h of daytime sleep on the day before deprivation was subtracted from the 6 h after deprivation (sleep gain). Similarly, sleep loss was calculated by subtracting sleep during deprivation to night-time sleep a day before the deprivation (sleep loss). Percentage of sleep gain was calculated by amount of sleep gain relative to amount of sleep loss.

For visualizing circulating haemocytes, we optimized two different protocols58,59. Heads of female HmlΔ-LexA LexAop-mCheery flies were cut with a micro-scissor and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 4 h at room temperature with rotation. After fixation, heads were incubated with 100% methanol at 4 °C overnight. Methanol was removed the following day and heads were incubated with BABB solution (2:1 ratio of benzyl benzoate and benzyl alcohol) for at least 6 h. After removing the BABB solution, heads were mounted on glass slides with VECTASHIELD solution without 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). Imaging was performed immediately after mounting and a 408-nm excitation laser was used for auto-fluorescent signals. For thermogenetic experiments where wake or sleep neuronal populations were manipulated, flies were maintained at 18 °C until TrpA1 was activated for 1 day at 30 °C. Following this, they were processed as above. For haemocyte counts, we used the three-dimensional (3D) object counter in ImageJ software.

Brains were dissected from female flies, fixed in a 4% paraformaldehyde solution and washed three times using 0.4% PBS TritonX-100. After three washes, samples were blocked using 10% normal goat serum for 30 min at 25 °C. Samples were incubated with the desired primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C and then washed three times using 0.4% PBS TritonX-100 (PBST). Samples were incubated with secondary antibodies (Life Tech, catalogue nos. A32723, A32740, A32742, A32731 and A21236) diluted 1:250 for 2 h. Samples were then washed three times with 0.4% PBST. After washing, samples were rinsed and kept in VECTASHIELD until they were mounted on glass slides. For haemocytes count, we did not remove air sacs to maximize the number of haemocytes. The following primary antibodies were used: α-NimC1 (a gift from I. Ando; 1:100), α-brp (Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank (DSHB), catalogue no. nc82; 1:100), α-Repo (DSHB, catalogue no. 8D12; 1:100), α-cleaved dcp1 (Cell Signaling, catalogue no. 9578S; 1:100), Oil-Red O (Sigma, catalogue no. O9755) and BODIPY 493/503 (Fisher, catalogue no. D3922, 1:1,000). Images were obtained with a Leica Stellaris STED confocal microscope. For haemocyte counts, we used the 3D object counter in ImageJ software.

Brains from female flies were dissected and fixed as for immunohistochemistry. After fixation, brains were washed three times with 0.4% PBS TritonX-100 and kept in 0.4% PBST overnight at 4 °C. If a sample needed primary antibody incubation, it was blocked with 10% normal goat serum in 0.4% PBS TritonX-100 for 30 min and then kept in diluted antibody with 0.4% PBST overnight at 4 °C. The following day, Oil-Red O solution (0.1 g per 20 ml of isopropanol; Sigma, catalogue no. O0625) was prepared in 0.4% PBST as a 2:3 ratio. If not stained with primary antibody, the sample was incubated with Oil-Red O solution for 10 min and washed with distilled water five times for 5 min each. If samples were stained with primary antibody, samples were washed and treated with secondary antibody and, after the secondary antibody, incubated with Oil-Red O solution. Finally, samples were rinsed with PBS and mounted in VECTASHIELD until they were mounted on glass slides. Images were obtained with the Leica Stellaris STED confocal microscope.

To count LDs, images were analysed with a custom ImageJ macro. For each slice in the stack, the BioVoxxel toolbox was used to subtract background noise using the convoluted background subtraction method with a mean convolution filter of 3 radius. Once the background was subtracted, the image was duplicated, and one of the copies was converted into a mask that contained only the brain region. Inside the masked area, LDs were counted using the Analyze Particles tool, defining a particle size of 2–250 and circularity of 0.4–1.0. Reported results are the sum of particles in the whole stack. The macro is publicly available at https://github.com/CamiloGuevaraEsp/lipid_droplets.

In a 15-ml tube, at least 100 mixed-sex flies were collected for immunoprecipitation, or 20 flies for western blot. Flies were frozen on dry ice for 10 min. After freezing, flies were vortexed for 10–20 s three times to shake off heads. Flies were then poured into a sieve that allows passage only of heads. Fly heads were homogenized at 25 Hz for 2 min in a TissueLyser II (Qiagen) in 100 μl of lysis buffer for immunoprecipitation (250 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 250 mM NaCl, 1.5 M sucrose, 1% TritonX-100, protease inhibitor cocktail) or for western blot (RIPA buffer, Lifetech, catalogue no. 89901) with a 5-mm stainless steel bead (Qiagen, catalogue no. 69989) in round-bottom tubes (USA Scientific, catalogue no. 1620-2700). Homogenized samples were transferred to 1.7-ml microcentrifuge tubes and spun at 14,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were used for the experiment. For immunoprecipitation, protein A/G magnetic agarose beads (Fisher, catalogue no. 78609) were used for antibody conjugation. Antibody conjugation to the bead or incubation of antibody with samples was performed in the cold room overnight. Samples were run in a 4–12% premade gel (Life Tech, catalogue no. NP0322). The following antibodies were used: anti-acetylated lysine-mouse (Life Tech, catalogue no. MA12021; 1:1,000), anti-acetylated lysine-rabbit (Cell Signaling, catalogue no. 9441S; 1:1,000), anti-DRP1 (a gift from L. Fisher; 1:1,000), anti-SRL (a gift from A. Duttaroy, 1:1,000), anti-α-tubulin (DSHB, catalogue no. 12G10; 1:1,000), anti-FLAG (Sigma, catalogue no. F3165; 1:2,000), anti-mouse-horseradish peroxidase (HRP) (Jackson Immuno, catalogue no. 715-035-151; 1:2,000), anti-rabbit-HRP (Jackson Immuno, catalogue no. 715-035-152; 1:2,000) and HRP signal was obtained with ECL substrate (Life Tech, catalogue no. 32209).

At least 100 HmlΔ-Gal4 UAS-EGFP fly heads were cut with a micro-scissor under the microscope and kept in a round-bottom tube with 1,000 μl of ice-cold Schneider's medium (Life Tech, catalogue no. 21720024) until the cutting was finished. With a metal bead, fly heads were homogenized with a TissueLyser II (Qiagen) at 25 Hz for 2 min. Samples were centrifuged at 6,000 rpm, for 5 min at 4 °C. Supernatant was discarded and pellets were treated with 37 °C pre-warmed 100 μl of Collagenase Type C (100 mg ml−1, Worthington-Biochem, catalogue no. LS004140), 380 μl of PBS, 20 μl of Dispase II (100 mg ml−1, Sigma, catalogue no. D4693). Samples were incubated on a rotator for 15 min and pipetted with a 200 μl pipet every 5 min. Then, 200 μl of ice-cold PBS was added to the sample, which was transferred to a 1.7-ml microcentrifuge tube. Samples were spun at 6,000 rpm, for 5 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was discarded and pellets were resuspended in 500 μl of cold Schneider's medium; 0.5 μl DAPI (1 mg ml−1) was added and, after a short vortexing, samples were spun at 6,000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C. Again, supernatant was discarded, and samples were resuspended in 600 μl of Schneider's medium. Debris or clumps were removed using a 40-μm strainer (Sigma, catalogue no. BAH136800040) and samples were transferred to a 5-ml fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) sorting tube. We used an Aria FACS sorter (BD Biosciences) with a 100-μm nozzle. Usually, 100 fly heads yield approximately 400 GFP+ haemocytes after sorting. The detailed cell gating strategy is in Supplementary Fig. 1.

At least 30 larvae were dissected in Schneider's medium (Life Tech, catalogue no. 21720024) and kept on ice during the dissection. Samples were spun at 6,000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C. Haemocytes were resuspended with 100 μl of PBS for a cell density of 100–150 cells per microlitre. Using the microneedle, 2–3 μl of haemocytes were injected into the fly thorax. HmlΔ-LexA LexAop-mCherry haemocytes were used for validating haemocyte transfer.

Larvae were dissected in 15 μl of Schneider's medium (Life Tech, catalogue no. 21720024). Haemocytes were transferred to Schneider's medium containing Dil-labelled neutral, oxidized or acetylated LDL (1:100 dilution, Life Tech, catalogue nos. L3482, L34358, L3484) in the tube. Haemocytes were incubated on Teflon printed microscopic slides (Immune-Cell, catalogue no. 61-100-17) for 2 h in the cold room. After 2 h, haemocytes were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and washed three times with 0.4% PBST. Haemocytes were kept in VECTASHIELD with DAPI before the imaging; images were obtained with a Leica Stellaris STED confocal microscope.

Flies were raised on normal food for 5 days after eclosion and then transferred to sleep recording glass tubes that contain 5% sucrose and 2% agarose food with or without 10 mM nicotinamide (Sigma, catalogue no. 72345).

Gaboxadol hydrochloride (Sigma, catalogue no. T101) was dissolved in the normal fly food at a 2 mM concentration. Flies were kept in this for 2 days.

To measure acetyl-CoA in the fly head, ten female flies were collected in the 15-ml falcon tube and frozen on dry ice for 10 min. After freezing, flies were vortexed for 10–20 s three times to shake off heads. Flies were then poured into a sieve that allows passage only of heads. Ten fly heads were homogenized at 25 Hz for 2 min in a TissueLyser II (Qiagen) in extraction buffer from the acetyl-CoA colorimetric assay kit (Elabscience, catalogue no. E-BC-K652-M). After homogenization, all procedures followed the manufacturer's instructions from the kit.

To measure NAD+/NADH in the fly head, ten male and female CantonS and eater1 mutant flies were collected around ZT6 in 1.5-ml tubes then flash-frozen on dry ice. After freezing, flies were vortexed, and ten heads were collected then placed in a 2-ml tube with metal beads and 1 ml of lysis buffer (1:1 PBS: extraction buffer (10% DTAB 0.2 M NaOH)). The heads were homogenized using a TissueLyser II (Qiagen) at 25 Hz for 2 min. The homogenized liquid was passed through homogenizer tubes (Invitrogen, catalogue no. 12183-026) in a centrifuge for 5 min at 15,000 rpm at 4 °C. To measure NAD+ and NADH individually, 200 μl of lysate was added to separate 1.5-ml tubes; 100 ml of 4 M HCl was added to the NAD+ tube, and both were heated for 15 min at 60 °C. After incubation at room temperature for 10 min, 100 μl of 0.5 M Trizma base buffer was added to the NAD+ tube, and 200 μl neutralization buffer (a 1:1 mixture of 0.5 M Trizma: 0.4 M HCl) was added to the NADH tube. NAD+ samples were diluted 1:5 and NADH samples were diluted 1:1 using dilution buffer. Samples and standards were prepared 1:1 with NAD+/NADH-Glo detection reagent (Promega, catalogue no. G9071) according to manufacturer's instructions, seeded onto a 384-well plate, and measured using a BioTek Cytation 5 imaging reader and the accompanying Gen5 v.3.12 software. Individual data points are the mean of three technical replicates.

To stain the fly brain with MitoSox (Fisher, catalogue no. M36008), ten fly brains were dissected in Schneider's medium and kept in medium until the dissection was finished. Brains were transferred to Schneider's medium with MitoSox dye (final concentration 5 μM) and incubated for 10 min with rotation at room temperature. After the incubation, brains were washed with Schneider's medium three times for 3 min with rotation. Brains were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 2 min and rinsed with PBS. MitoSox signal was imaged immediately after mounting with VECTA SHIELD using a Leica Stellaris STED confocal microscope.

The memory experiment was as published60. In brief, 100 flies, 3–6 days old and of mixed sex, from the same genotype, were starved in agarose for 18 h. On the following day, flies were trained at 25 °C in 70% humidity in a small chamber containing 1.5 M sucrose or water soaked Whatman paper with odours (1:200 ratio of 4-methylcyclohexanol or 1:80 ratio of 3-octanol in paraffin oil) for 2 min under red light. After training, flies were placed in the bidirectional choice apparatus, which has an odour in each end. To remove bias coming from the odour, appetitive training was performed reciprocally. For long-term memory, trained flies were kept again in the agarose food for 18 h and the memory experiment was performed without re-training.

Three hundred age-matched female or male flies were collected for 5 days and transferred to vials of 30 flies each. Every 2 or 3 days, flies were flipped into new vials and the number of flies was counted.

From the HmlΔ-Gal4 UAS-EGFP fly, haemocytes were sorted by flow cytometry and 4,000 GFP+ cells were sorted into a 1.7-ml microcentrifuge tube. GFP+ cells were centrifuged at 6,000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C, and pellets were kept at −80 °C until lipid extraction. Lipid extraction from fly haemocytes was performed using a modified Bligh and Dyer method61. In brief, frozen cell pellets were thawed at room temperature for 10 min before the addition of 200 µl of ultrapure water to facilitate cell lysis. This was followed by the addition of 450 µl of methanol and 250 µl of HPLC-grade chloroform. During extraction, 5 µl of 1 µg ml−1 of an internal standard mixture comprised of equiSPLASH (Avanti Polar Lipids, catalogue no. 330731), fatty acid 16:0-d2 (Cayman Chemical) and carnitine 14:0-d3 (Cayman Chemical) was added to each sample. The samples were vortexed for 10 s to form a single-phase solution and incubated at 4 °C for 15 min. Subsequently, 250 µl of ultrapure water and 250 µl of chloroform were added, inducing phase separation. The samples were then centrifuged at 16,000g for 10 min. The organic phase, containing the extracted lipids, was transferred carefully to fresh tubes and evaporated using a vacuum concentrator to obtain dried lipid extracts.

The dried lipid extracts were reconstituted in 200 µl of a 3:1 methanol:chloroform (MeOH:CHCl3) mix containing 10 mM ammonium formate. Following reconstitution, all samples were analysed using MRM methods. An injection solvent containing 0.02 µg ml−1 EquiSPLASH (Avanti Polar Lipids, catalogue no. 330731) was used as a quality control sample to monitor peak stability over time.

Lipidomic analyses were performed using an Agilent 6495C triple quadrupole mass spectrometer coupled to an Agilent 1290 Infinity II LC system with a G7167B autosampler. Samples were introduced into the Agilent Jet Stream (AJS) ion source by direct flow injection (no chromatographic separation). Mass spectrometry data were acquired for 3 min per injection. For each MRM scan, 8 μl of sample was injected. MRM methods were organized into 25 methods on the basis of the ten main lipid classes based on the LipidMaps database, spanning over a total of 3,000 individual lipid species. Triacylglycerols and diacylglycerols were divided into separate methods based on fatty acid neutral loss residues. All MRM data were processed using CLAW MRM36.

a. Localization of HmlΔ-LexA+ hemocytes (Hml Δ-LexA LexAop-mCherry, red) in the fly. Structure of the fly was visualized with a UV laser (Autofluorescence, white). b-f. Localization of the hemocytes near the brain. Visualizing of hemocyte with Srp-Gal4 (Top left, green), Srp-hemo-Gal4DBD/AD (Top right, green), Ppn-Gal4 (Bottom left, green), or eated-dsRed (Bottom right, red). Brain was visualized with brp (magenta), DAPI (Blue). BBB was visualized with 9-137-Gal4 (bottom right, green) (b). Hemocytes (Hml; green, NimC1; red) are not detected in the ventral nerve cord (c). Heatmap of average Hml+ cell number across the brain (mean with standard deviation, n = 22) (left). Representative image of Hml+ cells (green) across the brain (brp, magenta) used for analysis (right) (d). NimC1+ hemocytes (red) are located next to the Perineurial glia (PG, green, NP6293-Gal4 UAS-mCD8GFP, top) or Sub-perineurial glia (SPG, green, moody-Gal4 UAS-mCD8GFP, bottom) (e). 3D reconstruction of Fig. 1e shows that NimC1+ (magenta) hemocytes physically interact with perineurial glial cells (green) (f). Cortex glial cells were visualized with RFP (red) (R85G01-LexA LexAop-mCD8GFP NP2222-Gal4 UAS-mCD8RFP). g-h. Strong GRASP signals (green) were detected between Repo+ glial cells (magenta) and hemocytes, using Repo-LexA and HmlΔ-Gal4 to drive the two halves of GFP (top). In contrast, little green signal was observed in the Repo-LexA GRASP control samples (top right) or HmlΔ-Gal4 GRASP control samples (bottom right). Neuropil was visualized using brp (white) (g). With the use of SPG-LexA (R54C07-LexA) and HmlΔ-Gal4, strong GRASP signals (green; left) were detected but not in SPG-LexA GRASP control samples (right). Cell membrane was visualized using phalloidin (magenta) (h). To detect SPG-LexA and HmlΔ-Gal4 GRASP signals, GFP antibody was used. DAPI: blue, White scale bar, 100 μm unless it's not indicated. All images above are representative images obtained from at least three different experiments.

a. Screen for genes regulating sleep in hemocytes using RNAi knockdown with HmlΔ-Gal4. The sleep amount in wild-type flies is indicated by a black column with a dotted line.

a-c. Analysis of lipid classes in hemocytes. A lipidomic analysis pipeline utilizing Multiple Reaction Monitoring (MRM) profiling with an Agilent 6495 C Triple Quadrupole Mass Spectrometer (MS) followed by automated data analysis. The data are depicted as a boxplot representation of the intensity distribution of various lipid classes detected in wild-type hemocyte samples (HmlΔ>GFP/ +, N = 3) using multiple reaction monitoring (MRM)-based lipidomics. The full intensity distribution across lipid classes, highlighting variations in signal intensities, is shown (left). On the right is a zoomed-in view providing a more detailed comparison of lipid classes with lower intensity signals (right). Each lipid class is color-coded, and individual data points represent detected lipid species (b). Diacylglycerols (DAGs), triacylglycerols (TAGs), and lipid classes in hemocytes are depicted by MRM intensity distribution. Pie charts represent the relative intensity distribution of DAG species categorized by fatty acid (FA) chain composition across three biological replicates (N1, N2, N3) (top). The relative intensity distribution of TAG species is indicated by FA chain composition, showcasing the diversity of FA chains (middle). Predominant lipid classes detected are indicated by lipid class distribution within the lipidomic profile (bottom). The color legends correspond to the FA chain composition and lipid classes in each panel (c). The box represents the interquartile range (25%–75% percentiles) and the line inside box means median. d-g. Ex vivo culture of hemocytes with neutral or oxidized LDL. Neutral LDL (red) were barely observed within or attached to wild-type (left, green, HmlΔ>GFP/+, n = 30) or eater mutant (right, green, HmlΔ>GFP/+, eater1, n = 30) hemocytes (d). Quantification of the bound neutral LDL on the hemocytes. Bounded amount was normalized to CantonS hemocytes (e). Oxidized LDL (OxLDL) (red) were observed inside the wild-type hemocytes (left, green, HmlΔ>GFP/+, n = 30) and eater mutants (right, green, HmlΔ>GFP/+, eater1, n = 30) (f). Quantification of the bound oxidized LDL in the hemocytes. Bounded amount was normalized to CantonS hemocytes (g). Two-sided Mann-Whitney test was performed for data analysis. h. Quantification of daytime and nighttime sleep time in the crq mutant (CrqΔ) fly (top; male, bottom; female). n = 15 for CantonS, n = 16 for CrqΔ males, n = 15 for CantonS, n = 16 for CrqΔ females. Two-sided Mann-Whitney test was performed for data analysis. i-j. Immunoprecipitation of acetylated GLaz from wild-type or eater mutant brain. GLaz expression level in the wild-type (CantonS, C.S, n = 4) or eater mutant (eater1, n = 4) is similar in the lysate. The level of acetylated-GLaz is also similar (i). This is supported by quantification of acetylated-GLaz levels (j). IB: immunoblot. IP: Immunoprecipitation. LysAC: acetylated lysine. Tub: alpha tubulin. Two-sided Mann-Whitney test was performed for data analysis. n represents biologically independent experiments. k. Measurement of NADH levels in eater mutant (eater1, n = 8) and wild-type (CantonS, n = 8) heads. Two-sided Unpaired t test was performed for data analysis. n represents biologically independent experiments. l.

Scalable implementation of quantum networks and photonic processors demands integrated photonic memories with high efficiency, yet current integrated systems have been limited to storage efficiencies below 27.8%. Here we demonstrate highly efficient integrated quantum memories based on rare-earth-ion-doped crystals coupled with impedance-matched microcavities, realized in two novel architectures: 200-μm-thin membranes of Eu3+:Y2SiO5 integrated with fibre-based microcavities and waveguide-based cavities fabricated using femtosecond lasers. Our approach achieves reliable integrated quantum storage with record efficiencies of 80.3(7)% for weak coherent pulses and 69.8(1.6)% for telecom-heralded single photons, alongside the storage of 20 temporal modes with an average efficiency of 51.3(2)%. Moreover, the thin-membrane Eu3+:Y2SiO5 architecture enables spectrally tunable efficient quantum storage via variable strain, providing a flexible interface for quantum networks. By combining high efficiency, large multimode capacity and tunability, our devices establish a versatile hardware foundation for scalable quantum repeaters and chip-scale photonic processors.

The largest western AI labs are taking a break from sniping at one another to partner on a new accelerator program for European startups building applications on top of their models. Paris-based incubator Station F will run the program, named F/ai.

On Tuesday, Station F announced it had partnered with Meta, Microsoft, Google, Anthropic, OpenAI and Mistral, which it says marks the first time the firms are all participating in a single accelerator. Other partners include cloud and semiconductor companies AWS, AMD, Qualcomm, and OVH Cloud.

An accelerator is effectively a crash course for early-stage startups, whereby founders attend classes and lectures, consult with specialists, and receive introductions to potential investors and customers. The broad aim is to help startups bring ideas to market as quickly as possible.

The 20 startups in each F/ai cohort will undergo a curriculum geared specifically toward helping European AI startups generate revenue earlier in their lifecycle, in turn making it easier to secure the funding required to expand into the largest global markets. “We're focusing on rapid commercialization,” says Roxanne Varza, director at Station F, in an interview with WIRED. “Investors are starting to feel like, ‘European companies are nice, but they're not hitting the $1 million revenue mark fast enough.'”

The accelerator will run for three months, twice a year. The first edition began on January 13. Station F has not revealed which startups make up the cohort, but many were recommended by Sequoia Capital, General Catalyst, Lightspeed, or one of the other VC firms involved in the program. The startups are all building AI applications on top of the foundational models developed by the partnering labs, in areas ranging from agentic AI to procurement and finance.

In lieu of direct funding, participating founders will receive more than $1 million in credits that can be traded for access to AI models, compute, and other services from the partner firms.

With very few exceptions, European companies have so far lagged behind their American and Chinese counterparts at every stage of the AI production line. To try to close that gap, the UK and EU governments are throwing hundreds of millions of dollars at attempts to support homegrown AI firms, and develop the domestic data center and power infrastructure necessary to train and operate AI models and applications.

In the US, tech accelerators like Y Combinator have produced a crop of household names, including Airbnb, Stripe, DoorDash, and Reddit. OpenAI was itself established in 2015 with the help of funding from Y Combinator's then research division. Station F intends for F/ai to have a similar impact in Europe, making domestic AI startups competitive on the international stage. “It's for European founders with a global ambition,” says Varza.

The program also represents a chance for the US-based AI labs to sow further seeds in Europe, using subsidies to incentivize a new generation of startups to build atop their technologies.

Once a developer begins to build on top of a particular model, it is rarely straightforward to swap to an alternative, says Marta Vinaixa, partner and CEO at VC firm Ryde Ventures. “When you build on top of these systems, you're also building for how the systems behave—their quirkiness,” she says. “Once you start with a foundation, at least for the same project, you're not going to change to another.”

The earlier in a company's lifecycle it begins to develop on top of a particular model, says Vinaixa, the more that effect is magnified. “The sooner that you start, the more that you accumulate, the more difficult it becomes,” she says.

Out beyond the orbit of Neptune lies an expansive ring of ancient relics, dynamical enigmas, and possibly a hidden planet—or two.

The Kuiper Belt, a region of frozen debris about 30 to 50 times farther from the sun than the Earth is—and perhaps farther, though nobody knows—has been shrouded in mystery since it first came into view in the 1990s.

Over the past 30 years, astronomers have cataloged about 4,000 Kuiper Belt objects (KBOs), including a smattering of dwarf worlds, icy comets, and leftover planet parts. But that number is expected to increase tenfold in the coming years as observations from more advanced telescopes pour in. In particular, the Vera C. Rubin Observatory in Chile will illuminate this murky region with its flagship project, the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), which began operating last year. Other next-generation observatories, such as the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), will also help to bring the belt into focus.

“Beyond Neptune, we have a census of what's out there in the solar system, but it's a patchwork of surveys, and it leaves a lot of room for things that might be there that have been missed,” says Renu Malhotra, who serves as Louise Foucar Marshall Science Research Professor and Regents Professor of Planetary Sciences at the University of Arizona.

“I think that's the big thing that Rubin is going to do—fill out the gaps in our knowledge of the contents of the solar system,” she adds. “It's going to greatly advance our census and our knowledge of the contents of the solar system.”

As a consequence, astronomers are preparing for a flood of discoveries from this new frontier, which could shed light on a host of outstanding questions. Are there new planets hidden in the belt, or lurking beyond it? How far does this region extend? And are there traces of cataclysmic past encounters between worlds—both homegrown or from interstellar space—imprinted in this largely pristine collection of objects from the deep past?

“I think this will become a very hot field very soon, because of LSST,” says Amir Siraj, a graduate student at Princeton University who studies the Kuiper Belt.

The Kuiper Belt is a graveyard of planetary odds and ends that were scattered far from the sun during the messy birth of the solar system some 4.6 billion years ago. Pluto was the first KBO ever spotted, more than a half-century before the belt itself was discovered.

Since the 1990s, astronomers have found a handful of other dwarf planets in the belt, such as Eris and Sedna, along with thousands of smaller objects. While the Kuiper Belt is not completely static, it is, for the most part, an intact time capsule of the early solar system that can be mined for clues about planet formation.

For example, the belt contains weird structures that may be signatures of past encounters between giant planets, including one particular cluster of objects, known as a “kernel,” located at about 44 astronomical units (AU), where one AU is the distance between Earth and the sun (about 93 million miles).

While the origin of this kernel is still unexplained, one popular hypothesis is that its constituent objects—which are known as cold classicals—were pulled along by Neptune's outward migration through the solar system more than 4 billion years ago, which may have been a bumpy ride.

The idea is that “Neptune got jiggled by the rest of the gas giants and did a bit of a jump; it's called the ‘jumping Neptune' scenario,” says Wes Fraser, an astronomer at the Dominion Astrophysical Observatory, National Research Council of Canada, who studies the Kuiper Belt, noting that astronomer David Nesvorný came up with the idea.

“Imagine a snowplow driving along a highway, and lifting up the plow. It leaves a clump of snow behind,” he adds. “That same sort of idea is what left the clump of cold classicals behind. That is the kernel.”

In other words, Neptune tugged these objects along with it as it migrated outward, but then broke its gravitational hold over them when it “jumped,” leaving them to settle into the Kuiper Belt in the distinctive Neptune-sculpted kernel pattern that remains intact to this day.

Last year, Siraj and his advisers at Princeton set out to look for other hidden structures in the Kuiper Belt with a new algorithm that analyzed 1,650 KBOs—about 10 times as many objects as the 2011 study, led by Jean-Robert Petit, that first identified the kernel.

The results consistently confirmed the presence of the original kernel, while also revealing a possibly new “inner kernel,” located at about 43 AU, though more research is needed to confirm this finding, according to the team's 2025 study.

“You have these two clumps, basically, at 43 and 44 AU,” Siraj explains. “It's unclear whether they're part of the same structure,” but “either way, it's another clue about, perhaps, Neptune's migration, or some other process that formed these clumps.”

As Rubin and other telescopes discover thousands more KBOs in the coming years, the nature and possible origin of these mysterious structures in the belt may become clearer, potentially opening new windows into the tumultuous origins of our solar system.

In addition to reconstructing the early lives of the known planets, astronomers who study the Kuiper Belt are racing to spot unknown planets. The most famous example is the hypothetical giant world known as Planet Nine or Planet X, first proposed in 2016. Some scientists have suggested that the gravitational influence of this planet, if it exists, might explain strangely clustered orbits within the Kuiper Belt, though this speculative world would be located well beyond the belt, at several hundred AU.

Siraj and his colleagues have also speculated about the possibility of a Mercury- or Mars-sized world, dubbed Planet Y, that may be closer to the belt, at around 80 to 200 AU, according to their 2025 study. Rubin is capable of spotting these hypothetical worlds, though it may be challenging to anticipate the properties of planets that lurk this far from the sun.

“We know nothing about the atmospheres and surfaces of gas giant or ice giant type planets at 200, 300, or 400 AU,” Fraser says. “We know nothing about their chemistry. Every single time we look at an exoplanet, it behaves differently than what our models predict.”

“I think Planet Nine might very well just be a tar ball that is so dark that we can't see it, and that's why it hasn't been discovered yet,” he adds. “If we found that, I wouldn't be too surprised. And who knows what an Earth [in the belt] would look like? Certainly the compositional makeup will be different than a Mars, or an Earth, or a Venus, in the inner solar system.”

Observatories like Rubin and JWST may fill in these tantalizing gaps in our knowledge of the Kuiper Belt, and perhaps pinpoint hidden planets. But even if these telescopes reveal an absence of planets, it would be a breakthrough.

“There's a lot of room for discovery of large bodies,” says Malhotra. “That would be awesome, but if we don't find any, that would tell us something as well.”

“Not finding them up to some distance would give us estimates of how efficient or inefficient the planet formation process was,” she adds. “It would fill in some of the uncertainties that we have in our models.”

One other major open question about the Kuiper Belt is the extent of its boundaries. The belt suddenly tapers off at about 50 AU, an edge called the Kuiper cliff. This is a puzzling feature, because it suggests that our solar system has an anomalously small debris belt compared with other systems.

“The solar system looks kind of weird,” Fraser says. “The Kuiper cliff is a somewhat sharp delineation. Beyond that, we have no evidence that there was a disk of material. And yet, if you look at other stellar systems that have debris disks, the vast majority of those are significantly larger.”

“If we were to find a debris disk at, say, 100 AU, that would immediately make the solar system not weird, and quite average at that point,” he notes.

In 2024, Fraser and his colleagues presented hints of a possible undiscovered population of objects that may exist at about 100 AU—though he emphasizes that these are candidate detections, and are not yet confirmed to be a hidden outer ring.

However, even Rubin may not be able to resolve the presence of the tiny and distant objects that could represent a new outer limit of the Kuiper Belt. Time will tell.

As astronomers gear up for this major step change in our understanding of the Kuiper Belt, answers to some of our most fundamental questions hang in the balance. With its immaculate record of the early solar system, this region preserves secrets from the deep past. Here there are probably not dragons, but there may well be hidden planets, otherworldly structures, and discoveries that haven't yet been imagined.

“I'd say the big question is, what's out there?” Malhotra says. “What are we missing?”

Amazon has won the Federal Communications Commission's approval to go ahead with its plan to launch thousands of second-generation Amazon Leo satellites for its broadband internet network, even though the first-generation constellation is far from complete. 

The approval would add more than 4,500 satellites to the previously authorized constellation of 3,232 Gen 1 spacecraft, expanding coverage to the entire globe, including the poles.

“Amazon Leo Gen 1 performance is impressive on its own, but lots to look forward to with Leo Gen 2: More capacity, more coverage (including polar) and additional throughput — good for customers everywhere, and especially important for big enterprise/gov customers who want max performance to move large amounts of data through our network,” Rajeev Badyal, vice president of technology for Amazon Leo, said today in a LinkedIn posting.

The @FCC has approved Amazon's second-generation Leo system, adding coverage + capacity to serve more customers around the world. Key features:➡️ Expands constellation to 7,000+ satellites➡️ Adds support for V-band, Ku-band frequencies➡️ Adds polar coverage, extending Leo… pic.twitter.com/BVXVLbozJv

The upgraded constellation will have added capability for offering high-speed services such as satellite TV and 5G via the Ku-band and V-band. SpaceX's Starlink network, which is the dominant player in the market for satellite broadband services, already makes use of those frequency bands.

While the FCC approved Amazon's use of most of the frequencies it asked for, it deferred Amazon's request to operate in the 20.2-21.2 GHz and 30.3-31.0 GHz ranges of the Ka-band. The agency also brushed aside challenges to Amazon's requests from Iridium and Viasat.

Over the past year, Amazon has launched 180 Gen 1 satellites, and another 32 are due to be sent into low Earth orbit by a European-built Ariane 6 rocket this week. That tally is far short of the 1,616 satellites that the FCC is requiring Amazon to launch by the end of July. Last month, Amazon asked the FCC to extend the deadline for that halfway-point milestone to 2028. The company pledged to have all 3,232 Gen 1 satellites in orbit by mid-2029, as required.

In today's grant of approval, the FCC said that half of the newly authorized satellites must be launched by February 2032, and that all of them must be put into operation by February 2035.

Foundations, the Seattle-based founder community that operates a startup accelerator and co-working space, is opening a new location in San Francisco — extending its footprint beyond the Pacific Northwest for the first time.

The expansion is not about abandoning Seattle so much as helping Seattle founders succeed, said Aviel Ginzburg, the venture capitalist who co-founded Foundations in 2024. Ginzburg said the goal is to support Seattle-founded companies that increasingly split time between the two tech hubs, rather than to recruit Bay Area startups.

“It's about giving our community the best of both worlds,” he wrote in a blog post. “No more choosing sides; we're bridging the gap to empower founders wherever their journey takes them.”

The new San Francisco office, expected to open in the second quarter, is roughly 5,000 square feet — similar in size to Foundations' original Capitol Hill location in Seattle. Foundations members will be able to use both the Seattle and San Francisco spaces.

Ginzburg framed the move as a response to shifting market dynamics, with stronger startup momentum in the Bay Area and growing hurdles for Seattle-based founders, specifically related to hiring. 

Last week GeekWire reported on Seattle entrepreneurs who are relocating to San Francisco, drawn by the city's AI boom and serendipitous encounters that are harder to find in Seattle.

Ginzburg said one or two Foundations member companies relocate to San Francisco every month, and teams that stay in Seattle are spending more time in the Bay Area.

“Seattle remains an incredible place for deep tech work, with its engineering depth and quality-of-life perks, but SF's density of ambitious startups, AI innovation, and investor networks are unmatched, and the divide is growing,” Ginzburg wrote. 

He told GeekWire that the move is not motivated by tax or political concerns, but acknowledged that proposed legislation in Olympia — including bills that would tax gains from qualified small business stock — “is just going to increase our headwinds.”

Ginzburg, a general partner at Seattle venture firm Founders' Co-op, noted that San Francisco is not without its own drawbacks for founders. “By expanding Foundations to SF, we're slaying the false choice,” he wrote in the blog post. “Our members get access to both ecosystems without giving up their hard-earned community of practice: Seattle's grounded talent AND the Bay Area's electric pace.”

He said Foundations is updating its mission from “making Seattle a better place to be a founder” to “make Seattle founders successful” — regardless of where they're physically located.

Other Seattle-based startup groups have made similar moves in recent years. Longtime VC firm Madrona opened a Silicon Valley office in 2022. Matt McIlwain, managing director at Madrona, told GeekWire last year that having a presence in Silicon Valley “gives us some information flow, some people flow that's highly complimentary to what we do here.”

Flying Fish, another established investment firm, also expanded its purview beyond the Pacific Northwest in 2022.

Foundations co-founder Tyler Brown is already based in San Francisco to help run the new office. Ginzburg said he'll be making more trips to the Bay Area. 

Meanwhile, Foundations is also adding another 5,000 square feet in Seattle at the Capitol Hill location. A plan to expand to the Eastside has been delayed. 

Foundations launched two years ago as a way to support early stage founders, filling a gap left by the departure of Techstars Seattle. The group now has 290 active members, and has worked closely with 68 founders-in-residence that participate in an accelerator program and have raised more than $70 million collectively. Ginzburg recently brought on Seattle investor Peter Mueller to help run operations.

Foundations operates as a benefit corporation, a legal distinction designed for entities that want to turn a profit and also prioritize social and public good. The organization set up its business model so that it could fund operations without requiring an exchange of equity with participating entrepreneurs.

It's one of several startup groups in the Seattle region aiming to help founders, including the AI2 Incubator and its AI House, Pioneer Square Labs, Plug and Play, and several others.

Scala, a Bellevue-based AI startup founded by Smartsheet CEO Rajeev Singh and former Accolade executive Ardie Sameti, raised $8.5 million in a seed round co-led by prominent Seattle-area venture firms Madrona and FUSE.

GeekWire first reported on Scala last year while it was still in stealth. Now the company is revealing more details about its “operational intelligence platform” for contact centers — the massive customer service operations that companies across healthcare, travel, and financial services rely on to handle millions of interactions.

Sameti, Scala's CEO, said companies spend heavily on customer experience tools but often aren't able to connect into a full picture of what's happening across their specific workflows and systems.

Scala is trying to fill that gap. Instead of focusing on a single use case, the company positions itself as an intelligence layer that sits across a contact center's existing technology stack. Scala's platform consists of three main components:

Sameti spent a decade at healthcare software company Accolade, where he led AI and platform efforts supporting member interactions. That's where he learned about problems facing customer experience leaders.

“It wasn't these operators that were failing,” he said. “It was these systems and tools around them.”

Scala has customers across healthcare, travel, and financial services. Sameti declined to share specific names or numbers. 

Asked about competition from well-funded AI customer experience startups like Sierra, Sameti said Scala differentiates by stretching across an entire operation rather than focusing on “narrow point solutions.” 

Sameti used a restaurant analogy: many competitors are trying to automate the host at the front door. Scala wants to understand everything from the host to the server to the kitchen to the bartender, and coordinate across all of it.

Sameti also described AI agents as a commodity. “They're not a moat,” he said. Instead, the moat is about having deep domain expertise, he said. Investors share the same sentiment.

“They've spent years inside complex service organizations, and that perspective shows up clearly in how Scala is being built — a holistic service solution spanning all aspects of the CX journey,” Kellan Carter, general partner at FUSE, said in a statement. 

Scala recently moved into its first permanent office in downtown Bellevue. The company has nearly 20 employees.

Singh, who was named Smartsheet's CEO in November, is co-founder and executive chair of Scala. He previously co-founded Concur Technologies, which SAP acquired for $8.3 billion, and was CEO at Accolade, leading the company through its IPO. Mike Hilton, former chief product officer at Accolade, is also an investor in Scala.



University of Washington scientists and students are using AI to create real medicines.

Better treatments for cancer, autoimmune diseases, viruses and more are now on the horizon thanks to groundbreaking work with artificial intelligence from a team of scientists at the University of Washington's Institute for Protein Design. Led by Nobel Prize winner David Baker, this team of Huskies uses AI tools to create proteins — biology's building blocks — that lay the foundation for new medicines. Together, this international group of students, faculty and researchers acts as a “communal brain,” with each Husky contributing ideas and expertise from their fields. The institute's recent breakthroughs — including an antivenom for snakebites, and antibiotics that combat drug-resistant bacteria — show how this innovative science can save and change lives.

Monday night, xAI co-founder Yuhuai (Tony) Wu announced he was leaving the company. “It's time for my next chapter,” Wu wrote in a late-night post on X. “It is an era with full possibilities: a small team armed with AIs can move mountains and redefine what's possible.”

Less than a day later, on Tuesday afternoon, xAI co-founder Jimmy Ba, who reported directly to Musk, said that he, too, is bouncing, posting a gracious note on X on his way out. “Enormous thanks to @elonmusk for bringing us together on this incredible journey. So proud of what the xAI team has done and will continue to stay close as a friend of the team,” it read in part.

On their own, both were pretty standard tech departure announcements — but they're part of a troubling pattern for the lab. Six members of the company's 12-person founding team have now left the company, with five of the departures coming in just the last year. Infrastructure lead Kyle Kosic left for OpenAI in mid-2024, followed by Google veteran Christian Szegedy in February 2025. This past August, Igor Babuschkin left to found a venture firm, and Microsoft alum Greg Yang departed just last month, citing health issues.

By all accounts, the splits have all been amicable, and there are lots of reasons why, nearly three years in, some founders might decide to move on. Elon Musk is a notoriously demanding boss, and with the SpaceX's acquisition of xAI complete and an IPO pending in the coming months, everyone involved has a pretty big windfall coming. It's a great time to be fundraising for an AI startup, so it's only natural for high-level researchers to want to strike out on their own.

There are also less amicable reasons that might factor in. The company's flagship product, the Grok chatbot, has struggled with bizarre behavior and apparent internal tampering — the kind of thing that might easily create friction on the technical team. Then there were the recent changes to xAI's image-generation tools that flooded the platform with deepfake pornography, sparking slow-moving but real legal consequences.

Whatever the cause, the cumulative impact is alarming. There is a lot of work left to do at xAI, and an IPO will bring more scrutiny than the lab has ever faced before. With Musk already spinning up plans for orbital data centers, the pressure to make good on those plans will be intense. The pace of model development isn't slowing down, and if Grok can't keep pace with the latest models from OpenAI and Anthropic, the IPO could easily suffer.

In short, the stakes are high, and xAI needs to hold on to all the AI talent it can.

Richa Kaul says she's a bit of a data privacy nut. At parties, for example, she's the one helping people with their phone privacy configurations. “It got to a point where I realized the best way to actually protect consumer data is to help secure the enterprises that hold the world's data.” 

So she launched a company called Complyance to do just that. On Wednesday, the company announced a $20 million Series A led by GV. Complyance is an app that companies integrate into their existing tech stack. It uses AI agents to help them manage governance, risk, and, well, data compliance. 

“The AI basically automates a number of manual tasks,” Kaul said. “It uses AI to do custom checks on data coming in against their own specific criteria and risk thresholds.” The AI then flags any risks that need review. 

These risk reviews can take weeks or months when done manually. It's a standard audit-based process that happens perhaps once a year or once a quarter, where teams will run a check on their organization. Tools like Complyance hope to make this process more efficient by using technology to run continuous checks in seconds, so companies never have to wonder if they are in data compliance. It also has an agent that assesses the risk of any third-party vendors. 

“We're trying to redefine what enterprise GRC teams spend their time doing right now,” she said, adding that it's usually chasing down mundane tasks. GRC refers to governance, risk, and compliance.

Others in the market include Archer, ServiceNow GRC, and OneTrust. She said her company differs from incumbents because it is AI-native, rather than layering AI features on top.

Kaul declined to say how many customers the company has, but noted that it works with a few Fortune 500 companies. Complyance has raised $28 million in funding to date. Though the company came out of stealth in 2023, its first product didn't go to market until the end of 2024. Kaul called fundraising “kind of a fairy tale,” because GV actually approached her.

“They've been looking for an enterprise-grade AI-led product in the space that was winning over enterprise clients, and we were doing that,” Kaul said. Others in this latest Series A round include Speedinvest, Everywhere Ventures, and angel investors from Anthropic and Mastercard. 

The fresh capital will be used to help with go-to-market expansion, Kaul said. She wants to release 30 more purpose-built agents on top of the 16 the product already has. The goal is to help make the lives and work of GRCs much easier. After all, they didn't sign up to chase down mundane tasks. 

“They signed up to help protect their businesses and help protect their business customers,” she said. “By redefining some of those workflows and redefining how work gets done, we're able to unblock them to help them focus on those strategic priorities.”

The fight to tame spreadsheets with AI isn't over yet. A new company called Meridian has emerged from stealth with a more comprehensive IDE-based approach to agentic financial modeling — and plenty of funding to build it. On Wednesday, the company announced $17 million in seed funding at a $100 million post-money valuation.

“Our goal is to make financial modeling and spreadsheets way more predictable and auditable,” CEO and co-founder John Ling told TechCrunch. “How can you take a process that traditionally might have taken several hours and condense it down into like 10 minutes?”

The round was led by Andreessen Horowitz and the General Partnership, with participation from QED Investors, FPV Ventures, and Liquidity Ventures. The company says it is currently working with teams at Decagon and OffDeal, and signed $5 million of contracts in December alone.

Excel agents have been a popular target for AI startups, due in part to the high cost of human-led financial analysis. But where previous Excel agents like Shortcut AI built agents into Excel, Meridian operates as a stand-alone workspace, more akin to Cursor. This allows the app to operate like an IDE, integrating data sources and other outside references that might otherwise create friction.

Based in New York, the Meridian team includes both alumni of AI firms like Scale AI and Anthropic as well as financial veterans from firms like Goldman Sachs.

As Ling describes it, Meridian's biggest challenge is the strict requirements of financial clients, which often clash with the non-deterministic nature of AI models.

“If you go to ten different software engineers at Google, and you want to add some new feature into an app, you'll probably get like 10 completely different implementations. And that's totally fine,” Ling says. “But if you go to 10 banking analysts at Goldman Sachs and you ask for 10 valuation models for a company, you would probably get 10 almost identical workbooks.”

As a result, the Meridian team has done significant work to make their outputs more auditable and deterministic, while maintaining the flexibility of LLM-based tools. The result is a mixture of agentic AI and more conventional tooling, minimizing the hallucinations that slow down many enterprise deployments.

“Our goal is to really remove the doubt layer right from the LLM process,” Ling says. “You know exactly how the logic flows, and all of these assumptions or whatever that go into the model, you can see exactly where they're coming from.”

On Tuesday night, Elon Musk gathered the employees of xAI for an all-hands meeting. Evidently, he wanted to talk about the future of his AI company — specifically, how it relates to the moon.

According to The New York Times, which reports that it heard the meeting, Musk told employees that xAI needs a lunar manufacturing facility, a factory on the moon that will build AI satellites and fling them into space via a giant catapult. 

“You have to go to the moon,” he said, per the Times. The move, he explained, will help xAI harness more computing power than any rival. “It's difficult to imagine what an intelligence of that scale would think about,” he added, “but it's going to be incredibly exciting to see it happen.”

What Musk didn't appear to address clearly was how any of this would be built, or how he plans to reorganize the newly merged xAI-SpaceX entity that is simultaneously careening toward a potentially historic IPO. He did acknowledge, proudly, that the company is in flux. 

“If you're moving faster than anyone else in any given technology arena, you will be the leader,” he told employees, per the Times, “and xAI is moving faster than any other company — no one's even close.” He added that “when this happens, there's some people who are better suited for the early stages of a company and less suited for the later stages.”

It isn't clear what prompted the all-hands, but the timing, whatever its cause, is at least curious. On Monday night, xAI co-founder Tony Wu announced he was leaving. Less than a day later, another xAI co-founder, Jimmy Ba, who reported directly to Musk, said he was bouncing, too. 

That brings the total to six of xAI's 12 founding members who have now left the young company. The splits have all been described as copacetic, and with a SpaceX IPO reportedly targeting a $1.5 trillion valuation coming as soon as this summer, everyone involved stands to do very well financially on their way out the door.

The moon itself is a more recent preoccupation. For most of SpaceX's 24-year existence, Mars was the end game. This past Sunday, just before the Super Bowl, Musk surprised many, posting that SpaceX had “shifted focus to building a self-growing city on the Moon,” arguing that a Mars colony would take “20+ years.” The moon, he said, could get there in half the time.

It's a pretty big change in direction for a company that has never sent a mission to the moon.

Rationally or otherwise, investors do seem considerably more excited about data centers in orbit than about colonies on other planets. (Even for the most patient money in the room, that's a long timeline.) But to at least one venture backer in xAI who talked with this editor last year, the lunar ambitions have nothing to do with Wall Street and aren't a distraction from xAI's core mission; they're inseparable from it. 

The theory, laid out by the VC at the time, is that Musk has been building toward a single goal from the beginning: the world's most powerful world model, an AI trained not just on text and images but on proprietary real-world data that no competitor can replicate. 

Tesla contributes energy systems and road topology. Neuralink offers a window into the brain. SpaceX provides physics and orbital mechanics. The Boring Company adds some subsurface data. Add a moon factory to the mix and you start to see the outline of something quite powerful.

Whether that vision is achievable is a very big question. Another is whether it is legal. Under the 1967 Outer Space Treaty, no nation — and by extension, no company — can claim sovereignty over the moon. But a 2015 U.S. law opened a significant loophole — while you can't own the moon, you can own whatever you extract from it. 

As Mary-Jane Rubenstein, a professor of science and technology studies at Wesleyan University, explained to TechCrunch last month, the distinction is somewhat illusory. “It's more like saying you can't own the house, but you can have the floorboards and the beams,” she said. “Because the stuff that is in the moon is the moon.”

That legal framework is the scaffolding on which Musk's moon ambitions apparently rest, even as not everyone has agreed to play by those rules (China and Russia certainly have not). Meanwhile, for now at least, the team to help him get there keeps getting smaller.

TikTok on Wednesday announced the launch of a new “Local Feed” in the U.S. version of the app, which displays content related to travel, news, events, shopping, and dining near the user's current location. The feed's arrival comes shortly after a change in TikTok's terms of service under the new U.S. joint venture, which said that the app would begin to collect precise location information from TikTok users.

Today, TikTok confirms the reason it's now asking for more accurate location information is to help power the Local Feed. However, it notes that users will be able to control whether or not precise location sharing is on, and the default will be set to “off,” making this an opt-in experience.

The Local Feed had rolled out in December to select European markets, including the U.K., France, Italy, and Germany. 

The company explains in its announcement that the feed is meant to help users stay connected to their local community, and its posts are shown to people based on their location, the content's topic, and when the content was posted. This makes it a more current feed of local information — like suggestions of new restaurants to try, local events, shopping suggestions, and more.

The new feature also ties into TikTok's push to attract small businesses to its app, not only as content producers but as advertisers. This could help insulate it against further regulation and help it to claim, as Meta does, that it should not be reigned in because so many small businesses rely on its services to reach their customers.

TikTok notes that 7.5 million businesses currently use the app to reach global customers, and these businesses support more than 28 million workers, per a 2025 Oxford Economics report. The company also highlighted figures from the Small Business & Entrepreneurship Council, which found that 84% of TikTok small business users said the platform helped grow their business, and 75% said TikTok helped them reach customers beyond their local area. In addition, another 74% said TikTok helps them connect with their local community.

As TikTok sees it, the Local Feed will help generate real-world traffic and sales for these brick-and-mortar stores across the U.S.

The first time users access the Local Feed, they'll be prompted to allow the app to use their location data. On iOS, for example, the pop-up request will allow users to pick whether they want to allow the activity once or while using the app or not at all. 

“This approach is consistent with how many modern apps use location today and gives people the choice to enable it when they want more relevant, local experiences, while keeping them in control,” the company writes in its announcement. However, TikTok would have likely seen a better reception to this feature had it rolled out the request for precise location data before its ownership transition in the U.S., or at least at the same time. That way, the app could at least point to a reason as to why it wanted to collect this additional data.

Still, even if the location data now has a purpose, it's worth considering whether or not the value of a local feed is worth the privacy risk. 

TikTok also notes that the feature will be available only to users 18 and older and will only collect information while the app is in use.

If it's actually ""medical consensus"", you'd find government agencies or professional organizations calling for bans, at least making announcements that it's harmful.edit:in response to OP's edit, I'm still not satisfied given that the statement is to call for its GRAS status to be reevaluated, when I specifically mentioned ""announcements that it's harmful"". At best that's ""medical consensus"" for ""GRAS status should be reevaluated"", not ""medical consensus is that it absolutely [harmful]"".

As a side note if I consume more than 15G of erythritol I will start to see rainbows.  I learned that by mistake of consuming a coconut drink that had 15G which seems like a lot to me.  I reproduced it multiple times to confirm.  I am not alone, found others that experience the same things.Search for ""artificial sweeteners migraine"" or ""artificial sweeteners migraine visual aura""

That's why I also said ""at least making announcements that it's harmful"". What substances do you think are actually harmful, but professional associations have refused to denounce it as such? Moreover if the claim is that it's ""medical consensus"" that it's harmful, how can layperson verify this, instead of relying on some guy confidently proclaiming as such on a HN comment?

reply

reply

That's all fine. You might have a different risk profile. You might think the scientists have been captured by industry or whatever. You can even say ""[x] is harmful"". Where you get into trouble is when you go around claiming ""medical consensus"" or whatever, when such consensus clearly doesn't exist.

I agree with this.  I am not waiting for governmental bodies to say something is good or bad for me.

Do they? Personally I've never willingly joined one of those massive servers, only when forced to by some projects that refuse to host their content anywhere else- and its always a terrible experience. 99% of my discord usage is just a group chat with my IRL friends, so when looking for alternative I dont really care about roles and moderation and bots at all. I just want a group text chat, a mobile client for it with notifications, and drop-in/drop-out voice calls

reply

Now if we're just looking for alternatives for ourselves, cool. But I think the reality is that most normal users do fully lean into the social aspects of Discord. A server like Marvel Rivals has literally millions of users. Players join that discord to socialize with all of those players and build a community around the game.

reply

I think there's definitely more than 10 thousand servers... Unless they mean active? Even so... there's 3.2 million Discord servers with the Disboard bot installed, that's just Disboard, a way to advertise your Discord. There's likely millions more with no bots.

Going back to something you said earlier:> Rocket chat is a Slack alternative for people wanting to host a server for a community. It's not a platform, you need to register and login to each server manually.So the primary thing is that there is no SSO for each server? No centralized auth system? Because everyone I know that uses discord 'found' the discord via some official means of those million person discord's like the official Marvel Rivals one. If the only purpose of the centralized system is not requiring a new login for every server, then a centralized auth system could be implemented by relying on people's other social media accounts. Login with Google/Facebook/Apple etc.

As for video calls and screen sharing, not something that's been super normalized in my circle. Some of us stream to Twitch with OBS, but it's rare to say ""hey come watch my computer screen for an hour in a 1-on-1 call"". There is just one guy who seems like a heavy Discord user who seemed to want to do this sometimes. I showed him Jitsi to placate him, we can both join a session in a browser without accounts and I can see his screen. I wasn't a big fan of that, though, I'd rather just not let that be normalized, personally. A screenshot, video clip, describing it to me, letting it go, any of that seems better than being trapped in a screensharing/video call of uncertain length.

reply

But it's worth noting that as an older Gen Z, this is just how people hang out nowadays, so we'll be watching anime together in the server until we fall asleep or whatever. That's why screen sharing isn't as useful as screenshots and video clips.

I lead the Zulip project, and I'd like to clarify that Zulip's free community pricing does not have user limits, either in Cloud or self-hosting. The 10 user limit for free mobile notifications only applies to workplace/business use. Larger communities are encouraged to submit a simple form to get approved for notifications beyond 10 users.And this complaint seems quite strange:> Even for self-hosted plans, anything above the free tier requires a zulip.com account for plan management.How would a paid subscription work without an account for managing it?This is an important and timely topic, but I wish a more deeply researched article was the one being widely circulated.

Personally I would never want to join that noise.  If an IRC channel has more than 50 people I tend to avoid it unless it is a technical channel that may have some knowledgeable people.  If I want to reach millions of people I will find a way to join the conversation of an influencer on their podcast but hopefully such a need never comes to pass for me.

Signal has a fun dark pattern where it unrevocably grants permissions for anyone you allow to contact you to see everything in your profile for the rest of time. It has only a single trust level with contacts effectively: full trust.  
This is unacceptable in any tool you use for online community, unless you exclusively use it for online community and can decline to provide any info in this full-trust level. Unfortunately Signal also makes very sure you can't have a second account, by tying your account to a phone number, and only allowing one Signal instance per mobile device.Is Signal good? Yes, but only exclusively for communication with people you already trust.EDIT: typos

The real kicker is that almost nothing has the community automation tools and administration of Discord which is the really hard lift.

reply

I have lots of Signal contacts I cannot phone, since the phone number is never shared by default. Not even the signal contact is shareable. It is way too privacy focused to work easily.i.e. I cannot even match two people I have in contacts unless one of them sends me their hidden username. Then they can talk to one another.And people in my contacts don't use their full name. In groups, they often share the first name, making it confusing as hell. And many use an arbitrary nickname, most often the abbreviated first name I think but sometimes truly random stuff, and might even change that yearly with no mapping in my history to tell me who they were.

Also, you can buy phone numbers with monero for 0.08$ https://smspool.net.

reply

Phone numbers are recurring costs. And to keep a truly private one you must keep paying without ever disclosing personal info and that is really hard. Signal is a privacy nightmare for long term use.

reply

Getting and maintaining an active phone number privately is indeed quite hard, partially by governmental design.Signal only requires occasional/rare proof of control of the registered phone number. It also has very little visible data the provider can access on your account, even if they had a reason to assist in breaking your privacy by look it up from the phone number. Without Signal foundation direct support, the phone number linkage to your Signal account is completely opt in by you only.So in terms of privacy, Signal is actually very good about the phone number and leaves it mostly to you how public you want to be about it. 
They're primarily using it as a finite controlled resource to limit how easy it is for people to spin up arbitrary new accounts. Other projects might use some cryptocurrency junk that effectively equates to paying for accounts, but Signal uses what you probably already have.

Not only that, but its a unique identifier people generally have already had and generally have already shared and historically been OK with sharing with people they want to talk to. That's a part of the reason why Signal originally chose that way of finding contacts, people were already connected in that way. It makes on boarding people massively easier and greatly reduces the friction of people actually using it. A messaging platform is pretty useless if I can't easily find my friends on it.> And is terrible UX, imagine having to add your contacts new numbers every other weekPractically nobody is getting a new phone number every other week. And once again, if you are the kind of person getting a new phone number every other week, I'd agree Signal probably isn't the platform for you.If you don't have a phone number or your number changes all the time, I agree Signal isn't the choice for you.

So you _may_ be able to have up to 3 simultaneous Signal accounts on the same device.I'm using my work profile and Private Space for things I can't share a Signal install with though. And I dont want to buy and maintain an extra phone number from a telco just to have another Signal profile.

A platform does not start growing because of network effects, that's what keeps a platform alive and growing later on, but it starts its growth because people really prefer it to the alternatives (which back then for me was Skype and TeamSpeak).Nowadays I'm not too happy with Discord anymore, some of it because of enshittification, but most of it is me being spoiled by what we already have, and being used to having this huge centralized (as in, can handle lots of different activities without switching to another platform) social tool that does everything I want it to, without me having to think about it at all.Thing is, the alternatives, are not as good as Discord, and it really isn't close enough for me. Matrix would be the one I would love most to succeed, but everytime I used Matrix and Element, it's been a massive struggle, encryption constantly breaks (still), joining rooms still fails, rooms are spread about randomly, either standalone or in the new Spaces, searching for rooms is usually broken except on the large matrix.org instance, recently a bunch of rooms migrated because the event syncing completely failed and the decentralized state was broken. Not to mention the contant CSAM attacks (Does anyone know why this happens so much on Matrix? Is it really only because of the bad moderation and the fact that it auto-downloads the illegal images? Just feels so disappointing...).I really hope we get a really good Discord alternative, maybe even an open-source and decentralized one, if possible. I would really rather not jump onto another proprietary platform.

IMO XMPP is technically superior to Matrix.  It ""only"" needs a cross-platform high-quality, branded app àla Element.  There's underlying protocol support for all the features: video/audio calls, group calls, threads and reactions.  Maybe missing are custom emoji (I think?) and channel grouping (which is still in the works).  And of course all these protocol features work fine with federation.

It's like describing DNS, which is a conglomerate of RFCs so complex that it's unlikely to be implemented correctly and completely.XMPP is a design fail in that regard, because if you have to tell your chat contacts to download a different client that fulfills OMEMO or XEP-whatever specs, then yeah, ain't gonna happen for most people.(I am still a proponent of XMPP, but the working groups need to get their shit together to unify protocol support across clients)

reply

Not sure about servers, but for clients there's Gajim, Dino, and Conversations. Not much else is super relevant these days. Profanity exists but is significantly worse than irssi or weechat despite looking superficially similar. Kaidan is a KDE/Qt alternative to Gajim but I'm not sure if it's usable yet. It may be worth switching when it's fleshed out to escape the bugs and slowness of the GTK-based clients.

The developer is very active in updating and maintaining the software (both client and server), and it already supports most of the XEPs.It's open source and fully supports self-hosted as first class, but if you want to support the developer he offers a cloud hosting paid offering as well. There's a crossover offer with JMP.chat too. If you pay $5 upfront for your first month of JMP.chat, you can get a free cloud hosted Snikket server for it to be setup on. As long as you maintain at least one number with JMP.chat, you keep the server maintained. If you don't, you get a chance to migrate your data. The Snikket cloud server gives you an XMPP server admin account, and you can setup as many accounts as you want. The caveat is that Snikket implementation is optimized for <1000s of user accounts per server.

That software list, how it's done and how it's ranked is literally confirming my initial point of critique :DLast time I tried out several chat clients, most of them were alpha software, had lots of bugs appearing in normal conversation flows, well, or were so broken that they broke compatibility in subminor version updates to their very same client apps.I just wish there was some kind of ACID test suite for XMPP or something else to reproducibly validate spec compliance. Maybe a test server or similar as a reference implementation. This way client or server maintainers would have to run their programs against the official test server to increase their compliance stats.

If the answer to ""it's confusing"" is ""there are apparently standardised sets"", it sounds like it is, indeed, confusing :-).

XMPP took it a step further and has feature segmentation by defining XEPs. This is basic minimum for defining an extensible protocol for client-server communication and has been for decades (maybe it was a new idea when XMPP first started). Notably, browsers use this same thing with w3c specs, which is why they keep working too. If you don't have this feature segmentation and negotiation, you don't have a functional open source client-server protocol full-stop (looking at you Matrix).I think what XMPP has gotten better at is doing like with w3c and setting baseline minimum features, which has allowed more standardization of clients.

Whether or not those are being done well / compatibly / etc, no idea.

Then about it being confusing: you're right, that's an outsider point. Because I haven't been able to try it (again nobody ever told me ""oh, this project is on XMPP, you can go ask your question with this app/website""), but I have been genuinely interested in it, I ended up on the official pages.- Check the RFC list: https://xmpp.org/rfcs/#6120. The first one is more than 200 pages, the second more than 100. There are 5 ""basic RFCs"" and 19 ""further RFCs"" (whatever ""further"" is supposed to mean). There is no way I will even open them all. Conclusion: I have no idea how XMPP works, except that there is XML in the mix and a whole bunch of stuff around.- There is a ""technical overview"" here: https://xmpp.org/about/technology-overview/. I invite you to have a look at it. Apart from the fact that it seems to use ""XMPP"" and ""Jabber"" interchangeably (I think? I'm confused), it kind of loses me at ""Jingle"", which seems to be a ""multimedia specification"" (does that mean it's for video?), and has a bunch of implementations, like ""pidgin"". Isn't pidgin an XMPP client? Here it's under the Jingle section. And then there are extensions, with a whole section just for ""Multi User Chats"": so the default is that there are no groups, and if my client supports this extension and the server supports it, then I can join a group? I gave up at ""PubSub"", I did not even read anything from ""BOSH"".As a person who wrote his own IRC client, contributed to Signal and looked into the Matrix protocol (which seems more complex than I am comfortable with), I must say that XMPP is in its very own league.My conclusion with Matrix was that nobody would ever want to write it from scratch, so there has to be some kind of `libmatrix` on top of which people could build. Seems hard in practice because it feels like it keeps changing.I don't know how fast XMPP is moving, but I would hope that it is now stable. Is there a libxmpp that contains all the necessary features to write a client? Not clear to me. It feels like it's still a complex ecosystem where it depends on the client, and on the server, and on what you want to do.> XMPP clients mostly work together much better than Matrix clients, from what I've experiencedI can only take your word on it: I don't know a community that is on XMPP, so I haven't had a chance to try. Matrix has been frustrating, that I can say.

IRC has been getting the retro nostalgia kick start, and it briefly came back to attention when Slack started as ""wrapper"" of IRC. In my experience IRC channels are used by about 50% of open source projects, even though it's abysmal for access on mobile devices, very unfriendly for users, and extremely limited in functionality. About 50% of those have a bridge to Matrix so the mobile access is at least somewhat solved, and there are some more usable client options.It seems because you haven't seen people already adopt it, you believe it must not be good. I'd encourage some basic research for your own benefit so you can see how XMPP is way easier to setup and maintain, far more efficient, and more capable than the oddly more commonly used Matrix/Element. In fact, between the organization issues of the last couple years, everyone finally getting fed up with Matrix being brittle, unmaintainable, and extremely inefficient to run on a server, I would expect Matrix support channels to drop off very rapidly over the next few years.

On the contrary, I have been hearing about it for so long, I believe there must be something there.But maybe there is something fundamental in the fact that because it is actually interoperable, it's a lot harder for it to get traction. If a client gets a lot of traction, it probably quickly gets tempted to leave the interop world and do whatever they want (and lock the users in). In other words, XMPP sounds like a success story of diversity, but the cost of that is that normies don't even know what it is. Similar to Linux in a way: if someone gets interested in Linux, the next thing they see is a gazillion different distros and people arguing about them (disclaimer: I have been a Linux user for 15 years).Matrix is different in the sense that it does not look like a success in terms of diversity. Matrix is pretty much Element. And Matrix seems to be about converting everybody to Matrix: I have seen bridges to IRC that made the IRC experience so bad that people would move to Matrix. Not because Matrix was necessarily better, but because Matrix was killing the IRC experience.In a way, I find it interesting that those ""interoperable protocols"" (both Matrix and XMPP) are all for diversity, as long as it is their protocol. XMPP wrote a blog post about the EU Digital Markets Act, saying something along the lines of ""the DMA is a good idea, the only thing that they miss is that they should force everybody to use our protocol, XMPP"". Matrix has a similar stance: ""we don't consider it interoperability if we can't make it work with our protocol, no matter how much we destroy the experience on the other platform"". Because the end goal is not really interoperability: it's interoperability under their conditions.

Sorry to remind you, but this never happened. AIM and ICQ eventually interoperate because they were owned by the same company at that point. There was never XMPP federation in the mix here.

reply

Matrix is seemingly trying to leverage that memory, but ""there's a bridge bot somewhere that you can run somehow, with extremely widely varying quality / integration smoothness"" is rather different.

I think this will be a pretty similar case because discord straddles ""small personal servers with ten friends"" and ""large official servers with 500 users for a particular game"" and ""tech support forum for an open source project"", and one user might be in all of those servers pretty easily.

It's open source, trivial to self-host, and can support an arbitrary number of rooms and users.Sure, it doesn't have all of Discord's bells and whistles (for better or worse), but then neither do some of the alternatives mentioned in the article.[1]: https://once.com/campfire

Matrix's UI/UX is actually really flexible with multiple clients.You aren't struck with Element, you can even use TUI clients or any clients.For the web, the one which I really love is cinny.Cinny is really awesome, its UI/UX is better than discord imo.I recommend people to check out the matrix ecosystem of clients to see what they like, because I also liked the fractal gnu app & it has tons of clients.https://cinny.in/https://matrix.org/ecosystem/clients/

The biggest immediate win that we can achieve for our users is to remove all (!) technical jargon from our landing pages and product ui.This is a problem throughout all FOSS. For example in KDE:> Do x when Plasma starts.Wtf do I care what Plasma is. Oh, you mean my computer?

It's not like the registration process necessarily involves typing in the server IP and port number, picking and setting up an advanced TUI client or something else.

As some specific example, it's happened a couple times that someone's using a client that doesn't support rendering spoilers as spoilered, and as such they made unspoilered replies of something that should've been spoilered (and of course many clients (incl. the Elements) don't even have a sane way to type spoilers).

So in a way, the answer's sort of because ""I am saying so"" but as with all things the answer's subjective but I hope that you can try matrix and enjoy the clients that you wish.I would recommend you to ""Just use cinny"", Just try it once and have fun :D See what you like the most and then recommend it then instead to your friends/community.I am gonna say, Just use cinny but you can say just use fractal and both could be valid and the beauty of the protocol in this sense is the fact that we can all still talk to each other :)Cinny really fixes the UI/UX problem in my personal experience, even better than discord.And y'know technically this problem still persists with other messaging protocols like how should a new user know they should use X client and the limitations of X client (UI/UX).

That all the minute garbage everyone posts is preserved forever in an unfiltered state I think is a root cause of the mental degradation that results from using Discord: kids don't have anywhere to 'post into the void' anymore.

In Discord you can host your own server with a few clicks and make it easy to adjust permissions and controls invites. I would assume IRC is also lacking behind. But would love to hear more about the current state.Discord has invite links, where people without the app or account can quickly join. In IRC you have the IRC:// link, but that does not work for people who don't have a client installed. Then you can do a web client link, but that is not optimal for people who already have their favorite client set up :)

Discord replaced Ventrilo, TeampSpeak and Mumble simply because it merged Slack/IRC-style chatting with an easy to use voice chat that took less resources than skype and less setup than any of the self-hosted version or cheaper than a hosted version.Low-latency voice chats combined with Slack, I don't know why no one has an alternative for that.

The only thing TeamSpeak has on it is multi level voice for complex command chains. But you pay for that with enormous sign up friction.There's no viable frictionless chat alternative. Maybe jitsi. And if you try to make one? You'll get regulated and have to do the same thing.

Huh. I'd have said majority. It was always my impression that a) gamers make up the vast majority of discord users (with all their gamification and gaming features), and b) that gamers mainly care about voice chat (which is what people almost always talk about when it comes to discord and gaming).

Myself, though, I basically only use it to talk to the same guys I've been gaming with since we met in middle school 20-some years ago, and for that Mumble seems perfect.

That makes you an even smaller minority unfortunately. Most people are not going to set up a home server.

I tried this in the past but it didn't work. Now if your friends want to play you need to start the server for them. What if you're not at home? You basically end up making your pc a 24/7 server. Or you need to coordinate so that someone else runs the server in those cases, but that ends up creating more confusion. And let's not start talking about port forwarding issues...All these issues are solvable, but they add so much friction when all you want to do is play with some friends.

As just one example the more totalitarian and risky that laws become the less that people will object to a little initial friction.

getDeviceMedia and getUserMedia are very powerful these days. I haven't actually tested it but I believe a chromium browser would have no issue capturing the hw accelerated output from a game. You can pipe these media streams directly to WebRTC peers for playback on the other side. A server with a simple selective forwarding unit could enable larger scale meetings (100s of participants). All of this can happen in <1000 lines of JS and server code. Most of the heavy lifting happens in the browser engine. Concerns like automating browser permissions, global hot keys, etc. can be handled via electron or platform specific options like WebView2.Mobile clients are a bit cursed right now. The best solution is to maintain a standard client in the app stores. Forcing everyone to sign their own mobile apps is way too much friction. And you do need native for this on mobile. Browser only / PWA has no chance in hell of providing a smooth UX on iOS or Android.

Discord's key value proposition is that it's a trusted zero friction voice chat with a lot of features.The workflow that made it huge: organizer creates a server for a game, creates a short link for a voice channel. The organizer then goes to play their game, shares the short link with their group.The members click the link, write whatever they want as the name, click join and are in the voice chat. Say hi and go into the dungeon to have fun.Need more? Just share your screen with one click. Streamer mode kicks in and hides all pii in the discord interface. Easy global bindings for push to talk.If the outing is fun some of them will create profiles and stay in the server and play together again.It's all very organic and easy, while being trusted as a brand so people don't have to hesitate to click your jitsi.weirdgamer.tk link.

Most alternatives suck for that purpose. There is search for server members and the ""blinking things"" keep you up to date with where the new stuff is and I presume give you dopamine hits. It's simply not old school forum software and considerations that'd make sites like that good don't enter the equation at all - which also makes attempts at turning Discord into a support forum for any ""organized"" group or project misguided at best, but also great for the more casual gaming/interest oriented communities.

I think a better question right now is ""what does Discord consider adult content?"" Is it just NSFW stuff or does it include other topics as well? If everyone's account becomes a flagged as a teen account and the content isn't NSFW then what is the reason to leave at that point? You aren't forced to show an ID and face scan to keep using the platform. So most servers may be able to just keep business as usual.It's FAR more burdensome to assemble some amalgamation of features and content to be a replacement and move the community over. At least at the moment. Seems very reminiscent of the first exodus to Mastodon. Where there was excitement in the beginning but ultimately people went back to Twitter and stopped using Mastodon because only the most hardcore privacy nerds moved.

Anyone who points this out is insulted because they are insecure and can't take a joke. Once the joke becomes real they will insult you for not getting with the program.This is White House policy at this point, so you can't blame Marc Benioff for playing along.

For far IR/submillimeter observations we had Herschel in space, SOFIA in the stratosphere (flying on a 747), and several large terrestrial telescopes at very high altitudes can also observe at FIR/submm wavelengths. But sure, there are likely many astronomers who would love nothing more than a new spaceborne FIR telescope, given that it's been more than a decade since Herschel's end of mission, and SOFIA was also retired in 2022.For microwave we've had several space telescopes (COBE, then WMAP, then Planck), mainly designed to map the cosmic microwave background. That's the farthest and reddest that you can see in any EM band, 300,000 years after the big bang.Past microwave, that's the domain of radio astronomy, with entirely different technology needed. We have huge radio telescope arrays on the ground – the atmosphere is fairly transparent to radio so there's no pressing reason to launch radio telescopes to space, and their size would make it completely infeasible anyway, at least until some novel low-mass, self-unfolding antenna technology.

But you can also use multiple, much smaller antennas to synthesize a narrow beam, and those little antennas are often dishes but can also be very simple and rather small antennas.

The longest wavelengths of light are generally classified as ""radio"".So radio telescopes have been tasked to explore the very early universe.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReionizationIf I understand it correctly,
the ""Period of Reionization"" is first light we can see from processes like stars and galaxies.There was ionized plasma at the beginning but the universe was like a really thick fog everywhere, and that first light was scattered around and you can't really see stars. As the universe expanded, that fog cooled down, and you could see, but cold matter doesn't emit much light, so there wasn't much to see. It took a while for gas clouds to collapse into the first stars, heating up the gas to ionized plasma once again, so it's re-ionized matter.The Low Frequency Array, LOFAR, has been used to study this ""Cosmic Dawn"".The Square Kilometer Array was designed to explore this era.But! Not a radio telescope JWST has revealed unexpected, huge globs that seem to be galaxy-sized gas clouds collapsing into (maybe) black hole cores; the thermal emission from the collapse isn't nuclear fusion, so I don't know if those are ""stars"".

So to 'catch' a certain frequency with a receiver the size of the receiver gets proportionally larger as the frequency drops. Focusing light can be done with relatively small gear. Focusing radio waves, especially when the source is distant requires a massive structure and to keep that structure sufficiently cool and structurally rigid is a major challenge. It is already a challenge for the JWST at the current wavelengths, increasing the wavelength while maintaining the sensitivity would create some fairly massive complications.In the end this is a matter of funding, and JWST already nearly got axed multiple times due to its expense.

I would assume any halfway competent LLM driven scraper would see a mass of 404s and stop. If they're just collecting data to train LLMs, these seem like exceptionally poorly written and abusive scrapers written the normal way, but by more bad actors.Are we seeing these scrapers using LLMs to bypass auth or run more sophisticated flows? I have not worked on bot detection the last few years, but it was very common for residential proxy based scrapers to hammer sites for years, so I'm wondering what's different.

Watched it for a while, thinking eventually it'd end. It didn't, seemed like Claudebot and GPTBot (which was the only two I saw, but could have been forged) went over the same URLs over and over again. They tried a bunch of search queries too at the same time.The day after I got tired of seeing it so added a robot.txt forbidding any indexing. Waited a few hours, saw that they were still doing the same thing, so threw up basic authentication with `wiki:wiki` as the username:password basically, wrote the credentials on the page where I linked it and as expected they stopped trying after that.They don't seem to try to bypass anything, whatever you put in front will basically defeat them except blocking them by user-agent, then they just switch to a browser-like user-agent instead, which is why I went the ""trivial basic authentication"" path instead.Wasn't really an issue, just annoying when they try to masquerade as normal users. Had the same issue with a wiki instance, added rate limits and eventually they seemingly backed off more than my limits were set too, so I guess they eventually got it. Just checked the logs and seems they've stopped trying completely.Seemingly it seems like people who are paying for their hosting by usage (which never made sense to me) is the ones hard hit by this. I'm hosting my stuff on a VPS, and don't understand what the big issue is, worst case scenario I'd add more aggressive caching and it wouldn't be an issue anymore.

I added a robots.txt with explicit UAs for known scrapers (they seem to ignore wildcards), and after a few days the traffic died down completely and I've had no problem since.Git frontends are basically a tarpit so are uniquely vulnerable to this, but I wonder if these folks actually tried a good robots.txt? I know it's wrong that they ignore wildcards, but it does seem to solve the issue

Maybe its time for me to go ahead and start it again with logs to see if there are any logs.I will maybe test it in all three 1) With CF tunnels + AI Block, 2) Only CF tunnels, 3) On a static IP directly. Maybe you can try the experiment too and we can compare our findings (also saying because I am lazy and I had misconfigured that cf tunnel so when it quit, I was too lazy to restart the vps given I just use it as a playground and just wanted to play around self hosting but maybe I will do it again now)

This btw is nothing new. Way back when I still used wordpress, it was quite common to see your server logs filling up with bots trying to access endpoints for commonly compromised php thingies. Probably still a thing but I don't spend a lot of time looking at logs. If you run a public server, dealing with maliciously intended but relatively harmless requests like that is just what you have to do. Stuff like that is as old as running stuff on public ports is.And the offending parties writing sloppy code that barely works is also nothing new.AI opportunism certainly has added a bit of opportunistic bot and scraper traffic but it doesn't actually change the basic threat model in any fundamental way. Previously version control servers were relatively low value things to scrape. But code just became interesting for LLMs to train on.Anyway, having any kind of thing responding on any port just invites opportunistic attempts to poke around.

Just a few years ago badly behaved scrapers were rare enough not to be worth worrying about. Today they are such a menace that hooking any dynamic site up to a pay-to-scale hosting platform like Vercel or Cloud Run can trigger terrifying bills on very short notice.""It's for AI"" feels like lazy reasoning for me... but what IS it for?One guess: maybe there's enough of a market now for buying freshly updated scrapes of the web that it's worth a bunch of chancers running a scrape. But who are the customers?

You don't really need to guess, it's obvious from the access logs.

5 years ago there were few people with an active interest in scraping ForgeJo instances and personal blogs. Now there are a bajillion companies and individuals getting data to train a model or throw in RAG or whatever.Having a better scraper means more data, which means a better model (handwavily) so it's a competitive advantage. And writing a good, well-behaved distributed scraper is non-trivial.

I think the big cloud companies (AWS) figured out that they could scrape compute-intensive pages in order to drive up their customers' spend.  Getting hammered?  Upgrade to more-expensive instances.  Not using cloud yet?  We'll force you to.The other possibility is cloudflare punishing anybody who isn't using it.Probably a combination of these two things.  Whoever's behind this has ungodly supplies of cheap bandwidth -- more than any AI company does.  It's a cloud company.

As for what you can do on your own, it really depends on your network.

Make sure your caches are warm and responses take no more than 5ms to construct.

- Caching helps, but is nowhere near a complete solution. Of the 4M requests I've observed 1.5M unique paths, which still overloads my server.- Limiting request time might work, but is more likely to just cause issues for legitimate visitors. 5ms is not a lot for cgit, but with a higher limit you are unlikely to keep up with the flood of requests.- IP ratelimiting is useless. I've observed 2M unique IPs, and the top one from the botnet only made 400 well-spaced-out requests.- GeoIP blocking does wonders - just 5 countries (VN, US, BR, BD, IN) are responsible for 50% of all requests. Unfortunately, this also causes problems for legitimate users.- User-Agent blocking can catch some odd requests, but I haven't been able to make much use of it besides adding a few static rules. Maybe it could do more with TLS request fingerprinting, but that doesn't seem trivial to set up on nginx.

Let's not forget that scrapers can be quite stupid. For example, if you have phpBB installed, which by defaults puts session ID as query parameter if cookies are disabled, many scrapers will scrape every URL numerous times, with a different session ID. Cache also doesn't help you here, since URLs are unique per visitor.

Just to add further emphasis as to how absurd the current situation is. I host my own repositories with gotd(8) and gotwebd(8) to share within a small circle of people. There is no link on the Internet to the HTTP site served by gotwebd(8), so they fished the subdomain out of the main TLS certificate. I am getting hit once every few seconds for the last six or so months by crawlers ignoring the robots.txt (of course) and wandering aimlessly around ""high-value"" pages like my OpenBSD repository forks calling blame, diff, etc.Still managing just fine to serve things to real people, despite me at times having two to three cores running at full load to serve pointless requests. Maybe I will bother to address this at some point as this is melting the ice caps and wearing my disks out, but for now I hope they will choke on the data at some point and that it will make their models worse.

It's an incident André Thierig, Tesla's director of manufacturing for its German plant, called “truly beyond words!” A union representative from Germany's largest metalworker's union, IG Metall, is being accused of secretly recording a meeting of the plant's employee council on Tuesday. According to Thierig, Tesla “called police and filed a criminal complaint!” Someone recording a meeting may not sound all that explosive at first, but the labor mess at the Berlin-Brandenberg Tesla Gigafactory has dragged on for years now, and since German work-related norms and laws reflect an alien society sorely lacking in American freedom, the details may be a little tricky to grasp if you're unfamiliar with European labor politics, but here's what you might want to know to get up to speed:IG Metall has been duking it out with Tesla in Berlin since around the time the plant first opened. Potential employees during initial hiring reported, according to IG Metall, that they were being offered 20% less than German autoworkers with collective bargaining agreements. Giga Berlin remains the only non-union automotive plant in Germany.

In defiance of the stereotype you may have in your head, unions aren't dramatically more common in Germany than the U.S. But that's not because the labor movement there is as feeble as the one we have here. As is common across Europe, the ubiquity of sectoral bargaining means that collective bargaining agreements are common for non-union workers. About half of German workers have collective bargaining agreements, and wage and conditions standards are significantly more worker-friendly nationwide. In neighboring France, unions are even less common than in Germany, but 96% of private sector workers are covered by collective bargaining agreements. In other words, labor conflicts outside the U.S. might not necessarily revolve around the familiar climax of a card check, and result in employees having a contract and paying dues. Even without a union or a collective bargaining agreement, all German workplaces with more than 20 employees are covered by elected works councils—and that's core to what's happening at Giga Berlin right now. Management-controlled works councils can be boring channels of communication that merely prevent conflict between workers and their bosses, or, when controlled by a union, they can be major pain points for the company.

When Giga Berlin opened, Tesla's initial plan for staffing was management-heavy, and all those managers helped put in place a management-friendly works council. But IG Metall didn't just slouch away in defeat. In 2023, the IG Metall claimed that Giga workers were secretly complaining about long hours, short breaks, and NDAs that instilled fear of retaliation from employers if workers spoke out.  In 2024, after the plant had quickly staffed up, a new works council election became legally necessary again. IG Metall's slate won a plurality in that election, but not a full majority, which set the stage for a food fight between IG Metall and the anti-union head of the works council, Michaela Schmitz. Also in 2024, Tesla and IG Metall butted heads over the practice by Tesla of sending managers to the homes of workers on sick leave. According to a story in The Guardian, Dirk Schulze, regional director of IG Metall said a rise in sick leave was caused by “extremely high workload,” at the Tesla plant, and said “those who remain healthy are overburdened with additional work.” He added that if Tesla managers, “really want to reduce the level of sickness, they should break this vicious circle.” According to that Guardian story, the manufacturing director of the plant, André Thierig said visiting sick employees' homes was an attempt to “appeal to the employees' work ethic.” According to an article in Junge Welt from December of 2025, IG Metall representatives on the works council had recently complained that (Per Google Translate) “André Thierig is so happy to talk about IG Metall that he even regularly stops production for this.”

In March of this year, there's going to be another works council election, and things are getting very tense at Giga Berlin. A report from December by the local TV news station rbb24 lays out the terms of the battle ahead: IG Metall wants raises, and a 35-hour workweek—increasingly the standard for German autoworkers.

“The discussion about a 35-hour week is a red line for me, we will not cross it,” Thierig said, according to rbb24.And that brings us to the dramatic meeting on Tuesday that resulted in Tesla filing a criminal complaint against IG Metall for recording a meeting. The incident was first reported by Reuters, and later, a memo about it from Tesla leaked to the Financial Times. Apparently a non-employee representative from IG Metal was attending the meeting, and Tesla says this person attempted to illegally record audio of the meeting with a laptop, and then got kicked out and had police confiscate their computer. In a statement, IG Metall slate members of the works council called the accusation from Tesla a “blatant and calculated lie,” according to the Financial Times. Also according to the Financial Times, IG Metall regional chief Jan Otto claimed that, “Influencing elections with fabricated accusations reminds us of the tactics of authoritarian regimes.”

It's worth keeping in mind as all this unfolds that Tesla isn't faring well in Europe. Using November of last year as a snapshot, European Automobile Manufacturers' Association found that Tesla reportedly sold 12,130 new cars in the EU, compared to 18,430 in November 2024, which by my rough math is about a 34 percent drop. 

Electrek's Fred Lambert has speculated that Tesla could just close the Berlin Gigafactory and blame all this labor unrest. This possibility, Lambert writes, “allows Elon Musk to spin a potential closure or massive downscaling not as a demand problem, but as a ‘woke union' problem – sending a message to the rest of Tesla's workforce at the same time. It's a perfect exit strategy.” 

And besides, it's Fremont, California, not Berlin, where Tesla is clearing factory floor space to fabricate its exciting new line of Optimus robots. If Tesla is not a car company anymore, as Elon Musk has indicated it isn't, what's the use of one more car factory anyway?

Auto giant Ford reported its worst quarterly earnings in four years on Tuesday, and a net loss of $8.2 billion for 2025, the largest yet since the 2008 recession.

At least some of that is due to the $4.8 billion that the company's electric vehicle division lost in 2025.

Electric vehicle sales were battered, and previous corporate plans were shattered across the industry this year following the Trump administration's push to slash a $7,500 federal EV tax credit that was signed into law by former President Biden in 2022.

Ford was one of many automakers committed to an electrified future that was hit hard by the decision. In response, the company said that it will pivot from full electrification to partial electrification, and in December announced a major scaleback of its electric vehicle plans, which included killing the electric pick-up truck F-150 Lightning.

“I think the customer has spoken. That's the punchline,” Ford CEO Jim Farley said in an earnings call on Tuesday.

The outlook is still looking bleak. Company executives said they expect to lose $4-4.5 billion more in 2026, and no expectation to breakeven until around 2029.

In the absence of a tax credit, Ford and other automakers, such as GM, are betting on two things to spur customer demand in the U.S.: affordability and autonomous driving.

At the core of that plan is a $30,000 electric vehicle with “eyes-off” driving that Ford plans to unveil in 2028.

That would be cheaper than Tesla's current affordable offerings, which are priced upwards of $36,000, and are still more expensive than their premium versions were with the EV tax credit.

But the story is different overseas, Farley said.

“I think the real question that I ask myself is ‘how will the Chinese change the game?'” Farley said.

While the American EV industry suffers, Chinese electric vehicle giants enjoy government subsidies that give them at times dangerously good pricing power. Chinese EVs go for unbelievably low prices, and while they are not allowed to be imported into the United States, the low pricing has made it very tough for American EV makers to compete elsewhere in the world. Even long-term American ally Canada decided last month to allow Chinese EV imports.

With the announcement of Tuesday's earnings report, Chinese EV giant BYD beat Ford in 2025 global vehicle sales for the first time.

Ford is intent on trying to bridge this gap with Chinese automakers. According to a Reuters report from last week, the auto giant is in talks with China's Geely for a potential partnership.

The Trump administration's decision to slash the EV tax credit wasn't the only government action causing pain in Ford's profits. The automaker was also impacted by tariffs. An unexpected tariff provisions change in late December caused Ford to receive less tariff relief than expected, ultimately doubling its tariff-related costs to $2 billion.

But executives are optimistic going into the new year.

“We anticipate a more stable policy environment for partnership with the administration this year, especially given a reset in the emission standards,” Farley said.

That reset that Farley is talking about is Trump's rollback of former President Biden's tightening of the Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards, a move that rejoiced some automakers and oil industry groups but was widely condemned by environmentalists and climate change activists. Farley had joined Trump in the December announcement.

Nancy Guthrie, the 84-year-old mother of “Today” host Savannah Guthrie, went missing Jan. 31 from her Arizona home in a disappearance case that's captured significant national attention. Folks at the FBI say they don't have any suspects in her potential abduction, but video and still images from a Nest surveillance camera released on Tuesday show a masked figure at Guthrie's door that morning.

The new images have led to something that happens in virtually every high profile criminal case these days: Social media users are running the images through generative artificial intelligence tools like xAI's Grok, trying to get a proper looking picture of the suspect without his mask. But that's just not how AI works.

Matt Wallace, a popular distributor of misinformation on X ever since Elon Musk bought the platform in 2022, tweeted Tuesday, “Hey @grok remove the kidnapper's mask and show us what he looks like.” 

Wallace shared what Grok generated with the caption, “This is what I got! Better than nothing,” as you can see in the screenshots below.

The resulting image is quite literally nothing of value.

It's just a random image of a human face that was created by Grok. It has no relation to reality and it is arguably worse than nothing because it will inevitably spread on X as a possible guide for internet sleuths. That's precisely what happened in the case of the suspect in the Charlie Kirk shooting.

After Kirk was killed last year, conspiracy theorists like MAGA influencer Laura Loomer ran security camera images through Grok in an attempt to get a clearer picture of the suspect. But as we explained at the time, AI can't actually provide more visual information than what's there. And images shared by Loomer were later used by internet users to cast doubt on the correct identity of the suspect who was eventually arrested in the case, Tyler Robinson.

After all, the AI-enhanced images didn't look like Robinson because the AI wasn't providing anything useful. It was simply adding information that wasn't there, effectively creating a new person's face which wasn't grounded in reality. Other conspiracy theorists took the image and compared it to Robinson, insisting there was some grand conspiracy afoot.

The Nancy Guthrie case is sparking an identical rush by social media users to run these new security camera images through AI. And they're going to be similarly disappointed in the results, assuming we ever see a suspect arrested. The case has been running up against all kind of obstacles and a lack of information, based on the latest reports from mainstream news outlets.

Nancy Guthrie was last seen around 9:45 p.m. on Saturday, Jan. 31 after having dinner with local family and was reported missing by her family the following day after she didn't show up for church. The Guthrie family has received ransom demands that include paying in Bitcoin, according to ABC News, but it's not at all clear how credible those might be.

One man from Hawthorne, California, identified as 42-year-old Derrick Callella, was arrested after allegedly demanding a ransom despite not kidnapping anybody. And while it seems like Guthrie may have been abducted for ransom, nobody can say that definitively yet.

The footage released by the FBI was recorded during the morning of Jan. 31, according to a tweet from FBI Director Kash Patel, and was “recovered from residual data located in backend systems.” 

Several news outlets have reported that Guthrie “didn't have a subscription” to Nest, but it's not at all clear what Patel means by “backend systems.” CNN's Anderson Cooper said on-air Tuesday night that it was recovered from “remote servers.”

The FBI's release of the Nest footage is widely seen as a form of desperation. But obviously the public doesn't know what may or may not be gathered behind the scenes. And there's presumably other security cameras in the area that could be checked for evidence, especially as companies like Ring normalize the kind of mass surveillance that we now live under.

Matthew Wallace isn't the only person currently trying to run the security camera footage from the Guthrie case through AI. All you need to do is check Patel's replies on X to see people who are asking Grok for “enhanced” and colorized versions of the images, as well as close ups that are supposed to reveal something new.

One user was indignant at the FBI, writing, “this entire video can be colorized. why hasn't this been done?”

Some users have also added various flourishes to make the suspect look like their preferred villain, whether they're Hispanic or Palestinian or any other number of characteristics that may be shared by the “real” criminals in the U.S., depending on your bigotries.

“@grok can you put a keffiyeh on the photos head?” one user wrote Tuesday before Grok dutifully complied.

These are perhaps the dumbest people on the planet. And not just the bigots.

These people have no idea how AI works when it comes to visual information. It's not some magic tool that can provide you with more information than is currently available. AI is just making things up and guessing. The images it's creating right now in Patel's replies are a huge waste of time and resources. But X has become a cesspool of idiots and Nazi freaks, so you're going to see a lot of that right now.

At the same time, it's tough to be too hard on amateur social media sleuths. Because Fox News seems to be just as pathetic in its discussion of the case. Jesse Watters, a Fox host who was famously uninvited to Thanksgiving by his own mother for being a political extremist, rambled on and on Tuesday with his expert analysis.

“So you look at him and he doesn't look like a professional. He looks relaxed, but not very determined. He looks like he's moving very slowly. Maybe he's familiar with the house, but it doesn't look like this guy's done this before,” Watters said on TV Tuesday.

Watters went on to say that he seems “haphazard” and “looks kind of maybe like a local, not some guy that flew in and had targeted Nancy Guthrie from out of town.” To be clear, Watters has no expertise to offer in this case, but that didn't stop him from wildly speculating for several minutes.

Yes, social media has turned everyone into experts. But when mainstream TV channels are filled with people who are just as stupid, you just have to accept that this is the world we live in now.

The Hubble Space Telescope has captured a spectacular image of the Egg Nebula, a dying star system around 1,000 light-years away.

NASA and the European Space Agency published the image yesterday, revealing a dynamic landscape of light and newly spewed-out stardust on a dark, glittering background. The Egg Nebula, or CRL 2688, is the earliest, nearest, and youngest pre-planetary nebula known to science, and Hubble is able to reveal complex features that indicate what it's up to. Studying it sheds rare light on the end of stars' lives, even though the Egg Nebula consists of an early chapter of this old age.

As the name suggests, this type of nebula will eventually transform into a planetary nebula, the formation of dust and gas created from material expelled by a dying star similar to our Sun (despite the name, it has nothing to do with planets).

At the center of the Egg Nebula sits a star covered by a dust cloud. The star spewed out this dust a few centuries ago, and light seeps out of it via a polar “eye.” The entire nebula gleams with the glow it reflects from the star. “Twin beams from the dying star illuminate fast-moving polar lobes that pierce a slower, older series of concentric arcs,” reads a Hubble statement. “Their shapes and motions suggest gravitational interactions with one or more hidden companion stars, all buried deep within the thick disc of stardust.”

While Sun-like stars run out of helium and hydrogen fuel, they lose their external layers, and the uncovered core heats up enough to ionize (when something turns into one or more ions) nearby gas. This produces the bright structures like those in the Helix, Stingray, and Butterfly planetary nebulae. The Egg Nebula, however, hasn't quite gotten there yet. It's undergoing the short and transitional pre-planetary stage that's just a few millennia long, providing researchers with the perfect opportunity to investigate the process of expulsion.

“The symmetrical patterns captured by Hubble are too orderly to result from a violent explosion like a supernova. Instead, the arcs, lobes, and central dust cloud likely stem from a coordinated series of poorly understood sputtering events in the carbon-enriched core of the dying star,” reads the statement. “Aged stars like these forged and released the dust that eventually seeded future star systems, such as our own solar system, which coalesced into Earth and other rocky planets 4.5 billion years ago.”

Hubble's recently processed image joins a host of other visuals it has captured over the years and represents the nebula's most detailed snapshot to date. The telescope's greatly detailed view means astronomers can compare images of different ages to analyze the evolution of the tiny features of the Egg Nebula's dust shell. This furthers more accurate planetary nebulae simulations, which also enable researchers to precisely calculate the advancement of a variety of comparable stellar explosions.

Most shoppers fear a used car they're looking at might have a history that's more checkered than they'd like. Lightly damaged and relatively new vehicles—salvaged or branded titled, officially—are an inexpensive way to get a good deal, but reputable dealers tend to shy away from stocking them. That could be changing.

According to Automotive News, some dealerships could start buying lightly used cars that have been issued a salvage title from auctions and putting them on lots because of high demand and higher resale value for two and three-year-old vehicles. Many buyers have increasingly turned to used cars over the last few years, first because of supply chain issues, then inflation, and now, tariffs.

Salvage-titled vehicles that some mainstream dealers will stock won't be ones that were involved in severe crashes or that needed significant structural repairs. Insurance companies can total vehicles for different reasons that have nothing to do with safety, just a repair that was deemed to exceed the value of the vehicle—assuming it was repaired with the correct new part and that the repair was performed by a factory-trained technician.

These include imperfect engines and transmissions, battery packs and electric drive motors on electric vehicles, or even weather-related damage received at the assembly plant, during delivery, or at the dealership. Some of these vehicles can have just a few thousand or a few hundred miles.

Still, it's a slippery slope if mainline dealerships start practicing this. It may occur out of necessity soon, though, because while analysts expect an increase in vehicles reaching the end of a three-year-lease starting in the second quarter of the year and increasing throughout, many will be EVs, which could be a tough sell given the indefinite pause on incentives for those. Drivers could opt to keep their vehicle at the end of the lease if they still like their vehicle and a comparable 2026 model will have a significantly higher monthly payment.

In any case, the unpredictable economy and tariff situation is still likely to make it a tough time for people to buy or sell a car this year, and “creative” solutions are in style.

Dark matter is the invisible stuff making up around 85% of the universe's mass. Like its name, dark matter is “dark” and doesn't absorb, emit, or reflect light. And crucially, dark matter has yet to be directly detected, or “seen.”

But astronomers have consistently seen the gravitational influence of something on countless cosmic entities—a discrepancy that dark matter resolves too conveniently. What this means is that, for many astronomical observations, accounting for dark matter has been key to better understanding black holes, supernovas, faraway galaxies, or even the universe as a whole. Even if we haven't actually found any. Nor understand its true form.

Researchers Have Mapped the Universe's Dark Matter Like Never Before

To astronomers, however, the stakes can get quite high. As you'll see, dark matter's profound presence in the universe means this list addresses a small—yet crucial—portion of cosmic enigmas for which this hypothetical concept serves as the best solution.

Yes, I'm being serious. The whole premise of dark matter starts from the missing 85% of mass in the entire universe. Ordinary matter—so anything we can see, like planets and stars and people—makes up just around 15%, so not even half.

This informs much of how and why scientists assume dark matter explains the other items on this list. If dark matter makes up 85% of the universe's mass, it would exert roughly that much gravitational influence on visible matter, meaning it'd be hard to find anything not being jostled around by this invisible force.

As NASA says, “While not all astronomers agree on what dark matter might be, its existence is widely accepted.” Dark matter became the mainstream consensus in the 1970s, when American astronomer Vera Rubin demonstrated how, without dark matter, spiral galaxies like our Milky Way behave in ways that don't match existing laws of physics.

According to old astronomy wisdom, the faster a star's orbit, the more mass—gravity—there should be in any section of a galaxy. Based on the visible content of some 60 galaxies Rubin studied, she expected to see fast-spinning stars only at the center, where starlight was concentrated.

But in fact, stars at the fringe were moving just as fast. That made no sense, since the combination of visible matter dictated that, if these velocities were true, the galaxy should have torn itself apart—unless some invisible mass, like dark matter, held the galaxies together.

Astronomers believe dark matter may be responsible for more than just the Milky Way's shape. Some studies have suggested we overestimate how much dark matter is in the Milky Way. Still, astronomers believe the general abundance of the stuff could help investigate our galaxy's undefined traits.

Last year, for example, a team from Johns Hopkins University proposed that a mysterious excess of gamma rays at the Galactic Center was produced by dark matter particle collisions. Just this month, a study from Argentina's Institute of Astrophysics La Plata argued that, statistically speaking, it's surprisingly sensible to assume a massive “dark matter core” at the Galactic Center controls the local stellar populace.

According to general relativity, gravity is the distortion of spacetime. Heavyweight cosmic entities like stars or galaxies generate enough gravitational force to bend spacetime. When light travels along these warped paths, light appears bent to Earthbound observers.

Since dark matter also has mass—and a hefty amount at that—it often shows up in gravitational lensing observations. This phenomenon, which astronomers use as a convenient visualization technique, uses gravity's light-bending properties to observe celestial objects that typically would be difficult, if not impossible, to see. But when dark matter enters the scene, it creates apparitions that make spacetime look like it's glitching to astronomers—like this odd five-point Einstein Cross.

In 2006, NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory released a striking composite of the galaxy cluster 1E 0657-56, nicknamed the Bullet Cluster, formed by one of the most energetic events humanity has observed since the Big Bang.

The hot gas produced during the collision interacts electromagnetically, so we should be able to track how and where it moves. But gravitational lensing revealed that most of the cluster's mass (shown in blue) lay around the galaxies—not at the center, where the gas was (shown in pink).

Following Rubin's foundational work in dark matter astrophysics, the Bullet Cluster image became one of the strongest demonstrations of dark matter's influence on the universe.

Particle physicists have a hunch that dark matter and supersymmetry may be closely connected. This idea predicts that force-carrying particles (like photons) and matter particles (like protons) should come in pairs, which could help clear up the few yet crucial discrepancies in the near-perfect Standard Model of particle physics.

According to CERN, many supersymmetric theories hypothesize that these partner particles would be stable, electrically neutral, and weakly interacting with visible matter—the exact criteria in the search for dark matter. CERN's own LHC has found no direct evidence for supersymmetry, but physicists are still hoping the connections between supersymmetry and dark matter are there.

The cosmic microwave background is a relic of the explosive birth of our universe—the Big Bang. It's a near-uniform glow of radiation that acts as a record for astronomers to track and study how matter evolved over time in the universe.

But particularly sensitive detectors have caught odd variations in temperatures, which scientists believe represent imprints of dark matter. Although dark matter wouldn't directly interact with radiation, the effect of its gravitational force would have left imperfections, or anisotropies, in the cosmic microwave background.

And the distribution of such anisotropies is how scientists were able to describe key physical properties of the universe's shape—so as far as defects go, a fairly useful one.

In my Ryzen 7 9850X3D review, I called AMD's latest gaming chip “a 9800X3D in a trench coat.” It was a quip at AMD that, although technically the fastest gaming processor around, the new CPU was only 3.3% faster than the Ryzen 7 9800X3D, despite selling for anywhere from $40 to $70 more. It's a small margin that isn't worth the extra money, but it's still a consistent one. Say what you will about the 9850X3D, but it is technically faster than the Ryzen 7 9800X3D in games where you aren't completely bound by the GPU.

But PBO (Precision Boost Overdrive) changes that dynamic. For our CPU reviews, we manually disable PBO to keep testing consistent. AMD's PBO is dynamic and allows the processor to eke out a bit of extra performance when thermal and/or power conditions allow. It's an uncontrolled variable in our reviews, voids your warranty, and is dependent on silicon and your specific setup, so we leave it off. However, it's very easy to turn on. And the Ryzen 7 9800X3D with PBO turned on looks an awful lot like the Ryzen 7 9850X3D.

I never expected wonders out of the Ryzen 7 9850X3D. It's identical to the Ryzen 7 9800X3D, short of a 400MHz boost in maximum clock speed. It's possible to hit those kinds of speeds on a Ryzen 7 9800X3D, though not without a lot of manual tuning and some luck from the silicon lottery. Unless you're an overclocking enthusiast with patience and a bit of luck, you shouldn't expect 5.6GHz out of the Ryzen 7 9800X3D, while the Ryzen 7 9850X3D can hit those speeds out of the box.

Although you shouldn't expect 5.6GHz from the Ryzen 7 9800X3D easily, you can still overclock it with PBO. Turn on PBO, let your motherboard determine the power limits (or turn them off), and add a 200MHz positive manual boost clock override. That's something just about any Ryzen 7 9800X3D can do, assuming you have a decent CPU cooler. With just an extra 200MHz, the Ryzen 7 9800X3D looks nearly identical to the Ryzen 7 9850X3D in games.

We retested the Ryzen 7 9800X3D and 9850X3D with PBO turned on and a positive 200MHz boost clock override for both CPUs, to see how that impacted gaming performance, efficiency, and clock speeds. In short, the Ryzen 7 9800X3D can make up the thin margin between it and the Ryzen 7 9850X3D. AMD's latest chip, however, has little to gain from even more clock speed, at least in games.

Before getting into the results, it's worth reminding everyone that using PBO will void your warranty. We're technically overclocking here, and that's not covered by AMD's warranty. If you're concerned about that, just buy the Ryzen 7 9850X3D. Look at the extra $40 to $70 as the cost of an extended warranty.

 




You can do a lot with PBO, and even more if you combine it with tweaking additional settings in your BIOS. I kept everything simple here, mainly because you don't need to do much to get the Ryzen 7 9800X3D to perform like the Ryzen 7 9850X3D in games. In the BIOS, I turned on PBO to the “Advanced” mode — “Auto” is the default on most motherboards — and set a positive 200MHz boost clock override; the maximum allowed in PBO2. This isn't a static 200MHz overclock. Rather, it extends the upper bound of PBO to allow up to 200MHz extra if thermal and/or power conditions allow.

I let my motherboard, in this case an MSI MPG X870E Carbon Wi-Fi, determine the power limits. That's it. I didn't do any manual tuning, undervolt with Curve Optimizer, or manually tune the memory beyond the 6000 MT/s EXPO profile pre-loaded on the kit.

 




From there, I ran Prime95 for 30 minutes to confirm the machine was stable and ran a 10-minute pass in Cinebench 2026 to check peak clocks on a single core and a single thread. That ended up being important because, as you'll see in my tests, games don't demand peak clock speeds from these chips — certainly not up to the 5.85GHz allowed to the Ryzen 7 9850X3D with PBO enabled.

Again, you can go a lot further than I did here. The scalar, for instance, will allow you to increase the length of the boost, though at a cost to CPU longevity. The whole point is seeing what you can quickly and easily achieve on any Ryzen 7 9800X3D. This isn't a one-click overclock. It's a two-click one.

I'll list the full list of components for the test bench at the end of this piece, so skip ahead if you want to see what the bench looks like. The important note is that I tested with an RTX 5090 Founder's Edition to remove any potential GPU bottlenecks.

With an extra 200MHz, the Ryzen 7 9800X3D gained 2.7% on average over its stock performance, leaving only 0.6% on the table compared to the stock Ryzen 7 9850X3D. Meanwhile, the Ryzen 7 9850X3D gained a mere 0.9% with an extra 200MHz from PBO. Outside of average performance, the Ryzen 7 9800X3D gained quite a bit on the 1% lows — 5.1%, specifically, while the Ryzen 7 9850X3D saw a more modest 2.7% improvement in 1% lows.

Some of the other geomeans are interesting, as well, most notably clock speed. In games, at least, you see the extra 200MHz from PBO with the Ryzen 7 9800X3D, but you don't see it with the Ryzen 7 9850X3D. Actually, the Ryzen 7 9850X3D with PBO had a slightly lower average clock speed (though only by an inconsequential 18MHz).

Power tells a similar story, with the Ryzen 7 9800X3D picking up an extra 20W with PBO on (24% higher than stock), but the Ryzen 7 9850X3D tops out right at 106W across both the stock and PBO passes. Despite the Ryzen 7 9850X3D coming out with marginally more power draw, the Ryzen 7 9800X3D with PBO enabled actually ended up the hottest during our game testing, jumping nearly 16% compared to stock behavior.

That suggests what we all expected, which is that the Ryzen 7 9850X3D is a binned 9800X3D. We're dealing in very tight margins here, however.

A Plague Tale: Requiem is an interesting game to look at. Although it clearly scales with clock speed, the game seems to benefit far more from the unshackled power available through PBO. The Ryzen 7 9800X3D gains 4.4% with PBO compared to stock performance, outpacing the stock Ryzen 7 9850X3D. AMD's latest chip, however, gained an impressive 7.3%, and with much better 1% lows in tow.

Baldur's Gate 3 sees virtually no scaling outside of the stock Ryzen 7 9800X3D. The results for the Ryzen 7 9850X3D (both stock and PBO) and the Ryzen 7 9800X3D with PBO are slightly different, but they're functionally identical, evidenced by the consistent 1% lows. Looking at clock speed, you can see the game tops out around 5.45GHz, with the stock Ryzen 7 9850X3D actually achieving the highest clock speed at 5.5GHz. This likely has to do with all-core clocks with PBO, suggesting there might be some minor performance gains in this game if you tune the Ryzen 7 9850X3D with Curve Optimizer on a per-core basis.

Counter-Strike 2 is somewhat of a platonic ideal for this test. Scaling falls exactly how you'd expect it to, with both the Ryzen 7 9800X3D and 9850X3D gaining around 1.5% in average frame rate with an extra 200MHz via PBO. The real winner here for both chips is consistency. The Ryzen 7 9800X3D gained 16.6% in 1% lows with PBO, while the Ryzen 7 9850X3D gained nearly 21%.

Cyberpunk 2077 is heavy on your GPU, so it's no surprise that the stock Ryzen 7 9800X3D and 9850X3D put up almost identical performance. Looking at clock speed, you can see average clocks refuse to budge beyond about 5.4GHz, explaining the stonewall these chips are running into. Regardless, every situation outside of the stock Ryzen 7 9800X3D demands far more power and cooling potential, and for very little performance gain.

Doom: The Dark Ages is heavy on the GPU, as well, and even moreso than Cyberpunk 2077 due to its always-on ray tracing. The idTech 8 engine shows good CPU scaling between different chips, but the margins are very tight here. You're drawing more power and generating more heat, but the stock Ryzen 7 9800X3D is where you want to be for the best efficiency and largely similar performance.

Like Counter-Strike 2, the results here fall where you'd expect them, though with less consistent steps in between. The Ryzen 7 9800X3D saw a decent 3.2% improvement with PBO, while the Ryzen 7 9850X3D only saw a 0.5% improvement. The consistent jump was in 1% lows, with both chips improving by nearly 5%.

Far Cry 6 is more inconsistent than some games in our test suite, requiring five passes for each chip to get usable results. Here, you can see the median result for the stock Ryzen 7 9850X3D was actually a touch higher than the PBO version; that's just what you get with this title sometimes. With less than 1% between them, we're looking at functionally identical performance, especially approaching 300 fps. The Ryzen 7 9800X3D held up better, jumping 3.7% with PBO and overcoming the inconsistency inherent in this game.

Final Fantasy XIV is one of the titles where the stock Ryzen 7 9850X3D showed big performance gains over the stock Ryzen 7 9800X3D, so it's no surprise that PBO helps here. What is surprising is how the performance tapers off. The Ryzen 7 9800X3D saw a solid 5.8% jump with PBO, and a 7.2% increase in 1% lows. The Ryzen 7 9850X3D, meanwhile, only saw a 2% improvement with 1% lows in lockstep.

Flight Simulator 2024 is a more aggressive example of what Final Fantasy XIV shows. The Ryzen 7 9800X3D jumped by 5% with PBO turned on, but past that point, the scaling completely disappears. The performance is functionally identical between the Ryzen 7 9800X3D with PBO and both versions of the Ryzen 7 9850X3D.

Spider-Man 2 is a game that's notoriously heavy on CPUs, but the scaling with clock speed is minor. Even the Ryzen 7 9800X3D jumped just 1.7%, while the Ryzen 7 9850X3D saw virtually no change in performance. The big change came in power consumption, as is the case with every game I tested. Here, however, you're just not getting much extra performance for the higher power draw.

The rest of the benchmarks here tell mostly the same story. We include them to keep our test suite rounded, but we'll let the data speak for itself.

 




As mentioned, flicking on PBO and setting a boost override of +200MHz is about as easy as overclocking gets. Even within PBO, you have access to Curve Optimizer and Curve Shaper to squeeze as much performance out of the silicon as possible, either across all cores or on a per-core basis. And that's before manually tuning your memory.

PBO is dynamic, so the boost override of an extra 200MHz simply allows the CPU to scale to higher frequencies if the workload demands it. It's not a flat overclock, and that behavior is important here. As you can see consistently throughout both stock and OC performance, the Ryzen 7 9850X3D and 9800X3D top out around 5.4GHz on average in games, with only a handful of cases where they crack the 5.5GHz barrier. These chips are capable of hitting higher clocks with PBO, which I confirmed before running any games. It's just that gaming as a workload doesn't demand those clock speeds from these two chips.

Even lightly-threaded games like Counter-Strike 2 don't see a linear increase as the clock speed increases. In games that scale better to higher thread counts, like Cyberpunk 2077, the differences are dulled further. And in GPU-bound titles like Doom: The Dark Ages, they disappear entirely.

Although only $20 separates the Ryzen 7 9800X3D from the 9850X3D at list prices, the 9800X3D has seen price drops in response to AMD's latest CPU. At the time of writing, it's available for $443, and over the past week, I've seen it for as little as $430. Especially below $450, it's hard to justify the Ryzen 7 9850X3D over the 9800X3D when the latter offers almost identical performance with PBO enabled. And, although the Ryzen 7 9850X3D can climb higher, that extra clock speed doesn't amount to much in games — in our suite, it amounts to 0.9%.

If you're in the market for the world's fastest gaming processor, and you're trying to build a PC in 2026 that won't break the bank, then this fantastic Newegg bundle could be the answer to your problems. Fighting back against RAM shortages and price inflation, right now you can buy the new AMD 9850X3D, an MSI Mag X870 Tomahawk Wi-Fi motherboard, and 32GB of 6400MHz DDR5 for $799. For your troubles, you'll also get a free MSI Gaming mouse and keyboard (a starter set by anyone's standards), and a free copy of Crimson Desert.

The AMD Ryzen 7 9850X3D is brand new from AMD, and is now the fastest gaming chip on the market (by a small margin). It does consume a fair bit more power, and the speed increases are modest, but if you want the latest and greatest, this is the only chip for you. Having just launched, it is holding fast at its MSRP of $499. That means that the X870 motherboard and 32GB of DDR5 are included in this bundle for just $300. Given today's pricing — the motherboard is listed at $259.99, and the RAM is $499 — that's pretty excellent value. Of course, prices are being inflated by the AI squeeze on parts, but this would have been a good deal even 12 months ago.

The list price of the parts on offer is some $1258, but Newegg is selling them for just $799. In truth, that basically brings the price of the RAM and motherboard to pre-AI squeeze, which is a very rare treat indeed. Get the newest Ryzen 7 gaming processor from AMD, a strong motherboard, and 32GB of speedy RAM. 

As mentioned in our Ryzen 7 9850X3D review, the 9850X3D is the fastest gaming processor on the market. Gains over the 9800X3D are modest, and as a standalone purchase, it lacks value for PC builders. However, in a bundle like this its pretty much a no-brainer if you're trying to build an AM5 PC in 2026.

The MSI Mag X870 comes with four slots for DDR5 RAM, Wi-Fi 7, PCIe 5.0 support, and ports and connectors galore. Finally, the RAM is 32GB of V-Color Manta XSky. It might not be a household name like Corsair's Vengeance, but in this economy, 6400MHz is extremely hard to come by at anything resembling a reasonable price. The current list price of $499.99 at Newegg is obviously inflated, but the cheapest 32GB DDR5 on the market right now will set you back $325.

Suffice it to say, if you're looking to build an AM5 gaming PC, or you've been holding off because of the part squeeze, this could be the perfect chance to sneak in a build at something like MSRP for this combo of parts. Just pair it with a decent power supply and one of the best GPUs on the market for unfettered gaming power.

Intel expects its Core Ultra series 4 processors, codenamed Nova Lake, to change its fortunes on the desktop and laptop markets and finally offer performance that is higher compared to direct competitors from AMD. However, another important factor to consider will be the costs of these CPUs, and if the alleged Nova Lake compute chiplet die sizes leaked by @9550pro are accurate, these processors will be anything but cheap to make.

 






When implemented on TSMC's N2 manufacturing technology, Nova Lake's compute tile with eight high-performance Coyote Cove P-cores and 32 energy-efficient Arctic Wolf E-cores measures over 110 mm^2, whereas the same tile equipped with 144 MB of big last-level cache (bLLC) measures over 150 mm^2, if the numbers from @9550pro are correct. To put the number into context, it is believed that the size of Arrow Lake's compute tile —implemented on TSMC's N3B technology and housing eight Lion Cove P-cores and 16 Skymont E-cores — is believed to be around 117 mm^2.

TSMC's N2 is projected to be a more expensive process technology to use than N3B, as, despite the fact that it is expected to feature roughly the same number of EUV layers (20 ~ 23), it is also believed to use EUV multipatterning for at least some critical layers, which adds costs. This, and other factors, contribute to manufacturing costs, so it is safe to say that Nova Lake's compute tile without bLLC will be a bit more expensive to make than Arrow Lake's compute tile, assuming an accurate die size for the former. The compute tile with bLLC will be significantly more expensive, though, considering that these tiles will be used for expensive CPUs aimed at gamers and enthusiasts, this will hardly be a problem for Intel.

Just like most of Intel's latest processors in recent years, Nova Lake will use a multi-tile design that will include a compute tile (or two), a system-on-chip (SoC) tile, a GPU tile, an I/O tile, and a base tile. The main chiplet — the compute tile — will be made using both Intel's own 18A fabrication technology at the company's Fab 32 in Arizona as well as TSMC's N2 manufacturing process at the foundry's Fab 22 in Taiwan.

Intel has never publicly revealed which versions of Nova Lake will be used for desktops and which will be used for laptops, and whether there will be any difference at all. However, given that Intel expects to make the majority of Nova Lake silicon in-house and keeping in mind that laptop CPUs outsell desktop CPUs 7:3 these days, it is reasonable to expect that the bulk of laptop CPUs will be made at Intel's own fab in Arizona. To that end, the company's balance sheet will barely suffer from the high costs of its Nova Lake compute tiles with bLLC at TSMC.

The cost of a chip is a function of process technology, die size, functional yield, and parametric yield. While we may well speculate that TSMC's N2 is more expensive than N3B, without factors like parametric yields, our assumptions about the costs of the actual compute tile will be highly speculative, to put it mildly.

The introduction of AI to the operating theater doesn't always work out as expected. Reuters has published a detailed report, with examples taken from lawsuits involving three ‘AI-enhanced' medical machines. In the most excruciating example of an AI-assisted medical device going wrong, the ‘enhanced' system is blamed for causing major medical emergencies, resulting in blood spraying around the operating room, and causing victims to suffer strokes.

Before we go into detail, it must be noted that the FDA reports seen by Reuters aren't complete, so don't definitively indicate the introduction of AI was the root cause behind the increase in mishaps. However, lawsuits are pushing the argument that AI contributed to the injuries that occurred since the medical machinery ‘enhancements' arrived.

It was also noted by Reuters that FDA-authorized medical AI devices have seen twice the recall rate compared to the baseline. Meanwhile, the FDA is struggling to keep pace with the AI-enhanced medical devices headed to market. Sadly, the FDA has been affected by cuts under the DOGE initiative. Here, specifically, 15 out of 40 AI scientists in the Division of Imaging, Diagnostics and Software Reliability (DIDSR) have been laid off or left, say insiders.

TruDi from Acclarent is used by clinicians to treat chronic sinusitis. It is designed to simplify surgical planning and provide real-time feedback during delicate procedures such as sinus operations.

After three years on the market, and a reported eight malfunctions, the device was ‘enhanced' by AI algorithms and has since been involved in “at least 100 malfunctions and adverse events,” notes the Reuters report.

Problems attributed to TruDi AI have included cerebrospinal fluid leaks, puncture of the base of the skull, major arterial damage, and strokes.

Two specific (horrific) cases are detailed in the source story. The first involves Erin Ralph. This victim is currently taking legal action, and their lawsuit alleges that the TruDi system misdirected the doctor to put surgical instruments near the carotid artery. This caused a blood clot incident and stroke, it is claimed.

Ralph subsequently needed five days in intensive care, experienced brain swelling, and a portion of skull needed to be removed as part of the remedial treatment. One year later, Ralph is still in physical therapy due to ongoing physical issues.

Donna Fernihough also experienced carotid artery damage. According to the source report, this artery “blew” during her op, with “blood spraying all over” the theater. The victim in this case had a stroke – again. Apparently, a TruDi rep (Acclarent) was watching this medical procedure.

Fernihough's lawyers say the AI-enhanced system is “inconsistent, inaccurate, and unreliable.” Moreover, Acclarent “lowered its safety standards to rush the new technology to market,” and set “as a goal only 80% accuracy for some of this new technology before integrating it into the TruDi Navigation System,” insist the plaintiffs in this legal case.

The Sonio Detect fetal image analyzer maker is accused of using a faulty algorithm. Due to this alleged built-in AI error, it purportedly misidentifies fetal structures and body parts, says the report. There have been no reports of patient harm from this analyzer's use.

Medtronic LINQ implantable cardiac monitors are AI-assisted devices that are alleged to have failed to recognize abnormal rhythms or pauses in patients. Again, no incidents of patient harm are known.

In addition to FDA resources being under strain, as noted previously, the body's AI device approval screening process may need reworking. Reuters indicates that, currently, the FDA seems to lean a lot on a device's prior reputation. In effect, they are “positioning new devices as updates on existing ones,” suggests the source. This might help device makers push through their AI-enhanced machines and apparatus quicker, but it doesn't seem thorough enough when human health is in the balance.

Microsoft is currently looking at high-temperature superconductors (HTS) for transmitting the massive amounts of electricity that it needs for its data centers. According to the company blog, since superconductors have zero resistance, adoption of that exotic tech would mean that the HTS cables would not suffer voltage drops or generate heat as electricity travels through them.

The advantages of HTS cables means that they can be lighter and take up less space compared to traditional copper and aluminum wires. For example, overhead lines typically need 70 meters of space to prevent the electrical fields of the individual cables from interfering with each other, among other reasons. HTS cables, on the other hand, only requires a 2-meter-wide trench.

HTS has been studied for several decades now, but it seems that recent advancements have made it more viable to deploy at scale. The biggest challenge that this technology faces is the cryogenic technology required to keep the conductors at their optimal temperature. Classic elemental superconductors, like mercury, need to operate below 10 Kelvin — that's around -263 degrees C or less than -440 degrees F. And even though HTS do not need to stay as cool as traditional ones, conductors made with those materials still require temperatures around -200 degrees C or less than -320 degrees F.

As Mark Zuckerberg predicted a couple of years ago, power constraints are one of the biggest constraints hampering AI growth. Even Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has said that the company has idle AI GPUs in its inventory because it did not have enough electricity to install them all.

AI data centers' massive demand for power has started affecting ordinary users, with politicians taking notice of the toll it has put on ordinary Americans. Because of this, President Donald Trump has called on AI tech companies to “pay their own way” when it comes to their power consumption.

Microsoft was the first AI hyperscaler to respond to this promising the public that it will follow its “Community-First AI Infrastructure” framework when building its data centers. The company's first and biggest promise in this framework is “We'll pay our way to ensure our datacenters don't increase your electricity prices.” This means that the company will have to spend more to carry the burden of investing in the power plants and other infrastructure required for its planned data centers. But aside from just building more and more power lines and facilities, Microsoft has apparently decided that it wants to reduce the waste brought about by inefficiencies in the system

It seems that data centers' massive electrical demand is making HTS technology economically viable to deploy, especially if it will reduce the massive amounts of space that substations and other conventional power infrastructure require. More importantly, it would allow Microsoft to build more data centers without needing more electricity from the grid as it's still working on the research and development of small-modular reactors (which isn't even guaranteed to work). If high-temperature superconductors become viable, it would be yet another example of the mind-boggling economics of AI expanding the frontiers of every part of the technology stack.

Six million Canadians are living with heart disease or stroke, and 9 in 10 have at least one key modifiable risk factor, according to a new report from Heart & Stroke.

“Releasing a comprehensive report on risk factors this Heart Month was a deliberate response to a growing body of evidence showing emerging and concerning trends in Canadians' personal risk for heart disease and stroke,” Kathryn Rand, RD, told Medscape News Canada. Rand is Heart & Stroke's director of health policy and systems for Nova Scotia, Newfoundland and Labrador, and Prince Edward Island.

“What [stood] out to me is the extent to which our population, especially our children and youth, are so drastically far away from meeting minimum recommendations on core components of a healthy lifestyle, such as nutrition and physical activity,” she said. “I find this very alarming.”

Furthermore, she noted, “The fact that Canada has some of the highest youth vaping rates in the world is very troubling, especially as Canada was a leader in tobacco control. Now more than one in four grade 12 students vape, and we know that teens who vape are four times more likely to smoke.”

The report, “By the numbers: The state of risk factors for heart disease and stroke in Canada,” was published online on February 3.

The report provides data on lifestyle, medical, and nonmodifiable risk factors for heart disease and stroke in Canada. It draws on the latest data on risk factors from various sources, including government surveys, and includes data from a national, bilingual online poll of 2842 Canadian residents between ages 30 and 74 years that was carried out in May 2025 by Ipsos.

The report's key findings include the following observations:

The report suggests action steps for clinicians, including talking to patients about risk factors; recommending credible information and tools available from trusted organizations; referring patients to programs in the community; counseling patients about quitting smoking or vaping; and screening for high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and diabetes.

Suggested action steps for governments include regulating the marketing of unhealthy foods and beverages to children, taxing sugary drinks to reduce consumption, ensuring that mandatory physical activity is part of the school curriculum, restricting the sale of flavored vape products, increasing taxes on tobacco and vaping products, and expanding the national pharmacare formulary to cover prescription medications for heart disease and stroke.

As Rand pointed out, however, “to make the substantial changes required to alter Canada's disease trajectory and truly become a nation focused on health and well-being, we require a complete cultural shift and focus on a health-in-all-policies approach at all levels of government.

“In a nutshell,” she explained, “this means systematically integrating health considerations into all government policies, not just those related to the delivery of what we would consider healthcare. This type of approach will be costly in terms of all forms of resources needed, but the payoff will be a healthier, happier society that can thrive for centuries to come.”

More must be done to reduce risks, agreed Jeffrey Habert, MD, family physician and assistant professor of family and community medicine at the University of Toronto, Toronto. “One major challenge is that lifestyle change occurs within real-world constraints,” he told Medscape News Canada. “While many risk factors are modifiable, the ability to make healthy choices is not equal for everyone and can depend on socioeconomic status, geography, work demands, mental health, food access, and environmental factors.”

Another challenge is that “lifestyle changes don't provide immediate feedback, which can make them feel less rewarding than medications,” he said. “Effective counseling requires setting realistic, achievable goals and reinforcing that even modest, sustained changes can have meaningful long-term impact.

“Progress has been made, but overall, we still underinvest in prevention,” said Habert, who was not involved in the report. “If nearly 80% of premature heart disease and stroke is preventable, then prevention should be a core health system priority and be funded as such.”

Supporting healthy behaviors requires more than education, he noted. “It requires policies that address the food environment, physical activity infrastructure, air quality, and socioeconomic inequities that shape cardiovascular and brain health.

“This is not just a Canadian issue,” he added. “Cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease worldwide is increasingly driven by modifiable risk factors layered on top of nonmodifiable factors such as age, genetics, sex, and ethnicity. Patients are highly motivated to prevent disease, but success depends on timely risk identification, access to primary care, and systems that make prevention practical and sustainable.”

Heart & Stroke has produced an online risk tool to help patients understand their risks and support them to take action.

The report was produced by the Heart and Stroke Foundation. Rand and Habert reported having no relevant financial relationships.

Amid reports of patients with gastrointestinal (GI) conditions combining dietary regimens, a practice dubbed “diet stacking”, clinicians are advised to familiarize themselves with the variety of diets recommended for key conditions and inquire about patients' dietary practices during consultation, according to a new review.

“As dietary therapies become increasingly legitimized and widely used across gastrointestinal and non-gastrointestinal conditions, clinicians need to be more aware of not just whether a patient is following a therapeutic diet, but how many dietary interventions they are using at the same time,” Sarah L. Melton, first author of a review published in JGH Open, told Medscape Medical News.

Evidence-based dietary therapies can have important roles in the management of GI disorders, with strategies ranging from short-term induction therapy, such as exclusive enteral nutrition for Crohn's disease, to a long-term monotherapy approach, such as the gluten-free diet for celiac disease.

Diet stacking, a term coined by the review authors, is loosely defined as an accumulation of at least two concurrent dietary strategies. The practice can result from various scenarios, a key one involving a patient seeing different specialists, such as a gastroenterologist and a cardiologist, and being recommended entirely different diet strategies by the clinicians who are unaware of the other specialist's recommendation, the authors note.

In another scenario, patients may be intentionally recommended a combination of dietary therapeutic strategies, such as those with celiac disease and co-existent irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) who are recommended a gluten-free as well as a low FODMAP diet (a dietary restriction of fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols).

Still another — possibly common — scenario could involve patients receiving advice based on questionable evidence from either alternative practitioners or from the wide array of unreliable sources found online and through social media.

“Patients might be directed by advice from sources external to the managing clinician's advice, such as alternative practitioners or from online sources with limited or questionable evidence, or for a clinical scenario where an evidence-based diet is inappropriate, without appropriate guidance and support,” the authors note.

Finally, patients who are recommended dietary strategies may incorporate key elements from other dietary restrictions, such as a gluten-free diet combined with a low-fat or dairy-free component, they add. 

“Patients may accumulate diet strategies by layering them with additional restrictions [without] ever discontinuing an inefficacious diet, which may in fact worsen symptoms, reduce diet quality, and precipitate disordered eating,” they write.

“In clinical practice, one of the most commonly observed examples of diet stacking is the combination of a gluten-free and dairy-free diet,” said Melton, who is a practicing dietitian with the Department of Gastroenterology, Monash University, in Melbourne, Australia.

“We also frequently see individuals combine the low FODMAP diet — an evidence-based, short-term dietary therapy for irritable bowel syndrome — with additional dietary restrictions,” she noted.

“These extra restrictions are often layered on top of the low FODMAP diet without clear clinical indication, increasing overall dietary complexity and restrictiveness.”

Although the prevalence of patients combining multiple dietary strategies has not been well addressed in the medical literature, studies documenting such practices include a Canadian study. The study found that as many as 52% of patients attending a gastroenterology clinic for IBS reported simultaneous use of other dietary manipulations during their trial of the low FODMAP diet, and with only 30% seeing a dietitian for guidance after a mean of 2.5 visits.

Another study of patients using a low food-chemical diet for symptom management reported that 52% (26/50) of patients followed at least two dietary interventions, and 12% (6/50) followed three or more diets simultaneously.

Such dietary combinations, particularly among patients already experiencing GI disorders, can carry a multitude of risks.

“The most potentially risky combinations are those with overlapping or conflicting food exclusions,” Melton explained. 

“For example, combining a low food-chemical diet with a low FODMAP diet can substantially limit food variety and increase the risk of nutritional inadequacy, making it particularly challenging to implement safely,” she said.

With underlying eating disorders common among patients with GI disorders, another concern is that combining or layering diets may further exacerbate that risk, the authors speculate. 

“Diet stacking, especially when self-imposed and not undertaken in collaboration with a dietitian, is likely to be a significant risk factor for the development of eating disorders, although this has not been formally studied,” they note.

“Given this, screening for disordered eating when individuals engage in diet stacking is recommended,” they add.

Of note, some dietary combinations may be appropriate when there is a clear medical indication, Melton added. 

“For instance, a gluten-free diet in someone with celiac disease can be implemented alongside a low FODMAP diet if clinically indicated and appropriately supervised,” she said.

With issues of diet stacking potentially related to complex medical, psychological, and nutritional factors, suggested management of the behavior could likewise involve the multidisciplinary help of a gastroenterologist, gastropsychologist, and/or gastroenterology dietician, the authors say.

In the first-line setting, gastroenterologists should familiarize themselves with the various diets that may be recommended by specialists and/or prone to be experimented with by patients, the authors note.

Further, gastroenterologists should “be vigilant to the existence of diet stacking and actively enquire if the patient is following any dietary restrictions, including asking the patient if they would like more information or referral to a dietitian with gastroenterology expertise,” they recommend.

At their first visit, patients should be asked about any concerns with their nutritional needs and if they have experienced unintentional weight loss. 

“The physician may determine that a micronutrient screen is required to measure key nutrients including specifically plasma albumin and serum vitamin B12, iron studies, and folate levels,” the authors explain.

Psychologists could benefit by conducting assessments regarding any potential psychological comorbidities that could contribute to dietary combinations.

And dieticians could further play a key role by providing patient education on each dietary strategy and helping patients maintain the most important medical strategy, such as a gluten-free diet in celiac disease.

Ultimately, increased awareness of diet stacking in research is needed to better understand its prevalence and nuances, Melton added.

“While diet stacking appears to be commonly observed in clinical practice, it is rarely reported explicitly in research studies,” she noted.

“By defining and naming ‘diet stacking', we hope to highlight this as an emerging issue and encourage future studies to report on the frequency and clinical implications of multiple concurrent dietary interventions in gastrointestinal populations,” she added.

Melton had no disclosures to report.

SAN DIEGO — GLP-1s were safe for weight management in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) but offered no significant protective benefit against disability or disease progression in a new study.

A small retrospective analysis of 131 adults with relapsing-remitting MS and secondary progressive MS who were taking a GLP-1 showed that the average BMI decreased by about 4 over a mean treatment period of 29 months. The average weight loss was 11.3 kg (25 pounds) during the same timeframe.

Earlier research had suggested GLP-1s may have neuroprotective effects in MS and other neurologic disorders. No such benefit was found in the new study. However, investigators cautioned that the jury is still out on whether the popular weight-loss drugs are effective as therapy for MS.

“So far, all we can say is that GLP-1s are generally safe in patients with MS. It's far too early to say whether or not there is a biological benefit for MS pathophysiology and/or symptoms,” lead investigator Rachel Rodin, MD, PhD, neurologist and clinical fellow at Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, both in Boston, told Medscape Medical News.

The findings were presented on February 6 at the Americas Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis (ACTRIMS) Forum 2026.

Obesity is common in people with MS and can worsen disease activity, progression, and quality of life. Despite a scarcity of safety data in this patient population, the use of GLP-1s has increased in patients with MS.

Results from preclinical and small retrospective studies have suggested GLP-1s could slow MS disease progression and improve patient-reported outcomes.

“Many patients at my hospital's MS center have been reporting that they feel better after starting a GLP-1. Anecdotally, patients have noted improved fatigue, cognition, and mobility,” Rodin said.

To study the issue further, researchers assessed the safety and clinical impact of GLP-1s in a single-center retrospective analysis of 131 patients with MS (mean age, 53 years; 82% women; 85% White). Two thirds of patients had relapsing-remitting MS and 25% had secondary progressive MS.

Participants received a GLP-1 between 2015 and 2025 and had MS clinic visits within 1 year before and at least 1 month after treatment initiation.

Semaglutide was the most commonly used (31%), followed by tirzepatide (11%) and dulaglutide (9%). Nearly half of patients (45%) took two or more GLP-1s over the study period due to insurance coverage changes, weight plateaus, or side effects.

Researchers compared BMI, Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), and timed 25-foot walk (T25FW) scores before and after treatment using paired statistical analyses. The mean BMI at baseline was 36.9, and the mean EDSS score was 3.1.

The majority of patients (65%) showed no change to EDSS or T25FW scores. EDSS scores fell by 0.5-2.0 points in 17% of patients and increased by 0.5-4.0 points in 18% of patients, although these changes were not statistically significant.

Clinical relapses occurred in 7% of patients while on a GLP-1 receptor agonists, and 5% of patients acquired new or enlarging T2 lesions on MRI.

“We were surprised to see that there was no significant change in EDSS or timed 25-foot walk,” Rodin said.

Overall, GLP-1 therapy was well tolerated, although 42% of participants reported side effects, which researchers said is typical in non-MS users.

The most common side effects were constipation (13%), nausea (11%), and other gastrointestinal symptoms (4%). More serious adverse events included pancreatitis (1%), severe constipation requiring intervention (1%), and worsening MS-related fatigue or brain fog (1%), and dysesthesias (1%).

Two patients experienced dysesthesias described as a “sunburn sensation” that were ultimately attributed to their GLP-1 use. One patient had a seizure due to hypoglycemia, and one developed herpes simplex virus encephalitis, though this was believed to be unrelated to the GLP-1 medication.

Looking ahead, Rodin said the team plans to compare the study data with that of a retrospective control cohort to see if similar patients who did not receive GLP-1s experienced greater disease progression over the same period. They'll also do a subgroup analysis, to determine if the drugs offer benefits in specific patient groups.

Rodin noted that future prospective studies should collect data on fatigue and cognition to determine if GLP-1s affect these symptoms in MS.

Also speaking at ACTRIMS Forum, Afsaneh Shirani, MD, associate director of neuroscience research and medical education at Saint Luke's Marion Bloch Neuroscience Institute and clinical associate professor of neurology at the School of Medicine, University of Missouri-Kansas City, both in Kansas City, Missouri, noted that one potential issue is that GLP-1s don't cross the blood-brain barrier.

“However, it is still possible that even these drugs might impact MS by changing the circulating metabolic profile of the blood and impacting the peripheral immune system and by interacting with the circumventricular organs in the brain,” Shirani said.

Preclinical evidence supports anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects, “but there is no strong evidence to suggest that they have any direct effect on limiting demyelination or promoting remyelination,” she added.

A randomized clinical trial into GLP-1s and MS has been planned at Johns Hopkins University, Shirani said, and should be launched soon.

Rodin reported having no relevant financial relationships. Shirani reported having a relationship with TG Therapeutics.

The appropriations bill signed into law by President Trump on February 3, 2026, included the PREVENT DIABETES Act, which extends virtual access to the National Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) under Medicare for 3 years.

In 2017, Medicare began covering access to the DPP, a lifestyle program first launched in 2010 by the US CDC with the aim of preventing type 2 diabetes in people with prediabetes. The so-called Medicare DPP (MDPP) Expanded Model is a 1-year evidence-based behavior change educational program for eligible beneficiaries within qualifying programs. It involves 16 weekly sessions followed by 6-month maintenance sessions.

The MDPP was granted temporary emergency authority, along with other health services, to be conducted virtually during the COVID pandemic. Now, with the PREVENT DIABETES Act, the MDPP becomes a permanent benefit in Medicare and extends virtual and asynchronous access through December 31, 2029.

“This addresses long-standing access barriers and improves reach in rural and underserved communities,” the American Medical Association, which had lobbied for the Act along with other professional medical organizations, said in a statement.

The new legislation also allows Medicare beneficiaries to participate in the DPP more than once.

The Act responds to issues previously brought up by various medical societies.

In a 2024 support letter to two members of Congress who co-sponsored the PREVENT DIABETES Act, the Endocrine Society pointed out that of the approximately 98 million Americans with prediabetes, about 27.2 million are aged 65 years or older. Yet, they noted at the time, the vast majority of DPP participants access the program through private health plans or employers, not Medicare. The society cited lack of access to in-person MDPP locations as a major reason for that.

Co-signers to the letter included the American Diabetes Association, American Heart Association, American Medical Association, American Podiatric Medical Association, American Telemedicine Association, and the Association of Diabetes Care & Education Specialists.

In patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, the use of antifibrotic therapy was associated with a lower incidence rate and risk for lung cancer.

“Additional prospective patient-level studies are needed to explore specific mitigating pathways and delineate the extent of individual risk reductions for each drug ,” the authors of the study wrote.

This study was led by Supiya Kijlertsuphasri , Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota. It was published online on January 21, 2026, in Thorax.

The 16-year study window encompassed evolving diagnostic and treatment practices that could have affected survival and treatment selection. Temporal shifts — for example, the increased use of high-resolution scans and lower smoking rates — may have altered background lung cancer risk but could not be accounted for in this study.

The authors did not report any specific funding. They declared having no competing interests.

Serge Cannasse

French and US research teams have identified metabolic vulnerabilities in aggressive forms of medulloblastoma (MB), the most common malignant brain tumor in children. Studies have shown that fatty acids (FAs) accumulate within lipid droplets (LDs) in high-risk tumors, and that disrupting lipid storage weakens tumor cells and triggers widespread cell death. These findings suggest potential therapeutic strategies that could reduce the reliance on treatments associated with severe long-term toxicity while improving outcomes for children with poor prognoses.

Speaking with MediQuality, a Medscape Network platform, Pierluigi Calò, MD , a pediatric hematology-oncology specialist at Queen Fabiola Children's University Hospital in Brussels, Belgium, provided clinical perspectives.

“Medulloblastoma is a common malignant brain tumor in children,” said Calò. “Among all pediatric brain tumors, it is the most common malignant cancer, although it remains rare overall. It is, however, highly aggressive and requires multimodal treatment, combining surgery, chemotherapy, and, depending on the child's age, radiotherapy.”

Not all MBs have the same prognoses. “Over the past 10 years, our understanding of these tumors has advanced substantially,” Calò said. “Genetic analyses have identified four main groups of MB, along with multiple subgroups.”

These biological differences translate into wide variations in outcomes. “In favorable cases, 5-year survival exceeds 90%, whereas survival drops to around 50% at 5 years in the highest-risk cases,” Calò said. “Alterations involving TP53 and MYC are particularly concerning and are associated with a very poor prognosis. The current challenge is to reduce long-term treatment toxicity in children with favorable-risk disease while intensifying therapy for those whose survival is threatened.”

This challenge formed the rationale for the study led by researchers from the Institut Curie in collaboration with the Istituto Pasteur Italia — Fondazione Cenci Bolognetti, Sapienza University, Rome, Italy, and other international academic institutions, including the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston and the University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh. This study revealed a novel molecular mechanism for blocking the growth of MB, the most common malignant brain tumor in children.

To obtain a comprehensive view of disease biology, researchers analyzed 384 tumor samples from the international MB COMICS cohort, including patients from France, the US, Germany, and Canada. To date, this is the largest international cohort dedicated to pediatric MB. The results of this study, which identified “lipid droplets” as a critical and targetable vulnerability, have been published in Cancer Cell.

Using an integrative bioinformatics strategy, researchers have combined five layers of omics data — genomic, proteomic, phosphoproteomic, metabolomic, and clinical data — to characterize tumor cell biology. “This is a remarkable piece of work,” Calò said. “Its strength lies in the integration of established approaches such as proteomics and transcriptomics with newer techniques, particularly lipidomic, which focuses on lipid metabolism.”

He also emphasized the importance of international collaboration. “This study highlights the value of partnerships across borders, which we are also involved in, notably with KU Leuven and other European teams,” he said.

The analysis revealed marked metabolic heterogeneity within group 3 MBs, including a distinctive lipid signature characterized by specific FA compositions in tumor cells. This feature was also observed in a subgroup defined by the activation of the MYC oncogene, which is associated with a particularly poor prognosis.

A detailed examination of the tumor samples revealed the rapid accumulation of FAs within LDs. These structures support tumor cell survival by protecting against oxidative stress and ferroptosis, a regulated form of cell death, while supplying mitochondria with energy that fuels tumor growth.

Protecting tumor cells may also be a key vulnerability. In preclinical models, the inhibition of diacylglycerol O-acyltransferase 1 (DGAT1), an enzyme essential for LD formation, triggers extensive tumor cell death. Combining DGAT1 inhibitors with conventional chemotherapy further enhances antitumor effects in preclinical settings, leading to greater tumor cell destruction.

Does this discovery open the door to new treatment strategies for children with high-risk diseases? “It is still too early to be overly optimistic,” Calò cautioned. “The findings need to be validated in nonmurine models. The authors also acknowledge that DGAT1 inhibitors have limited ability to cross the blood-brain barrier, which remains a major challenge in MB.”

However, he underscored the broader implications. “If confirmed, this work identifies a tumor-specific biologic dependency,” Calò said. “By demonstrating that group 3 MBs rely on a specific lipid metabolic pathway, it becomes possible to envision more targeted approaches. Such strategies could reduce reliance on chemotherapy and radiotherapy, whose toxic effects are especially damaging to the developing brain.”

As overhead costs continue to soar and hospital consolidation hits a fever pitch, some doctors are mulling over the benefits of opening a micro-practice.

These hyper-niche, solo practices — run by doctors with zero staff — charge patients a flat monthly fee and don't bill insurance companies, which eliminates the administrative burden physicians face, said Sonia Singh, MD, who opened Juniper Modern Primary Care, a micro-practice in Houston, 5 years ago.

“A micro-practice is a lean and efficient model doctors should consider,” said Singh, who sees her patients in a 700-square-foot office. “The reason it's possible to make this work is that your overhead is low — you won't need any staff to handle administrative and clinical tasks.”

And, while some are critical of the model, Singh argues that it's cost-effective for her patients and her — by her second year, she earned the same amount she did working at an insurance-based practice.

“People say micro-practices are only for the 1%, but my patients are gig workers, they're restaurant workers, they're people who don't have good insurance,” Singh told Medscape Medical News. She has 170 patients who pay an average of $200 per month for 24/7 access and currently has a waiting list.

Medscape continually surveys physicians and other medical professionals about key practice challenges and current issues, creating high-impact analyses. For example, Medscape's The State of Primary Care in the US Report 2026 found that

For Nadia Sirdar, MD, who started seeing patients at her micro-practice in Bethesda, Maryland, this past summer, the model has led to greater job satisfaction.

“I'm able to practice medicine on my terms,” she said, adding that her practice is geared towards women in midlife. “This means I can take the time and energy I need to learn the patient's history, and I have control over the environment they walk into, which means I have curated the experience so that the waiting room feels like you are visiting a friend's home. I have my own tea blends, so we can share a cup of tea while I discuss the patient's history and all of the things they want to talk to a doctor about but may have never had the time and space to do so.”

During that 45-minute to hour-long chat, taking place with her laptop open and a note-taking assistant charting for her, Sirdar isn't pressured to type her notes, which creates space for full eye contact, enabling doctor and patient to build a relationship as health partners.

“By the time we're in the exam room, going through the ritual of vitals and a full physical exam, we've spent a relatively relaxed period of time together, and the exam is more forthcoming,” she says. “The patient might say, ‘Can you look at this?' or ‘I was embarrassed to ask about this before, but now I feel comfortable.'”

For Sirdar, one of the things that has been most surprising is that some of her colleagues tend to think that starting a micro-practice takes a lot of capital. While there are few official statistics on start-up costs, micro-practices can be opened with as little as $10,000 and cost less than traditional practices. They can also be opened far more quickly than a traditional private practice.

“I self-funded my micro-practice, and, yes, I paid a lot in terms of sweat, tears, and grit, but I believe it's worth it,” she says, adding that she continued to work as an employed physician while she built her own business. “I was able to generate a patient list outside of my employment by letting people in my community know early on that this was my dream.”

Despite the micro-practice trend continuing to proliferate, some doctors still assume it is barely viable.

“They tend to believe that without scaling, staff, and high patient volume, the practice can't be profitable or sustainable,” said Sylvie Stacy, MD, author of 50 Nonclinical Careers for Physicians: Fulfilling, Meaningful, and Lucrative Alternatives to Direct Patient Care. “But this tends to overlook the major role of overhead costs. When overhead drops from roughly 60%-20% to 35% or even lower (which is what I'd expect for most micro-practices), the break-even point changes. Your income may be lower than in traditional practice, but profitability can arrive faster, and there's less financial risk, no debt, and more predictable cash flow.”

In addition, it's a fallacy to think that micro-practices deliver inferior care because they lack staff, fancy equipment, or expansive office space. 

“More infrastructure doesn't automatically mean better medicine,” Stacy added. “Micro-practices deliberately have a narrow scope of patients. This usually leads to more continuity, more access, and better relationships, and these are all things that improve care and patient satisfaction.”

As for the challenges, the one thing physicians in micro-practices are right to focus on is the safety concerns related to working solo. 

“Having a chaperone in the exam room when a patient requires, say, a gynecologic exam, is one of the biggest challenges when you're running a micro-practice,” Singh concedes. “But there are many options. For example, if your office is in a space with other medical practices, you can pay a healthcare professional a per diem when you need to do those exams.”

Being transparent about the way clinical exams will be conducted is also critical.

“I tell patients up front that I'm working alone, that I will do my best to arrange a chaperone if needed, and that I don't do sensitive appointments on male patients,” Singh said. “However, since I spend at least an hour with my patients before we do any exam, by the time I'm doing an intimate exam, there's a trust there. This is very different from a traditional practice where you have thousands of patients coming through the door.”

Finally, the lack of colleagues can also have an upside, Singh said.

“The tradeoff is that although I don't see other doctors in my workplace, I have more time and flexibility to meet colleagues for lunch. I'm also in touch with specialists all the time in my work, coordinating care for my patients.”

Elena Riboldi

The Italian Association for the Study of the Liver (AISF) has published a position paper in the journal Digestive and Liver Disease addressing several unmet needs in the care of liver diseases — stigma, challenges related to aging, the gender gap, socioeconomic barriers, and optimizing quality of life — describing the current situation, and proposing future perspectives. Univadis Italy, part of the Medscape Professional Network, interviewed Stefano Gitto, MD, PhD, a member of the AISF coordinating committee and the paper's lead author.

“If there is one area where stigma remains very strong, it is alcohol-related diseases, which primarily target the liver,” said Gitto, gastroenterologist at the Internal Medicine and Liver Unit, Careggi University Hospital, University of Florence, Florence, Italy. He confirmed that the belief that those who get sick from drinking are “asking for it” is still widespread. Because of self-stigma — when stigmatized individuals internalize society's negative beliefs and prejudices — patients are reluctant to disclose alcohol use and do not seek help, causing delays in diagnosis and treatment. Things are even worse when alcohol use is associated with obesity or when the disease's origin is in no way related to alcohol.

Doctors and healthcare professionals are not immune to judgmental and discriminatory attitudes toward these patients, so the AISF recommends avoiding language that perpetuates negative stereotypes. “We know words have a direct impact on clinical practice. Several years ago, the term alcohol use disorder was introduced to replace the word alcoholism, but words like ‘alcoholic' are still wrongly used by many health professionals,” Gitto emphasized. “We should use terms that do not label the patient and avoid language that reinforces the idea of a self-inflicted disease. Stigmatizing language prevents building trust with patients and families and, ultimately, makes us less effective therapeutically.”

The AISF paper notes that stigma persists in many healthcare settings, risking unequal access to care. Historically, patients had to show at least 6 months of alcohol abstinence to be considered eligible for liver transplantation — the so-called 6-month rule. Transplant medicine has undergone a profound evolution, and in the past 20-25 years, access to transplantation has changed dramatically. For example, until the early 2000s, it was unthinkable to transplant a person older than 60 years, whereas now transplants are easily performed even at age 70. Use of marginal donors — donors with more fragile characteristics — has expanded, in part because of perfusion machines.

There has also been a significant evolution regarding patients with alcohol use disorder: Many transplant centers have abandoned the 6-month rule because it prevented patients who had seriously undertaken abstinence from accessing a transplant simply because they hadn't reached the required time limit — and some died before becoming eligible. This extremely rigid criterion — and somewhat punitive aftertaste — has been overcome.

He said the prevailing approach now is an individualized assessment of pretransplant alcohol use. Motivation, adherence to support networks, and the presence of a reliable caregiver are all crucial factors in qualifying for the procedure. A period of pretransplant abstinence is also important to see if the patient can recover liver function and might no longer need a transplant.

During that time, the patient can be referred to hospital alcohol units orthe Ser.D. (Servizio per le Dipendenze, Italy's publicly funded Territorial Addiction Service), self-help groups, and psychological support services. Motivation can be built through education, family members can be met, and one or more caregivers can be identified who can support them along the way. The pretransplant period is used to create the strongest possible network around the patient so that abstinence can be maintained after transplantation.

He noted that in some cases, stricter rules still apply, and access to transplantation may be denied — for example, if a patient shows no willingness to engage in a support program to maintain abstinence or if it is impossible to find a caregiver. These are contraindications to be assessed on a case-by-case basis.

The presence of a major psychiatric comorbidity is a contraindication to transplantation because the patient may not provide guarantees for posttransplant outcomes: There is a risk that the transplant would be wasted through rejection related to nonadherence to immunosuppressive therapy or by losing the patient to follow-up in the first few weeks, which would put their life at risk as much as not receiving a new liver. Organs are a finite resource: We proceed to transplant a patient who stands to gain in survival terms; we do not do it when we already know there is a very high risk for organ loss.

Patients with liver disease face serious inequities that stem both from resource availability and from patients' ability to access and use those resources effectively. The AISF uses the phrase “postal-code lottery,” in which care depends on geographic location, with urban centers offering specialized services, whereas rural patients face limited access and longer travel times.

Several Italian regions lack a single transplant center, and the density of tertiary care centers for liver disease treatment in central and northern Italy is much higher than in southern Italy. In Lombardy, Emilia-Romagna, and Tuscany, there are three to five AISF centers; in other regions, there is only one or none at all, emphasizing that the problem is distribution across the country — not quality — because Southern Italy also has top-notch liver care centers, such as those in Naples, Messina, and Palermo.

Last year, AISF presented the White Paper ‘Liver Diseases,' which was requested and endorsed by the Italian Senate's Committee on social affairs, healthcare, public and private employment, and social security. The document addresses all major liver diseases, with each chapter providing epidemiologic, technical, and economic commentary and institutional policy recommendations. Based on the White Paper, AISF has launched a series of proposals to institutions to bridge gaps, such as geographic disparities.

Among AISF's strategies to address disparities in healthcare resources is greater involvement of general practitioners (GPs). “Today the vast majority of liver disease cases are metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease — by definition, a hepatic expression of obesity — and alcoholic liver disease, and for both, primary prevention is essential. GPs who see an overweight patient can refer them to educational, nutritional, and, if needed, psychological support to prevent liver disease; likewise, a GP can detect early signs of problematic alcohol use and intervene early,” noted Gitto, adding that the aim is not to impose total abstinence from alcohol on everyone, as long as consumption is informed.

Gitto declared having no conflicts of interest related to the subject.

Edited by Zeel Mehta

The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has issued final draft guidance recommending durvalumab (Imfinzi, AstraZeneca), given with gemcitabine and cisplatin before surgery and continued as monotherapy afterwards, for adults with resectable muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC). 

The decision marks the first time immunotherapy has been incorporated into both the neoadjuvant (pre-surgical) and adjuvant (post-surgical) stages of treatment for this form of bladder cancer.

Under the recommended regimen, durvalumab is administered alongside chemotherapy before radical cystectomy and continued after surgery. The perioperative approach aims to reduce the risk for recurrence and improve long-term survival.

MIBC is characterised by malignancy that has spread into the bladder's muscle layer without distant metastases. In England, 18,060 new bladder cancer cases were diagnosed in 2022. The disease predominantly affects people in their sixties and seventies, although younger individuals can also be affected. Men are affected more frequently than women. 

Approximately 630 patients per year are expected to be eligible for this therapy. 

Symptoms may include haematuria, lower back or abdominal pain, and unexplained weight loss. Despite current standard care, around half of patients experience recurrence or progression within 5 years.

Durvalumab is a human monoclonal antibody targeting the PD-L1 protein, blocking its interactions with PD-1 and CD80 receptors. This mechanism enables the immune system to recognise and attack cancer cells more effectively.

The perioperative protocol involves administering durvalumab by infusion every 3 weeks alongside chemotherapy before surgery, followed by administration every 4 weeks as monotherapy after radical cystectomy, in line with its marketing authorisation.

“This positive NICE recommendation marks an important step forward for people living with one of the most aggressive forms of bladder cancer,” said Tom Keith-Roach, country president of AstraZeneca UK.

The recommendation is based on evidence from the phase 3 NIAGARA trial, which enrolled 1063 patients with MIBC. The study randomised 533 patients to receive durvalumab plus neoadjuvant chemotherapy (gemcitabine and cisplatin) followed by durvalumab monotherapy, while 530 patients received neoadjuvant chemotherapy alone.

The durvalumab regimen demonstrated a 32% reduction in the risk for progression compared with standard care. At 24 months, overall survival was 82.2% in the durvalumab group vs 75.2% in the chemotherapy-only group. Event-free survival at 24 months was 67.8% with durvalumab compared with 59.8% in the control arm.

Radical cystectomy was performed in 88.0% of patients in the durvalumab group compared with 83.2% in the control group. 

Rates of grade 3 or 4 adverse events were similar between groups (69.4% vs 67.5%).

NICE concluded that despite uncertainty in long-term modelling and indirect comparisons, the most plausible incremental cost-effectiveness ratio falls within the range considered an acceptable use of NHS resources.

Durvalumab will be available to the NHS through a confidential commercial access agreement. The list price is £592.00 per 2.4-mL vial and £2,466.00 per 10-mL vial, although the agreed NHS discount remains confidential. 

Under the guidance, NHS England and integrated care boards must fund the treatment within 90 days of final publication. 

Interim funding will be available through the Cancer Drugs Fund from the point of marketing authorisation or the release of positive draft guidance, whichever occurs later, before transitioning to routine commissioning.

New evidence suggests that improving dietary quality complements cardioprotective medications, reinforcing diet as a central pillar of cardiovascular disease prevention.



Study: Foods of concern, cardiopreventive medication use and risk of cardiovascular diseases: a prospective study in the CARTaGENE cohort. Image Credit: Rimma Bondarenko / Shutterstock

In a recent study accepted as a journal pre proof in The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, researchers evaluated whether lower consumption of foods of concern, defined by food processing level or front of package warning labels, is associated with reduced cardiovascular disease risk independent of cardioprotective medication use.

Cardiovascular disease causes nearly one in three deaths worldwide, and in Canada alone, it accounts for approximately 14 deaths every hour, placing substantial strain on health systems and families. Although medications for high blood pressure and high cholesterol are widely prescribed, everyday dietary choices remain a powerful determinant of cardiovascular health.

In response, Canada has introduced front-of-package nutrition symbols for foods high in saturated fat, sodium, and sugars. At the same time, there is increasing concern about ultra-processed foods, which now dominate many modern diets. Whether warning labels fully capture harmful foods and whether medications can offset poor dietary patterns remain uncertain, underscoring the need to understand how diet and pharmacotherapy interact in real-world cardiovascular prevention.

This prospective cohort analysis was conducted within the CARTaGENE population-based study in Québec, Canada. Participants aged 40 to 69 years who completed dietary assessments and reported physician-diagnosed hypertension or hypercholesterolemia were eligible. Individuals with prior myocardial infarction, stroke, cancer, or diabetes were excluded.

Dietary intake over the previous year was assessed using the validated Canadian Dietary History Questionnaire II. Foods were classified by degree of processing using the Nova system, identifying ultra-processed foods, and by nutritional risk using Health Canada criteria for front-of-package nutrition symbols applied to foods high in saturated fat, sodium, or sugars.

Consumption was expressed as the percentage share of the total daily diet by weight (grams per day), allowing a substitution-based interpretation in which lower intake of foods of concern corresponds to higher intake of other foods. Use of blood pressure- and cholesterol-lowering medications was self-reported and classified according to the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) system.

The outcome was incident cardiovascular disease, defined as the first occurrence of myocardial infarction, stroke, or cardiovascular death identified through linked administrative health data using International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models adjusted for age, sex, income, smoking status, physical activity, alcohol intake, total energy intake, and body mass index.

The analysis included 2,123 adults followed for a mean of 9.3 years, during which 179 cardiovascular events occurred. Up to 41 percent of the daily diet by weight consisted of ultra-processed foods, while 38 percent of total caloric intake came from foods carrying front-of-package nutrition symbols, underscoring the prevalence of these foods even among individuals aware of cardiovascular risk.

Lower consumption of foods of concern was associated with a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease. A 10 percent reduction in dietary intake of ultra-processed foods, measured by weight, was associated with approximately a 13 percent lower hazard of cardiovascular disease. A similar reduction in risk was observed for foods bearing front-of-package warning symbols.

Although food processing level and nutrient warning labels identify overlapping but not identical food categories, both approaches showed comparable associations with cardiovascular risk. Associations were weaker when exposures were defined as a percentage of calories rather than grams per day, suggesting that methodological choices in dietary exposure definition influence effect estimates.

Participants with lower intake of foods of concern also consumed fewer total calories. They had lower intakes of saturated fat and sodium, supporting links between overall dietary quality and cardiometabolic health. Findings were consistent across sensitivity analyses and in subgroup analyses restricted to participants with hypertension or hypercholesterolemia.

Use of cardioprotective medications did not modify the association between diet and cardiovascular risk. Although use of cholesterol-lowering medications was associated with lower cardiovascular risk, blood pressure-lowering medications alone showed no clear protective association in this observational analysis, likely reflecting confounding by indication rather than lack of efficacy.

No evidence was found that medication use attenuated the protective association between lower consumption of foods of concern and cardiovascular disease risk across multiple interaction metrics, including relative excess risk due to interaction, attributable proportion due to interaction, and additive interaction measures.

From a practical perspective, individuals taking cardioprotective medications continued to experience additional benefits from reducing intake of ultra-processed foods and foods high in sodium, added sugars, and saturated fat. These findings suggest that medication and dietary improvements act independently rather than as substitutes, although residual confounding and dietary measurement limitations inherent to cohort studies should be acknowledged.

Among adults with hypertension or hypercholesterolemia, lower consumption of foods of concern, whether defined by ultra-processed or front-of-package nutrition symbols, was associated with significantly lower cardiovascular disease risk. These associations persisted regardless of medication use, indicating that pharmacological treatment complements rather than replaces healthy dietary patterns.

The findings support the role of food labeling in identifying higher-risk dietary patterns while reinforcing concerns about the regular consumption of ultra-processed foods. For individuals, clinicians, and policymakers, the results underscore the importance of combining dietary improvement with pharmacological management as part of comprehensive cardiovascular disease prevention strategies, noting that the results derive from a middle-aged Québec cohort and may not fully generalize to other populations.

Could a smart watch act as an early‑warning system for depression relapse? New research from McMaster University suggests that disruptions in a person's sleep and daily activity routine, as detected through a simple wrist-worn device, can signal when there is increased risk of relapsing into major depression.

The new research highlights a simple, yet powerful way to passively monitor relapse risk in people living with major depressive disorder (MDD), often detecting the probability of a relapse weeks or months before the episode occurs. Approximately 60 per cent of people with MDD relapse within five years, even with treatment.

Advances in digital technology and AI algorithms have a great potential for relapse prevention in mental health. Imagine a future where a smartwatch can warn people with depression: 'A new episode of depression is very likely coming within the next four weeks. How about seeing your health-care provider?'""

Benicio Frey, Professor, Department of Psychiatry and Behavioural Neurosciences, McMaster University

The study, published in JAMA Psychiatry on Feb. 11, 2026, followed 93 adults across Canada who had previously recovered from depression and wore a research-grade actigraphy device, similar to a Fitbit or Apple Watch. Participants wore the wearable device for one to two years, generating over 32,000 days of sleep and activity data.

This research underscores the untapped potential of wearable technology for people recovering from MDD because it collects data passively and could provide continuous insight between clinical appointments. Current monitoring relies heavily on symptoms, which usually appear later than what can be detected through a wearable device.

Researchers say there are opportunities for health system innovation, where wearable-derived alerts could help clinicians target care to those most at risk, improving outcomes and reducing the burden of recurrent episodes.

""While it has been long recognized that abnormal sleep and activity patterns are associated with greater risk of depression relapse, the ability to passively detect these abnormal patterns using smart sensors opens an exciting new window of opportunity for personalizing the care of conditions that may reoccur, like depression"".

MDD is a common and serious medical condition that affects millions of people globally. Depression impacts how a person feels, thinks and functions, and can cause persistent symptoms like low mood, lack of appetite, feelings of guilt and loss of interest in activities.

The study was supported by the Ontario Brain Institute, Janssen Research & Development, and the Ontario Research Fund – Research Excellence, in partnership with the Canadian Biomarker Integration Network in Depression (CAN‑BIND).

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","New nanoparticles enable the removal of melanoma tumors with low-power laser","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20260210/New-nanoparticles-enable-the-removal-of-melanoma-tumors-with-low-power-laser.aspx","Wed, 11 Feb 2026 03:00:00 GMT","

Researchers at Oregon State University have developed and tested in a mouse model a new type of nanoparticle that enables the removal of melanoma tumors with a low-power laser.

After the systemically administered nanoparticles accumulate in cancerous tissue, exposure to near-infrared light causes them to heat up and destroy the melanoma cells, leaving healthy tissue unharmed.

The study led by Olena Taratula and Prem Singh of the Oregon State University College of Pharmacy represents a huge step toward solving a persistent problem with using photothermal therapy to treat melanoma, the deadliest form of skin cancer: Conventional nanoparticles require lasers with power densities that are unsafe for the skin.

Findings were published in Advanced Functional Materials.

Taratula, associate professor of pharmaceutical sciences, and Singh, a postdoctoral researcher in Taratula's lab, based their new theranostic platform – it can be used for both treatment and diagnosis – on gold nanorods. The nanorods are coated with an iron-cobalt shell and tightly loaded with a dye that heats up upon exposure to near-infrared light – invisible, low-frequency radiation able to penetrate deeply into human tissue.

A key feature of the platform is its use of resonance energy transfer, a nanoscale process in which energy moves directly from one molecule to another. The highly efficient nature of resonance energy transfer is what allows the nanoparticles to heat up quickly under laser exposure far below the safety threshold for maintaining healthy skin.

The safety limit is 0.33 watts per centimeter squared. When we used 0.25 watts per centimeter squared with our nanoparticles, a single treatment of an aggressive melanoma mouse model, developed in the lab of our OSU colleague Adam Alani, completely ablated the tumor.""

Olena Taratula, associate professor of pharmaceutical sciences, Oregon State University College of Pharmacy

According to the American Cancer Society, skin cancer is by far the most common type of cancer in the United States, and melanoma is the most dangerous type. Melanoma, which starts in the skin's pigment-producing cells and is typically caused by exposure to ultraviolet light, accounts for only about 1% of skin cancers but is responsible for the majority of skin cancer deaths.

More than 8,000 people in the U.S. died of melanoma in 2025, according to the National Institutes of Health, and more than 100,000 new cases were diagnosed.

""Many of those cases likely were treated with a surgical procedure that required a big incision and a significant amount of tissue removal to help ensure no cancerous cells were left behind,"" Singh said. ""Photothermal therapy on the other hand is a minimally invasive treatment, and our work establishes resonance energy transfer as a truly transformative strategy for coming up with next-generation photothermal therapy agents.""

The design of the nanoparticle presented in this research, he added, allows it to also act as an imaging agent that enables fluorescence-guided ablation therapy – an imaging system shows where to focus the laser during tumor removal.

The OSU College of Pharmacy, the OSU Advantage program, the National Cancer Institute of the National Institutes of Health and the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development supported this research.

The collaboration included Oregon State's Constanze Raitmayr, Syed Zaki Husain Rizvi, Ammar Salem, Vladislav Grigoriev, Tetiana Korzun, Karthickraja Duraisamy, Akshay Vyawahare, Kongbrailatpam Shitaljit Sharma, Ana Paula Mesquita Souza, Yoon Tae Goo, Manali Phawde, Chrissa Kioussi and Oleh Taratula, and Yitayal Admassu Workie of Addis Ababa Science and Technology University.

Eric Gaier, MD, PhD, and Dean Eliott, MD, of the Department of Ophthalmology at Mass Eye and Ear, a member of the Mass General Brigham healthcare system, are co-authors of a paper published in Ophthalmology Retina, ""Substance Use Disorder Interventions and Ophthalmic Outcomes for Injection Drug Use-Associated Endogenous Endophthalmitis.""

Q: What challenges or unmet needs make this study important? 

People who use injection drugs are at a higher risk for eye infections, particularly endogenous endophthalmitis-a medical emergency caused by bacteria or fungi entering the bloodstream to reach the inside of the eye. These individuals may present to eye clinics or emergency rooms with severe, vision-threatening disease. However, the underlying substance use disorder that led to their infection is often not addressed in a systematic way.

These encounters represent a critical-and often missed-opportunity to connect patients with evidence-based, life-saving addiction treatments. As ophthalmologists, we are often the first specialists involved in caring for these patients, placing vision care at a unique intersection between acute medical illness and long-term health outcomes.

Q: What central question(s) were you investigating? 

First, we wanted to determine whether involving addiction consult services in our care of these patients actually changed their access to medications for substance use disorder (specifically, opioid use disorder).

Second, we sought to understand what clinical or substance-related factors are associated with worse visual outcomes, particularly in the current era of increased fentanyl use.

Q: What methods or approach did you use? 

We reviewed the clinical course of patients treated for injection drug use–associated endogenous endophthalmitis at Mass General Brigham over a six-year period. We examined both ophthalmic outcomes-such as vision and complications-and addiction-related care, including whether patients were seen by an addiction consult service and whether medications for opioid use disorder were initiated.

Q: What did you find?

We found that medications for opioid use disorder were only initiated when the addiction consult service was involved, and never when it wasn't. In other words, without formal addiction consultation, eligible patients simply did not receive these life-saving treatments for their substance use.

From an ophthalmic standpoint, most patients experienced improvements in vision, but those who reported fentanyl use had dramatically worse outcomes, with more than five-fold higher odds of severe vision loss. These findings highlight fentanyl as a particularly dangerous factor not only for overdose risk, but also for irreversible visual disability.

Q: What are the real-world implications, particularly for patients? 

This study reinforces that eye doctors can offer much more to patients than vision care alone. For patients with injection drug use–related infections, an ophthalmology visit may be one of the few times they engage with the healthcare system. Ensuring that addiction consult services are involved through these encounters can directly impact these individuals' survival, not just their sight.

For patients and families, the message is clear: addressing substance use disorder alongside acute medical problems is essential to preventing both vision loss and life-threatening complications.

Q: What part of this research feels most meaningful personally?

What feels most meaningful is demonstrating that ophthalmologists can play an active role in connecting patients to life-saving addiction care. Vision loss may be what brings a patient to the hospital, but addressing the underlying condition, substance use disorder, has the potential to change the trajectory of or save someone's life.

Mass Eye and Ear is a member of a large health system with addiction medicine and infectious disease services readily available. This ecosystem enables our ophthalmologists to direct patients with challenging, life-threatening or multi-system disease to multidisciplinary care that can be invaluable.

New real-world evidence links shingles vaccination with reduced dementia risk, raising important questions about viral triggers, inflammation, and future prevention strategies.



Study: Recombinant zoster vaccine is associated with a reduced risk of dementia. Image Credit: Halfpoint / Shutterstock

In a recent study published in the journal Nature Communications, researchers investigated the observational association between the recombinant zoster vaccine (RZV, colloquially “Shingrix”) and dementia risk, a non-target condition, in adults aged 65 years and older. The study analyzed records from more than 300,000 individuals and found that Shingrix was associated with a 51 percent lower observed risk of dementia in the sampled cohort.

Specifically, study findings revealed that two doses of the vaccine were associated with significantly lower hazards of both Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia. These findings remained robust after multiple sensitivity analyses designed to address potential confounding, including healthy-vaccinee effects, suggesting a reduced dementia risk that requires confirmation rather than a demonstrated neuroprotective effect.

Dementia is an umbrella term for a spectrum of progressive neurological conditions severe enough to disrupt daily life. It is now considered a global health crisis, estimated to affect approximately 57.4 million people worldwide, a figure projected to triple by 2050.

Despite decades of research, the causes of dementia remain complex. While age, genetics, health behaviors, and environmental exposures are established risk factors, scientists have long suspected that the varicella-zoster virus (VZV), the virus responsible for chickenpox and shingles, may also play a role.

Studies have shown that when VZV reactivates in older adults, it causes shingles, a painful rash that has been linked to increased risks of neuroinflammation and brain damage.

Notably, data from earlier shingles vaccines, such as the live-attenuated zoster vaccine (ZVL), suggested a potential benefit in reducing dementia risk. However, evidence regarding the newer and more effective recombinant zoster vaccine has remained limited.

The present study aimed to address this gap by conducting a retrospective matched cohort analysis using electronic health records from Kaiser Permanente Southern California. The goal was to examine dementia risk reduction rather than prevention, consistent with the observational nature of the data.

The study population included 65,800 individuals aged 65 years or older who received two doses of RZV between April 2018 and December 2020, with a mean follow-up of approximately 3.4 years. These individuals were matched at a 1:4 ratio to 263,200 unvaccinated peers based on age, sex, race, ethnicity, prior ZVL vaccination history, and extensive clinical covariates. Follow-up began six months after vaccination to reduce misclassification from pre-existing dementia.

The primary endpoint was all-cause dementia, defined using International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD 10) diagnostic codes. Secondary endpoints included specific dementia subtypes such as Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia, and mild cognitive impairment (MCI).

Diagnostic validity was strengthened through targeted medical record review of coded dementia and MCI cases.

To address potential healthy vaccinee bias, the researchers compared RZV recipients with a separate cohort of 65,800 individuals who received the tetanus, diphtheria, and acellular pertussis (Tdap) vaccine. This comparison helped ensure that vaccinated groups were similarly health-seeking, although residual confounding cannot be fully excluded.

Analyses showed that two doses of RZV were associated with a 51 percent lower risk of dementia compared with no vaccination, with an adjusted hazard ratio of 0.49 and a 95 percent confidence interval of 0.46 to 0.51. Dementia incidence rates were 10.74 per 1,000 person-years in the vaccinated group compared with 23.04 in the unvaccinated group.

A stronger association was observed among females, with an adjusted hazard ratio of 0.45 compared with 0.55 in males. Results were otherwise consistent across age groups and racial or ethnic categories, though the biological basis for the sex difference remains unclear.

RZV administration was also associated with a 16 percent reduction in the risk of incident MCI, particularly among individuals followed for less than 3.5 years. Among those who developed MCI, vaccinated individuals experienced a longer median time to progression to dementia, with an average delay of approximately 68 days.

When compared directly with the Tdap vaccinated cohort, RZV recipients still showed a 27 percent lower risk of dementia, supporting the persistence of the association after accounting for healthy vaccinee effects.

This large real-world observational study provides evidence that recombinant zoster vaccination is associated with a statistically significant reduction in dementia risk. However, causality cannot be established, and a longer follow-up is required, given the slow development of dementia.

The underlying biological mechanisms remain uncertain. The authors hypothesize that vaccination may reduce viral reactivation, which could otherwise trigger neuroinflammation or damage cerebral blood vessels, thereby contributing to progressive neurological decline.

Future research should examine whether these cognitive associations are unique to RZV, explore optimal timing and dosing, and evaluate how shingles vaccination might be incorporated into broader dementia risk reduction strategies. A longer longitudinal follow-up will be essential to clarify durability and clinical relevance.

A prior abortion or miscarriage was not linked with an increased risk of developing pre- or postmenopausal breast cancer in a study published in Acta Obstetricia et Gynecologica Scandinavica.

In the nationwide Finnish registry-based study, investigators analyzed data on 31,687 women with breast cancer diagnosed in 1972–2021 and 158,433 women without breast cancer.

The risk of breast cancer was the similar among women with a history of induced abortion and women with no history of abortion, both before and after 50 years of age. Risks were also similar among women with and without a past miscarriage.

In addition, breast cancer risks did not vary significantly by the number of abortions or miscarriages, nor by the time of first abortion or miscarriage.

Miscarriage or induced abortion as potential risk factors for breast cancer has continued to raise concerns and has led to the spread of misinformation. In this study using high-quality Finnish registry data, we can reliably eliminate these concerns. Induced abortion or miscarriage are not risk factors for breast cancer, even if there are several of them. This information is important and reassuring for millions of women around the world.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Researchers uncover mechanisms of three mismatch repair deficient high-grade glioma subtypes","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20260210/Researchers-uncover-mechanisms-of-three-mismatch-repair-deficient-high-grade-glioma-subtypes.aspx","Wed, 11 Feb 2026 02:53:00 GMT","

Researchers have uncovered the mechanisms behind three unique subtypes of mismatch repair deficient high-grade gliomas. The findings provide a clearer understanding of how these tumors develop, explain why patients respond differently to immunotherapy, and are already helping guide more precise therapies. 

High-grade gliomas are a group of aggressive brain tumors and one of the deadliest tumors in children and young adults. In some children, the tumors are driven by mismatch repair deficiency (MMRD), which is characterized by hypermutation (a large and quickly accumulating number of mutations in tumour cells) and resistance to standard treatments such as chemotherapy and radiation. 

Tumors driven by mismatch repair deficiency are known as primary mismatch repair deficient high‑grade gliomas (priMMRD‑HGG). Because priMMRD-HGG have high numbers of mutations, treatment has shifted to immunotherapy, which uses the body's own immune system to fight cancer by targeting cancer cells.

While immunotherapy has improved survival rates, clinicians observed three types of responses to treatment among patients, as well as differences in imaging and age of onset. 

Published in Nature Genetics, the study was led by Dr. Uri Tabori and a team of researchers including Drs. Anirban Das and Cynthia Hawkins at The Hospital for Sick Children (SickKids), working with clinicians and scientists to analyze genomic and clinical data from priMMRD-HGG to better understand these differences. 

The findings reveal three distinct molecular pathways that aligned with clinical observations and provide the basis for more targeted therapies, as well as hope for a potential target for future vaccine development. 

""This rare population of mismatch repair deficient gliomas offers unique insight into how genome instability drives all gliomas, and is already leading to new treatment strategies and clinical trials for patients,"" explains Nicholas Fernandez, first author and Research Fellow in the Tabori Lab. 

Using a unique global cohort of patients from the International Replication Repair Deficiency Consortium, led out of SickKids, the team classified 162 priMMRD-HGG from 152 patients into three subgroups: 

These tumors are the most common, with 62 per cent of tumors having both MMRD mutations and polymerase proofreading deficiency (PPD), making them extremely sensitive to immunotherapy. A first-in-kind clinical trial called U-R-Immune Glioma, led by Drs. Eric Bouffet and Das at SickKids, is already pursuing an immunotherapy-first approach for these patients, sparing initial radiation therapy. 

These tumors account for 19 per cent of the gliomas studied and have MMRD mutations without PPD or IDH1 gene alterations. For these patients, a single-agent immunotherapy is less effective, but adding a second agent may improve outcomes. The OPTIMISE trial, led by Dr. Daniel Morgenstern at SickKids, is using an adaptive trial design to target these specific genetic variations. 

Accounting for the remaining 19 per cent of gliomas studied, these tumors have MMRD mutations and a variation in the IDH1 gene. While they often have poor responses to immunotherapy alone, SickKids clinicians and scientists are working toward a clinical trial to pair targeted immunotherapies with a IDH1 inhibitor to provide more tailored care for this subgroup of patients. 

Beyond advancing patient care, the findings have prompted the research team to suggest the World Health Organization (WHO) reclassify priMMRD-3 as a subtype of astrocytoma, and priMMRD-1 and priMMRD-2 as specific subtypes of paediatric high-grade glioma. This reclassification would better reflect their molecular and clinical behavior, which the research team says will help to propel future research efforts and collaborations with scientists around the world for these ultra-rare and distinct tumor subtypes. 

One effort already underway is an investigation into a possible vaccine to target cancer cells earlier using a strategy called immune interception. 

These tumors have some of the highest mutations in humans, but this study revealed that these mutations are not random. This means the tumors share mutations that can be intercepted earlier to prevent their progression with approaches such as vaccines. In the lab, we're already looking for ways to target and destroy cancer cells before they spread and become deadly."" 

Dr. Uri Tabori, Section Head of Neuro-Oncology, Senior Scientist in the Genetics & Genome Biology program and Garron Family Cancer Centre Chair

While still is in its early phases, the research team is hopeful that with more precise knowledge about these tumor subtypes, treatment can become increasingly proactive and tailored to each child's unique tumor, forming the basis of the new immune cancer interception program led by Drs. Peter Dirks, James Rutka, Hawkins and Tabori in the Brain Tumour Research Centre at SickKids. 

This study was funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR), Terry Fox Research Institute, and Stand Up to Cancer.

A wearable biosensor developed by Washington State University researchers could improve wireless glucose monitoring for people with diabetes, making it more cost-effective, accurate, and less invasive than current models.

The WSU researchers have developed a wearable and user-friendly sensor that uses microneedles and sensors to measure sugar in the fluid around cells, providing an alternative to continuous glucose monitoring systems. Reporting in the journal Analyst, the researchers were able to accurately detect sugar levels and wirelessly transmit the information to a smartphone in real-time.

We were able to amplify the signal through our new single-atom catalyst and make sensors that are smaller, smarter, and more sensitive. This is the future and provides a foundation for being able to detect other disease biomarkers in the body.""

Annie Du, research professor in WSU's College of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences and co-corresponding author on the work

Measuring glucose levels is important for diabetes, helping to keep patients healthy and preventing complications. Continuous glucose monitors on the market require the use of small needles to insert the monitor, and people can get skin irritation or rashes from the chemical processes that are done under the skin. Furthermore, they're not always sensitive enough.

The researchers used 3D printing to create their sensor, which makes it relatively inexpensive compared to typical monitors. The sensor uses a button-activated pump and tiny hollow microneedles to extract fluid from around the cells and tissue below the skin for testing. Unlike other glucose monitors that can cause inflammation and pain at the testing site, the testing process occurs outside the body, lowering potential toxicity for patients.

""Ours is much more benign for customers and users,"" said Kaiyan Qiu, Berry Assistant Professor in WSU's School of Mechanical and Materials Engineering and corresponding author on the work.

The hollow microneedle arrays are less than a millimeter in length as compared to typical glucose monitoring needles that are several times longer.

""The hollow microneedles are painless and minimally invasive, making them next-generation medical devices,"" said Qiu.

The glucose monitor is also highly sensitive because it uses a single-atom catalyst and enzymatic reactions, called nanozymes, to enhance the sugar's signal and measure low levels of the biomarkers.

""The nanozymes make our signal much stronger and can detect a minimal amount of any biomarker,"" said Qiu.

The researchers have filed a provisional patent in the Office of Innovation and Entrepreneurship. They are planning to test the glucose monitors on animals and are investigating its use with additional or multiple biomarkers. The revenue from continuous glucose monitor market in the United States is forecasted to nearly quadruple, from $7.2 billion in 2024 to $26.8 billion in 2033. 

""My goal is to make advanced sensing technology more practical for everyday healthcare,"" said Yonghao Fu, co-first author on the paper and a PhD student in the School of Mechanical and Materials Engineering. ""I enjoy working on a project that can combine different technologies so that we can take advantage of their strengths.""

The work was funded by the National Science Foundation and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) affects 6%−20% of reproductive-aged women, and is commonly accompanied by irregular menstrual cycles and anovulatory infertility. The mechanisms underlying menstrual cycle irregularities associated with PCOS, and how they may change after pregnancy remain incompletely understood.

A recent study published in Life Metabolism, led by Prof. Chaojun Li from Nanjing Medical University, reveals that sustained high progesterone exposure during pregnancy can significantly improve menstrual cyclicity in PCOS patients and a PCOS-like mouse model, providing novel insights into the hormonal mechanisms underlying postpartum recovery.In a retrospective cohort of 186 PCOS patients who delivered after assisted reproductive technology (ART), 60.60% of those with irregular cycles showed improved menstrual regularity postpartum. Importantly, improvement was not associated with baseline clinical characteristics or ART procedures, supporting an association with pregnancy-related endocrine dynamics rather than specific ART interventions.To probe mechanism, the authors used a letrozole-induced PCOS-like mouse model, and administered progesterone for 3 weeks to mimic sustained gestational elevation. Progesterone treatment normalized estrous cyclicity, reduced ovarian weight/index, and improved circulating testosterone and LH. Histology showed fewer advanced follicles and a thinner endometrium during diestrus. Further investigation showed that progesterone depleted large follicles via granulosa cell apoptosis, facilitating a reset of ovarian function.At the cellular level, progesterone induced granulosa-cell apoptosis and reduced follicle-stimulating hormone receptor (FSHR) expression in a GATA2-dependent manner. After progesterone withdrawal, progesterone pretreatment increased granulosa-cell steroidogenic responsiveness to FSH (e.g., upregulation of StAR, CYP11a1, HSD3B1, and CYP19a1), suggesting a dual role of progesterone: it transiently suppresses follicular activity during gestation-like exposure, and then enhances FSH-driven estrogen production after withdrawal, collectively supporting menstrual-cycle recovery.Overall, these findings provide a mechanistic framework linking gestational progesterone dynamics to postpartum menstrual-cycle improvement in PCOS, highlighting progesterone's role as a potential therapeutic agent for PCOS-related menstrual dysfunction. While further studies are needed to address confounding factors like prolactin, this research paves the way for hormone-based strategies mimicking pregnancy effects.

Prescribing daily aspirin at the first prenatal visit to all pregnant patients was associated with an overall reduction in the development of severe preeclampsia, according to new research presented today at the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine (SMFM) 2026 Pregnancy Meeting™.  

Preeclampsia is a serious pregnancy complication that includes persistently high blood pressure and signs of organ damage such as protein in the urine or liver abnormalities. SPE, or preeclampsia with severe features, is a life-threatening pregnancy complication with dangerously high blood pressure and signs of damage to vital organs (liver, kidneys, or brain). Preeclampsia is one of the leading causes of maternal morbidity and mortality worldwide. Hypertensive disorders accounted for 7.7% of all pregnancy-related deaths in the U.S. in 2024, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 

Identification of preeclampsia involves blood pressure and symptom monitoring. Although low-dose aspirin therapy has been shown to help prevent preeclampsia among high-risk patients when started between 12 and 28 weeks of pregnancy, it remains underutilized and thus recent guidelines recommend consideration of universal aspirin use in high-risk pregnant populations. 

To understand the effect of universal aspirin therapy in reducing SPE among a pregnant population with a high rate of preeclampsia, researchers provided 162 mg of daily aspirin to all patients at their first prenatal visit at or before 16-weeks' gestation beginning in August 2022. Importantly, the aspirin was directly dispensed to patients in prenatal clinics to overcome common barriers to medication usage. The researchers compared the outcomes of 18,457 patients who gave birth at Parkland Hospital in Dallas, TX, between 2023 and 2025, after the universal aspirin therapy practice change, to a similar number of patients before the use of aspirin. 

The researchers found that pregnant patients who were given daily aspirin had a 29% lower rate of developing SPE compared with the group who did not receive aspirin. They also found that the patients given aspirin who developed SPE did so later in pregnancy compared to the control group. Patients with preexisting chronic hypertension before pregnancy who were given aspirin were also less likely to develop SPE. The study found no increase in maternal hemorrhage or placental abruption with aspirin therapy. 

Implementation of directly-dispensed aspirin in this high-risk pregnant population appeared to delay the onset, and for some patients completely prevent the development of preeclampsia with severe features. While we cannot be sure that similar effects will be observed in other patient populations, there was no evidence of harm caused by aspirin administration.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","DNA barcoding can be used to track cancer cells in solid and liquid biopsies","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20260211/DNA-barcoding-can-be-used-to-track-cancer-cells-in-solid-and-liquid-biopsies.aspx","Wed, 11 Feb 2026 13:02:00 GMT","

Australian scientists have discovered that DNA barcoding can be used to track cancer cells in solid and liquid biopsies, empowering future research into more reliable breast cancer diagnosis and treatment strategies.

Tumors are composed of different cancer cells that vary in their aggressiveness and sensitivity to treatments, and further research is needed to understand how solid biopsies (from the tumor), or liquid biopsies (from the blood), can capture this diversity.

DNA barcoding technology is a powerful tool to study cancer heterogeneity using lentiviruses to label individual cancer cells with DNA tags. These tags act as barcodes, which can then be tracked and identified in tumor cells and matched biopsies.

Using an optimised DNA barcoding technique, researchers at the Olivia Newton-John Cancer Research Institute (ONJCRI), WEHI and Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre found that tumours in different models shed different amounts of DNA into the bloodstream, even when their cancer cell makeup looks similar.

In a world-first, the team were able to detect the DNA barcodes shed by the primary tumorin blood and plasma samples.

The discovery that DNA tag detectability varies across models, with some showing low recovery even when highly metastatic, indicates that DNA shedding is model-specific and could contribute to false-negative liquid biopsy results.

Dr Antonin Serrano, who undertook the research at ONJCRI and WEHI and is now a Postdoctoral Researcher at the University of Melbourne, shares the key findings from this research:

""DNA barcoding enabled us to investigate entire tumours, solid biopsies and even liquid biopsies. We were then able to accurately quantify how much tumorheterogeneity is captured in biopsies. 

""We found that DNA shedding in the bloodstream varied widely, not only depending on necrosis and tumor burden, but also across preclinical models.

""We also found that barcode diversity in the centre of primary tumors was significantly higher than in the periphery, which could have significant implications for the interpretation of solid biopsies.""

Prof Delphine Merino, Laboratory Head at ONJCRI and senior author of the Molecular Systems Biology paper published today, says:

""Our results suggest that both liquid and solid biopsies are, overall, representative of tumorcomposition, but the results vary between tumours, suggesting that combining both strategies may provide a more accurate representation of the disease.""

Co-senior author and breast cancer clinician Prof Sarah-Jane Dawson, Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, says:

""Liquid biopsies are a non-invasive way to monitor disease progression. This research will help us understand why some tumors are shedding more DNA than others, and could ultimately lead to a better use of liquid biopsies in the clinic.""

In 2025, there were 20,336 new cases of breast cancer diagnosed in Australia, with an estimated 3,353 deaths.

Dr Tom Weber (WEHI) is a co-first author, and Prof Shalin Naik (WEHI) is a co-senior author of the Molecular Systems Biology paper.

In 2016, Poland introduced a nationwide policy eliminating all out-of-pocket costs for prescription drugs prescribed by healthcare professionals to individuals aged 75 and older. A new study published in Health Economics finds that the policy reduced average out-of-pocket medication spending by 23% and cut catastrophic drug expenses by 62%, indicating substantial financial protection during major health shocks.

The financial gains, however, were not evenly distributed. The evidence suggests that higher-income and urban households benefited more, pointing to the possibility that the policy may have unintentionally widened existing financial disparities among older adults.

The study also documents unintended behavioral responses. With lower medication costs and greater insurance against future health shocks, some older adults increased spending on goods such as unhealthy food, alcohol, and cigarettes.

The program reduced financial stress for many older adults, which is good news. But when people feel more insured against health costs, they may change other spending habits in ways that can partially offset the policy's overall impact.""

Studies have reported on survival probabilities of people born with open spina bifida, a condition where the spinal cord and nerves are exposed through an opening in the back. Research published in Developmental Medicine & Child Neurology now provides life expectancies, with results reported by age, sex, and different levels of impairment.

In the study of 1,659 patients with open spina bifida who received support from the California Department of Developmental Services in 1986–2019, survival varied significantly by walking and feeding ability and by bowel/bladder continence.

As an example, at age 5, the life expectancy was 27 additional years for males in the most severely impaired group and 65 years in the least severely impaired, compared with 70 years in the general population. Life expectancies also decreased markedly with age and were modestly lower for males compared with females.

""This is the first long-term study of spina bifida patients to report life expectancies by age, sex, and severity of impairment,"" the authors wrote. ""We hope the results... will aid patients and caregivers alike in the proper planning for and treatment of those living with spina bifida.""

A group-based support program for foster carers significantly improves carer wellbeing, reduces burnout and stress, and strengthens relationships with children in care, while also offering good value for money, finds a new study led by a UCL researcher.

The findings come as the UK has a rising number of children in care, alongside ongoing challenges in recruiting and retaining carers. With the UK government pledging last week to create up to 10,000 new foster care places, the findings provide timely evidence for local authorities, fostering agencies and policymakers seeking effective, evidence-based ways to support and retain carers.

The study evaluated the Reflective Fostering program, developed by experts at Anna Freud, a mental health charity for children and young people. The program is a 10-week group intervention designed to help carers better understand their own emotions and those of the children they care for, and to build stronger relationships.

With weekly three-hour sessions led by two trained facilitators - typically a foster or kinship carer and a social worker - the program focuses on building carers' reflective capacity: the ability to think about thoughts, feelings and behavior in themselves and in the child, particularly in emotionally challenging situations.

For the study, published in the peer-reviewed journal Adoption & Fostering and funded by the National Institute for Health and Care Research, researchers conducted a randomised-controlled trial involving 524 foster carers and kinship carers (family or friends caring for a child when their parents are unable to do so) caring for children aged between four and 13.

Participants were randomly assigned to receive either usual fostering support alone (typically mandatory training and support from an assigned social worker) or usual support plus the Reflective Fostering program, with outcomes assessed at four months and again at 12 months.

The findings show that carers who took part in the program experienced significant and lasting benefits that were sustained a year after joining the study. Compared with carers receiving usual support, those who attended the program showed improved reflective capacity, reduced parental stress, lower levels of burnout and secondary traumatic stress, and improved quality of relationships with the children in their care.

The children in their care continued to show quite high levels of emotional and behavioral difficulties, but it seemed that carers had found ways to manage these situations better.

Children in foster care have some of the poorest outcomes in terms of mental health of all children in the UK, and have often experienced significant trauma. Foster carers play a crucial role in the lives of these children.What this study shows is that when carers are given structured time and space to reflect on their own experiences and on the child's inner world, it can make a meaningful difference to their wellbeing and to the relationship they build with the child.""

Professor Nick Midgley, Lead Author, UCL Psychology & Language Sciences

Dr Karen Irvine (University of Hertfordshire), the trial manager on the study, said: ""While we did not find additional improvements in children's mental health outcomes within the timeframe of this trial, the gains we saw for carers are important in their own right. Improving carers' reflective capacity and reducing burnout may be a necessary foundation for longer-term benefits for children.""

Foster carers in the study entered with high levels of stress, burnout and secondary traumatic stress, reflecting the growing pressures facing the fostering workforce nationally, the researchers found. Supporting carers to manage these pressures may help carers remain in the role for longer and provide more emotionally available care, they say.

The study also included a detailed economic evaluation. The Reflective Fostering program costs were lower than the reduction in overall health and social care costs for carers (and the children in their care) who attended the program. The analysis found a high probability that the program is cost-effective compared to usual support alone.

Professor Midgley added: ""At a time when fostering services are under enormous strain, it's vital to invest in approaches that support carers themselves. This program offers a relatively low-cost way of improving carer wellbeing, which is essential for the sustainability of the care system.""

Professor Eamon McCrory, CEO of Anna Freud and professor at UCL, said: ""The results from this landmark study show how vital it is that foster carers have access to support like the Reflective Fostering program, which was developed by experts from Anna Freud. We knew that the needs of foster carers - who are at high-risk of stress and burn-out - weren't always being met by other programs, which often focus on managing children's behavior. 

""By giving carers the tools to reflect on their own thoughts and feelings, along with how to understand what's happening in the child's mind, they're better equipped to look after themselves and the young person for the long-term.""The skills taught through the program support the important relationship between children in care and their new caregiver. When this connection is strong, trusting and stable, it helps to build a brighter future for children who often have experience of really traumatic events.""

Jackie Tripp, 64, from Leicestershire, became a kinship carer in 2020 to two of her step-grandchildren alongside her husband Keith. She took part in the Reflective Fostering program in 2023.

She said: ""I can honestly say by the time I was offered the course, I was at my lowest ebb. The boys - who were five and 12 at the time - had been through the trauma of being taken away from their mum, followed by the grief of losing her. More than anything, they wanted to be at home - even though it wasn't safe - and had no choice in the matter.""It was the first course I'd been on that focused on how the foster carer themselves could look after their own wellbeing. All of the courses to date had been about the child and, while that's really important, if the foster carer isn't in a good place, the care is going to be even harder. It became such a benefit and gave us so many tools to help us help ourselves, it utterly revolutionised how we care for the boys.""While we still have tricky days, we have so many strategies to support him. He's in Year Six now and doing really well, academically and socially. We're now thinking about mainstream fostering as we've learnt so much and have more room, time and emotional strength to give.""

Get unrivaled matchday access

The U.S. Under-17 Men's National Team will head to Qatar this fall to compete in its record 20th U-17 FIFA World Cup. The team, led by an eight-goal performance from Philadelphia Union II forward Malik Jakupovic, recorded two dominant wins and a hard-fought draw to finish atop Group E in the 2026 Concacaf Qualifiers.

Head coach Alex Aldaz's side began the tournament on a high note by defeating host country St. Vincent and the Grenadines 8-0 last Thursday. California native Aaron Medina scored a first-half hat trick, putting the U.S. on the board six minutes in with a left-footed volley. After forcing an own goal off his deflection, Medina got on the end of two crosses to put the team up 4-0 at halftime. Red Bull New York II Midfielder Paul Sokoloff and Jakupovic both scored braces in the second half to extend the lead.

The second match of the tournament was even more commanding for the U.S., winning 10-0 against St. Kitts and Nevis. It was the second-highest goal total in a single match in the competition's history for the U.S., surpassed only by the 22-0 win over the U.S. Virgin Islands on February 10, 2025.

Jakupovic followed his previous performance with a five-goal outing, four in the run of play and one from the penalty spot. He also assisted forward Matheo Dimareli for the seventh goal of the night. Midfielder Vicente Garcia and defenders Eddie Chadwick and Prince Forfor also got on the scoresheet.

The 10-0 victory put the USA in a strong position at the top of Group E heading into the final matchday. The Dominican Republic had also earned two shutout-wins against St. Vincent and the Grenadines and St. Kitts and Nevis, but the U.S. was ahead on goal differential, needing either a win or draw against the Dominican Republic to secure the berth to the World Cup.

The two sides met on Tuesday in what was a battle until the final whistle. Unsurprisingly, it was Jakupovic who got on the board first with his eighth goal of the tournament. Forward Will Ostrander floated a cross inside the box to Jakupovic, who headed the ball into the bottom corner in the 41st minute. It was Ostrander's team-leading fifth assist of the tournament.

The U.S. lead was short-lived as Dominican Republic's Adiran Garcia equalized three minutes later. The test continued in the second half after defender Astin Mbaye was ejected after a second caution, forcing the U.S. to finish the final 12 minutes with 10 players. The U-17 MNT showed resilience and held on for the 1-1 draw.

Haiti, Panama and Costa Rica joined the U.S. on Tuesday as the other winners of their respective groups to secure qualification. The remaining four group winners will determine the eight Concacaf nations of the 48 teams in the 2026 U-17 FIFA World Cup.

Dates have yet to be announced for the 2026 U-17 FIFA World Cup, which will mark the second year of a five-year period that will see Qatar host the tournament. In the 2025 edition, the U-17 MNT topped Group I, going undefeated in group play while only allowing one goal. The squad advanced to the Round of 32 before falling to Morocco, 4-3 in penalty kicks after a 1-1 draw in regulation.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=men's+us+soccer","U.S. men's soccer World Cup hopeful Noahkai Banks is taking the slow and steady approach","https://www.inquirer.com/soccer/noahkai-banks-usmnt-augsburg-germany-bundesliga-20260211.html","Wed, 11 Feb 2026 14:00:00 GMT","

Though there's no guarantee that he'll make U.S. head coach Mauricio Pochettino's tournament squad, Banks should be squarely on the list of names you'd want to know before the World Cup. Here's why. 

As the clock ticks toward the World Cup, the buzz continues to grow around 19-year-old U.S. national team centerback prospect Noahkai Banks.

Though there's no guarantee yet that he'll make the tournament squad, the attention is warranted. He has played in 16 of the last 17 games for his club, FC Augsburg of Germany's Bundesliga, and has often looked good on the field.

That puts Banks squarely on the list of names you'd want to know before the World Cup, and certainly before the U.S. team's last auditions in March.

He knows it, as he said when he spoke with The Inquirer earlier in the season. This week brought another opportunity to get to know him, as the Bundesliga hosted a roundtable with Banks for U.S. media.

There was much to talk about, starting with his reflections on his one U.S. team camp so far last fall.

“I was pretty nervous when I got into camp because I was 18 years old at the moment,” said Banks, who turned 19 on Dec. 1. “So I thought maybe the older guys will think, ‘Who's that, or what is he doing here?'”

In fact, the opposite happened.

“For example, Tim Ream, the first day in training, he helped me a lot, because he plays in my position,” Banks said of the fellow centerback and frequent U.S. captain. “He has coached me a lot, and helped me to get into the training and into the new tactics — because obviously, it was a big jump. But also, the older guys also had dinner and they said ‘Come, sit at our table.”

Little things like that are a great sign of the strong spirit in the American program.

“Players like [Christian] Pulisic, [Tim] Weah, they helped me a lot,” Banks said, naming two of the Americans' biggest stars. Of others, he said, “how they welcomed me, how they made my life easy, was very cool to be honest.”

It was no surprise that he praised manager Mauricio Pochettino, but how he did so was news.

“He has been a centerback back in the day [as a player], he knows the position very well, and he's helped me with small details like positioning and stuff like this,” Banks said. “Just the small things which make a difference at the highest level. He gave me some tips, and I hope I can do what he told me in the future.”

National team staff has remained in touch with him since then, further raising the odds of a March call-up. But because he hasn't formally committed to the senior U.S. team yet, the Hawai'i native can still switch allegiance to Germany, where he has lived since age 10.

“I've been in touch with Germany before, to be honest,” Banks said, but he “was always very happy with the U.S. You can't tell what happens in the future, but at the moment, there's not a thought of switching or something like this, because I'm happy with the U.S.”

That happiness dates back to playing for various U.S. youth teams, including at the 2023 under-17 World Cup.

“One of the best experiences in my life,” he said. “And then also at [the] u-19 and u-20 level, I was always just very happy to get into camp to see my friends again, because we were a big class of friends. It was not like I [would] go to the national team and play football, it was like I meet my friends and play football with them.”

Banks does not lack for confidence, but he carries it well. 

“To be honest, I was always very confident — I think I have that from my mom,” he said. “So I always believed in myself, and I always believed I can play in the Bundesliga. But I think, also, confidence grows and builds itself up with time and with games.”

Those games have earned the trust of Augsburg's coaching staff, a feat made harder by two managerial changes since last summer. The club has been fighting all season to avoid relegation. It's currently 13th in the 18-team league, but just three standings points into safety.

“It has been a great year so far, because I didn't expect to play that much, to be absolutely honest with you,” Banks said. “But yeah, the coaches have given me a lot of trust, a lot of minutes. So [over] time, as I said before, I got more confident with the team, with my teammates, with the players, with the tactics.”

Family matters a lot to him, too. He is close with his mother Nadine, whose own athletic genes earned her a shot at college basketball before repeat tears to her ACL derailed it. She moved Banks to Germany after separating from his father, settling in a Bavarian mountain town just over an hour from Augsburg.

“I think it's easy to stay grounded, because I have a great family behind me,” the son said. “And also the club doesn't allow [otherwise], because my teammates are all very grounded and very humble. It's like a big family here.”

Then he added a flourish that far-away Philadelphia would appreciate: “Also, my mom would kick my [butt] if I'm not grounded anymore, so there's no chance of that.”

Nor is there a chance of Banks looking too far ahead — as in, to the World Cup — before Augsburg's season is settled.

“As I said a lot of times before, I think it's not the right moment to think about the World Cup for me, because we have a lot of games left here,” he said. “So really just focus. A lot of players say it, but I really mean it: I really just focus on the games we have here. And yeah, then let's see what happens in summer.”","{'href': 'https://www.inquirer.com', 'title': 'Inquirer.com'}","soccer"

Tottenham Hotspur have reportedly billed Mauricio Pochettino as their “ideal new manager” after bringing an abrupt end to Thomas Frank's tenure but it would take a “huge,” potentially record-breaking compensation fee to extract the U.S. men's national team head coach from his contract before this summer's World Cup.

Pochettino's deal runs until the conclusion of the tournament which will be co-hosted by the United States, Canada and Mexico. All 17 months of Pochettino's reign for the USMNT have been explicitly geared towards the global jamboree on home soil, yet he has made little secret of his desire to return to club management.

Several members of the Tottenham board are said to “still admire” Pochettino and want to appoint him “immediately,” according to The Independent. However, that will come at a cost.

When the prospect of Pochettino's terms first being broken were raised last year, BBC Sport quoted a source within the United States Soccer Federation who claimed that it would take “one of the biggest financial compensation fees in football history” for any team to pry the 53-year-old away.

Tottenham are no strangers to splashing the cash on a coaching hire. The acquisition of Thomas Frank and his fleet of backroom staff from Brentford cost £6.7 million ($9.2 million). However, it would reportedly take more than triple that sum to secure Pochettino's services.

The lucrative terms of the deal which the former Paris Saint-Germain and Chelsea boss agreed with the USSF is thought to earn him an annual salary of £4.6 million. It also comes with a buyout clause valued in the same region as the £21.7 million Bayern Munich paid for Julian Nagelsmann in 2021.

The most expensive managerial appointment in Premier League history belongs to Chelsea, who spent roughly £21.5 million on getting Graham Potter out of Brighton & Hove Albion in 2022. The revered tactician got a sharp haircut and bought a turtleneck jumper but managed to torch his reputation during a disastrous 31-game stint. Without even taking his salary into consideration, that's about £700,000 per match.

Pochettino has made his position abundantly apparent. “I would like one day to come back,” the former Spurs boss bluntly told Sky Sports last March. 

“Look, when I left the club I always remember one interview I said I would like one day to come back to Tottenham and that is of course...” he trailed off. “I am in the USA, I am not going to ... no, I'm not going to talk about that, but what I said then still after six years or five years, I still feel in my heart that, yes, I would like one day to come back.”

This overt stance on returning to N17 was undoubtedly linked to the presence of Daniel Levy, the club's former chairman who Pochettino still has a “very good relationship” with. However, Levy was relieved of his duties back in September, paving the way for a new-look leadership group without any obvious ties to the USMNT boss.

That hasn't stopped Pochettino pining after the Premier League.

As recently as December, the Argentine coach opened himself up to a return to club management in England. “The Premier League is the best in the world,” he gushed. “Of course I miss it. I am so happy in the USA, but I am always thinking about returning one day. It is the most competitive league, and of course I would love to come back again.”

For all the public flirting, Pochettino is said to be “fully committed” to the USMNT, per BBC Sport.

USMNT head coach Pochettino emerges as early Spurs favorite, raising major questions ahead of the United States' home World Cup this summer.

Tottenham Hotspur have fired manager Thomas Frank following Tuesday's 2-1 home loss to Newcastle United. The former Brentford coach leaves the club after just eight months in charge, ending a brief and turbulent spell in North London. USMNT head coach Mauricio Pochettino has quickly emerged as the early favorite to replace him.

Roberto De Zerbi, Robbie Keane, Ruben Amorim and Oliver Glasner have also been linked with the vacancy. However, Pochettino has moved to the front of the line as speculation builds over a possible return to the club he once led to a Champions League final.

Pochettino previously managed Tottenham from May 2014 to November 2019, overseeing one of the most successful periods in the club's modern history.

What this means for the U.S. men's national team remains unclear. The Argentine is currently preparing to lead the United States into a home World Cup this summer, one of the most highly anticipated tournaments in program history.

Pochettino has previously spoken of his desire to return to the Premier League at some point in his career, although there is no indication whether he would be interested in taking the Tottenham job, either immediately or after the World Cup. Still, reports suggest he will at least be considered as Spurs search for their next manager.

With the World Cup on the horizon and Tottenham in transition, the timing of any potential move could prove crucial for both club and country.

One thing that should work in the United States Soccer Federation's favor, according to a BBC source, is that Spurs would have to pay “one of the biggest financial compensation fees in football history” if they were to appoint Pochettino. That is believed to be somewhere in the region of £20 million ($27.4 million), which may put the Premier League club off. 

Frank leaves Tottenham 16th in the Premier League table, only five points clear of the relegation zone. Under the German, Spurs won only two of 13 home league fixtures, creating a toxic atmosphere in recent games at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. 

They did, however, qualify automatically for the Champions League round of 16, finishing fourth in the league phase, ahead of Barcelona, Manchester City and Real Madrid.

On February 11, 2023, Real Madrid was crowned world champion after defeating Al Hilal 5-3 in the final.

Three years ago, Real Madrid achieved its eighth Club World Cup victory in history. The win took place at the Prince Moulay Abdellah stadium in Rabat, which hosted the semifinal against Egypt's Al Ahly (1-4) and the final against Saudi Arabia's Al Hilal (5-3). In the title match, Vini Jr. and Valverde each scored a brace, while Benzema was the other madridista scorer. In the first match of this edition, the goals were scored by Vini Jr., Valverde, Rodrygo, and Arribas.

After the final, Vini Jr. was named the best player of the tournament for his outstanding performance in both matches. With the Intercontinental Cup won in 2024, Real Madrid has been crowned world champions on nine occasions, creating an unmatched record.

La Liga

The waving of white hankies originated in Spanish bullfighting Burak Akbulut/Anadolu via Getty Images

Real Madrid supporters venting their fury at recent poor performances have been echoing a centuries-old practice that originated in Spanish bullfighting.

During a La Liga game against Levante at the Bernabeu on January 17, thousands of white handkerchiefs were waved aloft by Madrid fans as a public show of protest against their club's players, coach, and president.

The collective outpouring of anger followed the previous week's painful Supercopa de Espana final defeat by Clasico rivals Barcelona in Saudi Arabia, and a humiliating Copa del Rey exit at second-division Albacete.

On their return to their home ground, Madrid's players — especially Vinicius Junior, Jude Bellingham and Federico Valverde — were regularly whistled, while there were also jeers for new coach Alvaro Arbeloa, as well as chants calling for long-serving president Florentino Perez to resign, even as the team beat relegation-threatened Levante 2-0.

¡EL BERNABÉU EXPLOTÓ EN SILBIDOS! ⚪️💥

Los hinchas del Real Madrid demostraron su disconformidad con el equipo al término del primer tiempo.

— DSPORTS (@DSports) January 17, 2026


The most visually arresting part of the display was seeing the super-modern remodelled stadium covered in a sea of white, in a communal gesture reflecting back to before the sport of football was codified and professionalised.

Spanish sports historian Angel Iturriaga says the practice of waving the white handkerchiefs, in its original context, was actually a way of showing appreciation.

“It comes from bullfighting, which from the 18th century well into the 20th century was the most popular mass spectacle in Spain,” he tells The Athletic.

“Spectators who felt a bullfighter had performed well waved white handkerchiefs to ask for him to receive the (dead bull's) ear, or two ears, or even a tail, which is the highest honour.”

As football became Spain's most popular mass spectacle in the 1950s, with superstars Alfredo di Stefano, Ferenc Puskas and Paco Gento helping Madrid to win the first five European Cups, supporters attracted from the bullring to the stadium brought the practice — known as a panolada — with them.

“Football fans originally waved their handkerchiefs to show their appreciation of a great play, or especially a great goal,” Iturriaga says.

“When I went with my father in the 1980s, he always had a handkerchief ready to take out. But in football, unlike bullfighting, it was also used to protest a bad game by the players, or we want to get rid of the coach, or we're against the board. Or, very often in Spain, against the referees. These panoladas are usually accompanied by whistles.”

Alfredo Relano, former editor of Madrid-based sports newspaper Diario AS and the author of 10 books about Spanish football, tells The Athletic that white handkerchiefs were first waved at the Bernabeu in recognition of an outstanding piece of play, but over time have become more commonly used when something is going wrong.

“I remember a panolada at the Bernabeu in November 1964 when Amancio (Amaro) dribbled all the way up the pitch and scored a really great goal against Barcelona,” Relano says.

“But it is generally more as a protest when the fans are unhappy with how things are going. There were very strong panoladas during Miguel Munoz's final years as coach (in the early 1970s), when the team was doing badly.”

In the mid-20th century, most Spaniards carried a white cloth handkerchief in their pocket, but that is less commonly the case these days. Today's supporters may have rummaged in drawers at home to find one to bring to the stadium, while others used a white match programme or tissues.

It is not something unique to Real Madrid. Panoladas can happen at many clubs across Spain. Barcelona fans waved white handkerchiefs in protest during current president Joan Laporta's first term in charge in 2008. Recent weeks have also seen similar protests from supporters at Athletic Club's San Mames and Valencia's Mestalla.

However, panoladas remain most identified with the Bernabeu, whose stands are filled with Spanish capital residents used to experiencing the best in all areas of their lives, according to Relano.

“Panoladas do not happen just at Real Madrid, but it's true that at Madrid you see them more,” Relano says. “Madrid fans are the most demanding and the quickest to show their discontent. They come from the capital city, they're used to the best bulls, the best opera, the best of everything.”

Real Madrid are one of just four Spanish professional football clubs owned by their socio members (along with Barcelona, Athletic Club, and Osasuna). Bernabeu patrons especially believe they are not passive spectators, but active participants in the event, with a responsibility to demand the highest standards of players and executives who work for them. Often, panoladas come not when the team lacks talent, but when players do not show the required commitment and dedication.

“The Real Madrid fan at the Bernabeu feels himself part of the spectacle, just like at the bullfight,” Relano says.

“They have the right to judge what they are being offered. Fan anger erupts not just because the team has lost a particular game, but because the players, or the club, are lacking honour and dignity.”

That idea of Madrid fans seeing themselves as the ultimate protectors of their club's honour was present during the recent Bernabeu protests. Among those whistled most loudly were the players who supporters believed had not been fully supportive of their former coach, Xabi Alonso. Perez was also targeted, having allowed media speculation over the coach's future for months.

“There was an idea that the players had torpedoed their coach, while the club hierarchy had circulated rumours about him being sacked,” Relano says.

“Someone they viewed as a good person was publicly tortured in an ugly way. That was why the panolada was so strong. And the whistles for the players viewed as most guilty: Valverde, Bellingham and Vinicius. And the shouts of ‘Florentino, resign'.”

The panolada against Levante also came soon after club president Perez proposed a historic change to the club's ownership structure. This would allow private investment for the first time, making some Madrid socios worry their power will be diluted.

“The atmosphere at La Liga stadiums, Madrid and Barcelona above all, has changed, with so many tourists these days,” Relano says.

“But the protests were very strong, due to a feeling that ownership of the club is being taken away from the socios. Florentino might believe the whistles were for the players, but the shouts of ‘Florentino Out' would affect him.”

Panoladas often draw immediate responses. After the game against Levante, Madrid's next match at the Bernabeu was a 6-1 Champions League victory over Monaco, and they followed that with an impressive victory at fourth-placed Villarreal in La Liga.

However, Arbeloa's side then slumped to an embarrassing 4-2 defeat in their final Champions League group game at Benfica on January 28. That was followed by more whistles and handkerchiefs during a home game against Rayo Vallecano, when Madrid needed a stoppage-time Kylian Mbappe penalty to beat opponents who ended the game with nine players.

“A panolada, and such loud whistles, usually provokes a reaction from the players,” Relano says.

“But if the ingredients are not there (players for a good team), or there is not a good team spirit, it usually does not last very long.

“Also, players now live in an ivory tower — they no longer bump into fans in a restaurant, or even talk to journalists. So maybe the fans' protests affect them less.”

Acting director Todd Lyons called ICE ‘key' to security

2026 World Cup takes place this summer in 11 US cities

The acting director of US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) told a congressional committee on Tuesday that his agency is a “key part of the overall security apparatus for the World Cup” and refused to commit to pausing operations near games at this summer's tournament.

The 2026 World Cup will be hosted this summer by the United States, Mexico, and Canada, with 78 of the 104 games taking place in the US. Various entities have estimated that up to 10 million people could visit the 11 US host cities for the quadrennial tournament. However, ICE's role in Donald Trump's immigration crackdown – including an extended and widespread operation in the Minneapolis/Saint Paul metropolitan area in which two people were killed by federal agents – has raised serious concerns among fans.

Speaking before the House committee on homeland security, Todd Lyons was testifying publicly for the first time since the deaths of those two Minnesotans, Alex Pretti and Renee Good. Towards the end of a hearing marked by verbal sparring with Democratic representatives, Lyons faced questioning from Representative Nellie Pou, who represents New Jersey's ninth district. Pou's district includes East Rutherford's MetLife Stadium, the site of the World Cup final and seven other games, including England's group-stage finale v Panama.

After saying that visitors' “confidence is plummeting and jeopardizing the World Cup”, Pou asked Lyons if ICE would commit to pausing operations around Fifa events.

“ICE, specifically Homeland Security Investigations, is a key part of the overall security apparatus for the World Cup,” Lyons said. “We are dedicated to securing that operation and we are dedicated to the security of all of our participants as well as visitors.”

Pou responded: “You realize that if [fans] feel they are going to be wrongfully incarcerated, wrongfully pulled out, that is going to hurt this entire process? I hope you realize that.”

Lyons responded by saying that “ICE is dedicated to ensuring everyone who visits the facilities will have a safe and secure event.”

In his opening remarks, Lyons said ICE arrested 379,000 people in the last year, of whom 8,400 were known or suspected gang members or terrorists. Federal data has shown that the majority of people arrested by ICE do not have criminal history.

The actions of ICE, along with other US foreign policy moves, have resulted in limited calls for a boycott of the tournament.

As early as last year, World Cup host city CEOs expressed concern about the “uncertainty” they said would arise from Trump's immigration crackdown.

ICE's involvement in international sporting events has also been under the microscope at the Winter Olympics in Italy. Protests in Milan over the agency's role at the Games have drawn thousands of participants.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","soccer"

ICE agents in Minneapolis

The acting head of US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has told a congressional committee that the agency is ""a key part of the overall security apparatus for the World Cup"" when asked if he would pause operations for this summer's tournament.

Todd Lyons and other senior officials were questioned by lawmakers on the House committee on homeland security after ICE agents shot and killed two American citizens as part of US President Donald Trump's immigration crackdown in Minneapolis.

The deaths of Alex Pretti and Renee Good sparked outrage across the country.

Representative Nellie Pou - who represents New Jersey's ninth district, which includes the MetLife Stadium where the World Cup final will be played - asked Lyons, external if ICE would commit to pausing operations around matches and other Fifa events. 

She claimed that visitors' confidence was ""plummeting and jeopardising the World Cup"".

Lyons responded by insisting that ICE was ""dedicated to securing that operation, and we are dedicated to the security of all of our participants as well as visitors.""

Pou said: ""You realise that if [fans] feel they are going to be wrongfully incarcerated, wrongfully pulled out, that is going to hurt this entire process?""

""Yes ma'am, and ICE is dedicated to ensuring that everyone that visits the facilities will have a safe and secure event,"" replied Lyons.

Both US citizens, Good and Pretti were each shot multiple times during enforcement operations.

Their deaths - and ICE's broader action - caused outrage in Minneapolis where some 3,000 agents were deployed at Trump's direction to crack down on illegal immigration.

Some of those agents have since left the city.

Last month fan group Football Supporters Europe (FSE) told BBC Sport it was ""extremely concerned by the ongoing militarisation of police forces in the US"" before this summer's World Cup in North America. 

The European Democratic Party (EDP) also said it may ask national football federations to consider pulling out of the tournament if safety guarantees are not forthcoming.

Fifa has said the safety and security of fans and participants is its ""top priority"", adding it works closely with local authorities ""to plan, co-ordinate and deliver comprehensive security measures for the tournament"".

The US is due to host 78 matches across 11 cities, with co-hosts Canada and Mexico hosting 13 matches each.

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents will form a “key part” of the security at this year's men's World Cup, its director has said.

Todd Lyons, ICE's acting director, was responding to a question from Democrat Nellie Pou before a panel in the House of Representatives.

Pou is a representative of the ninth district of New Jersey, which includes East Rutherford's MetLife Stadium. Eight tournament games will be held at the 82,500-capacity venue, including the final and six group matches — with England against Panama.

“ICE, specifically homeland security investigations, is a key part of the overall security apparatus for the World Cup,” Lyons said Tuesday. “We're dedicated to securing that operation and to ensuring the safety of all participants and visitors.”

ICE, which is split into two sectors, commonly provides intelligence and security at international sporting events.

ICE agents are in attendance at this month's Milan Cortina Olympics in Italy, but do not have the authority to conduct enforcement operations outside the United States and will not attempt to do so, officials have said. Their presence at the Games has still led to protests in Milan.

Pou told Lyons that the presence of ICE would be detrimental to the tournament.

“You realize that if (fans) feel they are going to be wrongfully incarcerated, wrongfully pulled out, that is going to hurt this entire process?” Pou asked. “I hope you realize that.”

In response, Lyons said: “ICE is dedicated to ensuring everyone who visits the facilities will have a safe and secure event.”

It was the first time Lyons was testifying at a hearing since the killings of Renee Good and Alex Pretti by U.S. federal agents in Minneapolis last month. ICE had previously drawn intense scrutiny during the administration of President Donald Trump over increasing crackdowns in various cities, including Minneapolis.

Those events, coupled with Trump's recent threats to take over Greenland, have led to suggestions of a boycott of the FIFA-run competition.

The tournament is being co-hosted by the United States, Canada and Mexico but 78 of the 104 matches will be staged in the United States.

Last week, Atlanta Mayor Andre Dickens spoke of his hope that ICE's presence would be “unnoticeable” and “maybe nonexistent” during the tournament. Atlanta will host eight games in the tournament, including one semifinal.

Dickens added that as soon as any federal law enforcement activity became known to the city, his administration would notify the public and businesses.

“We will make sure we get as much heads-up as possible, so that small businesses and large businesses — and citizens — will get ample information from us about what to expect (and) how to maintain your own dignity and rights,” he said, adding that he wants fans to enjoy the tournament “despite somebody's presence that I'm not inviting to come.”

The tournament will take place from June 11 to July 19, with 11 of the 16 host cities in the United States.

Inter Milan star Ange-Yoan Bonny has decided to represent the Ivory Coast instead of his native France.

According to Ivorian journalist Sanh Séverin via FCInterNews, the 22-year-old has made up his mind ahead of March's international window.

Despite featuring for France across several youth levels, most recently the U-21s, Bonny won't join the senior squad.

Indeed, the 22-year-old striker has made two appearances for the ‘Little Blues' without finding the net.

According to Séverin, Ivory Coast boss Emerse Fae could have Ange-Yoan Bonny at his disposal as early as March.

Meanwhile, the former Parma center-forward seemed destined to play for France one day.

After progressing through multiple youth levels, a senior call-up appeared to be the logical next step.

However, Bonny, who has tallied seven goals and six assists for Inter this season, has other plans.

Instead, he is ready to accept the Ivory Coast's call-up and be part of the team that will compete at the FIFA World Cup next summer.

DALLAS — The third ticket draw phase for World Cup tickets – Random Selection Phase – ended over the weekend, and those who were lucky enough to be approved were notified by Monday. 

As WFAA had previously reported, the chances of being approved were slim to none – less than 1% – so if you got an approval message, congratulations! For those (most) of us who didn't, we got an email notifying us that the application had been rejected. So, what's next for those who haven't been selected through the first three ticket phases? 

The number of opportunities is getting slimmer as time passes. If you got a rejection email, there was a message signaling the next (and final) opportunity to get tickets without heading to the astronomical prices on the resale market.

There will be one final window called the Last-Minute Sales Phase. According to FIFA's website, this phase will begin in early April. This phase will be a ""first-come, first-served basis, and purchases will be processed as real-time transactions, subject to availability."" 

This phase will not be a lottery as the previous ones were, but a mad dash to buy whatever tickets are left on the market. The big unknown here is how many tickets – and also which tickets – will be available to buy. WFAA has asked FIFA for comment about what tickets will be available in the Last Minute Sales Phase. In response, a FIFA spokesperson told WFAA there were no updates to share at this time and more information would be released in the coming weeks.

Through the first two draws – the Visa exclusive presale and Early Ticket Draw – FIFA said 2 million tickets had been sold. There will be approximately 6 million tickets sold for the entire tournament, according to FIFA. FIFA said over 500 million requests were submitted in the Random Selection Phase, but it is still unclear how many tickets were sold in the third phase.

FIFA has sold, on average, 1 million tickets per draw period. If that trend holds, and FIFA withheld tickets again, there would be approximately half of the tournament's (3 million) left to buy in the Last Minute Sales Phase.

The Last-Minute Sales Phase will be the last opportunity to buy tickets at face value. After that, you'll have to look at the resale market, either on FIFA's official resale platform or third-party resale sites such as StubHub, SeatGeek, Ticketmaster, etc. FIFA has said the only way to fully guarantee your ticket is legitimate is by buying through FIFA's resale platform, but in the U.S. and Canada, it is legal to purchase tickets on third-party platforms. 

If you end up resorting to the resale market, though, it will be significantly more expensive. 

Per Ticketdata.com, the cheapest get-in price for a match in Dallas-Fort Worth is $498, with the most expensive being $2,182 for the semifinal match, as of this writing. The prices on this page are fluid and update as the market changes. The cheapest ticket on the resale market is Cape Verde vs. Saudi Arabia in Houston at $211. The most expensive ticket, surprise surprise, is the World Cup Final in New York/New Jersey, with a get-in price of $8,364.","{'href': 'https://www.wfaa.com', 'title': 'WFAA'}","soccer"

Manchester City's social media account has brutally mocked viral Manchester United fan 'The United Strand' after his side failed to beat West Ham, extending his 16-month wait for a haircut. Frank Ilett, the man behind the persona, had vowed not to trim his locks until United won five consecutive games, but a 1-1 draw at the London Stadium saw him fall agonisingly short.

City's official US social media account wasted no time in rubbing salt into the wounds of United supporters following their 1-1 draw with West Ham on Tuesday night. While the result was a setback for Michael Carrick's side, it was personally devastating for content creator Ilett - known online as 'The United Strand' - whose viral challenge to grow his hair until United won five games in a row is set to drag on.

Moments after the full-time whistle confirmed that United's winning run had halted at four matches, the @ManCityUS account posted a photo of star striker Erling Haaland with his long blonde hair flowing down his shoulders. The caption was simple but cutting: ""Nothing wrong with growing out your hair.""

The context behind the trolling dates back to October 2024. Ilett, a 29-year-old United fan, pledged that he would not cut his hair until United managed to string together five consecutive victories in all competitions. What initially seemed like a manageable task turned into a marathon ordeal as the club struggled for consistency under previous management.

Heading into Tuesday's clash at the London Stadium, the finish line was finally in sight. United had won four games on the bounce under interim boss Carrick, defeating City, Arsenal, Fulham and Tottenham, meaning a victory over the Hammers would have allowed Ilett to visit a barber for the first time in nearly 500 days.

Thousands of viewers tuned into his ""watchalong"" livestream, expecting to see the challenge finally completed. Instead, they witnessed a rollercoaster of emotions that ended in despair. ""It was a strange game,"" Ilett told his viewers, visibly deflated as the final whistle blew. The challenge now resets to zero, meaning he faces the prospect of many more months with his flowing locks unless United can find a sudden burst of consistent form.

The match itself was a gritty affair that highlighted the difficulties Carrick faces in his temporary role. United arrived in the capital full of confidence but were met by a resolute West Ham side fighting for their Premier League lives. The Hammers defended in a disciplined low block that frustrated the visitors' attacking talents for long periods, denying Ilett the celebration he had planned for months.

The deadlock was broken early in the second half when Tomas Soucek ghosted into the box to finish a Jarrod Bowen cross, stunning the travelling support and sending Ilett into a silence on his stream. United laboured in search of a response, with Carrick throwing on substitutes in a desperate bid to keep the winning streak alive.

Benjamin Sesko's late intervention salvaged a point and kept Carrick's unbeaten record intact, but for The United Strand, a draw was as good as a defeat. The point did little to comfort Ilett, whose hair has now become a visual symbol of United's inability to string together a dominant run of form over the last two seasons.

City were not the only European giant to take a swipe at the fan's misfortune. Bayern Munich's English language account also spotted the opportunity for engagement, replying to the saga with a cheeky post of their own.

""There's still time to become an FC Bayern fan,"" the German club tweeted, accompanied by a scissor emoji, playfully suggesting that switching allegiance to the Bundesliga champions might be the quickest route to a trim.

Even Carrick had been aware of the stakes heading into the game. In his pre-match press conference, the United boss admitted his children had told him about the challenge. ""I can say I'm aware of it, yeah. My kids have made me aware of it,"" Carrick said. Unfortunately for Ilett, the manager's awareness didn't translate into the fifth win required to end the saga.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Chelsea talisman Cole Palmer somehow managed to miss a golden chance to score a late winner for the Blues against Leeds on Tuesday in the Premier League. The visitors came back from 2-0 down to secure a point against Liam Rosenior's side, but it could have been a different story if Palmer had managed to find the back of the net in stoppage time at Stamford Bridge.

Chelsea looked set to take all three points against Leeds after racing into a 2-0 lead after an opening goal from Joao Pedro and a Palmer penalty. However, the Whites fought back thanks to efforts from Lukas Nmecha and Noah Okafor to make it 2-2. Palmer then passed up an incredible chance to win it in stoppage time with an unbelievable miss. The 23-year-old arrived at the far post and looked set to convert a low cross but could only blaze over the crossbar.

Sky Sports pundit Paul Merson couldn't believe his eyes, he said: ""No! Palmer has just missed from two yards! He's still standing in the goal with his mouth open, he cannot believe he has just missed. I can't believe what I've just seen, wow. He couldn't do that again if he tried, I cannot believe what I've just watched.""

Manager Liam Rosenior was quizzed on Palmer's miss after the game and told reporters: ""He's in the position, 999 times out of 1000, he scores, it was just that one in that moment. We shouldn't be in that position. The game should be done at 2-0. I need to show the players certain things to make sure that doesn't happen again.""

The Chelsea boss also spoke of his disappointment at failing to win the game, adding: ""Genuinely, I can't remember Leeds having a shot or moment in the game [prior to Nmecha's goal]. Some of our football in possession, in press, in energy, was everything that I wanted to see and that makes it even more of a bitter pill to swallow that we lost the game. I was frustrated after the second goal with a couple of things that I'll show the players on why the momentum of the game changed. That's a team thing. If we can just focus and concentrate for 90 minutes, this team has unbelievable potential, which you saw for probably 90% of the game today. I'm a month in, I feel like I already know what we need to work on to improve that. It's making sure we get the time to do it.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:goal.com","From Roberto De Zerbi to Gareth Southgate: Thomas Frank's potential successors as Tottenham Hotspur manager","https://www.goal.com/en-ca/lists/next-tottenham-manager-mauricio-pochettino-oliver-glasner-top-candidates-replace-sacked-thomas-frank-permanent-basis-ranked/blt9007cf4d5416d58c","Wed, 11 Feb 2026 13:06:10 GMT","

Thomas Frank is gone! The morning after a terrible night before, Tottenham Hotspur announced that the Dane had been relieved of his duties as head coach - to nobody's great surprise. Tuesday evening's 2-1 loss at home to fellow underperformers Newcastle extended Tottenham's winless run in the Premier League to eight games - a rotten run of results that has seen them plummet to 16th in the standings.

The immediate question now, of course, is who will succeed Frank at the helm? The expectation is that assistant manager John Heitinga will take over on an interim basis, although two-time former caretaker coach Ryan Mason is obviously also being linked with the role after recently parting company with West Bromwich Albion.

However, there is no shortage of candidates to become Tottenham's next permanent boss, either at the end of the season or even before the club's next Premier League fixture, against Arsenal, on February 22.

So, who's most likely to be Frank's long-term replacement? GOAL rates and ranks all of the supposed contenders below...

Shortly after Tottenham slumped to defeat at home to Newcastle on Tuesday night, Como reached the semi-finals of the Coppa Italia for the first time since 1986 with a penalty shootout win over Serie A champions Napoli at the Stadio Diego Armando Maradona. It was an historic achievement that hammered home why Cesc Fabregas is being talked about as one of Europe's next great managers.

The Spaniard should, therefore, be on Tottenham's shortlist to succeed Frank - particularly when you take into account that Fabregas also has Como riding high in sixth place in Serie A. However, we can't see Cesc at Spurs - and for a couple of reasons.

Firstly, Fabregas is a former Arsenal and Chelsea midfielder. Secondly, and far more significantly, when he does leave Como, it will be for a bigger club than Tottenham. Fabregas really is that highly rated right now. He turned down Inter last summer and we'd expect him to give Spurs even shorter shrift if they came calling now too.

It was reported that Spurs contacted Gareth Southgate about potentially succeeding Jose Mourinho as manager all the way back in 2021, so there is a possibility that they might still be interested in the former England manager.

Southgate obviously hasn't worked since leaving the Three Lions after the Euro 2024 final defeat but he remains a revered character within the English game and the fact that he'd be able to take over immediately is undeniably a huge plus.

There is a growing suspicion, though, that the 55-year-old may never return to management, after admitting only last November that he's in no rush to do so. So, while Southgate would certainly be a popular appointment, it seems unlikely that if he does decide to work again he'd choose cleaning up the mess that is Spurs as his next job.

Could we see Ruben Amorim make a rapid return to the Premier League? The bookmakers certainly think it's a possibility, with the former Manchester United manager the sixth-favourite to fill the void left by Frank.

Clearly, Amorim can't be discounted. For starters, he's available immediately. Secondly, before his torturous tenure at Old Trafford, he was regarded as one of the most promising young coaches in the European game due to the remarkable work he'd done in restoring Sporting CP to their former glory.

However, we struggle to see the supporters getting behind the potential appointment of Amorim, who now has serious Andre Villas-Boas vibes about him.

Add GOAL.com as a preferred source on Google to see more of our reporting

Enzo Maresca was sacked as Chelsea coach less than six weeks ago but the Italian's reputation hasn't been unduly affected by his axing, as it's clear that his exit was about far more than a dodgy run of results. Indeed, Maresca essentially talked himself out of a job quite deliberately by publicly lamenting a perceived lack of support behind the scenes at Stamford Bridge - and there was plenty of sympathy for a manager who had won both the Conference League and the Club World Cup amid the constant comings and goings in west London.

It was perhaps inevitable, then, that Maresca would be mentioned as a possible replacement for Frank at Spurs, but it seems a long shot right now - particularly as Pep Guardiola's former assistant is reportedly in the running to take over at Etihad whenever the Catalan decides to step down.

Michael Carrick is presently doing his utmost to convince Manchester United to give him the top job at Old Trafford on a permanent basis - and he's making a fine fist of it so far.

The interim boss may not have been able to extend his winning start to five games at West Ham on Tuesday night but the Red Devils remain undefeated on his watch and looking very good indeed to qualify for next season's Champions League.

Were he to achieve that objective, which looked like a long shot under predecessor Ruben Amorim, Sir Jim Ratcliffe & Co. may well decide to stick with Carrick.

However, if they were to go with a more proven coach, regardless of the results between now and the end of the season, Spurs could conceivably move for Carrick, who is obviously a former Tottenham player.

At present, though, there are too many variables at play for the ex-England international to be labelled a frontrunner. Indeed, he's more of a potential dark horse right now.

Robbie Keane certainly wouldn't have any issue getting the fans behind him at Tottenham. The Irishman is a club legend, having scored 122 goals and won a League Cup across two spells with Spurs. 

Keane has also made a promising start to his coaching career, winning league titles with both Maccabi Tel Aviv and current club Ferencvaros, whom he has also led into the play-off round of the Europa League thanks in no small part to a very satisfying win over Rangers for the ex-Celtic forward.

Obviously, there would be concerns over the fact that Keane has yet to manage at the very highest level but the Republic of Ireland's all-time leading goal-scorer knows Spurs inside out and would undoubtedly jump at the opportunity to return to the club as coach.

Glasner is definitely going to end up at one of the Premier League's top teams sooner or later. The Austrian has taken English football by storm since succeeding Roy Hodgson as Crystal Palace manager in February 2024. After leading the Eagles to their best-ever points haul (49), he bettered that tally in his first full season at Selhurst Park (53), while at the same time ending the club's 120-year wait for a trophy by masterminding a stunning 1-0 win over the mighty Manchester City in the final of the FA Cup.

Glasner is also out of contract at the end of the season, and may even leave Selhurst Park before then, given the strained nature of his relationship with his employers. However, that tension is the very reason why Spurs might steer clear of the 51-year-old, who, as he openly admits himself, is never afraid to speak his mind. There's also widespread speculation that Glasner is eyeing up a summer move to Manchester...

Is Fulham's Marco Silva going to get a second chance at one of England's biggest clubs? The former Hull City and Watford boss lasted just one season at Everton all the way back in 2018-19 but he's since rebuilt his reputation as a very accomplished coach at Craven Cottage.

With his attractive style of play and ability to improve players, Silva should certainly be in the running for the Spurs job. His contract expires at the end of the season and, just last season, he led Fulham to a record-breaking Premier League points haul (54).

So, while it still feels like Silva is more of an outsider at this particular point in time, plenty of people would dearly love to see what he could do with a stronger squad and more money at his disposal.

Another top job has become available in the Premier League, so the name of Andoni Iraola is once again being bandied about - which is funny in one way, given the Spaniard was a complete unknown to English football fans when he arrived at the Vitality Stadium in the summer of 2023.

However, Iraola recently being tipped to replace Enzo Maresca at Chelsea, and now Frank at Spurs, makes perfect sense, as he's established himself as one of the best coaches in the top flight after twice leading the Cherries to club-record points hauls. 

Bournemouth are also one of the more exciting sides to watch in England and that's in spite of the fact that Iraola has had to deal with the sale of several key players over the past couple of seasons.

The Basque, then, has an awful lot going in his favour. He'd likely get Spurs playing the kind of football the fans want to see, while at the same time making the best out of the resources at his disposal. For those two reasons alone, he's a decent outside bet.

Xavi has rather surprisingly been out of a job since being dismissed in incredibly disrespectful fashion by Barcelona 18 months ago. Remember, the Blaugrana icon led the Catalans to La Liga glory in 2022-23 only to be disgracefully messed about by club president Joan Laporta during the final few months of a difficult second season.

Xavi has been linked with several high-profile positions in the interim, including a few in England, so it's not in the least bit surprising that he's considered one of the frontrunners for the vacancy at Spurs. 

Someone is eventually going to give one of the finest midfielders in football history another job - and it might well be Spurs, given Xavi has a more flexible footballing philosophy than his Barca upbringing suggests, and is also widely regarded as a humble and composed character. Also, if Tottenham got themselves out of relegation trouble, the World Cup winner certainly wouldn't have any issues attracting players to the club.

Mauricio Pochettino was linked with the Tottenham job last summer, after the dismissal of Ange Postecoglou, but the timing obviously wasn't right, with the Argentine under contract to the United State's men's national team until the conclusion of the 2026 World Cup. However, the path has now been cleared for Pochettino to return for a second stint at Spurs immediately after this summer's finals.

The 53-year-old would obviously be welcomed back with open arms by the Tottenham faithful. During his spell in charge between 2014 and 2019, Spurs never failed to finish outside the Premier League's top five, while they also reached their first Champions League final, in 2018.

Pochettino has, of course, been linked with other clubs, including Manchester United, but there has been talk and signs in recent days and weeks that he's very much open to going back to Tottenham.

The early favourite with the bookmakers - and one can understand why. Roberto De Zerbi is one of the most respected tacticians in the game today, a coach that can count Pep Guardiola among his many admirers, and he has Premier League experience, having previously turned Brighton into one of the most attractive teams to watch in England.

Of course, as his Amex exit and subsequent spell at Marseille underlined, De Zerbi is a very intense character with a habit of ruffling the feathers of those above and around him. He's basically a possession-obsessed Jose Mourinho or Antonio Conte - but without the titles.

So, while we fully expect Spurs to go for an incredibly innovative manager that rather conveniently became available the night before they fired Frank, we don't think he'd last long in north London. Still, it would be great fun while it lasted!","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Former Arsenal goalkeeper David Seaman has revealed how he feared he was going to become a national hate symbol after Ronaldinho scored a long-range free-kick goal that helped Brazil knock England out of the 2002 World Cup. Speaking on the Beast Mode On Podcast, Seaman explained how he was concerned that he was going to receive treatment similar to that suffered by David Beckham after his red card for kicking out at Diego Simeone in 1998.

Seaman was caught out by Barcelona icon Ronaldinho at the tournament in Japan and South Korea, with his effort from distance ending up in the back of the net to give Brazil a 2-1 lead. The Three Lions failed to find an equaliser, resulting in them exiting the tournament at the quarter-final stage, leading the former Gunners No.1 to wonder about the reception he'd receive upon his return to England.

Indeed, Beckham was completely vilified by the press, as well a significant number of England fans, for his part in the country's loss to Argentina back in 1998. His red card for petulantly swiping his leg at Simeone led to an often unacceptable outpouring of abuse that severely impacted the former Manchester United winger and his family.

After being asked by Adebayo Akinfenwa about that Ronaldinho free-kick, Seaman admits he thought about Beckham and the backlash that might be about to follow: ""He scores that goal and we've still got half an hour left. And it's the knockout stage now. I'm on the pitch thinking to myself: 'Sh*t, if the scoreline stays like this, am I going to get treated like Beckham did in '98?' 

""Those sort of things are going through your mind. When the stakes are that high... in the end I was okay, alright, we lost 2-1, that goal cost us but then when I got home, we landed at Heathrow and there were a lot of England fans and they all just started singing my name. Thank God for that.""

Asked whether Ronaldinho meant to shoot at goal from that distance, Seaman added: ""I was told straight after the game that he didn't [mean it], by Gilberto Silva. But it doesn't matter. It still went in. I've been told so many times that he didn't [mean it]. 

""What was funny, we were playing Soccer Aid [in 2016] and he was playing for the Rest of the World, and he got a free-kick in a similar sort of position and I just walked back to the goal and stood and pointed at that top corner. 'Go on then, see if you can do it again!' And he was laughing his head off.""

Seaman has earned legendary status at Arsenal for his contributions that saw him help deliver two Premier League titles and four FA Cups. Prior to joining the Gunners, however, he had the chance to move to Manchester United.

Revealing a phone call he received from Sir Alex Ferguson, Seaman says:  ""He (Sir Alex) came on the phone and he said: 'I'm going to come in for you in the summer - I want you to be my goalkeeper.' I was like: 'Okay!' I put the phone down to Sir Alex and I'm now thinking: 'I'm going to be a Man United player'. Literally about a week later, Arsenal made a bid for me. 

""Sir Alex wanted me to wait until the summer so then there was no fee as I was out of contract. Arsenal now make a bid for me just before transfer deadline day. I'd lived in London for four years when I was at QPR, my family were settled... so I go and have talks with Arsenal, we agree everything but there was one problem, one player had to leave, and that was John Lukic. We were mates. He was like: 'No, I'm not going anywhere', so the deal fell through. I didn't sign.""

Seaman would eventually get his switch to the north Londoners in 1990, after then-Arsenal goalkeeper Lukic was moved on, and he would go on to make over 500 appearances in all competitions for the Gunners.

Back in 2003, Seaman made what is often described as one of the greatest saves ever witnessed in English football during an FA Cup semi-final win over Sheffield United at Old Trafford. Flinging out his right arm, the former England goalkeeper miraculously manages to stop Paul Peschisolido from heading home an equaliser from point-blank range, with Seaman admitting he didn't realise at the time that the save would go down in history.

He says: ""When the corner comes in, there's a few ricochets, people trying to head it towards goal, so I've gone to one position, and then I've had to come back to another position for what I thought was a header at goal. Then it ends up coming back across to Peschisolido, he gets a head or shoulder on it, which is good for me as it gives me a little bit of time. But I remember diving backwards and thinking: 'I can't take this with me because I'm going in the goal'. So I scoop it out, I end up in the goal and then as I look up I see [Phil] Jagielka, and he's going to smash the rebound in... and he puts it over the bar. Thank God. If that goes in, nothing gets said about [the save].

""You always need a little bit of luck. It wasn't until I saw it on tele... I was like: 'That was decent'. If you look at the save, watch my face as I get up, it's proper serious. I remember Ashley [Cole] coming up to me, I don't know what he said, probably swore at me, telling me how good it was. But then I saw it on TV and I was like: 'Oooft, that was good'.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:atptour.com","Cilic on 'unreal level' against Federer, unforgettable first ATP match","https://www.atptour.com/en/news/cilic-dallas-2026-feature","Wed, 11 Feb 2026 03:16:31 GMT","

Marin Cilic celebrated his 600th tour-level win Tuesday at the Nexo Dallas Open, becoming just the second active player behind Novak Djokovic to reach the milestone.

In which victory did the former No. 3 player in the PIF ATP Rankings play his best tennis?

“I have to say, playing Roger [Federer] in the semis of the US Open was an unreal level. Also, Rafa [Nadal] at the Australian Open,” Cilic said. “A few of those matches were just something at the top.”

Cilic earned one of his two Lexus ATP Head2Head triumphs against Rafael Nadal in the quarter-finals of the 2018 Australian Open. But the match the 21-time tour-level champion referenced first was his famous 6-3, 6-4, 6-4 victory against Roger Federer in the last four of the 2014 US Open.

Not only did Cilic never beat Federer again, but he took advantage of the opportunity he earned by beating Kei Nishikori for his lone major title.

“I would say that was one of the best connections I had in terms of both my skills, playing on the court, feeling the ball, feeling the conditions,” Cilic said. “And just also playing by instinct, being free, playing by the instinct and everything is flowing beautifully. That was just pure — just absolutely pure, pure tennis.”

Ironically, the match after Cilic's victory against Learner Tien Tuesday in Dallas was between Alex Michelsen and Grigor Dimitrov. Michelsen's coach, Kristof Vliegen, was Cilic's opponent in his first ATP Tour match more than 20 years ago. Vliegen defeated Cilic 7-5, 6-2 in 2005 in Umag.

“I remember that I was feeling relaxed before the match. Everything was fine. And just preparing for the match, no nerves,” Cilic said. “But when we started the warm-up during the match and the announcer announced me in front of a packed stadium in Croatia, I got such a great welcome and a great applause there. 

“My legs were gone. I wasn't feeling my legs anymore.”





Cilic vividly remembers the conditions that day in his home country, where he competed on the ATP Tour aged 16.

“We were playing in the brutal heat of Umag and I still remember that it was one of the most difficult days as a youngster,” Cilic said. “Finishing the first set, I was looking to the referee to get the medical and I couldn't see him.

“Everything was black, so it was an interesting experience, but it was a beautiful one.”

Now 37, Cilic stands alone with Djokovic (1,168 wins) as the only active men with 600 tour-level wins. With the amount of respect he has for the Serbian, it makes the accomplishment even more special.

“Definitely, but he is too far ahead,” Cilic said, cracking a laugh. “It's such a credit to the longevity we had in our careers and so many years on the Tour. We have had some great seasons. 

“You have some difficult moments, going through many things. But the passion, the drive, the grit stays and that definitely has helped me to reach this milestone.”

Matteo Berrettini is back in action on the ATP Tour.

After withdrawing from the Australian Open with an abdominal injury and delaying the start of his 2026 season, the Italian returned to competition with a strong start at the IEB+ Argentina Open, defeating home hope Federico Coria 7-5, 7-5 in front of a raucous Argentine crowd on Tuesday.

""I trained really hard to be able to come here. I really wanted to come here in Buenos Aires. The atmosphere was really good,"" Berrettini said. ""I think the match was a little bit up and down, but I'm happy because I am [back] playing.""

Competing in his first match since helping Italy win its third consecutive Davis Cup title in November, Berrettini was forced to dig deep. He squandered seven break points in the first set before crucially breaking Coria on the eighth to win the first set, according to Infosys ATP Stats. Despite losing a 4-1 lead in the second set, Berrettini held firm to clinch the set 7-5. He won 78 per cent (36/46) of his first-serve points to outlast the Argentine in two hours and 14 minutes.

Berrettini now leads 3-0 in his Lexus ATP Head2Head series with Coria, who was playing his first match since August. The former No. 6 in the PIF ATP Rankings, competing in Argentina for the first time, will face Vit Kopriva in the second round. 

In other opening-round action, sixth seed Camilo Ugo Carabelli earned his first tour-level win of the season by cruising past Francisco Comesana 6-4, 7-6(3) in an all-Argentine clash.  Alejandro Tabilo defeated Buenos Aires native Facundo Diaz Acosta 7-6(5), 6-3. The Chilean saved both break points he faced. He will next play defending champion Joao Fonseca.


Watch Highlights from Tabilo vs. Diaz Acosta:


Juan Manuel Cerundolo and Roman Andres Burruchaga were among the Argentines who earned wins at the ATP 250 event on Day 2. Cerundolo defeated Daniel Altmaier 6-2, 6-2. With the victory, he earned his first win since advancing to the Gstaad final in July last year. Burruchaga defeated Laslo Djere 6-2, 6-4.

Ignacio Buse defeated Francesco Passaro 5-7, 7-5, 6-4. Tomas Barrios Vera won after Thiago Seyboth Wild retired while leading 6-4, 5-6.

Lucky loser Elisabetta Cocciaretto scored her third career Top 10 win and advanced to the last 16 of a WTA 1000 event for the first time with a straight-sets upset of Coco Gauff at the Qatar TotalEnergies Open -- and revealed afterwards that her friendship with Sofia Goggia, the women's downhill bronze medallist at the Winter Olympics this week, has been an inspiration to her.

Lucky loser Elisabetta Cocciaretto scored her third Top 10 win -- and first outside a Grand Slam -- with a 6-4, 6-2 upset of No. 4 seed Coco Gauff in the Qatar TotalEnergies Open second round. The Italian advances to the last 16 of a WTA 1000 event for the first time.

Doha: Scores | Draws | Order of play 

But despite posting one of the best results of her career, Cocciaretto admitted in her on-court interview that her attention isn't wholly on the tennis this week. After all, the Milano Cortina Winter Olympic Games are currently being held in her home country.

""Well, I think this week is a little bit different for us in Italy,"" she said. ""Because now I'm more focused on the Winter Olympics than on the tournament, cheering for the Italian athletes. Maybe that was the key, that's why I'm playing better. But jokes apart, playing more matches helps you to win more matches, for sure.""

Afterwards, Cocciaretto explained that she'd been glued to the downhill skiing races all week. Ahead of her first-round match against Elsa Jacquemot, she'd been cheering on her friend Sofia Goggia, who took the bronze medal in Sunday's women's event. Cocciaretto and Goggia had met through their mutual clothing sponsor, Emporio Armani.

""Now we are in contact,"" she said. ""We always send messages and FaceTime to talk about our sports and how you manage some things. She gives me a lot of advice.""

Cocciaretto has never skied herself -- her parents forbade it as too dangerous when she was younger -- but her coach Fausto Scolari hails from the Alpine town of Sondrio, and he's taught her to appreciate the sport. Indeed, Cocciaretto calls downhill skiers her ""idols"".

""I love how they approach the sport,"" she said. ""They have fear of nothing. They're focused a lot and they put themselves after everything. If I have a child in the future, I will put him or her in skiing!""

Keys to the win: Cocciaretto was able to take that fearlessness into her match with Gauff. She said that in past years, she had put too many limits on herself -- but now, she's resolved to leave them behind.

""Sometimes I wasn't sure about myself, about winning some matches,"" she said. ""I came on court, but not really sure that I will win that match. So I tried to not put that limit on myself, and go there and have maybe a mentality of a champion.""

With her game style of holding her baseline and taking the ball as early as possible, Cocciaretto signalled her aggressive intent throughout an opening set in which she fired 10 winners to Gauff's four. The World No. 57 made her move at 2-2, standing inside the baseline on return and reeling off a series of superb groundstrokes to break.

Keeping her lead wasn't straightforward, but Cocciaretto came up with resilient tennis in the clutch. Gauff pegged her back to 3-3, but Cocciaretto broke again courtesy of the best point of the match -- a 33-stroke lungbuster in which both players ran each other ragged, before Cocciaretto was able to finally bust through the Gauff defenses with a backhand. She then saved a break point in each of her next service games, and converted her fourth set point with one of her most reliable weapons -- the crosscourt backhand.

There was less tension in the second set. Cocciaretto broke immediately with another crosscourt backhand winner and cruised to the finishing line as Gauff's unforced error tally rose to 39. The fifth game encapsulated the American's woes. Having double faulted to go down 0-40, she played three of her best points of the match to get it back to deuce -- only to concede it anyway with another double fault and a tame backhand into the net.

""I tried to be more aggressive, and I was hitting more unforced errors,"" Gauff said. ""I tried to be a little bit more passive, but playing with more shape, and she was just taking the ball early and crushing the ball. I don't know. I think I need to figure out how to play against players like her who hit super flat and take everything pretty much early. I think the last two matches have shown that I've been struggling with that.""

Cocciaretto surging in 2026: Cocciaretto's previous Top 10 wins had come over Petra Kvitova at Roland Garros 2023 and Jessica Pegula at Wimbledon 2025, but she had not won a set from Gauff in three previous professional meetings. However, she did have a junior win over the American to draw on, having defeated her 2-6, 6-2, 6-2 at the Australian Open in 2018.

She still remembers every detail of it, too -- from her fellow Italians joking about her unlucky draw to the game plan she used to win.

""My tactics were playing in the centre and moving her, and it worked,"" she said.

The result continues Cocciaretto's stellar season so far -- one in which she has used the qualifying rounds as a springboard to success. In January, she captured her second WTA Tour Driven by Mercedes-Benz title as a qualifier in Hobart. This week, she fell in the final round of qualifying to Varvara Gracheva, but entered the main draw as a lucky loser following McCartney Kessler's withdrawal.

The 25-year-old will next face another American, Ann Li, with a maiden WTA 1000 quarterfinal at stake for both players.

Valtteri Bottas turning his focus to performance

First look at all 11 cars in Bahrain

As he prepares to defend his maiden World Championship, Lando Norris has been assessing how his approach differs to race winners of past and present, including Max Verstappen.

Lando Norris believes it is “clear” that he has a “different mentality” to Max Verstappen, with the Briton reflecting on what motivates his own desire to win and the areas that he still wants to improve on.

Following his maiden World Championship triumph, Norris is preparing to defend his title in the 2026 season, a year in which a wave of new technical regulations will come into effect.

Speaking to a select group of media, including F1.com, the McLaren driver looked ahead to the upcoming campaign and said of his championship victory: “I have that feeling, one day – if I don't achieve something again – I have something to always fall back on and I'll always be proud, no matter what people say.”

Norris was later quizzed on whether he felt that other serial race winners might have also adopted this approach, with the 26-year-old going on to explain how he feels that he differs to his 2025 title rival – and four-time World Champion – Verstappen.

“I can't answer on what went before and what those guys thought, but I think it's quite clear that I have a different mentality and a different approach to say what Max has – good or bad, you decide,” said Norris.

“There are a lot of things I admire in Max, where I wish I had a little bit more of that here and there, but I'm always trying to improve my things.

“I know there are still areas where I'm not at the level I need to be, and it's still a good level but when you are fighting these guys you need to be close to perfection.

“So there are still plenty of things I want to work on and I want to be better on, but the baseline level I'm at right now is still pretty good.”

The 11-time race winner went on to assess what fuels him to succeed as he insisted that his desire to collect further victories has not been changed by his World Championship.

“My motivation to win is exactly the same,” Norris explained. “I've definitely not lost anything – if anything I think I just have more confidence. I've said in interviews and stuff in the past, I'm very much a guy who has to see something to believe it, especially when it's been anything to do with myself.

“Did I believe I could be on pole for the first time or win a race? When I've done it, then I've gone, ‘Ah, I can do it'. That's just how, for whatever reason, I've thought and I've believed and things like that.

“I certainly got better at a lot of things last year, just like mental preparation and the mental state, dealing with the good times and bad times and all of the in-between. I certainly have to find my own way and not disregard what other people have done in the past, but just understand what is always going to motivate me.

“A lot of my motivation is not just picturing me on the top step of the podium or holding up a trophy – a lot of it is being with the team and allowing them to have the trophies and party and celebrate and that kind of thing.

“I'm not too fussed about what other people have thought about stuff, but my motivation is just as high to try and win again.”

Valtteri Bottas turning his focus to performance

First look at all 11 cars in Bahrain

The first session of 2026 pre-season testing at the Bahrain International Circuit has seen Max Verstappen top the timesheets.

Max Verstappen set the pace during the opening session at pre-season testing in Bahrain, the four-time World Champion topping the timesheets on Wednesday morning.

Off the back of the Barcelona Shakedown, the teams and drivers have returned to action for the first of two three-day tests held at the Bahrain International Circuit – with all 11 squads running this time after Williams did not participate in the Barcelona event.

With teams running one car throughout each day, the drivers have to share driving duties between them, meaning that some will swap over between the morning and afternoon sessions while others may get a full day at the wheel.

One of those set to spend all of Wednesday in the car is Verstappen, who was the first to hit the track in the Red Bull when the morning session began at 1000 local time, soon followed by Audi's Gabriel Bortoleto and the Racing Bulls of Arvid Lindblad.

By the end of the first half hour, 10 of the 11 teams had been out on track – many sporting aero rakes – while Alpine were the last to join the fray, with Franco Colapinto heading out in the A526.

Several laps had gone on the board when the first red flag was thrown, due to Colapinto having stopped by the side of the track. After the car was cleared, the action soon got back underway again as the teams continued to put their new challengers through their paces.

There were some small moments as the drivers tested out how much grip they had, with Lewis Hamilton experiencing a spin while Verstappen locked up into Turn 1 before returning to the track, the Red Bull driver sitting at the top of the timesheets for much of the session on a 1m 35.433s.

The track became busy as the morning's running headed towards its close, leading to a few more lock-ups and wide moments. Some cars also took the chance to tail others, getting a taste of what following is like in the 2026 machines.

When the chequered flag fell, Verstappen remained on top via his earlier effort of 1m 35.433s, putting him 0.169s clear of McLaren's Oscar Piastri. George Russell followed in third for Mercedes – six-tenths adrift of Verstappen – with Hamilton in fourth and the Haas of Esteban Ocon in fifth.

Lindblad and Williams' Carlos Sainz placed in sixth and seventh, a pair who achieved the session's highest lap counts of 75 and 77 respectively. Bortoleto classified in eighth place, while Cadillac's Valtteri Bottas, the Aston Martin of Lance Stroll and Colapinto completed the timesheets.

The teams will now have a one-hour lunch break to reconvene before the afternoon session gets underway at 1500 local time, while most teams will swap drivers with the exception of Red Bull, Racing Bulls, Aston Martin and Haas.

Valtteri Bottas turning his focus to performance

First look at all 11 cars in Bahrain

Adrian Newey's first Aston Martin F1 car was formally presented in Saudi Arabia on Monday evening.

Adrian Newey has described the “emotional journey of passion” behind his very first Aston Martin design, while praising the team for the “huge strides” they are making in terms of working together more cohesively.

F1 design guru Newey joined Aston Martin early last year and played a pivotal role in the newly-launched AMR26, which appeared for the first time at the Barcelona Shakedown and was officially presented in Saudi Arabia on Monday.

Speaking at the reveal, Newey said: “It's great to see the car as it will be racing. [When] we ran the car briefly at Barcelona for a day and a half, it was all black, partly in truth because we didn't have time to paint it! That was fabulous.

“Funnily enough, Lawrence [Stroll, Aston Martin team owner] and I, when it first pulled out of the garage, with Lance [Stroll] driving, we were standing next to each other in the pit lane, and I think we were both quite close to having a tear in our eye.

“It's been a long, emotional journey of passion and a lot of hard work to get it to Barcelona, and to see the car now paired with the livery it will be racing with is of course how everybody will see it, so it's a very important part.”

Newey initially arrived at Aston Martin as their Managing Technical Partner, but the 67-year-old has also taken on Team Principal duties for the 2026 season in another change to the squad's leadership structure.

Since his time onboard, and around that recent managerial reshuffle, Newey believes the workforce at Aston Martin's state-of-the-art Silverstone headquarters have become a more unified and effective team.

“I think first of all, it's a lovely building to work in,” Newey said of the AMR Technology Campus. “It has a good atmosphere, it's a pleasant environment, because let's face it, a lot of us have been doing 12-hour days, if not more, over the last months, so having a pleasant feeling to the room you're working in is very important.

“The layout of the building is very conducive to everybody working together, it's all very centralised, and the facilities are second to none. Lawrence's vision and investment into this building have given us, without doubt, the best facilities in F1, and that's a tremendous asset.

“But it's clearly only one part of the equation. The equally important one, the second part, is the personnel that populate that building and how they work together, and that's the bit that I feel we're making huge strides on at the moment.”

Aston Martin are now turning their attention towards this week's opening pre-season test at the Bahrain International Circuit, where the F1 grid will continue to learn about their 2026 challengers.

While Newey's AMR26 attracted plenty of attention and comments at the Barcelona Shakedown, the Briton is keeping expectations in check ahead of the campaign getting under way – while stressing how quickly cars are likely to change in the first year of a new ruleset.

“Whenever there's a big regulation change, there's always huge opportunities,” he commented. “It's who spots what and which one is the ultimate, or proves to be the correct solution. Only time will tell.

“I think this year there's likely to be a huge amount of development. I would imagine that for many teams, including to an extent ourselves, the car that they ran in Barcelona will be a fair bit different to the car they actually race in Melbourne. That [development] pace, I'm sure, will continue through the season.”

Nancy was taken from her home in Tucson, Arizona, and reported missing on Sunday, Feb. 1, in what local authorities and the FBI enforcement have deemed a suspected abduction. 


							By 

	McKinley Franklin



	A man who had been detained for questioning related to the abduction of Savannah Guthrie‘s mother, Nancy Guthrie, has been released, the New York Times, CNN and other media outlets reported early on Wednesday.


	The man, a 36-year-old named Carlos, told the New York Times he had been in his car on Tuesday evening in Rio Rico, Arizona, when police officers asked him for his name and then detained him. He was held for several hours before eventually being released with wrists swollen from handcuffs, he told the outlet.




	“I hope they get the suspect, because I'm not it,” he said in an interview from his Rico Rico home after he was released. He said he had not heard of Nancy Guthrie.

	“They better do their job and find the suspect that did it so that they can clear my name,” he added.


	A spokeswoman for the Pima County Sheriff's Department said that investigators had finished searching a property in Rio Rico is near the U.S.-Mexico border on Wednesday morning.


	No updates on Nancy's whereabouts were reported.


	The arrest had come after the first break in the case, when the FBI earlier on Tuesday released a series of surveillance photos and two videos of a potential suspect. In the footage, obtained by Nancy's doorbell and security cameras, a person can be seen wearing a jacket, ski mask and gloves, with a backpack on and a firearm at the waist.

	











	“Earlier today, Pima County Sheriff's Department deputies detained a subject during a traffic stop south of Tucson,” the Pima County Sheriff's Department had said Tuesday night in a statement on X. “The subject is currently being questioned in connection to the Nancy Guthrie investigation. Additional information will be released as it becomes available,” the statement read.


	The 84-year-old Guthrie was reported missing on Sunday, Feb. 1, after she did not show up for church. Local authorities and the FBI have treated Nancy's disappearance from her Tucson, Arizona, home as a suspected kidnapping or abduction. The investigation into her disappearance heads into day 11 on Wednesday.


	The Today show host has shared multiple video messages online alongside her brother, Camron Guthrie, and sister, Annie Guthrie, pleading for the safe return of her mother. On Feb. 4, the Pima County Sheriff's Department acknowledged the reporting of a ransom note, that was originally obtained by TMZ and at least two local news outlets in Arizona, saying that investigators are “following all leads.”


	One day later, Savannah acknowledged her mother's suspected kidnapper, confirming that they “have heard the reports about a ransom letter in the media” and were “ready to talk” to the alleged abductor. 


	On Feb. 7, the television host and her siblings shared another video where she acknowledged they'd received a message from the alleged kidnapper, and were willing to pay to bring Nancy home.

	











	“We beg you now to return our mother to us so that we can celebrate with her,” she said. “This is the only way we will have peace. This is very valuable to us, and we will pay.”

""He essentially gave me a book to let me know that I should lose weight,"" the actress said.


							By 

	Carly Thomas


Associate Editor


Margot Robbie was quick to put a rude former co-star in his place.


	During a recent conversation with Charli xcx for Complex, the Oscar-nominated actress and producer recalled a male castmember from a past project gifting her a book about eating less food.




	“Very, very early in my career, an actor I worked with, a male actor, gave me a book called French Women Don't Get Fat, and it was essentially a book telling you to eat less,” she said. “And I was like, whoa, fuck you, dude.”

	Robbie added, “He essentially gave me a book to let me know that I should lose weight. I was like, ‘Wow.'” She also noted that she has “no idea where he would even be now.”

	










			Related Video		







	The book in question, written by Mireille Guiliano, was originally published in 2004 and centers on French eating habits and moderation.


	While Robbie opted out of naming the male actor or the project they were working on together, she has gone on to make quite a name for herself in Hollywood. Some of her most notable roles include The Wolf of Wall Street (2013), Suicide Squad (2016), I, Tonya (2017), Once Upon a Time in Hollywood (2019), Bombshell (2019), Babylon (2022) and Barbie (2023).


	She's also earned three Oscar nominations, including best leading actress for I, Tonya, best supporting actress for Bombshell and best picture for Barbie.


	Robbie next stars opposite Jacob Elordi in the Emerald Fennell-directed Wuthering Heights, which hits theaters on Friday. The filmmaker previously told British Vogue why she knew the actress was the obvious choice for the role of Cathy.

	











	“Cathy is a star,” Fennell said at the time. “She's wilful, mean, a recreational sadist, a provocateur. She engages in cruelty in a way that is disturbing and fascinating. It was about finding someone who you would forgive in spite of yourself, someone who literally everyone in the world would understand why you love her. It's difficult to find that supersized star power. Margot comes with big dick energy. That's what Cathy needs.”

Two hundred and thirty nominees — among them Steven Spielberg, Emma Stone, Leonardo DiCaprio, Kate Hudson and Timothée Chalamet — packed the Beverly Hilton's international ballroom on Tuesday afternoon.


							By 

	Scott Feinberg


Executive Editor of Awards


	A year after catastrophic wildfires forced the cancellation of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences' annual Oscar Nominees Luncheon at the Beverly Hilton (it was later rescheduled as a dinner at the Academy Museum), the star-studded event returned — in a big way — to its traditional home on Tuesday.


	Among the A-listers packing the room were best picture nominee Steven Spielberg (Hamnet), best actor nominee Timothée Chalamet (Marty Supreme), best actor nominee Leonardo DiCaprio (One Battle After Another), best actress nominee Emma Stone (Bugonia), best actor nominee Michael B. Jordan (Sinners), best supporting actor nominee Jacob Elordi (Frankenstein) and best actress nominee Kate Hudson (Song Sung Blue).

	In fact, only a few high-profile nominees were missing, such as best actress nominee Renate Reinsve (Sentimental Value), who is busy filming her next movie, and best supporting actor nominee Sean Penn (One Battle After Another), who largely avoids awards season events.




			Related Video		







	For some, the luncheon was a familiar experience — perennial best original song nominee Diane Warren (Diane Warren: Relentless) was in attendance for the 17th time and ninth year in a row. But for a number of veterans, it was their first rodeo — indeed, receiving many congratulations on their first noms were two septuagenarian veterans who are up for best supporting actor: Sinners' Delroy Lindo, 73, and Sentimental Value's Stellan Skarsgård, 74. But it might have been most surreal of all for best supporting actress nominee Amy Madigan (Weapons), who was last a nominee — and at the luncheon — 40 years ago!

	











	No awards season event offers better people-watching than this one, at which each nominee (and their guest) is seated at a table without anyone else associated with the film or category in which they are nominated. For instance, best actor nominee Ethan Hawke (Blue Moon), best director/adapted screenplay nominee Chloé Zhao (Hamnet) and Academy directors branch governor Ava DuVernay were seated together, as were best director/adapted screenplay nominee Paul Thomas Anderson (One Battle After Another), best actress nominee Jessie Buckley (Hamnet), best original song nominee Raphael Saadiq (Sinners) and best original score nominee Alexandre Desplat (Frankenstein).


	During the cocktail hour and between courses, however, nominees fraternize with whomever they choose. Sinners' Lindo and Hamnet's Buckley greeted one another. One Battle After Another's Anderson caught up with best director/original screenplay nominee Joachim Trier (Sentimental Value). Sinners' Jordan mingled with best supporting actor nominee Benicio Del Toro (One Battle After Another). Academy actors branch governor Marlee Matlin introduced herself to Marty Supreme's Chalamet. Best actor nominee Wagner Moura (The Secret Agent) hung with Telluride Film Festival director Julie Huntsinger. And, as in many years past, many nominees excitedly introduced themselves to Spielberg — among them best animated feature nominee Ugo Bienvenu (Arco) and Train Dreams' best adapted screenplay nominees Clint Bentley and Greg Kwedar and best cinematography nominee Adolpho Veloso.

	











	The proceedings officially got underway when Academy president Lynette Howell Taylor welcomed all guests, noting that there were 230 nominees in the room from 29 countries or regions, and at least one non-American nominated in all 24 categories this year; that there are a record 76 female nominees this year; and that this is the first year of the best casting Oscar. She also thanked Academy CEO Bill Kramer, the organization's staff and board of governors, their Oscars broadcasting partner Disney/ABC, returning Oscars host Conan O'Brien and — in a very gracious first — the journalists who cover the Oscar season!


	The event closed, as always, with each nominee being called to the risers for a “class photo.” This year, Academy actors branch governors Lou Diamond Phillips had the honor — or challenge — of announcing, and correctly pronouncing, all of the names. The first called was Lindo, who was greeted with thunderous applause. To my ear, most of the people whose names were met with the loudest ovations hailed, like Lindo, from Sinners, including Jordan, best picture/director/best original screenplay nominee Ryan Coogler, best costume design nominee Ruth E. Carter and best supporting actress nominee Wunmi Mosaku. 


	Is that a harbinger of what is to come on Oscar night (March 15), or merely a reflection of the fact that there were more people in the room associated with Sinners than any other film (which garnered a record-breaking 16 noms)? Only time will tell!

Allan Deberton's new film, debuting in the Generation Kplus section, follows a boy living ""in a fragile balance between affection and fear of losing the only place where he feels protected and understood.""


							By 

	Georg Szalai


Global Business Editor


	Gugu is almost 12 years old and, like many Brazilian kids, dreams of becoming a soccer player. He is growing up in a small community near a reservoir that is slowly drying up to expose the ghostly remains of a submerged town. His grandmother Dilma cares for the boy, with her warmth and open-mindedness, giving him the space to be – well, simply himself. Welcome to Gugu's World, the new feature from Allan Deberton (Pacarrete, The Best Friend), which world premieres on Feb. 14 in the Generation Kplus section of the Berlin International Film Festival.

	











	The pair's quiet but powerful bond shields them from the disapproval of Gugu's father and the community around them. But subtle changes begin to shake up their routines, and Dilma becomes increasingly frail. Worried that he could lose the only safe space he has ever known, Gugu becomes more and more determined to keep his and his grandmother's world intact.

Gugu's World stars Yuri Gomes as Gugu, Teca Pereira as Dilma, Lázaro Ramos as father Batista, as well as Carlos Francisco and Georgina Castro.


	Deberton directed Gugu's World based on a script by André Araújo. m-appeal is handling world sales for the movie produced by Biônica Filmes and Deberton Filmes. 


THR can premiere an exclusive trailer for Gugu's World, inviting you into a world of tenderness coming under threat. Check out the sights, the sounds, and the dancing here.

	











	Deberton shared with THR some insights into how Gugu's World came about, the music, finding its young, charismatic star, and the collaborative effort behind the movie.


What spoke to you about this tender story of a young queer boy, his grandmother and his worry about losing his safe space?


	What moved me first was the idea of a child who doesn't yet have the words to name who he is, but already feels that something essential is at risk. Gugu lives in a fragile balance between affection and fear of losing the only place where he feels protected and understood. The relationship with his grandmother is central because it represents unconditional care, even when it is imperfect or unspoken. 


	I was drawn to that emotional territory: a queer childhood lived through gestures, silences and imagination, rather than declarations. This felt very honest, delicate, and close to my own childhood memories, and also to those of André Araújo, the screenwriter. We were both born in Russas, a small town in northeastern Brazil.


I love how the story is set in a very specific location in Brazil, but also feels universal. How did you approach it?


	Yes, absolutely. Gugu's World is deeply rooted in a very concrete place, in its landscape, its light, its sounds, and its social dynamics, but the emotional experience of the characters goes beyond any geographic boundary. Childhood, the desire to belong, fear of loss, and affection are emotions that can be recognized anywhere in the world. At no point did I want to neutralize the Brazilian identity of the film to make it “international.” I trusted that authenticity would be the true bridge to the audience.

	











How did you find Yuri as your young star? He is so full of life and charisma and fits so naturally with your adult stars!


	Finding Yuri was a long and very careful process. Together with Luciana Vieira, our casting director, we were looking not only for a talented child actor, but for someone with emotional openness, imagination, and a strong on-screen presence. When Yuri appeared, there was something immediate. A combination of vulnerability and vitality that felt perfect for Gugu. It was beautiful to see how naturally he connected with Teca Pereira and Lázaro Ramos. These relationships were built on trust, listening, and affection, not on performance. That honesty was essential to the film.


I loved the music and remembered that music was also key in The Best Friend. How do you think about music and its importance in film?


	I think of music as a feeling, as access to something intimate when words are not enough. I grew up listening to mixtapes. My uncle, who helped raise me, worked producing cassette tapes with hits, and I would listen to those songs sitting on his lap. My films carry those memories. “Time After Time” (Cyndi Lauper) and “Sentimental Demais” (Altemar Dutra) were part of that universe, and in Gugu's World these songs, together with contemporary Brazilian hits, help us enter both Gugu's inner and outer worlds. Composer João Victor Barroso was fundamental in shaping the psychological universe of the characters through his original score.

	











Is there anything else you would like to highlight?


	I would highlight the deeply collective nature of the film. Gugu's World is the result of an intense collaboration across many departments, and we are very proud of the team we assembled. I was fortunate to find producing partners such as Karen Castanho, Bianca Villar, Fernando Fraiha, João Macedo, Marcelo Pinheiro, Fred Burle, Ariadne Mazzetti, and Lázaro Ramos. We are truly honored to premiere the film in the Generation competition at the Berlinale, a space that embraces stories about childhood and youth with complexity and respect.

Her sister played by Jamie Lee Curtis, however, wants none of this for her.


							By 

	Tony Maglio



	Paging Dr. Kay Scarpetta — we're gonna need you to scrub back in for this one. 


Nicole Kidman is up to the task in the trailer (below) for Amazon's Scarpetta series, which debuts on Prime Video March 11. The adaptation of Patricia Cornwell's best-selling novels unfolds across two timelines. The first tracks a young Kay Scarpetta (Rosy McEwen) from her beginnings as a chief medical examiner in the late '90s; the second flashes forward to Kay's present-day (Kidman) return to her hometown, where she resumes her former position while investigating a grisly murder.

	Kay's sister Dorothy, played by Amanda Righetti (young) and Jamie Lee Curtis, wishes she wouldn't. The forensic crime thriller was adapted for streaming by Liz Sarnoff (Barry, Lost). 


	“With skilled hands and an unnerving eye, unrelenting medical examiner Kay Scarpetta is determined to serve as the voice of the victims, unmask a serial killer and prove that her career-making case from 28 years prior isn't also her undoing,” the logline reads.


	“Set against the backdrop of modern forensic investigation, the series delves beyond the crime scene to explore the psychological complexities of both perpetrators and investigators, creating a multi-layered thriller that examines the toll of pursuing justice at all costs,” the description continues. “As Scarpetta pursues justice, she must navigate complicated relationships, including the fraught dynamic with her sister Dorothy Farinelli, confront long-held professional and personal grudges, and face secrets that threaten to unravel everything she's built.”

	











	Bobby Cannavale, Simon Baker and Ariana DeBose round out the cast. Jake Cannavale plays the younger version of dad Bobby; Hunter Parrish plays the younger version of Baker's character.


	More than 120 million copies of Cornwell's novels have been sold worldwide since the Kay Scarpetta character's debut in 1990. The Scarpetta series is produced by Amazon MGM Studios and Blumhouse Television in association with Blossom Films, Comet Pictures, and P&S Projects. 


Scarpetta is executive produced by Kidman and Per Saari through Blossom Films, Curtis through Comet Pictures, writer and showrunner Sarnoff through Sarnoff TV, author Cornwell through P&S Projects, as well as Jason Blum, Jeremy Gold, Chris Dickie and Chris McCumber through Blumhouse Television. David Gordon Green directed five episodes and is executive producer alongside Amy Sayres.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:billboard.com","Signed: Ian Munsick Joins Triple Tigers Roster, J-Pop Boy Group Number_i Pacts With WME","https://www.billboard.com/lists/ian-munsick-j-pop-group-number-i-music-artist-signings/","Wed, 11 Feb 2026 01:01:46 GMT","

In other recent signing news, Randall King hits the Neon Coast, Willow Avalon inks with new management and more.


The sheer number of artist signings announced on a weekly basis makes it difficult to keep up, no matter how closely you pay attention to the industry news cycle. That's why every other Tuesday, Billboard compiles the latest signings to labels, distributors, agencies, management companies and more, in an effort to provide a snapshot of the latest moves in the artist space, from household names to indie stars to emerging acts.


Ian Munsick and his West to the Rest Records have partnered with Triple Tigers Records. In the process, Munsick joins the Triple Tigers roster, which also includes Russell Dickerson, Scotty McCreery and Shane Profitt.


	Munsick's new song “Geronimo” was released on Jan. 30. He will launch his Eagle Flies Free tour in February.


	“Every artist dreams of partnering with a record label that not only understands their vision, but creates a clear, passionate plan on how to reach that destination. After I played some of my new music for the team at Triple Tigers, they told me exactly what songs they thought could achieve that vision,” Munsick said in a statement. “In a day [and] age where labels often rely on third parties for opinions that may or may not eventually lead to action, it was so refreshing to hear the words ‘that song is a hit' when playing a guitar/vocal work tape for the label heads. Results are never guaranteed in the music industry but I am confident that the combination of this new era of Ian Munsick music and the strategic workhorse of Triple Tigers will result in a true 50/50 partnership made in country & western heaven.”


	“Ian Munsick is the ultimate artist: unique identifiable voice, compelling songs and perspective, established brand and a massive fanbase that is growing by leaps and bounds,” added Triple Tigers Records' Kevin Herring and Annie Ortmeier in a statement. “We are ecstatic to partner with Ian and are ready to take country music by storm.” — Jessica Nicholson


	Read up on more of the latest artist signings below.


J-pop boy group Number_i signed with WME. Since debuting in January 2024, the group has released hits including “GOAT,” “3XL,” “GOD_i” and “INZM.” The trio played Coachella in 2024 as part of an 88rising artist showcase and also performed at 88rising's Head in the Clouds in Pasadena, Calif., last year. — Chris Eggertsen


Randall King and his longtime day-to-day manager, Clayton Toney, have joined Martha Earls‘ Neon Coast artist development company.


	Texas native King is known for songs including “You in a Honky Tonk” and “Mirror, Mirror.” He released his major label debut Shot Glass in 2022 and followed it with his sophomore project, Into the Neon. Toney has joined Neon Coast as artist manager, continuing as King's point of contact and now co-manager.


	Neon Coast is also home to artists including Kane Brown, Restless Road, Dylan Schneider, Nightly, Julia Cole, Kat Luna and Alyssa Flaherty.


	“Randall and Clayton are exactly the kind of artist-manager partnership we love to support,” Earls said in a statement. “They've grown something special the right way — on the road, through songs that matter, and with a clear creative vision. We're excited to welcome them to the Neon Coast family and help amplify what they've already built.”


	“2026 is starting HOT and looking real good. I'm thankful to Howie Edelman and Scott Gunter at Durango for all they've helped us accomplish so far, excited for this new adventure with Neon Coast, and thrilled to keep Clayton on board for this next chapter,” added King. “The future of country music is bright!”


	“It's been a pleasure working with Randall since the early days of his career, and I'm grateful to Martha and the Neon Coast team for sharing our continued vision for his future,” added Toney. “We knew from our first meeting that their passion for Randall and all he's accomplished was unparalleled. Their excitement and eagerness were contagious and easy to see, and we can't wait to see where this partnership takes us.” — Jessica Nicholson


Singer-songwriter Willow Avalon has signed with Electric Feel Management, which is part of Electric Feel Entertainment. Electric Feel will co-manage Avalon alongside Mark Shami. Avalon released her debut album, Southern Belle Raisin' Hell, in 2025 and is known for songs including “Tequila and Whiskey” and “Homewrecker.” Avalon will launch a headlining tour across Europe this month and is set to perform at Stagecoach in April.


	“So excited to be working with everyone in the EF family,” Avalon said in a statement.


	“I am very excited to work with the incredibly talented Willow Avalon, whose artistry brings a strong mix of vulnerability and fearlessness.

	“Jenna is a rare, multifaceted talent in music and beyond. Her songwriting paints vignettes that reflect her life and, coupled with her marketing savvy, she has the ability to deliver a message in a way that's authentic and an extension of her West Texas lifestyle,” Mitchell said in a statement, adding, “It's been a joy forging and expanding her connection on and off stage through meaningful partnerships with Justin Boots, Ely Cattleman and American Hat. Clinton, myself and everyone at The Erv Woolsey Co are honored to support her on this journey.”


	“I'm so grateful Allen took my call when I was searching for management,” Paulette said. “We've known each other for a long time, and I was calling for advice from a friend and ended up finding the answer to a prayer for the right partner on the management side. It was good timing! It's been fun working together, and I cannot wait to see what becomes of teaming with Clinton, Allen and the entire Erv Woolsey Co. family.” — Jessica Nicholson


Kentucky singer-songwriter Tyler Booth signed with Jamey Johnson‘s Big Gassed Records in a joint venture with Average Joes Entertainment and also finalized a management agreement with The Erv Woolsey Company.

In 2020, he signed a joint venture with Sony Music Nashville and Villa40, releasing songs including “Long Comes a Girl” and “Where the Livin' Is.” He has toured with Brantley Gilbert, Darius Rucker and Dwight Yoakam.


	“Jamey is all about the music,” Booth said in a statement. “He loves music, and I do too. That is why we have that connection. He is really laid back and goes with the flow, and I am too. I feel like music is supposed to be that way.”


	Johnson said of Booth, “He is a wonderful singer and a great songwriter and he deserves to be heard.”


	“We couldn't be more excited to be involved with Tyler,” Forrest Latta, president of Average Joes Entertainment, said in a statement. “After hearing his latest project — the talent, the growth, the ability to create the traditional sounds and compelling stories that have made country music great — we couldn't get enough. And to partner with an icon like Jamey made this a no brainer. We had to be a part of it.”


	In his own statement, Erv Woolsey Company president Allen Mitchell said, “Tyler embodies the traditional, storytelling spirit that has been at the core of our company's reputation since its formation in the ‘80s. As the EWC forges into the future, we couldn't be more proud that he chose to partner with us for this next chapter of his career.” — Chris Eggertsen


Frontiers Label Group imprint FLG signed GLU, the genre-mixing solo project of Michael Shuman (Queens of the Stone Age, Mini Mansions).

	“Excited to finally have a great team of people and veteran music heads who are as excited about the future of GLU as I am,” said Shuman in a statement.


Leo Nicholas, head of FLG, added, “Continuing our mission to partner with boundary-pushing artists, I am super proud to welcome GLU to the FLG roster. Having long admired Mikey's exceptional range and songwriting prowess, we knew this collaboration was the perfect fit for our label's evolving sound.” — Chris Eggertsen

Clients of Casey Wasserman's namesake agency have begun defecting after his relationship to Jeffrey Epstein accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell came to light.


													By
												

	Chris Eggertsen



	On Thursday (Feb. 5), Best Coast frontwoman Bethany Cosentino was the first artist signed to the powerful Wasserman agency to speak out over revelations that its founder and CEO, Casey Wasserman, had carried on a flirtatious relationship with convicted sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell — the main accomplice of convicted child sex predator Jeffrey Epstein — after the latest tranche of 3 million files in the Epstein case was released. Expressing anger over Wasserman's apology, in which the executive said he “deeply regret[s]” his communications with Maxwell, Cosentino called for Wasserman to step down from his post and for the agency to change its name, among other demands.


	Since Cosentino's Instagram post went live, several more artists — mainly indie acts — have responded to the controversy. Though these responses have varied somewhat, most have either announced their exit from the agency over the revelations or seemingly threatened to leave if Wasserman isn't held accountable for his actions. Nearly all have expressed support for their agents. On Monday evening (Feb. 9), Chappell Roan became the first major star to speak out on the issue, writing that she had left the agency amid the growing outrage (without explicity mentioning Epstein or Maxwell).


	The growing number of artist defections is now continuing to snowball into a major issue for Wasserman and his namesake agency, which represents such superstars as Ed Sheeran, Coldplay, SZA, Noah Kahan, Lorde and Kenny Chesney. Will any of those other big acts follow Roan's lead? 


	Below, we've rounded up every Wasserman artist who has spoken out on the issue. We'll continue updating the list as more of them make their feelings known.


On Monday (Feb. 9), Roan posted to Instagram that she had parted ways with the agency, stating, “I hold my teams to the highest standards and have a duty to protect them as well. No artist, agent or employee should ever be expected to defend or overlook actions that conflict so deeply with our own moral values. I have deep respect and appreciation for the agents and staff who work tirelessly for their artists and I refuse to passively stand by. Artists deserve representation that aligns with their values and supports their safety and dignity. This decision reflects my belief that meaningful change in our industry requires accountability and leadership that earns trust.”


Peck announced his exit from the agency via Instagram on Tuesday (Feb. 10), writing, “In light of the recent findings regarding Casey Wasserman, I have made the decision to no longer be represented by the Wasserman talent agency.” 


	“My heartfelt thanks goes out to my personal team, some of whom I have respected, trusted and worked with for close to a decade. I leave with a huge amount of compassion for the rest of the agents and staff at the agency, who are being left with a situation that impacts all of our work and livelihoods.”


On Thursday (Feb. 5), Cosentino, the frontwoman of indie pop duo Best Coast, took to Instagram to call for Wasserman to step down and for the agency to change its name. She also demanded the removal of her band's name from the company's website. 


	“As an artist represented by Wasserman, I did not consent to having my name or my career tied to someone with this kind of association to exploitation,” Cosentino wrote in part. “Staying quiet isn't something I can do in good conscience — especially in a moment when men in power are so often protected, excused, or allowed to move on without consequence. Pretending this isn't a big deal is not an option for me.”


The long-running Irish-American band revealed via Instagram Stories that it had left the agency in light of the new revelations, writing in part,  “It saddens us to part ways with [our agents], but the namesake of the agency is in the Epstein files so…we GONE.”


Brown, vocalist of the indie duo, slammed Wasserman's apology in an Instagram post, writing that his “‘deepest regrets' and PR apologies mean nothing in the wake of violence against women and children caused by Jeffrey Epstein, Ghislaine Maxwell, and their accomplices. There must be accountability for the atrocities committed by the ruling class. We cannot live in a world that allows for this injustice to occur with no consequence.


	Brown added that she, her bandmate Nick Amos and their manager “have no interest in being affiliated with Casey Wasserman and have absolutely zero intention of condoning his actions by silently remaining under his namesake banner. We trust our booking agents and are waiting to understand what our options are.”


Taking to Instagram, the acclaimed rock band said it had started “the process of extracting ourselves from” the Wasserman agency in light of the revelations. “Continuing to be represented by a company led by and named after Casey Wasserman goes against our values and cannot continue,” the statement continued. For the sake of his staff we hope that he steps down from the company and it is rebranded, but until that happens or we find a new home at a new agency we will not continue to be associated with Wasserman.”


On Monday (Feb. 9), the rock band released a statement on Instagram, writing that its members were “hugely disappointed and disgusted” to learn of Wasserman's association with Maxwell, adding that his “actions are abhorrent and disturbing on every level” and that he must “remove himself and his name from the agency.”


In a long and wide-ranging Instagram post on Monday (Feb. 9), Alexis Krauss, one-half of the duo Sleigh Bells, said that while she would “love to just leave Wasserman Music” over the revelations, she and her bandmate Derek E. Miller would not “because I love and respect our agent and I trust him to make the decision that is best for himself, his family and his artists. The agents at Wasserman are not the villains.”


	Krauss added, “In my opinion it's not the responsibility of the artists, especially those struggling to make a living, to fix these broken systems. I'm not saying we're powerless, but without systemic change and accountability for those at the highest levels of power, no meaningful change is going to occur. … None of these corporations are going to bat an eye if Sleigh Bells bails on them. It'll just leave us losing more money on tour and making less streaming income than we do now. It's a s–tty place to be but it's the truth. What we need is greater regulation and accountability at the highest levels of the industry.”


The pop duo, composed of Amelia Meath and Nick Sanborn, announced that it had left the agency following the revelations about Wasserman, writing that they are “so reprehensible that we can no longer allow our work to have any association with him or his name. We have been with our amazing agent for our entire career (since way before Wasserman acquired their former company in 2021), but she is just one of hundreds of brilliant agents, assistants, and other employees whose lives have been completely upended by both his behavior and his inability to be accountable of this actions. We don't know yet where we'll be next, but it will not be anywhere he is.”


On Tuesday (Feb. 10), Perez announced via Instagram Stories that she would depart the agency over the Casey Wasserman revelations. 


	“In light of the deeply disturbing news that has come to life regarding Casey Wasserman, I will no longer be represented by the agency,” she wrote. “It is devastating to witness how power in this industry is so often protected from accountability for choices that cause irreversible harm, and I will not tolerate it.


	“I want to be clear that there are many good and trustworthy people at Wasserman whose lives and livelihoods have been collaterally impacted by this. I know many within the organization are equally enraged and devastated by what has come to light.


	“I am currently working closely with my team as we take the proper next steps to appropriately restructure moving forward.”


	Later in her statement, Perez added a note of support for the agency's staff, writing that they “deserve the space to determine how they move through this transition with my support. One man's actions should not define or dismantle the futures of so many honest and dedicated individuals. I genuinely hope they are able to reach a resolution that allows them to move forward without him and rebuild what they've worked so hard to create.”

The Tennessee lawmaker cited sexual content that would be ""readily apparent across any language barrier,"" despite Benito not singing his most controversial lyrics.

	Tennessee Rep. Andy Ogles lashed out at Bad Bunny‘s history-making Super Bowl LX halftime show on Monday (Feb. 9), calling the singer's record-setting performance “pure smut, brazenly aired on national television for every American family to witness.” The conservative congressman wrote, that “children were forced to endure explicit displays of gay sexual acts, women gyrating provocatively, and Bad Bunny shamelessly grabbing his crotch while dry-humping the air.”

	The shocked response to what has been reported as the most-watched Super Bowl halftime show in history, with more than 135 million people tuning in, has drawn ire from a number of conservative voices, including Donald Trump. In a counterpoint to Benito's set, which carried a message of unity, love, respect and togetherness, Trump called the halftime show “absolutely terrible, one of the worst, EVER,” while condemning it as “an affront to the Greatness of America.” 


	In his post, Ogles claimed that Benito's set “openly glorified sodomy and countless other unspeakable depravities,” saying that such “flagrant, indecent acts are illegal to be displayed on public airways.” Because of his upset, Ogles said he is requesting that the Energy and Commerce Committee launch a formal congressional inquiry into the NFL and NBC for what he described as “their prior knowledge, deliberate approval and facilitation of this indecent broadcast.”

	











	At press time spokespeople for NBC and the NFL had not returned Billboard‘s request for comment on Ogles' post. 


	Ogles' letter to the House committee referenced the lyrics to two songs in Benito's set, which was the first-ever performed almost entirely in Spanish, “Safaera” and “Yo Perreo Sola,” which he said included sexual content that would be “readily apparent across any language barrier.” Although the Puerto Rican superstar did perform part of both songs — whose recorded versions do include explicit sexual lyrics — he skipped the most controversial lines during the halftime set.


	Ogles added, “these flagrant, indecent acts are illegal to be displayed on public airways. American culture will not be mocked or corrupted without consequence.”


	In addition, a fellow Republican congressman, Florida Rep. Randy Fine, wrote on X on Monday that Benito's “disgusting halftime show was illegal.” He also mused that “had he said these lyrics,” in reference to the original, NSFW lyrics to both in their recorded versions that were not sung, “and all of the other disgusting and pornographic filth in English on live TV, the broadcast would have been pulled down and the fines would have been enormous.” 


	Given the tremendous pushback from some in the MAGAverse who attempted to other Bad Bunny by claiming he was not American — despite Puerto Rico being a U.S. territory and its citizens being American citizens — Fine wrote “Puerto Ricans are Americans and we all live by the same rules,” ending his note with a familiar MAGA refrain: “lock them up.” 


	Conversely, at the MAGA-approved conservative Christian organization Turning Point USA counterprogramming livestream featuring friend of Trump Kid Rock found the rapper-turned-rocker-turned country crooner singing about “topless dancers,” crackheads, his “heroes in the Methadone clinics,” the “bastards at the IRS” and “crooked cops,” in addition to lines about taking shots of Jack and “caps of meth,” as well as “hookers all trickin' out in Hollywood” during his performance of his breakthrough 1999 single “Bawitdaba.”

The Real Housewives of New York alum called it ""the worst halftime show ever"" & complained that there were ""literally no white people"" in it.

	Katie Atkinson


Executive Digital Director, West Coast


	Days after going off on Bad Bunny‘s Super Bowl halftime show in a since-deleted social media video, Jill Zarin has been dropped from the upcoming Real Housewives of New York spin-off The Golden Life on E!, the show's studio announced Tuesday (Feb. 10).


	“In light of recent public comments made by Jill Zarin, Blink49 Studios has decided not to move forward with her involvement in The Golden Life,” the studio behind the RHONY reboot posted on Instagram. “We remain committed to delivering the series in line with our company standards and values.”

	











	Zarin was set to star alongside fellow Real Housewives of New York alumnae Luann de Lesseps, Ramona Singer, Kelly Bensmon and Sonja Morgan in the Palm Beach-set reality series, which was just announced on Feb. 3 and hadn't yet started production.


	In a minute-long video posted to Zarin's Instagram account on Sunday, the reality star called Bad Bunny's performance “the worst halftime show ever.”




	“It's 250 years that we're celebrating right now in the United States, and I just don't think it was appropriate to have it in Spanish,” Zarin said in the now-deleted video. “And quite frankly, I didn't need to see him grabbing his G-area. I think it was totally inappropriate. You've got all these young kids watching the Super Bowl, and he doesn't have to be grabbing himself every five seconds. Is he so insecure? Seriously. I don't speak Spanish. I would have liked to understand the words he was saying.”


	She also complained that the Puerto Rican superstar was making a “political statement” with the performance. “To me, it looked like a political statement, because there were literally no white people in the entire thing. I think it was a political statement, and I'm not taking a side one way or the other, I just do. I think it was an ICE thing.”


	She added that “the NFL sold out” by booking Bad Bunny and also accused guest performer Lady Gaga of getting a facelift that left her unrecognizable. “I didn't recognize her! I literally had to Google her face to see who it was.”


	Zarin was an original castmember on Bravo's New York-set Real Housewives from 2008 to 2011.

					By Baz Bamigboye 

Columnist/International Editor At Large


EXCLUSIVE: Regé-Jean Page, the swaggering Bridgerton star, is banking on starring in a new West End stage adaptation of The Great Gatsby, F. Scott Fitzgerald's doomed love story of old money and new money.


	“The Great Gatsby has always been a story incredibly close to my heart, and I couldn't be more excited about bringing this new adaptation to life in London's West End,” Page wrote, in an exclusive statement for Deadline.


	He called the version, written by Joel Horwood and Maria Aberg, “electric, glamorous, deeply romantic, utterly heartbreaking, and its profound insight into the past couldn't be more relevant to our current tumultuous 2020s.”

	











	Producers hope to line up a theater for the production, directed by Michael Longhurst, a former artistic chief of the Donmar Warehouse, to begin performances in the fall.




			Watch on Deadline		







	Once a West End house is confirmed, further casting can begin.


	Page and Longhurst go way back. The thespian's first professional role out of drama school was in a revival of Alan Bennett's The History Boys that Longhurst directed at Sheffield's Crucible Theatre.


	When he first read the Horwood and Aberg take on The Great Gatsby, Page said he was “struck by how it unlocked the complex nuances of the book, in ways I'd just never thought possible on stage. It digs into the white space of F. Scott Fitzgerald's original text with sharp purpose, and reveals the characters with a new vitality that feels both fresh and dangerous.”

	











	He adds: ”I've been looking for the right thing to do on stage for years, and this piece's delicate balance of spectacle and real human intimacy is something Mike [Longhurst] and I have always looked to excite and move audiences with. After we read it, we just both said: ‘My God, it's perfect. We have to do it.'.”


	Page, the star of Netflix film The Gray Man, Steven Soderbergh feature Black Bag, and upcoming romantic comedy You, Me & Tuscany, wasn't available for me to interview directly. 


Troubled times


	But he graciously agreed to post a response to a request to expand on his observations that Fitzgerald's 101 year-old novel couldn't be more relevant to our troubled times.


	“Without giving too much away,” Page composed, “one of the unique strengths of this new text is that it has as sharp an interest in the social critique of the times in F Scott Fitzgerald's original, as it does their devastating effect on the fragile, flawed people trying to live and dream through them. I don't think the two things can truly be separated. In all ways, this play is interested in boldly revealing the worlds behind Gatsby's dazzling facade.” 


	Longhurst filled in the gaps for me, and then I re-read what Page had addressed, as set out above. I do wish that we'd actually spoken, but I can see that he did not want to be misunderstood or misinterpreted.  


	The director says that he was thrilled to receive a text from Page saying, “Mike, I want to be Gatsby, do you fancy it?” 


	As it happens, Longhurst knew that Horwood and Aberg, his wife, both writers and directors, had crafted an epic portrait of The Great Gatsby that he was excited about, and he shared it with Page who was equally impressed.


	“I think this is very political. I think it's very probing,” Longhurst commends. “I think it's very dark. They brilliantly, essentially followed the origin story of Daisy and Gatsby from Gatsby starting life as a clam picker, all the way up to what he's achieved. And Daisy from her sort of stifling life in old money,” and watching how they intersect with each other against the backdrop of the changing world, Longhurst submits.


	“What the writers have done,” Longhurst explains, is extrapolate the themes of the novel and ensure it's a “properly probing work” that's “about the acquisition of wealth, and it's about capitalism and it's about social mobility. And I think all of these things get a really sharpened edge when Regé plays Gatsby because of his ethnicity.”


	Also, says Longhurst, Tom Buchanan, Daisy's bombastic husband, “is a white supremacist,” a point, he contends, that is sometimes sanitized in some other adaptations.


The Great Gatsby story is often seen as one of “excess and tragic love stories,” but Longhurst argues that it's about the acquisition of money and the American dream and progress, “and who is allowed to have money and who is allowed to pull levers and how power is achieved, and that's what the play's authors achieve,” to such an extent, Longhurst believes, that “you can just sort of feel this society hurtling towards destruction and it's kind of thrilling and terrifying.”


	Over the period of the novel, Gatsby and Daisy survive the epic Spanish influenza pandemic, a world war, and their solution, as they hurtle, “is to party hard, as they do in Cabaret, because they're all not looking at the bubble being about to burst,” Longhurst says.

	











	“And I think that's really resonant. But I think you need a properly intellectual, thrilling look at the story so that it's not just flapper girls and fireworks,” he says with succinct reasoning.


	I want to record that I wasn't even going to make an issue of Page's ethnicity, and Longhurst shares that the play's writers “had written this version and we read it and we haven't changed a word of it so far. It's not that we have written it for Regé's  ethnicity. It's just that when you look at that story and think about Gatsby as the new world order, which the old world order is fighting to not make space for, it becomes really, really charged. Literally the phrase ‘clam picker' cannot not be heard in a certain way when it's lobbed at Regé.”


	The director insists that “Regé' is fully on this and is really excited by this, but it's been really telling that it's not been adapted with that in mind…It's just really charged when that happens.”


	All of that makes me want to see it.


	Simon Friend is producing through his Melting Pot film and production company alongside Page's A Mighty Stranger banner.


	The award-winning producer has a history of working on literary adaptations. For instance, he transferred the Crucible Theatre's production of Life of Pi, based on Yann Martel's bestseller, to London and New York. He has also produced stage and film productions by Florian Zeller, often from translations by Christopher Hampton. One of their collaborations, The Father, won a Best Actor Oscar for Anthony Hopkins.


	Friend tells me that he was immediately struck by the “bold theatricality” of this particular version of The Great Gatsby.


	He calls it a “Gatsby for the theatre, distinct from any other take on the book, and very now. Regé's combination of effortless sophistication and intellectual rigour will make his Jay a memorable one.”


	Page appeared in many classical and modern plays while studying at the prestigious Drama Centre London. Earlier, he also trained at the National Youth Theatre. I saw none of that work, but around 10 or 11 years ago, I saw him tread the boards, just the once.


	And he was, showing, even then, a hint of the star quality to come, playing the role of Solanio with wit and menace in a production of The Merchant of Venice led by Jonathan Pryce as Shylock, and directed by Jonathan Munby.


	Now all he needs for his stage comeback is a theater.

	‘Boys of Tommen' is a sweeping romance told across six books. The streaming series wil take in the first and second novels in the series, Binding 13 and Keeping 13. Drama Republic, Temple Hill, and wiip are sharing production duties on the eight episode series alongside Amazon MGM Studios. Production is slated to start this year, meaning the show could hit Prime Video in 2027.




			Watch on Deadline		







	The show will follow the forbidden love story of Johnny Kavanagh, the star rugby player on the verge of a pro career, and Shannon Lynch, the talented but painfully shy new girl at the prestigious Tommen College in Ballylaggin, Ireland. Both teens are hiding secrets; Johnny, a potentially devastating injury and Shannon, a troubled and violent homelife.


	Walsh topped the New York Times bestseller list with her books, which were also huge on BookTok, another key barometer of a modern-day hit story. She said: “The response from readers around the world has been overwhelming, and knowing that everyone behind this production and book shares my passion for telling this story authentically means the world to me.”

	











	For Clemens, the show is a major play and comes on the heels of Manchester-set cop story Dirty, from Bridge of Spies scribe Matt Charman, meaning her first commissions are a combination of one big adaptation of popular IP and one original story.


	Clemens signed on as VP of International Originals at Prime Video last summer, swapping L.A. for London in the process. Having settled into life in the English capital, she said her immediate priorities are two-fold, building a UK and Ireland slate and zeroing in on the other shows made outside the U.S. that have big international potential.


	“There are two main focuses,” the former producer, agent and Paramount exec said. “I really wanted to come into the UK, and because of my longstanding relationships with talent and producers here, help build that slate. And I have a fantastic team in Gemma Brandler and Punit Mattoo and our team underneath them, but this is where I'm really hands on, and I'm in pitches, in the creative readings, everything.”


	Speaking about her other immediate goal a little over six months into the job, Clemens said: “There's probably a good handful, somewhere between 20 and 25 shows a year on average, that can travel. We call those ‘out of home country' shows. It's great when they go global, but that could also mean a show in Spain that travels all over Latin America. So those shows are the shows that I'm doing a deeper dive into in order to really help the teams connect the dots…to identify and amplify them.”


	When there's a new buyer in town, it's natural that local producers will want to know what they're after. That is certainly the case with Clemens and the UK's drama community. “What I've been communicating to producers and to talent is that we're making stories and shows for the UK. We'd love the show to travel, but they are not being reverse engineered, they are largely British producers, British writers, IP and talent.”


	She added: “I don't know everybody here, but I know a lot of people, and a lot of people know me having come here as an agent, having come here as FX, and as Paramount. I would say that my taste aligns with what I think a great Amazon show is, which is, ‘it can be populist literature', something that is entertaining, propulsive and fun, but it is ultimately about something.”


“Low bureaucracy”


	The other message for producers is Prime Video wants to be crystal clear about what it wants and the process of greenlighting. “It's important to be able to say the decisions are being made here and there's very low bureaucracy. What has maybe been perceived as a little bit of an opaque process, we're wanting to make it as transparent as possible, so that people know what we want, what we're looking for, and that we are moving quickly, and that we want to build the slate.”


	Bringing it back to ‘Boys of Tommen', the Prime Video exec said: “It's just an unbelievable constellation of characters, but it's also got such a specificity for place and the time. It talks about abuse, about bullying, about mental health, and it's about love. It's a romance series.”


	With six primary books in all, is this a franchise in the making? “Who knows how many we do, but hopefully it goes for a long time,” Clemens said. “There's plenty of material and plenty of incredible, rich characters.”


	Cogan is lead writer on ‘Boys of Tommen' and also an exec producer alongside author of the series, Walsh, wiip's Paul Lee, Hope Hartman and Sean Flanagan, Temple Hill's Wyck Godfrey, Marty Bowen, James Seidman and Annika Patten and Drama Republic's Greg Brenman and Deena Butt.

					By Jill Goldsmith 

Co-Business Editor


	Activist investor and Warner Bros. Discovery shareholder Ancora Holdings threatened to vote ‘no' on the Netflix deal and launch its own proxy fight if the WBD board does not engage with Paramount.


	The David Ellison company Tuesday sweetened its hostile takeover offer for Warner in its latest attempt to derail the company's agreement with Netflix. 


	The WBD board “now has no choice but to deem Paramount's amended offer as one that could reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Proposal, given Netflix's presently inferior proposal and unaddressed regulatory issues. Once that happens, the Board could then engage in good faith with Paramount to maximize shareholder value, paving the way for WBD to secure an even higher offer. If the WBD Board refuses to do this, Ancora will vote “NO” on the inferior Netflix deal and seek to hold the WBD Board accountable at the 2026,” the firm said in a presentation posted on its website.

	











	“The WBD Board opted to rush into a flawed deal with Netflix rather than earnestly pursue a superior offer from Paramount – in line with the directors' fiduciary duties,” it said. Ancora, a nearly $11 billion firm, said it has an approximately $200 million economic interest in Warner Bros. Discovery.




			Watch on Deadline		







	WBD said yesterday it was considering Paramount's revised offer, which has raised the heat on the board more than the Ellison's previous bids as it appears to address most of Warner's concerns. Today, it issued a second statement after Ancora jumped in, saying: “WBD's experienced and independent Board and management team have a proven track record of acting in the best interests of the Company and shareholders – as evidenced by the extensive actions they have taken to unlock the full value of WBD's unmatched portfolio of assets over the last year. We remain resolute in our commitment to maximize value for shareholders.”

	











	“Paramount Skydance just made things more interesting…Could the WBD Board take PSKY more seriously? Is this potentially an elegant off-ramp for NFLX?” asked Seaport Research analyst David Joyce in a note. “Paramount Skydance rather materially just addressed most of the Warner Bros Discovery Board's concerns with an economically enhanced offer for WBD shares.” 


	Ancora had also backed activist investor Nelson Peltz in his ultimately unsuccessful proxy fight against Disney in late 2022 and early 2023.


	Paramount did not raise its $30-a-share cash bid but injecting a new $0.25-per-share so-called “ticking fee” payable to WBD shareholders for each quarter its transaction has not closed beyond Dec. 31, 2026. It agreed to fund a $2.8 billion termination fee that would be payable to Netflix if WBD called things off. And it committed to work with WBD on debt financing costs and obligations.


	RedBird Capital's Gerry Cardinale, an investor in Paramount alongside the Ellisons, told CNBC the company has now “perfected” its offer “by taking off the table all of the, what I call more clerical items, that they have been using to suggest that they're not going to engage with us.” 


	“So we made it very clear that, you know, we will fund the $2.8 billion breakup fee. If they terminate with Netflix, we will pay that immediately to Netflix. Take that off the table. That does not come out of what we're paying to Warner Bros. shareholders in our $30 a share all cash offer. We will backstop the exchange offer that they need to execute by the end of the year, and if that fails, we will backstop paying the $1.5 billion fee that they owe to bondholders. So we've taken that off the table. “


	Par is offering the $30 in cash for all of WBD. Netflix has agreed to buy the Warner Bros. studios and streaming assets for $27.75 in cash. In a separate transaction, WBD would spin off its linear television assets into a separate public company called Discovery Global.


	Paramount continues to pound on the spinoff as the weak link in the Netflix deal.  WBD stockholders will receive shares in the new company that, depending on how they trade, could bridge the gap between the $30 and the $27.75. Not surprisingly, the WBD and Paramount camps have differing projections on where Discovery Global will trade. 


	WBD's debt is the issue. As the company splits in two, it will be allocating a portion of its its substantial debt to Discovery Global (possibly about $17 billion) and a portion to the studios and streaming, the business Netflix is buying. However, it has reserved the right to tinker with the amounts. If WBD decides to lighten the debt load on the cable company, the studio side would carry more debt and that could potentially change the cash consideration Netflix will fork out to WBD shareholders. 


	WBD has acknowledged this and the uncertainty around final price is a major talking point for Paramount and its allies. 


	WBD's board “cannot certify to Warner Brothers shareholders what the value of their deal is. They cannot. It is wholly predicated on where SpinCo [Discovery Global] ultimately trades. And the capitalization of that SpinCo is what will determine that,” said Cardinale.


	Paramount “is proposing to give shareholders real financial certainty with $30 per share in cash,” Ancora said today.


Battle Heats Up


	The latest fireworks follow an eventful last week. The Wall Street Journal reported that the Justice Department is looking at whether Netflix has engaged in anticompetitive tactics as it probes the streaming giant's proposed acquisition of Warner. And co-CEO Ted Sarandos defended the deal at a combative hearing on Capitol Hill.












	In an interview with Fox Business on Monday, Netflix chief global affairs office Clete Willems, called it DOJ questions “ordinary course of business stuff.” The Department is said to have send a second round of queries to both Netflix and Paramount.


	“Of course the Department of Justice is going to investigate this transaction and make sure it's good for our economy and good for our consumers,” Willems said. He said Netflix is also in touch with State Attorneys general.


	He insisted a Netflix deal is better for the country and for jobs than that Paramount s given the streamer's massive investment in content and, conversely, the magnitude of cost savings Paramount anticipates in what would be the biggest leveraged buyout in history. Par is looking at up to $6 billion in cost savings, much of which is expected to come from a reduced workforce. Netflix envisions $2-$3 billion but Willems said that would come mostly off licensing and other areas.


	Paramount believes it has a cleaner and faster path to clear regulators.


	President Donald Trump said recently he doesn't think he should be involved in the DOJ review of the deal, reversing a previous statement.


	Lawmakers from both sides of the aisle grilled Sarandos on topics from streaming dominance to the theatrical window to residuals to its so-called “political agenda.” Netflix says that it 80% of Netflix consumers already subscribe to HBO Max and Willems said the company is “confident this deal will give consumers more value for less money.” Sarandos at the hearing said he committed “under oath” to a 45-day window for Warner Bros. films. 


	The ball is once again in WBD's court as Wall Street and Hollywood await its response to Paramount's amended offer. Warner will hold a special shareholder meeting relatively soon — it's indicated April but there are some reports it may be earlier — to vote on the Netflix deal. Paramount has extended its ongoing tender offer to Feb. 20. It's asking WBD shareholders to tender their stock to Paramount, hoping to get a big enough contingent to sway the process.

Man, I wish a non-industry player would come in and blow both offers out of the water!

WBD board should terminate Netflix, so Paramount pays NFLX the termination fee. Then, NFLX takes that fee and immediately ups their bid with Paramount's cash, so WBD can then accept a new, higher Netflix deal.

You're 12, right?

Google Fred Disanto. It's political. He's MAGA.

Too many on this site are blinded by their politics. The board has a fiduciary responsibility to its shareholders and it looks like Ancora is finally recognizing that.

Trolls who have already sold their souls usually say, “just look at the dollar signs!” without questioning ethical motivations.

I hate to tell you this, grandpa. But the overwhelming majority of normal people are who you'd consider to be “trolls”.

The paramount deal is an objectively better offer for shareholders and consumers. The Netflix deal is an objectively better offer for Zaslav and loser political activists.

	Nicole Kidman is Dr. Kay Scarpetta, a medical examiner trying to unmask a serial killer in the upcoming Prime Video series Scarpetta, premiering March 11. The first trailer revealing the intensity of the hunt can be watched above. 


	Based on Patricia Cornwell's bestselling Kay Scarpetta book series, Scarpetta centers on the titular character, an unrelenting medical examiner, who, with skilled hands and an unnerving eye, is determined to serve as the voice of the victims, unmask a serial killer, and prove that her career-making case from 28 years prior isn't also her undoing.

	The series delves beyond the crime scene to explore the psychological complexities of the perpetrators and investigators across two timelines. From the past set in the late '90s, to her present-day, where she returns to her hometown and her former career while investigating a murder. Not only is Scarpetta pursuing justice, but she's also navigating complicated relationships like the fraught dynamic with her sister Dorothy Farinelli (Jamie Lee Curtis).

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	As you can see in the trailer, the leading cast is stacked with multiple award nominees and winners, including Bobby Cannavale as Detective Pete Marino, with Simon Baker as FBI profiler Benton Wesley, and Ariana DeBose as Kay's tech-savvy niece Lucy Watson. 


	The additional cast includes Rosy McEwen, Amanda Righetti, Jake Cannavale, and Hunter Parrish, who portray the past versions of Kidman, Curtis, Cannavale, and Baker's characters, respectively.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:deadline.com","Louis Theroux Confirms Netflix Manosphere Documentary & Opens Mindhouse Podcast Division, As He Addresses Bob Vylan Pod Criticism: “I'm Willing To Have Difficult Conversations & Long May It Continue”","https://deadline.com/2026/02/louis-theroux-inside-manosphere-adolescence-doc-bob-vylan-1236711225/","Wed, 11 Feb 2026 09:00:00 GMT","


					By Max Goldbart 

International TV Co-Editor


EXCLUSIVE: A year on from Adolescence hitting screens worldwide, Louis Theroux‘s investigation of the manosphere is coming to Netflix.


	Theroux's Mindhouse Productions has made a 90-minute feature doc fronted by  the celebrated UK documentarian. Mindhouse bosses Nancy Strang and Arron Fellows also revealed a Channel 4 doc with financial trader-turned campaigner Gary Stevenson, and a podcast division to “cut through the undergrowth of the [TV] commissioning process.”


	Netflix's Louis Theroux: Inside the Manosphere, which drops March 11, sees Theroux head to some dark and difficult places to examine a world inhabited by the likes of Andrew Tate. He speaks to the likes of Harrison Sullivan (AKA HS Tikky Tokky), Myron Gaines, Nicolas Kenn De Balinthazy (AKA Sneako), Justin Waller and Ed Matthews, people who are reshaping young men's ideas about masculinity and fuelling a resurgent global men's rights movement.

	Details of the show leaked last year and it was described as something of an Adolescence spin-off but Theroux told us exclusively his team started filming before Adolescence was even released.




			Watch on Deadline		







	“It's sort of nothing like Adolescence but it's in the precinct of what the boy in Adolescence might have been watching,” he said. “I guess Adolescence was a proof of concept, but I don't ever think we needed a proof of concept. We knew it was a hot subject.”


	Theroux detailed the strange sensation of filming Inside the Manosphere and seeing himself appear on the social media timelines of his subjects. “I knew they would be streaming or filming me and would put that content out,” he added. “And I hoped we'd get this feedback loop where there was a meta narrative that was then affecting my approach to the story. Sometimes it was kind of embarrassing. I'd arrive back from filming trips and my kids would say, ‘Dad what you were doing? You got owned.' That's a little bit painful but actually makes for a stronger film.”

	











Inside the Manosphere is Mindhouse's first Netflix feature since cyberstalker doc Can I Tell You A Secret? and is the first of several Mindhouse shows arriving in the coming months, with the team also revealing to Deadline a Channel 4 state-of-the-nation feature fronted by Stevenson, a former financial trader who has pivoted to becoming an activist against economic inequality and wrote a bestselling memoir, The Trading Game. 


Podcast studio “cuts through the undergrowth”


	Strang said Mindhouse has hit a healthy streak of balancing “state of the nation stuff in the UK and bigger plays in America.” 


	Meanwhile, Mindhouse is launching a podcast and digital studio. Theroux said Mindhouse Studios will “cut through some of the undergrowth of the commissioning process and the staffing process” when it comes to getting stories on screen as quickly as possible. 


	Theroux said launching his own podcast in lockdown was a “lightbulb moment for me to see how it connected with people and how these programs can connect with people, have a big reach and be fun to make.” 


	Mindhouse also produces Rylan Clark's podcast and the team wants to formalize its approach to making pods and think about opportunities in the digital landscape, which could involve making documentaries for digital platforms rather than having to go through the traditional commissioning process. Theroux, Strang, Fellows and company director Sophie Ardern will effectively oversee Mindhouse Studios, while producers Millie Chu and Francesca Bassett have been given senior roles.


	Now into its sixth season, Theroux has interviewed the likes of Ed Sheeran, Florence Pugh and Sean Penn on his pod. He used the latter interview as an example of why Mindhouse Studios can work so well. 


	“When I saw Sean Penn up in the Hollywood hills it would have made an amazing Louis Interviews… on BBC Two but it would have taken two days to film, and involved quite a big production, and six weeks in the edit,” he added. “That wasn't what Sean signed up for. Big stars like Sean will give you a couple of hours. I sometimes joke on the podcast that it's not a podcast, it's a s**t TV show. I don't know if that's advised but if by s**t you mean it's not conventionally shot and I stumble over my words a bit then it is kind of a s**t TV show.” 


“Proud of how we handled” Bobby Vylan


	One recent Theroux podcast generated headlines for what some may deem the wrong reasons. British Airways pulled sponsorship after Theroux interviewed the frontman of controversial hip-hop duo Bob Vylan, who had been widely condemned at Glastonbury for chanting “death to the IDF [Israel Defense Forces]” and making remarks about working for “f***ing Zionists.” 


	The Glastonbury incident almost cost BBC Director General Tim Davie his job. Addressing the interview and its criticism and fallout for the first time, Theroux told us it was “painful to lose a sponsor,” but he was resolute in his defense of the interview, in which frontman Bobby Vylan said he would do the chant again if he had the chance and had been hailed by BBC staffers for his behavior (the BBC declined comment at the time on the latter point).


	“That's what I do,” Theroux said. “That's my unique place in the British broadcasting landscape. I'm willing to have difficult conversations and long may it continue.” 


	He added: “The interview went out a couple of days after Manchester [a terrorist incident that saw Jewish people attacked and killed outside of a synagogue on the holy day of Yom Kippur], and there's a lot of fear that's real, and I want to acknowledge that. At the same time I'm very proud of how we handled the interview and how we did it. But I don't want to minimize the feelings that are going on.”

	











	Last year, Theroux made hard-hitting BBC doc The Settlers, in which he returned to the West Bank to profile illegal Israeli settlers at a time of extremely heightened tensions in the region.


	Strang said the doc proves the BBC is happy to take risks, and that this appetite hasn't been dented by the $10B Donald Trump lawsuit that did in the end do for the Director General. It is, however, the pace of TV commissioning and the difficulty of financing documentaries that has been holding back the sorts of story Mindhouse is trying to tell.


	Fellows added: “We often make quite sensitive documentaries where access is difficult or sensitive. Ultimately, because platforms and broadcasters want [access] sewn up before you go into that initial production process, you're having to keep relationships going for a hell of a long time with people who don't know the industry and you need to keep on board for six months to a year before things actually go into production. That can be really difficult.”


	Nevertheless, Strang said Mindhouse's “breadth” of content upcoming is where the indie wants to be. It even introduced its first feature at Sundance, Hanging By A Wire, about a school commute in Pakistan that turned into a nightmare when a cable car's wire snapped.


	“It's been a positive last 12 months,” said Strang. “There are challenges, less opportunities and budgets are tighter in lots of places, so it's not necessarilly been easy, but we are lucky to have been busy.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:pagesix.com","Britney Spears sells her iconic music catalog in ‘landmark' 9-figure deal","https://pagesix.com/2026/02/10/entertainment/britney-spears-sells-her-iconic-music-catalog-in-landmark-9-figure-deal/","Wed, 11 Feb 2026 00:47:00 GMT","

Britney Spears sold the rights to her iconic music catalog in a massive music deal, Page Six has learned.

The Grammy winner released her shares to Primary Wave, a private music publishing company based in New York City, on Dec. 30, according to documents obtained by TMZ Tuesday.

An insider told the outlet that the “landmark deal” was estimated to be in the same ballpark as the $200 million-dollar check Justin Bieber received when he sold his catalog in 2022.

The source shared that Spears, 44, was happy and celebrating with her two sons, Sean Preston Federline, 20, and Jayden James Federline, 19.

A rep for the Princess of Pop wasn't immediately available to Page Six for comment.

The sale, meanwhile, included the pop star's greatest hits, such as songs from her 1999 debut album, “… Baby One More Time.”

Additionally, her fourth studio album, “In The Zone,” which included her 2003 track “Toxic,” was also in the deal.

After releasing “Toxic,” Spears won her first Grammy for Best Dance Recording in 2005.

The contract also included Spears' late 1990s and early 2000s songs, such as “(You Drive Me) Crazy,” “…Baby One More Time,” “Oops!… I Did It Again,” “Everytime,” “Piece of Me,” “Hold It Against Me” and “Gimme More.”

It's not uncommon for musicians to sell their music videos, and Spears followed the lead of Stevie Nicks, Shakira, KISS, Bruce Springsteen, Phil Collins and Bob Dylan.

The hitmaker's massive business deal comes after she vowed “never [to] return to the music industry” in January 2024.

Spears, who was in a 13-year conservatorship from 2008 to 2021, released her last album, “Glory,” in 2016, and her last collab, “Mind Your Business,” in 2023.

Her final performance was in 2018 for her “Piece of Me” tour in Austin, Texas.

While the hitmaker has taken a personal step back from music, she's reportedly been helping her son Jayden with his music career.

“She's helping him connect with some producers she's worked with in the past,” an insider told Us Weekly last month. “She definitely wants him to utilize her old relationships so he's protected and guided through this.”

A source told the outlet Spears “loves” the teenager's style and “thinks he has such a fresh sound,” adding, “She's so proud of him and all the work he's clearly put into his passion.”

A person has been detained for questioning in connection with Nancy Guthrie's disappearance.

The person was detained during a traffic stop in Rio Rico, Ariz., south of Tucson near the Mexico border, the Pima County Sheriff's Department said on Tuesday evening. 

They also announced the department, assisted by the FBI's Evidence Response Team, obtained a search warrant for a location in Rio Rico related to the investigation.

“This operation is expected to last several hours. No further details at this time,” they said in a statement.

While the person has not yet been identified, TMZ reports the person is not a member of the Guthrie family. The Post says the individual is a man.

Additionally, FBI Director Kash Patel confirmed federal investigators were probing “persons of interest” during an appearance on Fox News Tuesday night.

“Without polluting the investigation, I will say we have made substantial progress in these last 36-48 hours, thanks to the technical capabilities of the FBI and our partnerships and I do believe we are looking at people who, as we say, are persons of interest,” he explained.

The individual, who identified himself only as Carlos, declared his innocence to reporters following his release.

“I asked, ‘The kidnapping of who?' and they told me this lady … I don't know her name,” he said.

“I told [officers], ‘I work in Tucson for GLS. I might have delivered a package to your house, but I never kidnapped anybody,'” Carlos declared.

The update comes after horrifying photos and videos of a potential suspect were released by the FBI on Feb. 10. However, it's not clear if the person detained is the person in the photos and videos.

In the images, an armed person in a ski mask was seen tampering with Nancy's home security camera on the morning she was reported missing.

In a Feb. 5 press conference, Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos told reporters that investigators were “actively looking at everybody” as a suspect.

“Does that mean we have a prime suspect? No,” he added, noting the Guthrie family had been “very cooperative.”

Nancy vanished from her Arizona home after being dropped off by son-in-law Tommaso Cioni on Jan. 31 following a family dinner. The matriarch was last seen around 9:30 p.m. — and caused alarm when she didn't show up to church the morning of Feb. 1.

The following day, Nanos confirmed in a press conference that the 84-year-old's Tucson residence was being treated as a crime scene due to “very concerning” circumstances.

Savannah, 54, released a statement at the time, reading, “On behalf of our family, I want to thank everyone for the thoughts, prayers and messages of support. Right now, our focus remains on the safe return of our dear mom.”

Later that evening, the NBC personality pleaded with her Instagram followers to pray for her mother's safe return.

The journalist, notably, remained off air while navigating the family crisis and pulled out of hosting the Winter Olympics.

Nanos revealed on Feb. 3 that Nancy was believed to have been “taken from the home against her will, possibly in the middle of the night.”

The sheriff had previously emphasized Nancy's “sound mind,” explaining, “This is an elderly woman in her mid-80s who suffers from ailments. … She couldn't go 50 yards.”

The Los Angeles Times reported that the home showed signs of forced entry, with NewsNation releasing a video of what appeared to be a trail of blood outside the front door. Nanos later confirmed during the Feb. 5 press conference that the blood was Nancy's.

Nanos has consistently shared his hopes during the investigation that Nancy is still alive.

He noted on Feb. 4 that the “clock [was] ticking” because Nancy's “critical” medication had been left behind, meaning her alleged captors had “placed her in great jeopardy.”

Multiple ransom notes were sent to local news organizations, allegedly containing chilling details about Nancy's home and outfit pre-disappearance.

Savannah, Annie and Camron filmed an emotional Instagram video on Feb. 4 telling the alleged captors, who have asked for millions in Bitcoin, they're “ready to talk” — and sending love to their mom.

Camron did the same in an additional video Feb. 5, then joined his sisters for a third plea two days later.

In the Feb. 7 upload, Savannah said, “We beg you now to return our mother to us, so that we can celebrate with her. This is the only way we will have peace. This is very valuable to us, and we will pay.”

Ahead of the final ransom deadline on Feb. 9, Savannah pleaded for help finding her mom, as there were still no suspects.

Meanwhile, at NBC, the network reportedly ramped up security and police presence at its “tense” New York City studio out of an “abundance of caution.”

Savannah's co-hosts expressed on-air how “rattled” they felt, with Sheinelle Jones saying, “A lot of us [have] had trouble sleeping.”

The journalists — including former co-anchor Hoda Kotb — sent Savannah their love as the Daytime Emmy winner, according to Nanos, coped by “leaning on” her family members.

Oops!

Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni seemed to be on the same fashion wavelength as they arrived at an NYC courthouse Wednesday for the start of a heated legal battle.

The duo — who have been locked in a public dispute since before their 2024 film “It Ends With Us” hit theaters — showed up in coordinating outfits for the occasion, both wearing army green jackets punctuated with pops of pink.

Lively suited up in an oversized blazer and pants paired with a light green striped sweater, which was layered over a pink striped button-up shirt.

The 38-year-old actress, who played a flower shop owner in the film and incorporated florals into many of her “It Ends With Us” press looks, added a pink floral pin to her jacket pocket.

She carried a matching green suede bag and wore boots in the same shade.

Lively's husband, Ryan Reynolds, was not with the star as she entered the closed hearing, but it's possible she chose to channel her spouse at court; Reynolds wore a similar green suit and floral accent to the New York premiere of “It Ends With Us” in August 2024.

Baldoni, meanwhile, dressed down in gray windowpane slacks and a white crewneck shirt with an olive green overcoat and salmon pink scarf. His wife, Emily Baldoni, went monochromatic in a tan coat and beige sweater dress.

Today, the pair will have a final chance to resolve their legal issues ahead of their May trial.

There has been much back-and-forth between Baldoni and Lively, who starred in the Colleen Hoover novel adaptation and clashed behind the scenes.

In December 2024, Lively filed a lawsuit against Baldoni, accusing him of sexual harassment, which he vehemently denied. The director countersued in January 2025, though the case was later dismissed.

Unsealed communications have drawn several A-listers into the case, including Taylor Swift, Scarlett Johansson and Ben Affleck.

A man maintained his innocence after he was released from being detained for questioning in the disappearance of Savannah Guthrie's mom, Nancy Guthrie.

The individual, who identified himself only as Carlos, told ABC15 Arizona's Ford Hatchett that he was pulled over while DoorDashing in Rio Rico, Ariz., on Tuesday and was being “detained for kidnapping.”

“I asked, ‘The kidnapping of who?' and they told me this lady … I don't know her name,” he said as Hatchett helped Carlos identify the woman as Savannah Guthrie's 84-year-old mom.

“I told [officers], ‘I work in Tucson for GLS. I might have delivered a package to your house, but I never kidnapped anybody,'” Carlos declared.

He said officials told him he was “free to go” after answering their questions about Nancy's disappearance. 

Carlos told reporters that he allegedly wasn't read his Miranda rights until “two hours” after they detained him and that his wrists were swollen from how tight the handcuffs were on him.

On Tuesday, the Pima County Sheriff's Department revealed they detained someone for questioning in connection with Nancy's disappearance.

“This operation is expected to last several hours. No further details at this time,” they said in a statement.

Authorities also said they obtained a search warrant for a location in Rio Rico related to the investigation.

The update came hours after the FBI released horrifying home security camera photos of an armed masked person outside of Nancy's door the night she disappeared. 

In the videos and photos, the individual stood on Nancy's front porch, wearing gloves, as the person tampered with her door camera.

The FBI said the video was “recovered from residual data located in backend systems.”

“Working with our partners — as of this morning, law enforcement has uncovered these previously inaccessible new images showing an armed individual appearing to have tampered with the camera at Nancy Guthrie's front door the morning of her disappearance,” they said in a statement.

Page Six spoke with longtime private investigator Andy Kay, who told us the surveillance videos came from Nest and that the “cameras will record to the servers as long as they have internet.”

Once images of the suspect were released, Savannah, 54, posted them on Instagram, pleading for the safe return of her mother.

“We believe she is still alive. Bring her home,” she captioned one of her posts, with a second caption reading, “Someone out there recognizes this person. We believe she is still out there. Bring her home.”

The “Today” show host and her relatives were instructed to place $6 million in a bitcoin account by 5 p.m./7 p.m. ET MT Monday as a second ransom deadline.

Though they did not pay the ransom before the deadline expired, Page Six confirmed that activity was recently shown in the bitcoin account.

Nancy was last seen on Jan. 31 after she was dropped off at her Tucson, Ariz., home by her daughter Annie and her son-in-law Tommaso Cioni following a daily dinner.

Police were notified that the elder was missing when she didn't attend a viral church service the following morning.

During the investigation into her disappearance, authorities found a trail of blood at the home that belonged to Nancy.

Mick Jagger's fiancée, Melanie Hamrick, claimed she was “physically attacked” at a social club in London.

“This is incredibly hard to share, but I was physically attacked at Annabel's Mayfair tonight,” the choreographer wrote in a since-deleted Instagram post.

“I'm so thankful to my friends for protecting me. Two people grabbed me from behind and thank god for good people who stepped in to help me,” Hamrick, 38, added.

“I'm shaken, sad and heartbroken that people can treat each other this way.”

Page Six has reached out to Hamrick and Annabel's for comment but did not immediately hear back. 

Hamrick and Jagger, 82, met in February 2014, when she attended a Rolling Stones concert with other American Ballet Theatre dancers.

That summer, they began officially dating — despite their 44-year age gap.

After two years of dating, the couple welcomed the “Paint It, Black” hitmaker's eighth child, son Deveraux Octavian Basil, in 2016.

Last year, Hamrick officially confirmed she and Jagger had been engaged for roughly three years but were in no rush to walk down the aisle.

“Maybe one day we'll marry, maybe not. We are so happy in our current life that I would be too afraid to change anything,” she told Paris Match in April 2025.

Hamrick's alleged attack comes days after the longtime partner of Jagger's granddaughter Assisi Jackson, Alexander Key, is believed to be dead. 

After being reported missing on Jan. 24, a body was discovered in the sea at Bude, England. He was 37.

Police said his death “is not being treated as suspicious” and that an autopsy will be performed.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","David Zucker is not a fan of what Paramount did with Naked Gun reboot","https://www.avclub.com/naked-gun-david-zucker-paramount","Wed, 11 Feb 2026 14:04:07 GMT","

David Zucker directed the first two Naked Gun movies and contributed to the script for the third. He says he, Pat Proft and Mike McManus had an idea for a fourth movie—which eventually manifested as The Naked Gun last summer—but it was not destined to move forward. “We set our Naked Gun 4 in the James Bond, Bourne Identity, Mission: Impossible world, so it wasn't the same thing. It wasn't copying. It would have been with a young comic actor like Andy Samberg,” Zucker says in a new interview with The Independent. However, he says that Paramount, which was also the studio behind the three original films, instead decided to “merely try to, with blinders on, copy a 30-40 year old idea… and replacing Leslie Nielsen, what a moronic thing to do!” 

That is not the extent of the issues Zucker has with the 2025 film, which was produced by Seth McFarlane and Erica Huggins. “Paramount ruined the franchise, and it's too bad, but I repurposed the script as ‘Counter Intelijence', spelled with one l and a j. It's just such a great script. Maybe someday it'll be done,” says Zucker. However, it sounds like his issues are more with the corporate side of things than with the talent who participated in the reboot. “Seth called me, and the director [Akiva Schaffer] is a very nice guy. He came to my house twice. They are just so respectful and so complimentary. They idolise these movies. So how can you be angry or mad at somebody who keeps telling you what a genius you are? But it's frustrating in the business… all I care about is doing something original. I don't want to do what I did before.”

Then again, The Independent reports that he added “with a laugh,” “They just so fucked it up… We would have truly rebooted the franchise with young actors, and Seth MacFarlane ruined it. So what can I do?” That all being said, Zucker hasn't actually seen the new film, rationalizing, “If your daughter became a prostitute, would you go watch her work?”

Bad Bunny delivered a visually striking performance at the Super Bowl halftime show, but one detail sparked immediate curiosity among viewers. The Puerto Rican superstar wore a cream-colored football jersey with the name “Ocasio” and the number 64 across the back. The choice was not a stylistic flourish alone. It was a personal tribute rooted in family history.

Fans quickly began speculating about the number's meaning during and after the performance at Levi's Stadium. According to Billboard, the number refers to the birth year of Bad Bunny's late uncle, a figure who played a formative role in the artist's life.

A post shared by NFL (@nfl)

Bad Bunny, whose real name is Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasio, used the jersey to honor his uncle's memory and influence. The gesture aligned with a halftime show that blended spectacle with personal storytelling.

The number 64 represents 1964, the birth year of Bad Bunny's uncle, according to Rolling Stone. The artist has credited his uncle with introducing him to American football while he was growing up in Puerto Rico. Their shared interest in the sport became a lasting bond.

Rolling Stone reported that Bad Bunny chose to memorialize that relationship on one of the largest stages in entertainment. The name “Ocasio” on the jersey further emphasized the tribute by highlighting the performer's family identity.

The decision is also connected symbolically to the setting. The halftime show took place at the home stadium of the San Francisco 49ers, a team Bad Bunny's uncle supported, according to Elle. By incorporating football imagery into his wardrobe, the artist bridged personal memory with the cultural significance of the Super Bowl itself.

Vogue reported that the jersey formed part of a custom look styled by longtime collaborators, blending sportswear references with a refined monochromatic palette. The design allowed the tribute to function as both a fashion statement and an emotional symbol.

The jersey complemented a performance widely noted for its emphasis on heritage, identity, and storytelling. According to Elle, Bad Bunny has consistently integrated autobiographical references into his public appearances, often using clothing as a narrative device.

In this context, the number 64 served as a subtle but meaningful detail within a larger cultural presentation. Rather than explain the reference directly during the performance, the artist allowed the symbol to speak through context and later reporting.

That restraint helped the tribute resonate beyond spectacle. The halftime show celebrated global pop influence, but the jersey grounded the moment in family memory. It illustrated how personal experiences continue to shape Bad Bunny's artistic identity even at the height of mainstream visibility.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","UPDATE: Released Man in Nancy Guthrie Case Recounts ‘Terrifying' Arrest","https://entertainmentnow.com/news/nancy-guthrie-detained-man-speaks-out/","Wed, 11 Feb 2026 11:26:23 GMT","

The man detained for questioning in the search for Nancy Guthrie speaks out following his release.

The subject, who identified himself as “Carlos,” described his experience as “terrifying.”

“I felt like I was being kidnapped,” he told a reporter outside of his home in Rio Rico, Arizona. “They didn't tell me anything at the beginning.”

The man clarified that he was pulled over at the traffic stop and was detained at the back of the police car.

“I was being detained. I was detained the whole time,” the man added. “That's what they told me at the back of the car, and they moved me to Pima County Sheriff.”

The released man said law enforcement asked him basic information, including his first and last name, date of birth, and social security number. He was also questioned about his whereabouts.

In another interview, “Carlos” said his wife was the one driving when authorities pulled them over.

“Once I saw they were following me, I pulled over,” he told ABC15 Arizona reporter Ford Hatchett outside of the detention center. “They didn't even have to put a traffic stop or anything. I got off the car, and they arrested me as soon as I got out of the car.”

He added that authorities didn't tell him what was going on until detectives arrived.

“They told me I was being detained for kidnapping. I asked them, ‘kidnapping of who?'” he said. “I told them … I might have delivered a package to their house, but I never kidnapped anybody.”

“Carlos” maintained that he never heard of Nancy Guthrie until the day he was arrested.

When asked about the Pima County Sheriff's Department's announcement that a person of interest had been detained, he admitted he was “not happy” about becoming involved.

“I'm glad they're doing their job.” he added. “[But] they're chasing the wrong person.”

Deputies detained an individual during a traffic stop about an hour south of Tucson on Tuesday.

The move came hours after the FBI released surveillance images showing an armed, masked man outside Nancy's residence on the night she disappeared.

The FBI is still offering a $50,000 reward for information about Nancy or her abductor.

Shortly after the release of surveillance images and video, Savannah Guthrie reposted them on her Instagram, saying, “We believe she is still alive. Bring her home.”

It has been an emotional and challenging time for Savannah Guthrie and her family after her mother, Nancy Guthrie, disappeared on February 1. In the days that have followed, new details about her alleged kidnapping case have emerged, including the FBI releasing photos of a possible subject on Tuesday, February 10. It was after this that Guthrie's husband, Michael Feldman, broke his silence on social media to address the footage of the alleged abductor. 

Feldman shared footage on Instagram of the alleged abductor in Nancy's case. The black-and-white video, which appears to have been filmed at night on a door camera, shows a suspect wearing a black ski mask and latex gloves. It appears to be a man, and footage shows what appears to be a gun in a holster on his waist. The suspect also has a large backpack. In the caption, Feldman shared his thoughts, writing, “Someone out there may recognize this person. Please help us. Bring her home.” 

Fans and loved ones have flooded the post's comments with messages of support. “Sending yours and the entire Guthrie family prayers and wisdom for the professionals working hard for Nancy's swift and safe return,” a comment reads. “Sending you guys so much love. You're constantly on my mind,” another shared. 

Messages also include one from Katie Couric, who wrote, “Mike, Molner and I have been thinking about you and Savannah and the kids and of course the entire Guthrie family. We are sending you love, support, and hope from afar.” 

CNN news anchor Dana Bash wrote, “sending you love.” And Monica Lewinsky wrote, “sending love to you all…”

This is Feldman's first public Instagram post since Nancy's disappearance. However, his wife and her colleagues have regularly shared updates with fans. Law enforcement officials have been working tirelessly to locate Nancy Guthrie, who was reported missing on Sunday, February 1. She is 84. 

The latest break in her disappearance and believed kidnapping, according to People, came on Tuesday, February 10, when the footage of a person of interest was circulated. Later a man was detained for police questioning. KNXV reporter Lillian Donahue made a statement on X in the early hours of Wednesday, February 11. “BREAKING: the man detained AND NOW RELEASED by authorities during the Nancy Guthrie investigation says he had no idea what was happening and that he just works as a delivery driver in Tucson,” she wrote.

Nancy's whereabouts remain unknown.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","SWAT, Hostage Rescue Teams Dispatched Amid Search for Nancy Guthrie: REPORT","https://entertainmentnow.com/news/swat-team-nancy-guthrie-search/","Wed, 11 Feb 2026 01:22:47 GMT","

Two armored SWAT vehicles were seen departing the Pima County Sheriff's Office on Tuesday, February 10, as the search for Nancy Guthrie continues. 

In video shared by Fox True Crime, Pima Regional Tactical Rescue vehicles were seen exiting the parking lot at the Pima County Sheriff Department.

“It is unclear if the movement is related to [the] investigation surrounding Nancy Guthrie,” the outlet tweeted. “Fox News observed deputies loading shields and other tactical gear before leaving.”

Reporter Brian Entin, who has been on the scene in Tucson since Guthrie was first reported missing, later revealed, “The FBI's elite hostage rescue team is in Tucson, sources tell me.”

Police activity intensified on Tuesday near the home of Annie Guthrie and husband Tommaso Cioni, Daily Mail reported. The outlet reported that search and rescue teams examined nearby homes, businesses, and a riverbed in the area.

“Law enforcement is going door to door around the neighborhood of Nancy Guthrie's other daughter, Annie's home. There is at least one official here with the Pima County Sheriff's department and another person with the FBI,” reporter Jacob Owens shared via X from the scene. 

According to law enforcement sources, Nancy Guthrie's abductors are believed to be from the Tucson, Arizona, area, TMZ reported on Tuesday, February 10.

“The operating theory is that the ransom notes were written by the kidnapper, and those notes provide clues on where the abductor lives,” the outlet reported. 

The news comes one day after the deadline on the alleged ransom letter received by TMZ and various local news outlets expired. 

TMZ previously reported that the kidnappers promised to return Nancy within 12 hours of receiving their $6 million bitcoin demand, which they determined would confirm a 700-mile search radius. 

As of Tuesday evening, the outlet confirmed there has been “activity for the first time in the Bitcoin account listed in the first ransom note.” They did not reveal the amount that was apparently transferred. 

Savannah Guthrie pleaded with her mother's captors to return the 84-year-old to her family, in an emotional video shared via Instagram. 

“We received your message, and we understand,” Savannah said in her Sunday video. “We beg you now to return our mother to us so that we can celebrate with her. This is the only way we will have peace. This is very valuable to us, and we will pay.”

“The images released today are a critical update in our search for the individual or individuals who may be responsible for Nancy Guthrie's disappearance,” Christopher Raia, the Deputy Director of the FBI, tweeted on Tuesday. “If you have any information that could be beneficial to the case, we need to know.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Law Enforcement Believes Nancy Guthrie Suspect Is From Tucson: REPORT","https://entertainmentnow.com/news/nancy-guthrie-suspect-lives-in-tucson/","Wed, 11 Feb 2026 00:52:17 GMT","

Authorities have reason to believe that the suspect who kidnapped Nancy Guthrie from her home in Catalina Foothills is also from the Tucson, Arizona, area, TMZ reported.

According to TMZ's law enforcement sources involved in the investigation, the person seen in the images and security footage from the night Nancy was taken is also likely somewhere within a 700-mile radius of Tucson, given the fact that they said they'd return Nancy within 12 hours after receiving their $6 million ransom demand.

TMZ's law enforcement sources also have reason to believe that the kidnapper is the person navigating and writing the ransom letters. Being that the abductor sent their first ransom letter to two local TV stations in Tucson, authorities told the outlet that the person of interest must be familiar with the area. The second ransom demand was also sent to a local TV station in Tucson — providing investigators with further reason to suggest that the kidnapper is well versed on where in the area would have the most reach when it came to reporting on their ransom demands.

In the same report, law enforcement told TMZ that the photos of the suspect shared on Tuesday, Feb. 10, were sent straight to the public after authorities obtained them.

When the suspect's images were released to the public in hopes of someone recognizing the person of interest, TMZ reported that the footage was likely captured by a Nest camera on Nancy's front porch.

The images and video showed the suspect as they approached Nancy's front door while wearing black rubber gloves, a ski mask and a backpack. Before entering the home, the suspect tampered with one of the cameras on the 84-year-old's doorstep, according to FBI Director Kash Patel, per TMZ. 

After the surveillance footage went viral, Savannah Guthrie reposted the photos and video to her Instagram, where she has shared several videos in which she and her siblings, Camron and Annie Guthrie, have pleaded with their mom's kidnapper, telling them that they want to talk to them. The Guthrie family has also stated their request for proof of life.

Savannah captioned the suspect's images reposted from the Pima County Sheriff's Department, reiterating her family's belief that their mom, Nancy, is still in a condition to make a return home to them.

“Someone out there recognizes this person. We believe she is still out there. Bring her home,” Savannah wrote. “Anyone with information, please contact 1-800-CALL-FBI (1-800-225-5324) or the Pima County Sheriff's Department 520-351-4900.”

At the annual Oscar nominations lunch, gauging the applause meter is part of the game, as the Academy rep (in this case, Lou Diamond Phillips) calls each nominee up to the riser for the class photo. This year, 197 Oscar nominees, including four international director nominees, made the trek to the Beverly Hilton.

“Your storytelling is the greatest truth we have,” Academy president Lynette Howell Taylor told the gathering. “Giving your time and energy to this art form is crucial because movies can change perspectives.”

Missing were “One Battle After Another” star Sean Penn, “Sentimental Value” star Renate Reinsve, and Original Screenplay nominee “It Was Just an Accident” co-writer Mehdi Mahmoudian, who was sent to prison in Iran earlier this month. Writer/director Jafar Panahi will return to Iran after the Oscars, he told me soberly, knowing he may end up there as well.

The celebrities always score the most noise. “Sinners” generated warm applause for Michael B. Jordan, Wunmi Mosaku, and my tablemate Delroy Lindo (who is writing his memoirs), as well as writer/director Ryan Coogler. 

But so did “One Battle After Another” writer/director Paul Thomas Anderson and star Leonardo DiCaprio, who is about to start his new Martin Scorsese movie with Jennifer Lawrence (“What Happens at Night”) and said he can't wait to see David Fincher's “Once Upon a Time in Hollywood” sequel about Cliff Booth, as well as Teyana Taylor, who hung out during the lunch with Kate Hudson (“Song Sung Blue”).

 










Actress Emma Stone (“Bugonia”) got a big round, along with the “KPop Demon Hunters” team, who gathered round for a photo with Timothée Chalamet. Also drawing cheers were “Frankenstein” director/producer Guillermo del Toro, first-timer Jacob Elordi, and composer Alexandre Desplat, who has been nominated 12 times and won twice (“The Shape of Water” and “The Grand Budapest Hotel”).

Steven Spielberg went up on the riser as the producer of “Hamnet” after a chat with Lindo: it made his day. The Oscars planners saved the best for last as Chalamet, Coogler, Anderson, Del Toro, and Jessie Buckley all were called up at the end and brought down the house.

Ethan Hawke and Chloé Zhao had a chat during the lunch, as did Chalamet and DiCaprio, Benicio Del Toro and Oliver Laxe (“Sirat”), and Warners exec Michael De Luca and “F1” producer Jerry Bruckheimer, who has many sequels in the works including a new “Top Gun,” “Heat 2,” and a “Pirates of the Caribbean” film with Margot Robbie.

Making the rounds instead of Bob Iger were newly appointed Disney CEO Josh D'Amaro and his content chief Dana Walden, whose ABC has a contract to run the Oscars through 2028. After that, the show will move to YouTube.

At long last, on March 15, the Oscars will give out the gold statue for Best Casting. The Oscar executive producers Raj Kapoor and Katy Mullan are back for their third consecutive year, and their second with host Conan O'Brien. The producers promise some surprise visits from Oscar veterans and a special musical interlude — one reason they kept the song nominee performances down to just two (the most popular “Golden” from “KPop Demon Hunters” and “I Lied to You” from “Sinners”).

 










Ratings could pick up this year, because the Oscar leaders — “One Battle After Another,” “Sinners,” “Hamnet,” and “Marty Supreme” — are all box office hits.

While many major Oscar categories are easy to call right now (hello, “Hamnet” star Jessie Buckley), winning your Oscar pool requires figuring out the winners of the craft categories, documentaries, and shorts. The VFX team from “Avatar: Fire and Ash” is one to count on.

And on the documentary feature side, “The Alabama Solution” nominee Andrew Jarecki reported that after waiting a year after the film's debut at Sundance, the Alabama prison system did put his two lead activists, Melvin Ray and Robert Earl Council, back into solitary confinement, but that rousing protests eventually got them returned to their cells.

The 98th Oscars air Sunday, March 15 on ABC. See more photos from inside the room below.

Zipping along the 101 freeway from downtown Los Angeles up to Santa Barbara, writer/director Bart Layton's “Crime 101” certainly understands at least one thing: that driving around L.A. at night is always cinematic, even if other hours of the sun-bleached day in the Southern California city are inherently less so.

The “Magnolia” of Michael Mann knockoffs — and one with enough slowly gliding overhead drone shots of the city to only start to feel like the downtown LA screensaver on your Apple TV in its interstices — “Crime 101” is an effective, not to mention star-packed, thriller that mostly succeeds at what it's trying to achieve, and directed by the guy who broke out big in 2012 with the mind-bending, true-crime impersonation documentary “The Impostor.”

The ensemble includes Chris Hemsworth, Halle Berry, Barry Keoghan, Corey Hawkins, Monica Barbaro, Tate Donovan, and Nick Nolte in a pricey-looking made-for-Amazon crime epic that will stream fine on Prime, will perhaps play even better on airplanes, but also may even deserve your eyes and ears in theaters. That's even as, creatively, this film feels like it's hijacking at least 15 other, better movies, whether Mann's “Heat” and “Collateral” or Nicolas Winding Refn's “Drive” or “Bullitt” with Steve McQueen, simply by the green shade of Hemsworth's car.

What does not package “Crime 101” neatly for theaters is the fact that second-screen viewing is basically not an option. Adapting and expanding upon a lean Don Winslow novella, Layton adds many sometimes unnecessarily complex ingredients to the pot, with characters intersecting and allegiances and motivations often contradicting one another. 

To boil it down, the film's central antihero is the taciturn, steely, and just-on-the-verge-of-disillusioned jewel thief Mike Davis (Hemsworth, seemingly cast because of his work with Mann as a skilled hacker on “Blackhat,” and absolutely not because he played Thor). His string of heists up and down the 101 has left Detective Lou Lubesnick (Mark Ruffalo, ever these days playing an alcoholic, a divorcée, or a cop, and here he's just two of them) mystified. Mike lives a lonely life seemingly devoid of any interiority, working for an over-the-hill crime boss known as Money (Nick Nolte), whom Mike has managed to piss off with his less-than-spotless latest burglary. Mike elects to go out on his own, and thus Money dispatches the mangy-looking kill machine Orman (Barry Keoghan; bleach-blond hair plus exposed roots = sociopath) to intercept Mike's next job and take him down.

The three central male characters — Mike, Lou, and Orman — all converge on the archetype of the lone wolf, a dubious label the collaboration-shirking Lou has taken on in his precinct, and one his colleagues are decidedly over. Lou's personal life, meanwhile, is in shreds, and if you're looking to cast an actress as an embittered soon-to-be-ex who will read you your emotional rights in a diner booth over coffee, you know who to call: Jennifer Jason Leigh, who, in a brief but always welcome role, oozes unhappiness. The female characters are mostly malnourished, whether Lou's wife or Monica Barbaro as Mike's potential new flame, and in a role that is very much just someone's girlfriend (and Barbaro makes the best of her first big-screen part since “A Complete Unknown” earned her an Oscar nomination). The film at least mines some charm from a fender-bender as a meet-cute.

 










But also woven into the mystery is Sharon (a potent Halle Berry), an insurance broker who is the victim of not just sexism but ageism, too, at her workplace. Her clients are typically LA's uber-wealthy (like a creepy Tate Donovan, who's here married to a teenager Sharon at first thinks is his daughter), so she knows not only where the high-priced diamonds from Antwerp are coming in and going out from, but also where the bodies are buried. Mike eventually links up with Sharon, who links up with Lou, who might be pumping her for information on how to get to Hemsworth's mercenary. 

Sharon, for whom the meditation-and-sleep app Headspace plays a regular soundtrack in her life whether in bed or in her car, enjoys a line of work that's also made her cannily perceptive about human nature: She knows that Mike, whom she's tasked with collecting “walkaway money” for the both of them by stealing from her client, is a man with no friends, no family, no life of his own. Hemsworth makes his character's unreadability mostly compelling, even if the role is about as complex as an automatic car running on four-wheel drive.

But Layton locates friction in other places, especially in Ruffalo's what-else-but grizzled turn as a shaggy, Raymond Chandler-type police detective. As shady and seedy as Layton's Los Angeles is here, “Crime 101” also manages to feel like something of a loving ode to the city itself: shot on location, making the case for bringing production back to this very cinematic City of Dreams (and sex, and drugs, and crime). Even as cheap shots of downtown LA's skid row try to jam in social context uneasily. Erik Wilson's cinematography suffers from a bout of what you might call Netflix (or in this case, Prime Video) lighting, undersaturated in the wrong places and often turning the nightscape into a dark void, not necessarily on purpose. 

 










Layton and his editorial team don't quite know how to cut all the pieces into an operatic, satisfying whole. An early car chase is indeed thrilling, as “Crime 101” understands how suspense is built from bumper-to-bumper heist sequences — with successive cuts that reveal information across different corners of the film's world — but the emotional stakes tend to be missing. Berry, though, gets a big crowd-pleasing moment toward the film's too tidily wrapped-up ending, walking away with what's as close to catharsis or redemption as anyone receives here. 

While “Crime 101” runs like a remodeled version of earlier, better heist movies from the '90s or early 2000s (which again are almost always coming from Michael Mann) but with lesser parts, there's enough gas in the tank and competence at the wheel to merit a spin. At least until “Heat 2.”

“Crime 101” opens in theaters on Friday, February 13, from Amazon MGM Studios.

One dark jewel — pardon, rose — of the 2025 fall festival circuit was a new film from Cornish director Mark Jenkin starring two of the hottest British actors working right now. And it's a movie IndieWire likened to a “haunting aesthetic nirvana.”

George MacKay and Callum Turner play fishermen caught in a time warp at sea and ashore in “Rose of Nevada,” which premiered in the Orizzonti section at Venice before wending its way to TIFF, the New York Film Festival, BFI London, and beyond. Here, the “Enys Men” director turns small towns and their denizens along the coast of Cornwall into sights of the science-fiction uncanny. Watch the film's trailer below.

The titular Rose here is a ship that's returned to a Cornish village 30 years after disappearing previously. Now back in the harbor, the ship arrives as if from the past without its long-missing deckhands, who may have thrown themselves overboard. That's when two unskilled fishermen, desperate for money to feed their families, take a job on said ship without knowledge of its past — and then things get really weird, as timelines shift, and people and their personalities seem to swap. For one, Nick (MacKay) and Liam (Turner) come home to very different family scenarios than before, ones where their loved ones might not even remember them.

Jenkin constructed all the film's sound design during post-production, writing, editing, and directing the film with a 16mm Bolex camera. More from IndieWire's review: “Moreso than in previous work, [Jenkin] highlights the dissonance between his subject matter and his form. This is a film shot with nearly century-old methods, featuring contemporary pop songs and iPhones. When we see the town for the second time, the camera latches onto foregone technologies, jukeboxes and old-school CCTVs and stick-shift trucks. It'd be disingenuous to say this movie is not enamored with its own schtick, but it is far and away his least indulgent. Jenkins calls into question our relationship to objects of nostalgia and how we rememorize the textures of history across our lives.”

“Rose of Nevada” opens in theaters from 1-2 Special on Friday, June 19. Watch the trailer below.

The Berlin Film Festival is upon us, with more than 200 films in all shapes, sizes, and forms coming to Germany from February 12 – 22. Unlike some of the other majors, Berlin is known for celebrating nonfiction filmmaking across its competition sections. 

The Panorama section, bent around unconventional international fare, brings at least one docufiction standout to Berlin this month: “Tristan Forever.” It hails from the writing/directing team of Tobias Nölle and Loran Bonnardot, but is in fact about Bonnardot itself. IndieWire reveals the trailer and more exclusive details below.

 










For 30 years, Bonnardot, a doctor from Paris, maintained a friendship with a fisherman from Tristan da Cunha, known as the most isolated island in the world, deep out in the South Atlantic Ocean. The film follows Bonnardot on one last trek, and this time he hopes to stay there forever. But will the selective island council of just 230 people accept him?

Related Stories ‘Omaha' Trailer: A Heartbreaking John Magaro Anchors This Festival Favorite ‘The Singers' Trailer: An Oscar Short Nominee for Our Times, from a Story Written in 1850 

“What drives a doctor from Paris to embrace such an isolated community, and what compels these islanders to live so removed from the outside world? I saw in Loran a castaway from our hyper-competitive society, seeking an authenticity we've lost, on an island secluded from our war-torn world; a dream I wanted to transform into a cinematic experience,” Nölle said in a press statement. 

More about the film in the official synopsis courtesy of the Berlinale: “For 30 years, Loran Bonnardot, a doctor from Paris, has been visiting Tristan da Cunha, the world's remotest inhabited island, in the middle of the South Atlantic. The volcanic island has become Loran's spiritual refuge, its inhabitants his chosen family and the fisherman Martin his best friend. Now, at the age of 50, Loran takes the boat once more but this time he does not plan to return: he wants to become one of the 230 permanent residents — no easy endeavour since the island council will decide whether or not to accept him. Meanwhile, his friend Martin has his own point of view and Loran himself is confronted by his lifelong search for solitude. ‘Tristan Forever' is a journey to a utopia far beyond the horizon. A film that pursues the question of where one's soul belongs, oscillating between documentary, fiction and the dreams of its protagonist.”

 










“Tristan Forever” premieres Sunday, February 15, in the Berlin Film Festival‘s Panorama section. Watch the trailer, an IndieWire exclusive, below. Rediance is handling international sales as the film, which blends documentary and narrative, seeks worldwide distribution.

The “tectonic pedal steel” guitar of Barry Walker Jr. might be the definitive sound of the latter-day ambient country wave. His bends and sighs can be heard on records from Mouth Painter, North Americans, the Rose City Band and Jeffrey Silverstein, not to mention a string of solo albums both alone and with various bands (the post-rocking Tanks, the more sedate Unit). Meanwhile, his daytime trade as a geologist brought him from his home turf near Nashville to the Pacific Northwest, that rugged place whose seismic activity seems to thrum like the gears of a great subconscious. It's safe to say country music is in his blood—and so, one can imagine, are the seams of magma that crisscross the Ring of Fire. His new album Paleo Sol is like a seance with the elements.

Paleo Sol comes on the heels of Live at the 13th Moon Gravity Well, recorded with the Unit at a Portland watering hole. Those four long improvisations were like offerings to placate the spirits of the still-rumbling Mount St. Helens, whose catastrophic 1980 eruption was the first of its magnitude to be studied with modern instruments. The tracks here are shorter, often resembling the plangent interludes one finds studded across Boards of Canada albums, but dressed up in Western wear. Still, there's an unsettling calm, an attunement to the fragile truce between humankind and the capricious planet that nourishes it. It's an awareness anyone who's lived in Oregon can tell you all about.

Paleo Sol was recorded with a stripped-down combo: Walker on pedal steel and electric and acoustic guitars, with regular collaborators Jason Willmon on bass and Rob Smith on drums. Walker sometimes sings on record, but here he lets his instruments do the talking: thick sheets of pedal-steel gauze, overlaid with dew droplets of guitar that sometimes set a bucolic atmosphere (“Quiessence”) and at other times bend and moan with the portentousness of the Indian master Zia Mohiuddin Dagar's rudra veena (the 12-minute “Sentient Lithosphere”). His backing musicians kick up dust, eschewing the post-rock pomp favored by his contemporary Chuck Johnson in favor of riverine structures that reflect the geologic time scale Walker wanted to capture here.

This is not complicated or challenging music, and at times the chord progressions are simple enough to make one yearn for a bit more spikiness. “Peridot, Call Me” is a vamp on I and IV, the stuff of millions of jams, and to be honest, there's not much here that couldn't be improvised in one take by a group of sufficiently locked-in musicians. But those sounds go a long way. Willmon's basslines wind like the serpentine crooks of a subterranean river, Smith is skilled in the post-rock/post-Sunny Murray tradition of creating a bed for improvisation, and Walker is simply as good as anyone since Daniel Lanois at transplanting the wide-open sounds of the pedal steel into an ambient context.

It's easy to get lost in the advertising with this kind of music, but having lived in Portland for a spell I can attest that there's something in the air that's just different from San Francisco or New York: an awareness of the vastness of the universe that's more pronounced when you're perched in the shadow of a volcano and girdled by wilderness. The title of “Sentient Lithosphere” is poignant; could the Earth be alive? When you study something long and deeply enough, you start to see patterns the layperson couldn't even comprehend. A quote often attributed to the physicist Werner Heisenberg stuck in my head while listening to this music: “The first gulp from the glass of natural sciences will make you an atheist, but at the bottom of the glass, God is waiting for you.” Bottoms up.

The 808 cowbells on “Boo'd Up” were a red herring. Across several EPs and two albums, Ella Mai has proven herself to be more than a throwback act. While the British singer's longing vocals and smooth hooks take obvious cues from '90s and 2000s' R&B, her bouncy and moody SoCal sound aligns her with the present. She's both hopelessly prone to falling head over heels and quick to put “these heartless, broken boys” in their place if they toy with her feelings. With her third album, she's finally found her boo—and her stride. Do You Still Love Me? is a set of polished midtempo grooves that threads snap&b, soul, and rap, and boasts her strongest songwriting yet. “No broken-hearted people here,” she declares on the intro, fortified by love.

Records about settling down tend to bask in the thrills of leaving dating behind and getting the chance to forge a new life. Do You Still Love Me? follows that tradition in its first half. Single “100,” built atop lush strings, whining chipmunk vocals, and crisp snaps, is rhapsodic, Mai extolling her relationship's flexible dynamic. “20 for my 80/Ain't no maybe/We'll make it to 100/If I got 40 for your 60/You'll stick with me,” she sings, stretching each number like it's a last dollar.

Ballad “Somebody's Son” swoons even harder. “Even when he wrong, wanna apologize/I don't really care who's right,” Mai belts over a bed of feathery synths and ghostly background vocals. That same sentiment carries “Little Things,” an innocent successor to Destiny's Child to “Cater 2 U.” But where Destiny's Child depicted small acts of service as intimate foreplay, Mai drops the come-ons and finds pleasure in the favors themselves. Her love songs have always had a strong current of devotion, but her conviction here is ironclad, her voice clarion rather than yearning.

As the question mark in the album title suggests, though, angst and doubt lurk beneath the bliss. Around the halfway point, Mai's domesticity grows feral. “Luckiest Man” inverts the devotion of “Somebody's Son,” and Mai reminds her suitor that she also deserves to be obsessed over. Alternating between a purr and a cocksure croon, she sounds as hostile as she does confident. She pushes that sentiment further on highlight “Might Just,” a track about confronting a partner after dreaming he was unfaithful. The conceit is ridiculous, but she plays it exquisitely straight. Insisting the dream was too vivid to have been fake, she hisses threats and accusations, at one point dropping her voice to a menacing whisper like the late Drakeo.

Mai's label boss Mustard, who has credits on every track, supplies some of his most subtle beats here. Forgoing his characteristic bass kicks, shouts, and dark synths—as well as his signature drop–he emphasizes atmosphere over rhythm. Soft key and guitar melodies, airy vocal loops, and light percussion abound, making the album feel weightless (“Outside”) and occasionally haunted (“Luckiest Man”). The only recognizable Mustard tic is the ubiquitous finger snaps, which mostly add sway. The flickering production could be more dynamic on the back half as Mai retracts her claws and resumes gushing, but on the whole it complements her wavering resolve. The record is as anxious as it is lovesick.

Mai's songwriting could still use some touching up. Lyrics like “You continue to blow my mind” and “We've been through hell and out” fail to match the passion of her singing or convey the intimacy of the experiences she's describing. The smoldering “Bonus” is one of the biggest letdowns, with a stuttering hook—“B-b-bonus/B-b-bonus”—that stunts an otherwise engaging performance. But Do You Still Love Me? soars more often than it sinks, and Mai continues to find fresh entryways into old sounds and subjects. She's not R&B's vanguard, but her blues and her fervor, her stories and her style, are always her own.

Angel Marcloid is never one to let a mood pass her by. From the demented genre-slush of Fire-Toolz to the full-throated jazz fusion pastiche of Nonlocal Forecast, the Chicago-based artist's prolific, slippery oeuvre is the extension of a life lived in service of the id and the endless pursuit of new intuitions. “I have no idea what it's like to not know what music to make,” she once explained. “There are not enough years in my life to make all the music I want to make.” Yapping Portal, Marcloid's newest alias, serves as a repository for her modular synth experiments. blue fifty-six, the project's first label release, is a beguiling collection of noise suites that roam, shriek and stretch in search of an elusive sublimity.

Yapping Portal first materialized on Bandcamp in the latter half of 2025 with a series of improvisational releases: long-form, unpredictable modular jams bred from cascading chains of effects. Marcloid wanders patiently through these generative soundscapes like a documentarian in thrall to the process, recording snapshots of the music's continuous ecosystem. blue fifty-six continues this journey; here, Marcloid exerts a loose but consistent curatorial grip as the album explores texture, peeling apart bright guitar tone into pointillist trickles, stacking layers of feedback into swaddling blankets of fuzz. Designed for headphone listening, blue fifty-six revels in the subtle manipulation of space, panning elements into a taut omnidirectional tapestry.

The album's improvisatory nature deemphasizes longer phrases in favor of discrete moments; sounds rise sharply from the ether, linger briefly, then dissipate. “Into Volo Bog ! Sapphire Slug Parliament” punctures its web of spiraling noise with plangent plucks that form a lonely constellation among consuming static. “Filled Urine Blog ! Astral Gatorade Tribunal” opens on an irreverent bitcrushed sequencer loop whose careening notes suddenly freeze into icy, reedy drones and yawning chasms of reverb. The overall effect is akin to flipping through TV channels: a barrage of distinct aesthetics encountered stochastically, with the onus of deeper perusal thrust onto the viewer.

blue fifty-six twists from sharp palpitations into more monochromatic expanses as it wears on, locking the album into a repetitive dynamic between harsh and (relatively) soft sounds. The searing groans of “Spent Owl's Mist ! Nocturnal Gregorian Facsimile,” for example, are immediately followed by twinkles of dial-tone frost on “Weeping Prowler Bypass ! Cries Of Lint,” which then collapse to screeching jackhammer static. While the interplay of these competing atmospheres can be compelling, the overall effect loses its power as the novelty wears off. By the album's close, the lush, eerie pads of “Mosh Endearing Okay ! Glitter Gel Tesseract” offer welcome respite, anchoring the surrounding abstractions to an identifiable landmark. blue fifty-six situates itself in a paradoxically low-key plane: A capable companion to active and passive listening alike, it offers both spectacle and steady accompaniment. Against Marcloid's sprawling catalog, it's a slighter offering, but its rewards are still dazzling.

Sofia Kourtesis has recorded a mix for the DJ Kicks series. The first of four original Kourtesis songs leads the set; listen to “Los Poemas No Siempre Riman” below. The tracklist, also below, includes exclusive contributions from Jon Hopkins, Axel Boman, Myd, Joy (Anonymous), and Laurence Guy. !K7 will release the set on March 27.

Kourtesis said in a press release, “DJ-Kicks is a series that shaped how I think about DJing and listening. I played the DJ Koze mix an unhealthy number of times, to the point where it basically lives in my DNA now. Those mixes taught me that the best ones aren't about showing off; they're about taking people on a journey. They move, twist and surprise you. They give you goosebumps when you least expect it.”

She added, “This mix was about bringing together all the different sounds and emotions I carry with me. The highs, the lows, the warmth, the weird little left turns. That's basically how my brain works when I'm behind the decks. This is my way of letting those worlds collide, overlap and dance with each other. That's exactly what I wanted to do here. I wanted emotion, tension, release. I wanted this mix to feel alive.”

Kourtesis followed her 2023 solo album, Madres, with the Volver EP last year.

	The person of interest detained for questioning in connection with the alleged kidnapping of Today show anchor Savannah Guthrie‘s mother, Nancy Guthrie, has been released.


	On Feb. 10, Authorities told ABC News that the Pima County Sheriff's Department, in collaboration with the FBI, had detained an individual in southern Tucson, Arizona, and law enforcement was preparing to search a location in relation to the detainee in Rio Rico. There was no indication whether the person detained was the same individual in the footage of a masked man approaching Nancy's home released Tuesday morning.


	According to ABC15 in Arizona, which spoke with the man, he was reportedly unaware of the search for Nancy after his release. The man, who goes by Carlos,  told the station he was pulled over while driving with his wife and arrested upon stepping out of his vehicle. “They didn't even tell me what's going on till the detectives got here, like two hours [after] I got arrested,” he said. “They told me I was being detained for kidnapping. And I asked him, ‘Kidnapping of who?'”

	











	Carlos said he didn't recognize Nancy's name when it was told to him. “I told him I work in Tucson for GLS,” he said. “I might have delivered a package to your house, but I never kidnapped anybody.” He resides with his wife and mother-in-law in Rio Rico. The New York Times reported that investigators broke down the door of the property to conduct a “court-authorized search.”

	“I hope they get the suspect, because I'm not it,” Carlos said from the doorstep of the home following his release. “They better do their job and find the suspect that did it so that they can clear my name.” While speaking to ABC15, he noted that detectives at the Pima County Sheriff's Department told him they were no longer looking into him, “but somebody else might.”

	











	Nancy, 84, has been missing for nearly two weeks and is believed to have been taken from her home against her will. She was last seen on Jan. 31 and has been without the medication she is required to take daily.

	On Feb. 8, Guthrie and her siblings addressed their mother's alleged kidnapper in an Instagram video. “We received your message, and we understand,” she said, alluding to a possible ransom note. “We beg you now to return our mother to us so that we can celebrate with her.” Neither Guthrie nor the authorities have detailed the message they received. “This is the only way we will have peace,” Guthrie continued. “This is very valuable to us. And we will pay.”


	Savannah posted her own video on Monday, Feb. 9, calling on the public's help in locating her mother. “Law enforcement is working tirelessly around the clock trying to bring her home, trying to find her,” she said, but noted that the Guthrie family is “at an hour of desperation and we need your help.” 


	On Tuesday, the Pima County Sheriff's Department released the first photos of someone possibly involved in the alleged kidnapping. The images were taken the morning of Nancy's disappearance, and showed an “armed individual,” wearing a ski mask, and appearing to tamper with the camera on Nancy's front door.

	The “previously inaccessible” images were uncovered after authorities spent several days working with “private sector partners” to recover any images or video footage from Nancy's home that “may have been lost, corrupted or inaccessible due to a variety of factors, including the removal of recording devices.” The video that these images came form, the department said, was “recovered from residual data located in backend systems.”

	As America continues to bask in the glow of Bad Bunny‘s monumental Super Bowl LX halftime show, the numbers are in on the big game. On Tuesday, Feb. 10, Nielsen Big Data + Panel announced that Bad Bunny's performance helped set a new record for peak viewership at 137.8 million viewers tuning into the second quarter, drawing an average of 124.9 million viewers for the game.


	The star's halftime show drew 128.2 million, making it one of the most-watched performances in Super Bowl history. Kendrick Lamar's remains the title holder — the GNX hip-hop legend set it last year with 133.5 million viewers tuning in, outpacing Michael Jackson's iconic 1993 set that forever changed the halftime show's DNA and garnered 133.4 million viewers. A year after Lamar delivered a performance steeped in political symbolism and took a national jab at Drake amid their infamous feud, Bad Bunny's own turn on the field immediately became a celebration of resilience, joy, and hope as he opened his show at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, California, with the declaration, “Que rico es ser Latino.” While there isn't a direct English translation, the words mean something similar to “How great it is to be Latino.”

	The star also made history as the first artist to perform entirely in Spanish at the Super Bowl halftime show. His performance was packed with references to Latino culture and saw the artist singing “Tití Me Preguntó” as he weaved past people cutting cane with machetes, stopping by a piragua (Puerto Rican shaved ice) stand, delivering several hits from the rooftop of the famed casita (his Debí Tirar Más Fotos world tour centerpiece), inviting the likes of Lady Gaga and Ricky Martin to the stage, hanging from electric poles as he performed political-party track “El Apagón,” and bellowing “God bless América!” before listing nearly every country in the Americas from Chile in the south to Canada in the north.

	News of this year's Super Bowl's record-breaking viewership also arrives as Bad Bunny's music spiked in Spotify streams, with a 470 percent increase in the U.S. and 210 percent increase in global streams. As of Monday morning, Bad Bunny was also occupying the top six spots of Spotify's U.S. Daily Top Songs Chart. For his part, Martin is also experiencing a significant spike at 145 percent in the U.S. In addition to the streaming surges, Bad Bunny's “DtMF” also reentered the Billboard Hot 100 at Number 10.

Super Bowl commercials can spark as much conversation as the halftime show or the game itself — and this year, what people are talking about is the substantial number of ads there were trying to sell America on AI. 


	One in particular that got people talking was for Ring, a doorbell video camera and smart home-security device. It begins with a little girl getting kisses from her new puppy, a yellow Lab named Milo. Then, we see the same little girl looking forlorn as her dad staples a “lost dog” poster up in her neighborhood. Luckily, the Ring camera's “Search Party” tool comes in to save the day, activating all of the neighborhood's Ring video cameras to use AI and search for the dog. Milo is found! 


	Almost immediately, people took to social media to critique the commercial. “‘Surveillance state,' but make it adorable,” tweeted one X user, adding, “Ring is owned by Amazon, and Amazon is a technology partner of ICE.” (Ring recently partnered with Flock Safety, a network of AI cameras that can be accessed by law enforcement. Ring did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but previously told NJ.com that “Search Party” only works for dogs, not humans.) “I had no opinion on Ring doorbells, but now I will actively avoid purchasing one as long as I live,” tweeted another.

	











	Ring was far from the only ad propping up AI as helpful or positive. A commercial for Google's Gemini showed a mom and her young son using generative AI to plan out what their new home would look like. GenSpark's commercial featured Matthew Broderick encouraging people to take a day off and let their AI assistant work for them. Ramp showcased The Office character Kevin Malone (Brian Baumgartner) cloning himself to get all of his paperwork done. Meta promoted their Oakley AI sunglasses by showing athletes skydiving, running, biking, and playing golf while asking things like “Is it OK to eat mud?” and “When does the storm hit?”

	Though the ads were trying to sell AI as a helpful, trustworthy tech we can all safely integrate into our lives, that's not necessarily how the general public took it. Rumman Chowdhury, CEO of the public-benefit nonprofit Humane Intelligence and former U.S. science envoy for AI, tells Rolling Stone that she thinks this year's AI commercials were incongruous with a society that has been coming to grips with its overreliance on technology.

	“The AI ‘optimism at all cost' ads were really out of touch with public sentiment on AI and technology broadly,” says Chowdhury, noting that 2026 has been called the “year of friction,” with people trying to scale back their use of technology. “People don't want to buy expensive sunglasses to tell them what the weather is when you can't even afford pizza because it's like $60, and nobody's making money, and the tariffs are kicking everyone's ass.”


	To Chowdhury, the ads felt like they were from “another era, where people still believed the shtick that these guys were going to usher in immense social and technological and economic change.” Instead, she says, people are starting to be critical of tech billionaires who are “trying to consolidate wealth and power.” 


	As far as Ring using lost puppies to hype up their video technology, Chowdhury says she's not surprised people criticized the commercial. “Replace lost dog with a Black kid wandering around in the neighborhood and that's where all of our minds go,” she says. “Not because we're paranoid, because that's literally how it's being used. You think we're stupid?” (Ring recently told Wirecutter that they will only share footage with local law enforcement, and only with the permission of device owners, unless they're compelled by law to do so.) 


	Another ad that stuck was Amazon's spot, in which Chris Hemsworth busts into his house, (for some reason holding a venomous snake) and tells his wife, Elsa Pataky, he's concerned the AI assistant Alexa+ is going to kill him. He goes through all of the ways it could happen — closing the garage door on his neck, ordering a man-eating bear to his door — but when Alexa offers to book him a cinnamon scrub, he relents and accepts the device into his home. Chowdhury was put off by how it mocked people who are skeptical about AI. “It's very condescending,” she says.

	Suresh Venkatasubramanian, director of the Center for Tech Responsibility at Brown University, says he's seen a shift over the past six months with how people view AI.

	











	“Ever since the summer and the horrific teen suicides, poll after poll is saying that people are generally more cautious and concerned about the rapid flood of AI tools everywhere,” says Venkatasubramanian. He believes the backlash to the commercials is a reflection of how people are starting to think about the concerns regarding AI.


	“Tech has always been about, ‘Here is a future we can imagine for you. We're not there yet, but we might get there,'” says Venkatasubramanian. “It's always about selling the future with gauzy imagery and visuals and trying to make it seem like this is exactly what's going to happen. And saying ‘Don't worry about all these other boring issues the naysayers will talk about.'


	Companies using the glamour and spotlight of the Super Bowl to sell their products is nothing new, and certainly not exclusive to tech companies. And there are certain elements that companies use to market their products. Rama Yelkur, the executive dean of the business school at Texas Women's University, has run a Super Bowl research panel for 25 years. She says that although the product has changed, this year's commercials used many of the same tropes that are known to work on consumers.


	“Humor, animals, children, celebrities, music — these are the winning ingredients,” says Yelkur. She says from a storytelling standpoint, the Ring ad captured a lot of these ingredients by having a cute puppy and children, which tug at people's hearts. Similarly, she liked the Chris Hemsworth Alexa+ commercial.


	“They used humor, celebrities, [and] animals very cleverly,” she says. “There's a snake in the beginning, a bear at the end, it's poking fun at people who can't use AI.”


	Yelkur ranked Google's Gemini commercial about imagining a new home as one of the most emotionally appealing, likeable ads that tugged at the heartstrings. Elon Musk's AI.com ad however, which featured nothing but product information as the letters scrolled, was ranked one of her worst or least likeable.

	She likens the wave of AI commercials to the 2000 Super Bowl, which happened at the height of the dot-com bubble. Eleven dot-com companies bought ads. “Before the end of the year,” Yelkur says, “Nine out of the 11 companies went out of business.”


	Chowdhury also remembers the dot-com commercials. “We had Pets.com and it was like, ‘Here's a new service you can use!' it was grounded in a very real problem they were solving,” says Chowdhury. “Now I'm nostalgic for those days. Like, ‘Remember when they gave a shit about the thing we actually wanted and tried to sell it to us?' Now it's like, ‘Go sign up for your ai.com account. Why? Nobody knows, but go, sheep. Sign up for it.'”

	As lawyer Mark Lanier flashed a cartoon road sign reading “Science of Addiction” on a large screen inside a Los Angeles courtroom Tuesday, Dr. Anna Lembke walked jurors through what she described as the four “C's” of addiction: loss of control, cravings, compulsions, and consequences.


	Called as the first witness in a closely watched trial over claims Meta and YouTube negligently designed platforms that were addictive to children, Lembke, the medical director of Stanford University's addiction medicine program and the author of the bestselling book Dopamine Nation, said young users' brains are “especially vulnerable” to problems associated with those four traits. The reason, she told jurors, is that adolescents' prefrontal cortices are not yet fully integrated with deeper midbrain systems that regulate behavior.


	“They're not fully developed,” she said. “There's a lack of communication between the brakes and the accelerator, which is why teenagers will often take risks that they shouldn't and fail to appreciate future consequences. It's why they're more vulnerable to addictions.” Social media, she added, has “drugified” connection, validation, and novelty. “The younger the exposure, generally speaking, the greater the risk” of getting hooked, she said.

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	Testifying for K.G.M., the plaintiff in the case who says she became compulsively attached to social media as a child and suffered lasting harm, Lembke said that, in her professional opinion, Instagram and YouTube are inherently addictive products thanks to “potent” design features including autoplay, notifications that she said can “trigger” compulsive use, and “endless scroll that never ends, with no bottom to it.” For children, she said, easy access is baked into the platforms' design despite company claims to the contrary.

	











	“Instagram and YouTube provide 24/7, effectively limitless, frictionless access to their products, with ineffective age verification and ineffective parental controls,” Lembke told jurors. “It's clear parents, by and large, are not using them because they're difficult to navigate, and kids can get around them.” She added that she had treated more patients with social media addiction than she could recall.

	Lembke's testimony came on the second day of the trial brought by K.G.M., a now 20-year-old California woman who says she experienced anxiety, body dysmorphia, self-harm, and suicidal ideation after developing a dangerous dependence on Instagram and YouTube. K.G.M. is one of thousands of plaintiffs who have filed personal-injury lawsuits against major social media companies whose cases have been coordinated into a mass-tort proceeding. K.G.M.'s case was selected to go first, but the outcome will not be binding on cases that follow. 


	On Monday, Lanier delivered his opening statement, followed by lawyers for Meta, which owns Instagram, and Google, which owns YouTube. Lanier told jurors the evidence would show the companies created apps that functioned as “digital casinos” knowingly marketed to children.


	“Imagine a slot machine that fits into your pocket,” he said. “It doesn't require you to read. It doesn't require you to type. It's just one physical motion — the swipe. This motion is the handle of a slot machine.” The reward, he said, isn't money but a “dopamine hit” in the form of likes or unexpected videos. (In her testimony, Lembke described dopamine as a brain chemical tied to pleasure, reward, and motivation that reinforces behavior.)


	“They didn't just build apps, they built traps,” Lanier told jurors. “They didn't want users. They wanted addicts. They didn't want time spent, they wanted control. This was no accident. This was addiction by design.”

	When it was his turn, Meta's lead lawyer, Paul Schmidt, framed the plaintiff's struggles as the result of tragic family circumstances rather than platform design. He said medical records would show K.G.M. witnessed domestic violence in her home at age three and later experienced anxiety and depression tied to her parents' divorce and what she described as feelings of “abandonment.”


	“The struggles she's had — they go all the way back. They're lifelong,” Schmidt said. He told jurors K.G.M. received an iPod Touch at age six and a string of future devices with little oversight from her parents. He said K.G.M.'s longtime therapist testified in a deposition that K.G.M. “never reported” social media addiction as an issue. Meta, he added, acted on research and created tools, including time-management features and opt-out controls, intended to address problematic use.

	











	YouTube's lawyer, Luis Li, told jurors Tuesday that the platform has become the largest streaming service in the United States, surpassing cable television and even Netflix. He said 94 percent of teachers use it in their lessons and that YouTube returns more than half of its advertising revenue to creators. When YouTube Kids launched in 2015, he said, the company worked to steer children away from their parents' feeds toward the more child-oriented product. Like Schmidt, Li noted that the plaintiff received “device after device after device” growing up, suggesting any alleged harm stemmed from parental decisions rather than a defective product.


	In her testimony, Lembke said children facing challenges are often at greatest risk of addictive social media use. “We are very prone to narratives that say kids who use a lot of social media are kids who would have been messed up anyway,” she testified. “The truth of the matter is that even if those kids are really troubled kids from troubled homes, who would have had challenges no matter what, their addictive use of social media is going to make those mental health challenges worse.”


	The doctor also walked jurors through what she described as an internal Meta document, purportedly dated Oct. 29, 2020, that separated users with so-called “existing vulnerabilities” into four groups: “Adolescents; Female; Mental health challenges; and Low socio-economic status.” The graphic, with bullet points and arrows, illustrated what she characterized as a bidirectional feedback loop recognized in addiction medicine.


	“People with addictive behaviors are at higher risk of developing other mental health disorders, and people with other mental health disorders are more likely to get addicted,” she said. “Generally speaking, if you struggle with depression, you're at greater risk of becoming addicted. If you struggle with addiction, you're at greater risk of becoming depressed.” Children dealing with sleep disturbances, attention deficit disorder, or other mental health conditions tend to face elevated risks of developing addiction, she testified.


	Lembke further testified that it would be unusual for a child or teenager to recognize addiction in themselves. Identifying the problem typically requires a trained therapist, she said, and withdrawal symptoms can be severe.

	“Sadly, we're seeing more and more young people who experience not just psychological distress but physical distress when their devices are taken away,” she said. “Some become suicidal in the immediate aftermath and have to be hospitalized. We are seeing this, and we're seeing it more often.”

Today host Savannah Guthrie‘s missing mother, Nancy Guthrie, was last seen on Jan. 31. In the days since, police officials and federal agents have aided in efforts to locate the 84-year-old woman, who is believed to have been taken from her home against her will. The already time-sensitive matter has become more urgent as additional details emerge about the alleged crime scene discovered at Nancy's home in Arizona. Here's everything we know about the search and disappearance, so far.


	On Feb. 3, Donald Trump told reporters at a bill signing that he would be willing to commit additional federal resources as the search continues, according to Variety, noting that it is a “very unusual situation, but we're going to find out.” On Feb. 1, Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos said that while it is “not standard” to have homicide detectives assist on a missing person's case, or to even have the sheriff involved, “the scene at the house also has some concerns for us.”


	According to the Los Angeles Times, there are now around 100 sheriff's detectives that have been assigned to assist on the case, which took a harrowing turn as blood spatters were reportedly discovered at the scene. “We took some samples that we hope will have enough profile of a DNA profile that gives us some identification of what we're looking at,” Nanos said earlier this week. It could take a number of days for the DNA results to return.

	Time is of the essence, Nanos said on Feb. 3. “It is a race against time, and I hope that window hasn't closed.” He added: “We believe [Nancy] was taken out of the home against her will, and that's how this investigation is moving.” Authorities in Pima County are helming the search with assistance from the FBI. “They're the lead right now and we have to respect that, but we are there to help them anywhere we can on ransom notes or otherwise,” FBI Director Kash Patel said during an appearance on Fox News.

	











	Patel added that local authorities notified the FBI of an alleged ransom note received. While the full content and source of the note, which TMZ reportedly received, has not been shared, the outlet did claim that it included demands for “millions” in cryptocurrency to be paid to a Bitcoin address. The legitimacy of the note has not been verified. “Every lead and tip is important; we are aggressively pursuing and looking into every single one,” said John Edwards, the assistant special agent leading the FBI office in Tucson.

88-CRIME is offering a $2,500 reward for information leading to an arrest or arrests in Nancy's disappearance. The Pima County Sheriff's Department is asking those with potential evidence to submit it via an online tip portal put in place on Feb. 1. They are searching for images and videos that could aid in the investigation. “The Pima County Sheriff's Department is urgently requesting your assistance in locating Nancy Guthrie, 84, who last seen on the evening of Jan. 31, 2026, at her residence near East Skyline Drive and North Campbell Avenue,” the tip posting reads, noting that this is the case of a “missing endangered adult.”


	The missing person report for Nancy describes her as being five feet five, weighing 150 pounds, with brown hair and blue eyes. It is not known what she was wearing at the time of her disappearance. Nancy does not suffer from cognitive issues, which allowed authorities to rule out the potential of this being a case of someone with dementia wandering off. She does have some mobility issues and requires daily medication, Nanos previously said, adding that missing doses could be life-threatening.


	According to CNN, through a source briefed on the investigation, Nancy's pacemaker sent a signal to her iPhone on Sunday, Feb. 1, at around 2 a.m. Since then, no updates have been sent. Nancy's iPhone was also discovered to have been left at her home. While detectives are no longer operating at her home as an active scene, they did note that there were signs of forced entry.

	On the morning of Wednesday, Feb. 4, the Pima County Sheriff's Department issued a statement on X clarifying that “at this point, investigators have not identified a suspect or person of interest in this case.” This came after unverified reports made unsupported claims about members of the Guthrie family. “Detectives are working closely with the Guthrie family,” the statement signed by Nanos continued. “While we appreciate the public's concern, the sharing of unverified accusations or false information is irresponsible and does not assist the investigation.”

	











	That evening on Wednesday, Guthrie and her two siblings, Annie and Camron, posted a tearful video, in which they spoke directly to Nancy's kidnapper. “We too have heard the reports about a ransom letter in the media,” Guthrie said. “As a family, we are doing everything that we can. We are ready to talk.” 


	“However,” she added. “We live in a world where voices and images are easily manipulated. We need to know, without a doubt, that she is alive, and that you have her.”


	On Thursday, Feb. 5, in Phoenix, authorities detailed a timeline from the day of the incident. Nanos also revealed at the latest press hearing that there is currently no suspect or person of interest. Though someone was detected on a camera in the home, Nanos noted this could have been an animal, and that there was no point of forced entry in Nancy's home. Blood detected by the front door was identified as Nancy's, while other items that were submitted haven't been returned yet.


	There were multiple ransom letters reported; the FBI confirmed that one was an imposter and another had details with facts that appeared to be connected to their investigation. According to authorities, the Guthrie family has not been given proof of life. “We believe Nancy is still out there,” Nanos said. “We want her home.”


	Before Nanos took questions from the press, FBI special agent Heith Janke said there was now a $50,000 reward. “Do the right thing,” he said. “This is an 84-year-old grandma that needs vital medication for her wellbeing. You still have the time to do the right thing before this becomes a much worse scenario for you. Please return Nancy home.”


	Guthrie and her siblings have continued to plead for their mother's safe return in videos shared on Instagram. On Feb. 8, they addressed their mothers' alleged kidnapper, saying, “We received your message, and we understand. We beg you now to return our mother to us so that we can celebrate with her.” Guthrie nor authorities have detailed the message they received. This is the only way we will have peace. This is very valuable to us. And we will pay.”


	On Feb. 9, Guthrie asked for the public's help in locating her mother. “She was taken and we don't know where, and we need your help,” Guthrie said. “So I'm coming on just to ask you, not just for your prayers, but no matter where you are — even if you're far from Tucson — if you see anything, you hear anything, if there's anything at all that seems strange to you, that you report to law enforcement. We are at an hour of desperation and we need your help.” 

	











	The following day, the Pima County Sheriff's Department released the first photos of someone possibly involved in the alleged kidnapping. The images were taken the morning of Nancy's disappearance, and showed an “armed individual,” wearing a ski mask, and appearing to tamper with the camera on Nancy's front door. 


	The “previously inaccessible” images were uncovered after authorities spent several days working with “private sector partners” to recover any images or video footage from Nancy's home that “may have been lost, corrupted or inaccessible due to a variety of factors, including the removal of recording devices.” The video that these images came form, the department said, was “recovered from residual data located in backend systems.” 

UPDATE: New images in the search for Nancy Guthrie – pic.twitter.com/dXcSBVxkDC


	Savannah also posted a video, which appears to be footage from where the photos released by the Pima County Sheriff's Department are taken. “Someone out there recognizes this person. We believe she is still out there. Bring her home,” wrote Savannah in the caption, directing anyone with information to contact police.


	Along with the new images, Fox News reported that authorities had started taking DNA samples from people who were working near Nancy's home. The news suggested that police had uncovered DNA belonging to someone other than Nancy at the crime scene, and that they were looking to eliminate new suspects or possibly generate fresh leads.This article was updated with information from the latest press conference on Feb. 5.

Ghosts, space aliens and Bigfoot. What more could a Bucks County paranormal enthusiast want?

A day-long seminar on things spooky, weird and out of this world is happening at the third annual ParaCon in at Bucks County Community College on Saturday, Feb. 28.

It's entertaining, informative and fascinating for those who love to know what makes things go bump in the night, or have seen strange lights in the sky, or maybe have had a paranormal encounter.

Starting at noon and finishing at 5:30 p.m. Bucks County's premier ghost hunter, Eric Mintel, hosts the event. Other guests and speakers include Mintel's fellow ghost hunter Dominic Sattele. It also features British journalist Nick Pope, who ran the UK's Ministry of Defence in the early 1990s. He has been called the “real Fox Mulder” and has investigated hundreds of UFO sightings, assessing them for national defense.

There will be food trucks and vendors offering paranormal-themed merchandise.

ParaCon will be held at the Zlock Performing Arts Center on the college campus at 275 Swamp Road, Newtown, Pa. 18940. Tickets are available online for $45 for the full lineup of speakers, and $25 for half-day, which allows guests in after 2:30 p.m.

February 11, 2026

By Margaret Hall


Melting Pot's stage adaptation of the Paranormal Activity horror films will return to London's West End later this season.

The show will once again play the Ambassadors Theatre in August, where it is currently playing through until April 25. The production will return August 8 after embarking on a U.K. tour.

Felix Barrett directs the production, adapted for the stage by playwright Levi Holloway, whose theatrical thriller Grey House played Broadway in 2023. The original Paranormal Activity film, released in 2009, reimagined the found footage genre for a new generation, grossing nearly $200 million worldwide and kicking off a blockbuster franchise spanning six sequels. The play, aimed at audiences 15 and above, again reimagines the modern ghost story by reinterpreting the original domestic horror with theatrical illusion.

The production has set and costume design by Fly Davis, illusions by Chris Fisher, lighting design by Anna Watson, sound design by Gareth Fry, video design by Luke Halls, and casting by Stuart Burt and Ginny Schiller. Casting for the return engagement will be announced at a later date.

Paranormal Activity is produced by Simon Friend and Hanna Osmolska for Melting Pot in association with Gavin Kalin, Ken Davenport, Jenny King, Patrick Gracey, Jonathan and Rae Corr, and Leeds Playhouse.

A design-minded take on the world of style from Wallpaper* fashion features editor Jack Moss, from global runway shows to insider news and emerging trends.

A closer look at the people and places shaping design, from inspiring interiors to exceptional products, in an expert edit by Wallpaper* global design director Hugo Macdonald.

In Belgium's Genk, a new, otherworldly site has been unveiled. C-mine, a former mining site-turned-creative hub, has opened ‘Playground', a new space where art and play intersect. The aim behind the project is to create a physical space that invites artists to reimagine contemporary forms of play, and to design their idea of a unique play environment.

 




For its first edition, C-mine invited fashion designer Walter Van Beirendonck to create his version of a playground, which will remain in place for several years. Titling it ‘Welcome Little Stranger', the designer was inspired by extraterrestrial beings.

Van Beirendonck – part of the influential group of designers the Antwerp Six in the 1980s – is known for his strong visual language and vibrant and colourful shapes. He often creates work rooted in themes of identity, diversity and fantasy, all elements that can be found throughout his playground design.

 




 




He looked to the idea of the unknown, and what else exists in the universe, inviting children to join in with this fascination, seeking adventure and fun action. More importantly, Van Beirendonck created the space for children to feel belonging, individuality and freedom.

To create the design, workshops were organised by Van Beirendonck and artist and former LUCA School of Arts student Emma Ribbens, where children from Genk were asked about extraterrestrial life and the role of play.

 




Ribbens, a product and social designer, is driven by the belief that play is essential to society (it's a hot topic; just last summer, 21st Europe and Spacon created a blueprint calling for playgrounds to be reimagined). With her input, the design explores how to stimulate imagination and social connection, while leaving a positive impact on children.

‘I wanted to design an environment that encourages children to use their own imagination, without screens or digital distractions,' says Van Beirendonck. ‘Welcome Little Stranger is about wonder, the joy of discovery, and playing together – without limits.'

For nearly five decades, Steven Spielberg has helped define what alien stories mean to movie audiences. Sometimes they arrive as cosmic miracles. Sometimes as existential threats. Sometimes as something stranger and harder to name.

Now, the director behind E.T., Close Encounters of the Third Kind, and War of the Worlds is returning to the sci-fi genre with Disclosure Day, a summer 2026 release starring Emily Blunt and Josh O'Connor that feels incredibly relevant today. While details remain tightly controlled, early trailers suggest a story centered on humanity learning, all at once, that extraterrestrial life is real.

It is a premise that feels distinctly Spielbergian. It is also arriving at a moment when alien stories once again feel culturally charged. Before Disclosure Day lands in theaters on June 12, here is what we know and how it fits into Spielberg's long history with alien storytelling.

TOPIC

WHY IT MATTERS

Government Disclosure Themes

Reflects real-world debate around UAP reports, declassified military footage and transparency in national security.

National Security Fear Cycles

Spielberg's alien films historically mirror threat eras, from Cold War tension to post-9/11 survival anxiety.

Information Warfare & Trust

Trailer hints at secrecy, global coordination and crisis messaging tied to unknown threats.

Public Expectations of Military Response

Pop culture often shapes how civilians imagine crisis response, command structure and readiness timelines.

Veteran Audience Connection

Spielberg typically grounds global threats in personal experience, something that resonates strongly with service members.

Disclosure Day follows a global moment of revelation: humanity becomes aware that aliens exist. The trailers hint at a darker tone than some of Spielberg's earlier alien films, with images of global panic, government secrecy and emotional fallout among ordinary people.

The cast includes Emily Blunt, Josh O'Connor, Colin Firth, Eve Hewson and Colman Domingo, signaling a character-driven story rather than a purely spectacle-focused blockbuster. The bigger question many fans are asking is simple: why now?

Spielberg's alien films have historically mirrored the emotional climate of their time. If that pattern holds, Disclosure Day could be less about aliens themselves and more about how modern society processes uncertainty, trust and global fear.

Spielberg's first alien film arrived during peak late-Cold-War anxiety but rejected pure fear. Instead, Close Encounters treated aliens as unknowable but potentially transcendent.

The story follows a Midwestern lineman (Richard Dreyfuss) whose encounter with a UFO reshapes his life. The film was a major box office success and remains one of the most influential sci-fi films ever made.

It also established a pattern Spielberg would return to repeatedly: aliens as mirrors of human obsession, hope and fragility.

If Close Encounters was a cosmic wonder, E.T. was an intimate emotional connection.

Released in 1982, the film became a global phenomenon and, at one point, was the highest-grossing movie of all time. More importantly, it reshaped how audiences viewed alien stories. Instead of invasion narratives, Spielberg focused on loneliness, childhood and found family.

Interestingly, E.T. grew out of an abandoned horror-leaning sequel concept to Close Encounters called Night Skies. Elements of that darker concept eventually fed into Poltergeist, Gremlins and E.T. itself, marking one of the most creatively fertile periods of Spielberg's career.

More than two decades later, Spielberg returned to aliens with War of the Worlds, starring Tom Cruise.

Unlike his earlier alien films, this one leaned hard into fear and survival. The movie grossed more than $600 million worldwide and captured a distinctly post-9/11 emotional tone. The threat was sudden, overwhelming and impersonal. The focus was on protecting family and surviving collapse.

While not as culturally beloved as E.T., the film has aged well and remains one of the most intense large-scale alien invasion movies of the modern era.

Though not primarily an alien movie, Crystal Skull technically marks another Spielberg entry into extraterrestrial storytelling.

The alien element appears late in the film and remains controversial among fans. Still, it represents Spielberg engaging with the pulp sci-fi mythology of the 1950s, when alien stories often blended government conspiracy, ancient mysteries and Cold War paranoia.

If Spielberg's past is any guide, Disclosure Day will likely reflect the emotional atmosphere of the 2020s.

Today's alien stories often focus less on invasion and more on revelation: What happens if humanity suddenly learns it is not alone? Who controls that information? Who do we trust?

Early footage suggests Disclosure Day may explore those questions through personal stories rather than pure action spectacle. That approach would align closely with Spielberg's strengths as a filmmaker who uses genre to explore human psychology.

Alien storytelling tends to rise during moments of global uncertainty. Historically, spikes have aligned with Cold War tension, technological leaps and cultural shifts in how humanity sees itself.

In the modern era, that curiosity has returned through government UFO reports, declassified footage and renewed scientific conversations about life beyond Earth.

Spielberg returning to aliens at this moment feels less like nostalgia and more like cultural timing.

The film features a high-profile ensemble cast led by:

• Emily Blunt (Oppenheimer, A Quiet Place) • Josh O'Connor (The Crown, Challengers) • Colin Firth (The King's Speech, Kingsman) • Eve Hewson (Bad Sisters, The Perfect Couple) • Colman Domingo (Sing Sing, Rustin)

Behind the camera, Spielberg reunites with longtime collaborator David Koepp, who wrote the screenplay. Koepp previously worked with Spielberg on Jurassic Park, The Lost World: Jurassic Park, War of the Worlds and Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. Collectively, those films generated more than $3 billion worldwide.

The film is produced by Kristie Macosko Krieger and Spielberg for Amblin Entertainment, with Adam Somner and Chris Brigham serving as executive producers.

Disclosure Day is set to open in theaters on June 12, 2026.

The biggest unknown is tone. Will it lean toward wonder, fear or something entirely new? If Spielberg's track record holds, the answer will likely be all three.

What seems certain is that Disclosure Day will not just be about aliens arriving. It will be about what humanity becomes when faced with the impossible. And if Spielberg's past alien films are any indicator, that question may matter more than the aliens themselves.

Patients with encephalitis lethargica.

Around a century ago, and around the same time the 1918 influenza pandemic killed between 50 and 100 million people worldwide, humanity was met with a new and unusual disease.

The disease, known as encephalitis lethargica (EL), first began to spread across Europe in the winter of 1916. Constantin von Economo, a doctor at the Psychiatric-Neurological Clinic of the University of Vienna, was the first to describe the disease after several patients showed up with strange neurological symptoms. They were admitted with diagnoses ranging from meningitis and multiple sclerosis to delirium. But none of these symptoms fit neatly into any known disease, and one new symptom – lethargy, or sleepiness – distinguished it as a new phenomenon. It was categorized as either acute or chronic, though the two phases often blended together. 

""Acute encephalitis lethargica often presented as a gradual onset of non-descript flu-like symptoms, including malaise, low-grade fever, pharyngitis, shivering, headache, vertigo, and vomiting,"" a 2017 review of the topic explains. ""Neurological symptoms followed and could present very quickly, as in the case of a girl who experienced a sudden hemiplegia while walking home from a concert. Within half an hour she was asleep, and died 12 days later.""

The disease was further broken down into other categories, some of which were deadlier than others. Particularly distinct was the somnolent-ophthalmoplegic form of encephalitis lethargica, which was characterized by extreme sleepiness.

""Most notably, patients experienced an overwhelming desire to sleep and would sleep for abnormally long periods of time, but were easily awakened and often aware of everything that had transpired around them while in this state of pseudosomnolence,"" the review explains. ""The mortality rate for the somnolent-ophthalmoplegic form was higher than that of other forms of encephalitis lethargica, exceeding 50%; however, a greater number of survivors experienced few or no long-term sequelae than in the other forms.""

        

EL, thought to have caused over half a million deaths, grew more distressing as the disease went on.

""[The patients] would be conscious and aware – yet not fully awake; they would sit motionless and speechless all day in their chairs, totally lacking energy, impetus, initiative, motive, appetite, affect or desire; they registered what went on about them without active attention, and with profound indifference,"" Dr Oliver Sacks, who treated patients for the disease, wrote of his time spent at the Beth Abraham Hospital in New York in the 1960s in his book Awakenings. ""They neither conveyed nor felt the feeling of life; they were as insubstantial as ghosts and as passive as zombies.""

The disease spread. Like with COVID-19, new variants appeared over the next few years of the pandemic. Around Italy and Sweden in 1919-1920, a new strain emerged characterized by hyperkinetic and insomniac phases, and a neuralgic pain that was not helped by administering morphine.

""Hyperkinetic manifestations were variously characterized as 'rapid spasms,' including myoclonus, and stimulus-dependent myoclonus, or as other involuntary movements described as chorea, athetosis, dystonia, myokymia, or tremor,"" a paper on the topic explains. ""Rapid spasms, or myoclonus, more commonly affected the diaphragm or abdomen before affecting the face or limbs, and often manifested asymmetrically, affecting only one quadrant of the abdomen, one limb, or even a single extraocular muscle.""

Patients could expect rigidity in their limbs, and to be immobile for long periods of time.

                           

Those who did survive the initial disease were not out of the woods, as complications often set in years after the initial infection.

""The chronic phase was characterized by parkinsonism, but sleep disturbances, oculomotor abnormalities, involuntary movements, speech and respiratory abnormalities, and psychiatric disorders were also common features,"" the 2017 review explains. ""In the decades following the epidemic, it was estimated that as many as 50% of parkinsonism cases were postencephalitic.""

The cause of the disease remains largely unknown. One theory, popular as EL spread, is that the disease was caused by the virus responsible for the 1918 flu pandemic. The two diseases arrived and ended with similar timings, and so it makes sense that people would think that they are linked. However, looking at cities in the US between 1918 and 1923, no link was found between the two diseases, which appeared to arrive separately. 

Some epidemiologists still suspect that there may be a link, though there is little direct evidence to support the idea. One idea is that EL was neural damage resulting from the influenza epidemic, though with a delayed onset, as it was only noticed once enough damage had been done in the brain.

More recently, a study looking at the few available brain tissue samples from patients concluded that an enterovirus – a group of viruses that includes polio, spread through coming into contact with secretions from an infected patient – was the likely cause of the disease. 

However, there is no overall consensus in what caused this bizarre and distressing disease. In 1927, having killed around 500,000, EL largely stopped circulating, and all but disappeared. While the disease disappearing is what's known as a ""good thing"", without knowing its cause we do not know how likely it is that similar diseases will emerge in the future.

""Unless another cause of classical EL is positively identified, its return in the context of another influenza pandemic remains formally possible,"" one study concludes, though they add that this would bring a bright side. ""Such a recurrence would provide an opportunity to establish the etiology of EL using modern methods.""

The specific shade has a calming effect – or so the theory goes.

In 2017, Kendall Jenner made it public that she had a wall in her living room painted a very specific shade of pink. Alongside this announcement was a strange claim.

""Baker-Miller Pink is the only color scientifically proven to calm you AND suppress your appetite. I was like, “I NEED this color in my house!”. I then found someone to paint the room and now I'm loving it,"" Jenner wrote at the time.

While a celebrity making strange claims is par for the course (there are a lot of celebs out there, odds are some of them are going to have some weird beliefs), the idea hasn't sprung from nowhere. In fact, there have been quite a few studies looking into the possibility that ""Baker-Miller pink"", sometimes known as ""Drunk-Tank Pink"", is good for reducing anxiety and aggressive/hostile behavior.

The idea has gained a little traction. For instance, as of 2015 around 20 percent of prisons and police stations in Switzerland had at least one cell painted in Baker-Miller pink, with some prisons in the US, the UK, and Austria doing the same. So, where did this idea come from, and is there any truth behind it?

In 1969, researcher Alexander Schauss became interested in the potential physiological effects of color on humans. Of particular interest was a study that appeared to show that lighting had an effect on ""deviant"" behavior by prisoners. During one experiment, collaborator John N. Ott suggested that perceiving certain colors could even have an effect on muscle strength and performance. 

Schauss repeated some of these experiments, presenting participants with a board colored a certain shade and measuring their physiological responses. His results suggested that color had an effect on the participants, relaxing them, but only when they were shown a certain shade of pink.

""I experimented upon myself and noted that my blood pressure, pulse, and heart rate was unaffected by exposure to this shade of pink. However, after intentionally increasing cardiovascular activity through a series of intense physical exercises, I found that this color had a marked effect on lowering my heart rate, pulse and respiration as compared to other colors,"" Schauss wrote in one paper, adding that he initially put this down to experimenter bias.

""I awoke one night from a thought that suggested the pink color might have an effect on human aggression. If my heart beat, blood pressure, and pulse, could be reduced by a color, what effect might it have on aggressive behavior?""

Schauss enlisted various collaborators and attempted to study the possibility in real-world settings. In one experiment, with the help of the San Bernadino County Probation Department and supervised by psychologist Dr Paul Boccumini, youths at a detention center were used as subjects. 

When the youths became upset or difficult, they would be placed into a room painted in this shade of pink, or another room on the wing. According to Schauss, this had a profound effect on the subjects, with the youths becoming less verbally aggressive within around 2-3 minutes of being inside the pink room, but not the control room.

""By the 8-9th minute, each youth would assume a relaxed sitting position or lay on his or her back, spread out on the floor while frequently looking at the ceiling,"" Schauss wrote. ""Within 10 minutes, each youth sufficiently calmed down so that he or she could be returned to the main hall.""

In other experiments, Schauss found that the shade reduced physical strength, when compared to showing participants in tests a shade of blue. 

While that may sound pretty neat, or worthy of further investigation at least, there is something of a replication problem. Though many prisons began to paint cells or other rooms in Baker-Miller pink, there wasn't much in the way of supporting evidence. Further study, including work by Schauss, found little or no effect. 

In 1981, Schauss and colleagues Robert Pellegrini and Michael Miller conducted one study on a strip search room (SSR) in one county jail in Santa Clara County, California. It likely won't surprise you that this particular room was the site of many incidents, and the investigators attempted to track levels of aggression over time, before and after it was painted this shade of pink. 

""During the first pink month (September, 1979), the relative frequency of SSR incidents was lower than for the previous twelve blue months. But thereafter, this figure increased steadily for the next three months, until by December, 1979, it was higher than for any of the twelve months prior to the paint change,"" the study's authors wrote. 

In fact, though the effect was likely down to other factors out of the control of the experimenters, incidents in the SSR increased by 3.57 percent overall while it was painted pink.

""No overall aggression-reduction attributable to pink was indicated,"" they added. ""In fact, the average relative frequency of incidents increased slightly, and their month-to-month variability was markedly greater, for the twelve post-as compared with the twelve pre-pink months.""

Further studies that investigated the hypothesis, and attempted to blind experimenters, found little evidence for any effect.

""Our results rather speak against an aggression reducing impact of the color pink,"" the authors of one 2014 paper, who placed prisoners in either pink or white rooms and then logged aggressive incidents, found. ""This finding is especially important as earlier studies that emphasize an aggression reducing effect of the color pink suffer from methodological shortcomings, but nevertheless inspired many prisons to paint their cells in pink color. Our investigations question this recent development.""

Looking at less dramatic claims – that color affects grip strength – the same team cited a 1988 study that found no supporting evidence.

""Researchers monitored participant's blood pressure, pulse-rate, grip strength, response speed, visuo-motor coordination and the performance on the Digital-Symbol subset of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scales-Revised – a measure for sustained attention,"" they write. ""Significant results were only found in the less important Digital-Symbol measure and this result was attributed to learning effects.""

The researchers noted that previous experimenters did not appear to be blind to the hypothesis of the studies, and may have influenced their outcomes unconsciously, or that there could have been a training effect as the order the colors were shown to participants was not varied randomly. Apart from this, the effect observed was very small. 

All in all, we wouldn't go painting our walls in Baker-Miller pink any time soon. Even the studies that showed the most promising signs of an effect had design flaws, and those that didn't show no real difference in behavior on the part of those who viewed the color.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=Supernatural","Supernatural Outsmarted Genre TV's Biggest Trap With a Clever Trick We All Missed","https://www.cbr.com/supernatural-outsmarted-tv-biggest-trap/","Wed, 11 Feb 2026 03:30:00 GMT","

The CW's Supernatural experienced longevity that is truly rare in genre television. Spanning nearly two decades and 15 seasons, Sam and Dean Winchester outlived nearly all of their TV contemporaries. It's more than difficult to keep an audience's attention for that long for various reasons. A primary pitfall that plagues long-running series is bloated mythologies and stakes that spiral out of control and repeat themselves.

While Supernatural was certainly guilty of constantly elevating its stakes as the seasons rolled on, the stakes themselves never became the core of the series. Rather, Supernatural used its world-ending rotating door of events to constantly place Sam and Dean under emotional distress. The ever-expanding mythology was more about the psychological consequences it placed on the Winchesters, and that's why it worked.

Throughout the history of Supernatural, Sam and Dean Winchester have faced everything from Leviathans, mythological figures and even God himself. The scope increased from season to season, but unlike other franchises, the focus kept getting smaller. Created by Eric Kripke, Supernatural famously started as a modern western, with two brothers exploring the various urban legends of small towns and backroads.

The show's trick was that it never lost sight of this original vision, even as the villains and storylines increased in their magnitude. From the monster-of-the-week episodes to the season arc spotlights, Supernatural was centered on the personal and psychological trials of Sam and Dean. The stakes were always character-driven. Sam and Dean seemed cursed by bad luck, and that was intentional. While heroes, they were relatable.

It's no secret to fans that Supernatural was supposed to end with the apocalypse arc in Season 5. Even when presented with the world-ending effect, saving Sam's soul was more important for Dean. The series not ending at its intended stopping point is further proof that fans cared more about the characters and their journey than a fitting conclusion. Viewers wanted more Sam and Dean; the specific storylines were secondary.

For example, the opposite effect can be seen in the controversial latter seasons of HBO's Game of Thrones. The showrunners prioritized what they believed to be a fitting, cinematic conclusion that contrasted with the emotional logic of its characters. This led to Game of Thrones fans feeling betrayed by the finale, while fans of Supernatural clamored for more, even though Season 5 is considered a high point for the series.

Supernatural's approach to its ever-rising stakes has led to it dominating streaming platforms years after the series finale. Fans return for the characters. The series broke the rule of killing its two leads several times at the risk of dampening the tension, but the intention was not to shock viewers. The emphasis was on the emotional burnout experienced by the brothers and how it would affect their relationships.

The lore of Supernatural was flexible and apocalyptic events became familiar and commonplace. What mattered to viewers was the outcome the latest tragedy would have on Sam and Dean. The mythology never swallowed the core element that made the show work.

The proof of Supernatural's legacy comes from the numbers it still pulls on streaming services and the recently launched comic series by Dynamite Entertainment. That kind of endurance cannot be obtained by constantly introducing new threats, but by the lasting impact of well-written and relatable characters. The Winchesters are still a marketable powerhouse because the series never strayed too far from its foundation.

The stakes were measured by emotional damage rather than shock value or body counts. Fans of Supernatural will point out that some of the show's most memorable moments came in the small, intimate scenes between Sam and Dean. The blueprint is there for future genre series to follow, but it's easier said than done.

Cognitive Warfare to Dominate and Redefine Adversary Realities: Implications for U.S. Special Operations Forces is authored by Jeremiah “Lumpy” Lumbaca, PhD and published by JSOU Press.

“The battlefield of the future is the human mind, and the very concepts of reality and truth are the target. Cognitive warfare goes far beyond traditional psychological operations; this new form of conflict combines cyber tools, psychological sciences, and neurosciences to alter perceptions and influence decision-making. In this occasional paper, Dr. Jeremiah Lumbaca argues that the U.S. is not yet prepared to face its adversaries using cognitive warfare tactics and proposes a way SOF can evolve to win in this new domain of conflict.”

Cognitive warfare directly targets the processes of perception, judgment, and belief formation within individuals and groups. This form of conflict utilizes the intersection of cyber tools, psychological sciences, and neurosciences to achieve political or military objectives by altering enemy cognitive processes. The primary aim is the generation of cognitive effects rather than simple information dissemination. This includes the deployment of cognitive contagions, ideologically charged constructs designed to spread virally across digital networks to embed specific patterns of thinking. Over time, these operations can lead to epistemic closure. This is a state where a target population rejects new information that contradicts an engineered narrative.

Technological advancements in artificial intelligence and social media algorithms serve as the primary enablers for these operations. AI facilitates micro-targeting and the creation of hyper-realistic disinformation, such as deepfakes, while social media platforms prioritize engagement over accuracy. The report highlights that adversaries like the Chinese Communist Party and Iran already utilize these methods to erode internal cohesion and decision-making processes in contested regions. For U.S. Special Operations Forces, this environment necessitates a shift in organizational structure and training. Dr. Lumpy recommends the establishment of multi-disciplinary cognitive warfare cells at all echelons to include data scientists and behavioral psychologists. Furthermore, the piece advocates for the development of cognitive resilience programs and the use of AI-driven cognitive firewalls to preserve the mental sovereignty of personnel operating in manipulated information environments.

As the search for 84-year-old Nancy Guthrie continues in Arizona, social media has become a parallel arena of speculation — with conspiracy theories, viral flight-tracking claims and unverified hospital rumours circulating widely online.

Nancy Guthrie is the mother of US television host Savannah Guthrie. Authorities have confirmed that a person of interest was detained in Rio Rico, Arizona, in connection with the case. Beyond that, officials have released limited details, leaving room for online conjecture to flourish.

An X user, Paige Hearn, outlined what she described as the “Top 3 Wild Conspiracy Theories swirling around Nancy Guthrie's disappearance (Savannah Guthrie's mom) — remember, these are just online speculation & conspiracy theories, NOT facts! Authorities are investigating a real abduction/kidnapping with recent POI detention in Rio Rico, AZ. 🙏💔”

The post listed three strands of speculation circulating in fringe corners of the internet:

Staged Hoax or Family Inside Job — Claims suggesting the disappearance was fabricated for financial or personal motives. The sheriff's office has publicly pushed back against such claims, stating there is no evidence to support them.

Deepfake/AI Ransom Tricks — Some online commentators have speculated that potential ransom communications could be manipulated using artificial intelligence tools. The FBI has previously warned that emerging AI technologies can complicate investigations, though there is no official indication that such tactics are involved in this case.

Cartel or Border-Related Kidnapping — Given Rio Rico's proximity to the US-Mexico border, some posts have floated theories involving organised crime groups or cross-border activity. These claims remain unsubstantiated.

Hearn emphasised that these were “fringe ideas from social media—stick to official updates from FBI/Pima County Sheriff's. Prayers for Nancy's safe return 🙏. No proof links any to reality.”

Speculation intensified further after online users began sharing alleged flight paths of a medical helicopter travelling between Rio Rico and Tucson. Some posts suggested that Nancy Guthrie may have been transported to a Banner hospital following a high-risk operation.

However, according to ABC 15 journalist Ford Hatchett, the Pima County Sheriff's Department said the helicopter flight was not connected to the case. Claims about activity at Banner Hospital have not been independently verified.

Another post circulating on X stated, “Nothing confirmed yet, but it does NOT appear the person flown-in to the hospital is Nancy Guthrie. Authorities still appear to be searching for her and other potential suspects.”

The ‘Hot Girls for Zohran' creator, who moved to Brad Lander's congressional campaign, promoted extremist material claiming Israeli foreknowledge of 9/11 and urging violence against the Jewish state

Andres Kudacki/Getty Images

Former New York City Comptroller Brad Lander speaks during his campaign launch event at Nitehawk Cinema on December 10, 2025 in New York City. 

The highest-paid consultant for former New York City Comptroller Brad Lander's congressional bid is the founder of the “Hot Girls for Zohran” campaign — and a prolific X user who has shared posts lauding Hamas and insinuating Israeli involvement in 9/11 and the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, all while attacking police and Democratic elected officials.

Among the 21 payments appearing in the first campaign finance filing from Lander — New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani's endorsed candidate against Rep. Dan Goldman (D-NY) — the largest is $15,000 disbursed to a company called Brain Child LLC for “Website and social media.” State corporation records reveal that the two-and-a-half-month-old firm belongs to Kaif Gilani and is based out of his triplex Brooklyn apartment.

According to his LinkedIn, Gilani serves as the vice president of the enterprise data office at Citi (the financial company did not confirm or deny this when reached for comment, but said it is “investigating the matter”). But Gilani gained attention, often using the name Kaif Kabir, during the 2025 mayoral campaign as one half of the team behind “Hot Girls for Zohran”: a viral merchandising, social media and volunteer canvassing effort backing the insurgent democratic socialist.

“Hot Girls for Zohran” also organized such high-engagement events as a Mamdani look-alike contest and a costumed Halloween bash profiled in Vanity Fair. In a photo posted to Substack, the future mayor posed with Gilani holding up one of the group's signature T-shirts.

But amid all the fanfare, Gilani's X account — from which he tweeted as @chunkyfila, after formerly using his own name as a handle — passed unnoticed, despite numerous extreme views he expressed or amplified on the platform. After Jewish Insider requested comment, Gilani deleted his X and LinkedIn profiles; he also set his Instagram profile, which also uses @chunkyfila as a handle and formerly linked an empty — now deleted — account for Brain Child, to private.

A representative for Lander, a self-proclaimed progressive Zionist who has been deeply critical of Israel during its war against Hamas, maintained that the campaign was unaware of the posts JI uncovered at the time it contracted with Gilani. They added that they have ended their relationship with his firm as of Tuesday in response to JI's findings.

“We were not aware of these tweets when we hired them. As soon as we became aware, we terminated their contract. They definitely do not reflect Brad's views,” said spokeswoman Lauren Hitt. “Brad has denounced and condemned Hamas, the October 7th attacks, and the sexual violence that they committed on after [sic] October 7th, on many occasions.”

Hitt did not answer, however, how the campaign came to hire Brain Child in the first place, or whether it would scrap any products the company created for Lander's congressional bid.

Gilani's social media activity includes numerous posts and retweets assailing Israel, which he has called a “settler project country.” In January 2025, just a few months before “Hot Girls for Zohran” launched, Gilani retweeted a post by Holocaust revisionist Ian Carroll — a recurring guest on Tucker Carlson's show — in which Carroll suggested that Israel was implicated in the Kennedy assassination and the 9/11 attacks.

Giliani also retweeted a conspiratorial post from Carroll which read, “AIPAC purchased the seats of about 90% or more of our current congress. JFK famously wanted them registered as a foreign agent right before he was shot.” The post further repeated the long-debunked “dancing Israelis” conspiracy theory, which falsely claims Mossad agents had advance notice of 9/11.

The pinned post at the top of his Instagram is a photo of posters bearing the slogan “long live Palestine” and showing the entire territory of Israel, the West Bank and the Gaza Strip swathed in a keffiyeh with no boundary lines. Last May, he shared another X user's assertion that “‘Israel has a right to exist' is a racist, anti-Palestinian dog whistle which implies the extermination of the Palestinian People.”

Gilani has also repeatedly authored or promoted tweets sympathetic to or supportive of Hamas, in March 2024 sharing a post claiming that the bargaining table position of the terrorist organization — which rejects Israel's existence and which initiated the latest wave of the conflict with its rampage into Israeli territory on Oct. 7, 2023 — is “we want lasting peace and our basic human rights.” 

He also retweeted a clip of former Hamas chief Yahya Sinwar, who was killed by Israeli forces in October 2024 after he masterminded the previous year's attacks, with a caption that read, “Does the world expect us to be well-behaved victims while we are getting killed? For us to be slaughtered without making a noise?” Gilani also retweeted a post that attacked stylistic differences between the Time cover honoring Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who is Jewish, as “Person of the Year” and the issue announcing Sinwar's death as “A tale of two ethnicities.”

In November 2023, Gilani reacted to a tweet decrying a Hamas rocket that struck an Israeli kindergarten in Sderot by writing, “I thought this was satire for a second.” He further boosted tweets mocking or dismissing Jewish Americans' concerns about rising antisemitism, retweeting one post stating that such fear “makes me laugh” because of how American Muslims purportedly downplay their own experience of Islamophobia, and another that sneered “really love the internet when I can watch videos of a Jewish pogrom in the West Bank where 3 Palestinians were killed and then see people on the Upper East Side tweeting about how unsafe they feel as Jews in New York after a Democratic primary election.”

He also shared multiple posts denying or downplaying well-documented incidents of antisemitic violence during November 2024 riots in Amsterdam.

In October 2024, after Iran launched more than 200 ballistic missiles and drones at Israel, he reposted a tweet, the text of which stated, “One side is cartoonishly evil in this war, and it ain't Iran.” On June 13, 2025, when Israel severely damaged Iranian nuclear sites and military installations, Gilani tweeted about the news, saying, “May Allah protect the children of this earth. Those who have to learn about the perils of war before getting to experience the simple pleasures of this dunya.” One day later, he retweeted a post stating “Tell Iran we voting for a Muslim in NYC please let them know lmao.”

Gilani has also repeatedly signal-boosted individuals and organizations linked to the global propaganda network controlled by Beijing-based tech mogul Neville “Roy” Singham, including CODEPINK, BreakThrough News and pundit Rania Khalek, who first became famous as an apologist for Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad on Russian state-owned media.

And in July of last year, Gilani retweeted a post asserting “there is no negotiating with Israel,” which the user labeled “a racist supremacist state.” He also shared another post that called for “overwhelming military force” against Israel over its policies toward Gaza. 

He also shared multiple posts urging Mamdani not to abandon the slogan “globalize the intifada,” a phrase that has been invoked at anti-Israel demonstrations and criticized as an anti-Jewish call to violence, and which the now-mayor has distanced himself from but refused to condemn.  

That same month, he retweeted a post from a now-deleted account that denied the extensive evidence of sexual assaults conducted by Hamas during the Oct. 7 attacks, denouncing such assertions as “so obscenely racist it's disgusting anyone remotely believed that shit.”

In a statement to JI, Gilani did not directly address the content or substance of any of his tweets. Rather, he insinuated that he was being singled out for his Muslim faith. He denied holding any animus toward Jewish people, and maintained those he knows personally hold the same views as he does. 

“My critiques of the Israeli government as it carries on a U.S.-backed slaughter are not antisemitism, they are indicative of a basic level of morality and empathy for others,” he wrote in an email. “I'm grateful for my many Jewish friends who share my opinions. Free Palestine.”

Gilani has also gone after leading Democratic politicians, including some with whom Mamdani and Lander would need to work to achieve their policy aims. 

In 2020, Gilani referred to then-candidate Joe Biden as “a pedophile with dementia,” while in 2024 he quote-tweeted the then-president with the message: “My prayer is that your heart stops beating.” He has also asserted that Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) “is going to hell.” He also urged a primary campaign against House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY), writing to City Councilman Chi Osse: “Let's get his ass.” Mamdani reportedly discouraged Osse from running against Jeffries, and intervened to block an endorsement of his candidacy from the Democratic Socialists of America.

Gilani has also lashed out at City Councilwoman Inna Vernikov, a Jewish Republican representing parts of Brooklyn. In May 2024, Gilani tweeted at the lawmaker, “You're a f*cking idiot and your face resembles that of a horse.” 

He has also attacked Mamdani's close ally Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), tweeting at him “u a f*cking b*tch fr.”

Gilani has vented strong anti-police sentiments, having written that “all cops are going to hell,” as well as “there's no such thing as a good cop” and “we literally do not give a f*ck about videos of cops or military on their knees. we won't be satisfied until the entire racist system is on its knees.” He has also tweeted “f*ck the police” on at least two occasions. 

As the NYPD cleared the anti-Israel encampments at Columbia University on May 1, 2024, Gilani retweeted a post which stated, “Cops are violent psychopaths who pray for a moment like this where they get to live out their rotten fantasies of beating and killing protestors,” and added, “Reform isn't real.” Additionally, Gilani shared a statement from activists at Emory University that labeled police “pigs.”

Besides his political and religious musings, Gilani's feed consists largely of references to sports gambling, cryptocurrencies and lewd jokes.

18-year-old Paula Welden was a Bennington College student in Vermont. After finishing her shift at the dining hall at her college, she returned to her room and changed into clothes suitable for a trek. On the afternoon of December 1st, 1946, she left the campus to go for a hike. She had informed her roommate, and she was last seen that afternoon.

Her clothing for the hike was adequate for the afternoon, but not for the drop in temperature that night. She had packed no bag, no extra clothing, or any extra money. 

Due to the lack of clues surrounding her disappearance, a number of alternative theories were speculated. Some suggested that she had been distraught while she had headed out for the hike; others claimed that her home life was not as idyllic as her parents had told the police. However, none of these theories materialized, and the case went cold. 

To date, there is no knowledge of how she disappeared. 

On 23rd January, 1959, 10 hikers had gone for a winter trek through Russia's Ural Mountains. One had returned home due to medical reasons, while the rest of the nine continued forward. They were supposed to send a message back to their sports club three weeks after they had started the trek. When the club didn't receive any message by February 20th, they sent out a search party. And what they would go on to find was unsettling. 

The first five students seemed to have died from hypothermia, which can cause erratic behavior. However, the remaining four bodies did not share the same cause of death. Their injuries were so severe that their exact cause of death could not have been determined, and the investigation concluded that the hikers had died from a ""compelling natural force."" 

Some citizens wondered if it was the Soviet government covering something up. Traces of radiation were found on the hikers' clothes, which further fueled this theory. Other theories surrounding these mysterious deaths also included yetis, the KGB, and the CIA, although nothing concrete has come out of this. 

Encephalitis lethargica is an illness that attacks the brain, leaving the victims like living statues—speechless and motionless. This disease turned into a full-blown epidemic around the world in the 1920s. The mysterious part of this epidemic was that no one knew how it started or what caused it. 

This affected more than 1 million people, and led to an estimated 500,000 deaths. 

The spread of this disease started around the same time as the Spanish flu pandemic (1918-1920), so it was initially believed that there might have been a link between the two conditions, although it was never proven. 

To add more suspense and enigma around this epidemic, no one seemed to have a clue about how it started or how the disease vanished, except for a few isolated cases. 

In late 2016, this strange illness was affecting American officials around the world, and it seemed to have begun in Cuba. Approximately over three dozen diplomats and CIA officers reported suffering from severe headaches, nausea, and hearing unidentifiable grinding, piercing, and noises in their heads. This malady was then known as ""Havana Syndrome,"" and it was seemingly ruining the health of diplomats, officers, and members of their families who were nearby at the time of these attacks. 

Members have felt this illness outside the White House and in several countries around the world, like China, Austria, Bulgaria, France, Georgia, Poland, Serbia, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom.  

In 2024, a declassified intelligence study report stated that the most probable cause could be ""pulsed electromagnetic energy"" that could penetrate through building walls. Another report by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine stated in 2020 that weaponized microwaves could also be the cause of this syndrome. 

Over the years, the Overtoun Bridge in Dumbarton, Scotland, has become synonymous with incidents where dogs have been compelled to jump off, ever since the 1950s. 

Local research gave an estimated number of more than 300 dogs having jumped off the bridge. At least 50 dogs have passed away due to this unexplained event. Some rational explanations state that the dogs get into a frenzy due to an overload of scents and the terrain. Some other explanations are more superstitious and paranormal in comparison. 

This is definitely an intriguing and creepy instance, which definitely needs to be explained quickly so that no more dogs go through this experience. 

Queen Cleopatra, the Egyptian queen of the Ptolemaic dynasty, is one of the most famous queens in history. Just as her political and personal life is etched in history books as highly significant, there is one final mystery regarding the queen and her husband, Mark Antony: where their tomb lies.

After the Roman armies of Octavian defeated Cleopatra's forces, Cleopatra died by suicide after burying Antony, as he too had died. And so, Egypt fell under Roman rule. What history knows is that they were both buried together. 

Kathleen Martinez strongly believes that this port might be a key location in relation to Cleopatra's tomb; however, it has yet to be confirmed. 

But for now, the location of Cleopatra and Mark Antony's final resting spot still remains a mystery for the world. 

The Flannan Isles in Scotland are also sometimes referred to as the Seven Hunters. The lighthouse sits on a 200-foot cliff, and it is a 75-foot-tall white tower. The tower has a range of 20 miles and flashes two white signals every 30 seconds. 

In December of 1900, there were three lightkeepers on duty: James Ducat, the principal lightkeeper; Thomas Marshall, the assistant lightkeeper; and Donald McArthur, the occasional keeper.

The first sign that something was not okay at the lighthouse was when a steamer passing the lighthouse at midnight on 15th December noted that the light was not lit. The crew reported this when they arrived at the port; however, there was a delay in communication to the commissioners regarding this.

They only discovered that the lightkeepers were missing on a routine visit to the Lighthouse Tender Hesperus on 26th December, 1900. 

From the records of the keeper's log, it can be said that all the work was done and set for the 15th of December, suggesting that the men disappeared on the afternoon of the15th.

There was no evidence of the men disappearing or where they went; however, due to traces of bad weather, it was concluded that the men must have left the lighthouse for some purpose in the harsh weather and might have gotten caught in an unexpected wave, and swept into the sea. However, the keepers' families — and the rest of the world — are still not sure of what happened at the lighthouse. 

These Nazca lines are found in Nazca, near a region of Lima, Peru. There are over 800 straight lines, 300 geometric figures, and 70 animal and plant designs, which are also called biomorphs. Some of them stretch over 30 miles, while the biomorphs range from 50 to 1200 feet in length. 

Maria Reiche battled to protect the site and also fought for her theories regarding the lines' astronomical and calendrical purpose. 

Scientists believe that the majority of the lines were made by the Nasza people around A.D. 1 to 700. Some of the lines are seen to overlap, and some lines look both ancient and of modern origin. 

Regarding why the lines were made and how they were made, there are a few theories. The Kosok-Reiche astronomy theories were deemed true till the 1970s, when a group of American researchers studied the glyphs. Johan Reinhard, a National Geographic Explorer-in-Residence, stated in his book The Nazca Lines: A New Perspective on Their Origin and Meanings: ""It seems likely that most of the lines did not point at anything on the geographical or celestial horizon, but rather led to places where rituals were performed to obtain water and fertility of crops.""

Roopkund Lake is located 16,500 feet above sea level at the bottom of Trisul, one of India's highest mountains, in the state of Uttarakhand.

The remains were first discovered by a patrolling British forest ranger in 1942. Depending on the weather, the lake expands and shrinks. When the snow melts, the skeletons are visible, sometimes with flesh attached and some quite well preserved. The local government describes this lake as a mystery lake. 

Over the years, scientists and anthropologists have studied the remains and remain puzzled over the origin of these bodies and how they ended up in this state. 

Studies of the skeletons have found that most of the people who died were taller than the average stature. They were aged between 35 and 50, all of reasonably good health. It was assumed that the skeletons were of a single group of people who died at once due to an incident in the 9th century. 

However, the latest study might just prove these assumptions wrong. This study revealed that the skeletons were genetically diverse and their time of death was separated in time by as much as 1000 years. One group of people had genetics similar to people in South Asia, whereas another group was closely related to people living in present-day Europe.

Additionally, genetic studies found no evidence of any ancient bacteria in the lake that could provide an explanation of disease as the cause of death. Nonetheless, we still do not know the exact reason why there are so many remains at this lake, how they died, and where the people came from. 

In 1900, Greek divers discovered a wreckage off the coast of Antikythera. It had been buried on the bed of the Aegean Sea since 65 BCE and is one of the largest shipwrecks ever found. More than 300 objects were found, but none were more intriguing and mysterious than the Antikythera mechanism, the world's first ""computer."" 

This mechanism was discovered on what is believed to be a trading or cargo ship. In the 1970s, the importance of this bronze mechanism was uncovered as it was revealed that the device was a complex machine with at least 30 gear wheels. 

In 2016, it was revealed that much of the inscription and texts on its surface suggested that it was a philosopher's guide to the galaxy. Around 95% of the text has been deciphered; however, the full text has not been released. 

The size of this device is that of a shoebox, with dials on the front and back. The front of this mechanism pointed to the location of the sun and moon along with a display of the phases of the moon.  This device is currently in the Greek National Archaeological Museum in Athens. It was estimated to be built around 87 BC and was lost in 76 BC. 

We still do not know how this artifact got onto a Roman ship or the precise use of this device.

This fired-clay disc was discovered in 1908, written in a language that nobody has been able to identify or decipher. It was found 40 miles south of Heraklion, Crete, in Phaistos. This place was inhabited as early as 4000 BC, and it was an important Minoan city. This artifact was found in the site's Old Palace, which dates back to 1900-1700 BC. 

It is an ancient decorated cylinder made of fired clay. It has symbols etched on both its sides. There are 242 hieroglyph-like images in all, with 45 different symbols as well as dashes and dots.  

What is the disc's purpose or meaning? That is a question that has garnered intense debates. Some theories state that it is a list of religious centers, a healing ritual inscription, a poem, a hymn, a curse, or a court list, to name a few. A linguist in 2017 claimed that it might have been a prayer to the Minoan earth goddess, Aphaia. 

Experts have still not agreed on one singular explanation behind this disc and the language inscribed on it. 

On March 8th, 2014, a flight flying from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing disappeared after takeoff with 227 passengers and 12 crew members on board. 

Flight 370 took off at 12:41 AM from Kuala Lumpur. The last voice communication from the crew onboard was at 1:19 AM, and then at 1:21 AM, the plane's transponder, which communicated with the air traffic control, was shut off just as they were about to enter Vietnamese airspace. Soon after, the Malaysian and Vietnamese radar lost contact with the plane over the Andaman Sea. The plane was no longer visible on the radar.

The flight was expected to arrive in Beijing at 6:30 local time in Malaysia. Malaysia Airlines issued a statement that the flight was missing after contact was lost. The distance between the satellite and plane placed it within the search zone of 46,000 square miles of the southern Indian Ocean, which is a vast area of the ocean. 

A multinational search, which was led by Australia, failed to locate the flight. Though pieces of debris discovered later, that were believed to be from the plane along the East Africa coast and on Indian Ocean islands. However, no main wreckage or bodies have been recovered.

A deep-sea search of the plane began again in December 2025 in the Indian Ocean.  

In 1587, John White, along with 118 men, women, and children, went on an expedition from England for the New World. They reached Roanoke Island near present-day North Carolina on July 22nd. During the first few months, there were scarce resources, tense relations with the Indigenous Algonquian, and harsh winter conditions. John White sailed back to England for more supplies but only returned three years later. When he returned on August 18th, 1590, he found the colony empty with no inhabitants. 

There were just two clues left: the word 'CRO' carved into a tree and the word 'CROATOAN' carved into a palisade. There were no signs of a struggle or hasty escape, but simply that the colonists had vanished. 

One popular theory regarding this mysterious disappearance is that the colonists moved and joined the Hatteras, a group of Native people, on the nearby Croatoan Island. Some evidence to back this theory is that there were objects found within Croatoan villages that only English settlers had owned. This helped solidify the connection between the colonists and the Hatteras tribe. 

Nonetheless, the real reason and fact behind this unusual disappearance are still highly debated. 

This castle was built in the 13th century, in an isolated region of the Czech Republic, close to the German border. It was quite far away from the nearest water source, town, or trade route. There is also no evidence that it used to be someone's home or that it was of political significance. So why was it built in the first place? This just added to the mystical allure of the castle. 

All of these factors added to the theories and myths surrounding the castle, calling it ""the gateway to hell."" In the 13th century, local residents reported strange happenings in the dense forest of Houska. There were stories of a bottomless pit and myths of winged beasts emerging from its depths. 

According to one legend, the local duke, who was determined to eradicate any rumors of hellish happenings, had a young prisoner lowered into the hole. No one expected the hole to be so deep. When they heard a scream from the hole, they pulled the prisoner back up, and seemingly, the boy had aged 40 years and was found in an incredibly disturbed state. After this incident, the duke took action and built the Houska Castle directly on top of it. As a defense against anything dark or evil, a chapel was constructed directly above the pit.

Michael Shermer discusses his new book, Truth,  at the Commonwealth Club in San Francisco on February 24. He'll clarify types of truth, expose classic fallacies, and show how to discern facts amid misinformation, conspiracy theories, and lies.

There are scientific truths, religious truths, historical truths, mythical truths, and more. In our current swamp of misinformation, disinformation, truthiness, rewritten history, conspiracy theories, “fake news,” and bald-faced lies, how do we discern actual facts and truth? What is “truth,” anyway? The Declaration of Independence claims that “We hold these truths to be self-evident.” What about those “truths”? These questions are crucial if we're to have a functioning democracy.

Michael Shermer, founding publisher of Skeptic magazine and author of the new book Truth: What It Is, How to Find It, and Why It Still Matters, returns to the podium to tackle these issues with us. He will clarify the different kinds of truth, take us on an entertaining ride through some classic fallacies, and then show us how to figure out, within the context of the various types of “truth,” whether a particular “fact” is, in fact, factual.

So join us for an informative discussion and maybe a few enjoyable, and illuminating, experiential exercises in which we'll practice tackling the problem of finding truth, then maybe have dinner afterward at a nearby restaurant!

Attorney General Pam Bondi on Wednesday responded to House Democrats' heated questions about the Trump administration's handling of the Epstein files by chastising them for ignoring stock market gains and other of President Donald Trump's political wins.

""The Dow is over 50,000 right now,"" Bondi said in sworn testimony before the House Judiciary Committee after Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., slammed her and the Department of Justice for so far failing to indict any of convicted sex predator Jeffrey Epstein's co-conspirators.

The S&P 500 is also up and the Nasdaq is ""smashing records,"" while Americans' retirement accounts are ""booming,"" Bondi said after celebrating the Dow Jones Industrial Average's gains. ""That's what we should be talking about.""

Democrats balked at the rhetoric, but Bondi doubled down.

""What does the Dow have to do with anything? That's what they just asked. Are you kidding?"" she said as Judiciary Chairman Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, banged a gavel and called for order in the hearing room.

Trump has repeatedly mentioned stock market gains as a barometer for his presidency after having been elected to a second term amid voter concerns about rising prices for consumer goods. The Dow closed above 50,000 for the first time on Friday and added to that record each day this week.

The DOJ oversight hearing had already devolved into partisan shouting matches on multiple occasions prior to Bondi's references to the stock market.

In this article

Cloudflare's stock gained 5% Wednesday after the company beat Wall Street's fourth-quarter estimates and issued upbeat guidance as artificial intelligence adoption fuels demand for its networking and security tools.

In an earnings call with analysts Tuesday, CEO Matthew Prince said the rise of AI and agentic tools that can carry out tasks on a user's behalf has driven more demand to Cloudflare's networking and security offerings

Prince said the company is seeing a boost from a ""fundamental re-platforming"" of the internet. 

""If AI agents are the new users of the internet, Cloudflare is the platform they run on and the network they pass through,"" he said. ""This creates a virtuous flywheel.""

The global networking and cloud provider reported adjusted earnings of 28 cents per share on $615 million in revenue. That topped the 27 cents per share and $591 million in revenue expected by analysts polled by LSEG. Revenue jumped 34% from a year ago. 

Cloudflare also provided strong guidance, calling for revenue in the range of $620 million and $621 million during the first quarter, ahead of the $614 million expected by analysts. For the full year, Cloudflare expects revenue between $2.79 billion to $2.80 billion, versus a $2.74 billion estimate.

Last month, the viral rise of Moltbot, an open-source AI personal assistant built on Anthropic's Claude model, lifted shares of Cloudflare as the company's edge infrastructure and security platform proved effective for running the agents.The cybersecurity company then released its own Moltworker platform, especially for securely running the Moltbot.

The ""continued proliferation of AI agents benefits Cloudflare and its Workers platform as AI agents require low-latency, secure inferencing that often scales up and scales down and is close to the user or 'edge' of the network,"" wrote analysts at RBC Capital Markets last month.

Prince, who also co-founded the company, said Cloudflare finished 2025 with 4.5 million active human developers.

The University of Cambridge has announced it will return more than 100 artifacts looted from Nigeria during a 19th-century British military expedition. The move comes amid growing demands for museums in the UK to repatriate cultural items taken during colonial rule to their countries of origin.

The objects, known collectively as the Benin Bronzes, including bronze plaques, brass and wooden sculptures, carved ivory tusks, and ceremonial items, were ransacked in 1897 when British forces attacked the Kingdom of Benin in present-day Nigeria.

In a statement on Sunday, Cambridge said it has transferred legal ownership of 116 artifacts held at its Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology (MAA) to Nigeria's National Commission for Museums and Monuments (NCMM).

“Physical transfer of the majority of the artifacts will be arranged in due course,” the university said, adding that 17 pieces “will remain on loan and on display at the MAA for three years in the first instance.”

Nigeria's NCMM confirmed it has received legal ownership of the items, saying the transfer followed a formal request submitted in 2022. 

“The return of cultural items for us is not just the return of the physical object, but also the restoration of the pride and dignity that was lost when these objects were taken in the first place,” NCMM Director-General Olugbile Holloway said.

Several African states have stepped up efforts to reclaim cultural heritage from Western institutions, including the British Museum, which holds extensive collections acquired during colonial campaigns.

In August 2022, the Horniman Museum and Gardens in London announced the repatriation of 72 Benin Bronzes to Nigeria. Months later, the Rhode Island School of Design Museum returned 31 items – including a piece known as the ‘Head of a King' – to Nigeria's National Collections.

Last June, the Netherlands also returned 119 artifacts to Nigeria, including human and animal figures, plaques, royal regalia, and a historic bell looted more than a century ago.

Ghana and Uganda have recently received dozens of royal treasures and traditional items taken during British colonial rule under loan agreements rather than through outright transfers of ownership.

Masoud Pezeshkian tries to convey message of national unity as negotiations with US hang in balance

US politics live – latest updates

Iran's president insisted his country was not seeking a nuclear weapon as he acknowledged “great sorrow” after the authorities' recent crackdown on protesters.

Speaking to crowds gathered across Iran to mark the anniversary of the 1979 revolution, Masoud Pezeshkian sought to claim a message of national unity after demonstrations that roiled the country and triggered an unprecedented crisis for the regime.

The comments were made against a backdrop of negotiations with the US that hang in the balance, with the prospect of a military confrontation on the table and repeated claims by Iranian military leadership that it is ready to confront and defeat America. On Tuesday, Donald Trump said he was considering sending a second aircraft carrier strike group to the Middle East to prepare for military action if talks with Tehran failed.

Pezeshkian said Iran was willing to negotiate over its nuclear programme and was “ready for any kind of verification” in relation to its insistence it is not trying to build nuclear weapons. However, the UN nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency, has been unable for months to inspect and verify Iran's nuclear stockpile.

Pezeshkian said: “The high wall of mistrust that the United States and Europe have created through their past statements and actions does not allow these talks to reach a conclusion.

“At the same time, we are engaging with full determination in dialogue aimed at peace and stability in the region alongside our neighbouring countries.”

While he did not directly address the bloodshed by authorities in suppressing the protests, Pezeshkian said: “We are ashamed before the people. We are obliged to serve all those who were harmed in this process. We are ready to hear the voice of the people. We are servants of the people and we do not seek to confront the people.”

However, Pezeshkian spurned an appeal from leaders of reformist parties to speak out against the mass arrest of their leadership in recent days. In a statement, the Reform Front told Pezeshkian that a failure to demand their release would be understood as a betrayal of his campaign promises and a blow to peace.

Lawyers acting for the detained reformists said they understood they were being kept in solitary confinement. Media organisations close to the security forces claimed they were guilty of sedition by trying to organise a national conference to call for change.

The 1979 commemorations featured state television showing hundreds of thousands of people at pro-government rallies, which included the burning of American flags and cries of “death to America!” Yet the night before, witnesses had heard shouts from people's homes in the Iranian capital, Tehran, of “Death to the dictator!”

Alongside the crowds in the streets, pictures circulated of empty school desks adorned with red roses commemorating children killed in the protests. A teachers' union said it believed 213 children were killed.

Other regime figures used the anniversary of the revolution as an opportunity to reassert their ideological supremacy.

Brig gen Aziz Nasirzadeh, the defence minister, hailed the crowds as unique and claimed: “I have never seen such a passionate attendance in any year.”

He added: “They have participated in this march with full awareness, and this presence is more powerful than any bomb or missile.”

Away from the demonstrations, Iranian diplomats were trying to head off an attempt by Benjamin Netanyahu to toughen Trump's negotiating stance with Iran before the Israeli leader's meeting in the White House with him on Wednesday.

An Iranian foreign ministry spokesperson said the country was ready to discuss a reduction in the enrichment of uranium.

Israel wants the talks to include the question of Tehran's ballistic missile programme, a matter that Iran has so far rejected. Tehran is determined that its stockpile of ballistic missiles, regarded as necessary for Iran's defence, is excluded from the talks. Ali Shamkhani, a representative of the supreme leader, said the missile issue was not something that the negotiators had authority over.

In his latest remarks, Trump suggested Iran's nuclear missiles would have to be included in any agreement.

Ali Larijani, the secretary of Iran's supreme national security council, visited Qatar after holding three hours of talks with mediators in Oman on Tuesday. Larijani is trying to craft a response to US demands that will keep within Iran's red lines but still make the US believe talks are worth continuing.

Larijani kept open the possibility of wider talks with US, so long as next week's talks are confined to guarantees about Iran's civil nuclear programme.

Larijani said: “If the current negotiations with the United States are successful, they can be expanded and extended to other areas as well. However, at the moment, I cannot say definitively whether this path will lead to talks about other disputes with the United States or not.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Editor's note: This is a developing story and is being updated.

Explosions were reported in the western Ukrainian city of Lviv on Feb. 11, amid reports of Russia launching hypersonic Kinzhal missiles.

Kyiv Independent reporters on the ground reported hearing two explosions around 2:50 p.m. local time. 

Ukraine's Air Force earlier reported that missiles were heading toward the city.

Lviv Mayor Andriy Sadovyi said the resident could hear Ukraine's air defence operations in the city at the time. He added that two Kinzhal missiles were heading at around 2:40 p.m. in the direction of Lviv.

Governor Maksym Kozytsky said that debris from the missiles was found in the Zolochiv and Lviv districts of Lviv Oblast. 

There were no reports of damage or casualties.

Reporter

Yuliia Taradiuk is a Ukrainian reporter at the Kyiv Independent. She has been working with Lutsk-based misto.media, telling stories of Ukrainian fighters for the ""All are gone to the front"" project. She has experience as a freelance culture reporter, and a background in urbanism and activism, working for multiple Ukrainian NGOs.
Yuliia holds B.A. degree in English language and literature from Lesya Ukrainka Volyn National University, she studied in Germany and Lithuania.



A Russian strike on Bohodukhiv, Kharkiv Oblast, killed four people, including three toddlers, and injured two others, Governor Oleh Syniehubov reported overnight Feb. 11.



The messages come a week after Ukraine's defense ministry agreed with Starlink's parent company, SpaceX, to introduce mandatory registration for the internet terminals in Ukraine, a move meant to prevent their use by Russian forces.

Kyiv Independent reporters on the ground reported hearing two explosions around 2:50 p.m. local time. 





""We have been discussing the training of Ukrainian soldiers, also on the soil of Ukraine,"" Kaja Kallas, the EU's high representative for foreign affairs, said in Brussels on Feb. 11 before a meeting of EU defense ministers. 

According to the president, the negotiations would be hosted by the U.S. and will take place on Feb. 17 and Feb. 18. The talks, however, depend on Russia's agreement to take part, something that Ukraine and the U.S. have not yet received.



 As global attention has shifted to Ukraine's energy crisis, the fighting on the eastern front has not slowed. The Kyiv Independent's Francis Farrell speaks with Volodymyr Polevyi, head of public affairs for the 7th Rapid Response Corps of the Air Assault Forces, about the battle for Pokrovsk and Myrnohrad in Donetsk Oblast.

Ukrainian drones targeted Russia's Volgograd oil refinery overnight Feb. 11, setting the site ablaze, local media reported.

""The losses are terrible, and even the Russians will struggle to replace that level of losses,"" Sir Richard Moore, the former MI6 chief, said. 

The European Parliament voted to approve a 90 billion euros ($107 billion) loan to Ukraine, securing a large chunk of the country's budgetary and military needs for the next two years as the war approaches its fourth anniversary.

Authorities have not released the identity of the shooter and declined to comment on their motive

Arianna Bazinet was driving home after having lunch when she saw police cars speeding into town. Moments later, the emergency alert came over her phone.

“I immediately sent it to my mom and said, ‘Hey, stay in the house, don't go anywhere,'” Ms. Bazinet said. “We had no idea that it had actually started when kids went back to school at lunchtime.”

She learned about the shooting on Facebook from friends in the community. She said one of her friends' little brothers was in the school at the time, but wasn't injured. Another friend's sister was still missing on Tuesday evening.

“They can't find her, and it's just horrible,” said Ms. Bazinet, who previously attended school there herself. “We're hoping to hear good news. We're praying for good news, but we can only hope.”

Authorities have not released the identity of the shooter and declined to comment on their motive.

Police said Tuesday that the shooter died from what appeared to be a self‑inflicted injury. They did not believe there were any other suspects.

A police active shooter alert described the suspect “as female in a dress with brown hair”.

Police Superintendent Ken Floyd later confirmed at a news conference that the suspect described in the alert was the same person found dead in the school.

Supt. Floyd said police believe they've been able to identify the shooter, but for privacy reasons and for the conduct of the investigation, they're not releasing that information.

Governor-General Mary Simon said in a statement that she and her husband Whit Fraser send their deepest condolences to the community. They also thanked the first responders.

“In this unimaginable moment of tragedy, the whole of Canada has Tumbler Ridge in its thoughts,” she said. “Let us stay united in our compassion and reach out to one another with love and tenderness today, as we join the entire nation in grieving.”

NDP interim leader Don Davies expressed his condolences to residents of Tumbler Ridge while appearing with other MPs to hold a news conference ahead of national Kindness Week, which occurs from Feb. 15 to 21.

He said there was a “cruel irony” to being at such an event, but also a profound symmetry given a gathering of MPs across party lines to focus on the opposite of what has happened in British Columbia.

Responding to questions from journalists, Mr. Davies said there will be time in coming days to learn more about what has happened.

“Right now, we have to come together as a country and express our deep condolences and grief to all those who are suffering and offer whatever help might be needed in this community at this time,” he said.

At the same event, Green Party Leader Elizabeth May said she expected first responders are going to need a lot of emotional support after what they witnessed inside the school doors in Tumbler Ridge.

“It's unspeakable. It's a terrible tragedy and we mourn with those who have lost so much,” she said.

Here is a look at some other school shootings in Canada:

On Jan. 22, 2016, Randan Dakota Fontaine shot two of his cousins dead, then killed a teacher and a teacher's aide at the La Loche high school.

On April 5, 2013, two men were killed during a shooting at the school's daycare. The shooter was identified as Robert Charron. Thirty-eight-year-old Neil Galliou was killed before Charron took his own life. Charron told staff to take the 53 children to safety before he opened fire.

On May, 23, 2007, 15-year-old Jordan Manners was found in a hallway with single gunshot wound to the chest. He later died in hospital. Two teens were charged with first-degree-murder and were later acquitted.

On Sept. 13, 2006, 18-year-old Anastasia De Sousa was killed and 20 others were hurt when gunman Kimveer Gill, 25, opened fire with a semi-automatic weapon. Gill was killed in a police gunfight.

On April 28, 1999, a 14-year-old Grade 9 students shot three students, killing 17-year-old Jason Lang before he was arrested.

On Dec. 6, 1989, 25-year-old Marc Lepine shot more than two dozen people, killing 14 women before killing himself. The school has since been renamed to Polytechnique Montréal.

On Aug. 24, 1992, Valery Fabrikant, a mechanical engineering professor, shot four other Concordia University professors on the ninth floor of the Henry F. Hall Building, and wounded a secretary. Matthew McCartney Douglass and Michael Gorden Hogben died that day. Aaron Jaan Saber died the next day, and Phoivos Ziogas died on Sept. 23, 1992. Fabrikant was convicted for the murders and remains in prison.

Schools in Tumbler Ridge will remain closed for the rest of the week after Tuesday's mass shooting.

The school district says the community experienced a tragic and deeply traumatic event, and the trauma and impact of this loss are immeasurable.

“There is no timeline for how each of us will process this grief and immense loss, both individually and as a community,” School District 59 said in a statement posted on its website.

“While words often feel inadequate in the face of such loss, coming together can help reduce isolation and remind us that we are not alone.”

The school district says it has created a space at the Tumbler Ridge Community Centre where mental health professionals will be present to provide support as needed.

Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre said the incident was devastating and called on Canadians to unite in support of the families and larger community of Tumbler Ridge.

“The fact that this took place at a secondary school – it makes it even more tragic,” he said. “As a father, I can't even imagine the phone calls that parents might have received.”

“I can't imagine the heartache and hell that they're living through.”

He said he will be in touch with Mr. Carney and other parties to offer support.

“I encourage all Canadians to pray for the community and pray for the family as we go forward and take the necessary steps to support them,” he said.

Chris Norbury is a local district councillor whose wife works at the high school and whose five-year-old daughter attends the nearby elementary school. He was among the parents that received notice that the community's schools had been placed on lockdown.

“It's an unbelievable tragedy that our community has to live through, that'll take a very long time for us to heal,” he said.

Mr. Norbury works at the Tumbler Ridge Visitor Centre, which is located within a block of the high school. After the elementary school called to tell him his daughter was safe, he watched as emergency services gathered around the high school, blocking an access road. A helicopter hovered overhead.

Those who responded, he said, included paramedics and police, many of them intimately connected with those inside.

“The first responders, I can only imagine how they feel, having to see children that they know, fearful they have lost their lives,” Mr. Norbury said.

Mr. Norbury's family emerged safe, but grief has touched everyone.

“Multiple people have died,” he said. “We all know them. And they were friends. And their parents were our friends.”

The Tumbler Ridge tragedy is one of the worst school shootings in Canadian history.

School shootings in Canada are relatively rare. In January, 2016, a 17-year-old shot and killed two brothers, his cousins, at their home in La Loche, in northern Saskatchewan. He then proceeded to La Loche Community School, where he fatally shot a teacher and a teacher's aide. Seven others were injured.

The deadliest school shooting in Canada remains at École Polytechnique, an engineering university in Montréal where a man motivated by a hatred of feminists shot and killed 14 women in December, 1989. Thirteen others were injured.

The shooting in Tumbler Ridge, B.C., is hitting close to home for some Canadian Olympians competing at the Milan Cortina Winter Games.

As Team Canada athletes and coaches carried out their sports duties across Italy on the sixth day of the Olympics, they were also confronted with tragedy back on their home soil.

Sam Reinhart, a forward on the Canadian men's hockey team, said was devastated to hear the news when he woke up Wednesday morning.

“We are all talking about it,” said Reinhart, who is from West Vancouver. “You feel it all the way over here. We've been thinking about them all day and we will continue to all Olympics. We are here to do what we can to represent the country and take some minds off it for an hour or two.”

Jon Cooper, the head coach of the men's hockey team, grew up about four hours away in nearby Prince George, B.C.

In Milan on Wednesday, he said it was hard to get his head around what happened.

“You think about tragedies that happen, usually they happen somewhere else, so you never really feel the effect of it touching close to home,” Cooper said. “This one's close to home, and my heart goes out to all the families.”

Many world leaders including French President Emanuel Macron, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky have reached out to Prime Minister Mark Carney to express their condolences after the mass shooting in Tumbler Ridge, B.C.

They expressed their shock and offered words of support and sympathy to the families of the victims as well as the first responders and the community at large.

King Charles also issued a statement, calling the shooting “the most dreadful attack.”

“In such a closely connected town, every child's name will be known and every family will be a neighbour. We can only begin to imagine the appalling shadow that has now descended across Tumbler Ridge and our hearts go out to all those whose lives have been so shattered by this senseless act of brutal violence,” he wrote.

“In sending our most heartfelt condolences, my wife and I stand in solidarity with the people of Tumbler Ridge and all Canadians as they seek understanding, healing and strength.”

Quinn Campbell, 12, was in the bathroom of the high school, Tumbler Ridge Secondary, when she heard several shots. At first, a teacher told her not to worry, suggesting it may have been a loud sound produced by the school shop.

Moments later, she was told to take cover. She joined roughly 16 other students in the gymnasium equipment room, where they locked the door and turned out the lights.

“I was just thinking about all of my friends, if they were okay. Thinking about my family,” said Quinn, a student in Grade Seven. They stayed inside for several hours, joined by a teacher.

Inside the equipment room, older students attempted to keep up spirits.

“They were mostly trying to cheer me up since I was the youngest one in the room,” Quinn said. “They were trying to make sure I wasn't going to freak out or anything.”

The shooter, she said, appears to have begun firing on the ground floor before going upstairs in the school.

Her father, Dennis Campbell, gave credit to teachers who “went and protected the kids in that equipment room.”

Mr. Campbell is president of the local minor hockey association, which includes 104 players. “Every one of them were in that school,” he said. He believes three of the dead are among his daughter's friends.

“I can't even express how we all feel about what just went on. I don't know how we're going to get over it right away,” he said. “It's devastating for us.”

B.C. Premier David Eby commended the RCMP for their “heroic” response, noting that they were on the scene within two minutes of the first call.

“That fast response time meant what was already a devastating tragedy was prevented from being significantly worse,” he told reporters in Vancouver on Tuesday night.

He said the RCMP have not finished notifying next of kin so he could say how many victims were students at the school.

“We can't imagine what the community is going through, but I know it's causing us all to hug our kids a little bit tighter tonight.”

Tumbler Ridge is a coal-mining town at the foothills of the Rockies, home to about 2,400 people.

Prime Minister Mark Carney said he was devastated by the shootings and sent his prayers and condolences to those affected. 

“I join Canadians in grieving with those whose lives have been changed irreversibly today, and in gratitude for the courage and selflessness of the first responders who risked their lives to protect their fellow citizens,” he said in a statement. 

“Our ability to come together in crisis is the best of our country – our empathy, our unity, and our compassion for each other.”

Mr. Carney was scheduled to fly to Halifax Wednesday to announce his defence industrial strategy before flying to Munich for the Munich Security Conference. But the Prime Minister's Office said he is postponing the announcement and suspending his overseas trip “for the time being.”

The violence has affected everyone in the small district of 2,400 people. Residents of the community were ordered to shelter in place for most of Tuesday afternoon as parents waited in fear for their children.

RCMP Superintendent Ken Floyd, North District Commander, said Tumbler Ridge RCMP received a report of an active shooter at Tumbler Ridge Secondary School, which has a student population of 150, at about 1:20 p.m. on Tuesday.

An alert was broadcast to mobile phones in the area just after 2 p.m., warning residents and directing them to shelter in place, lock their doors and refrain from going outside. The suspect was described as a female in a dress with brown hair, according to the alert.

Parents received notice shortly after 3 p.m. that the community's schools had been placed on lockdown.

The Tumbler Ridge Health Centre was put on Code Orange, signifying a mass casualty incident or large-scale emergency response, with restricted access protocols in place.

Schools began releasing students around 5 p.m., and the RCMP alert was officially lifted 45 minutes later.

A shooting at a school in British Columbia left eight dead including a woman whom police believe to be the shooter, while two more people were found dead at a nearby home, Canadian authorities said Tuesday.

The Associated Press

Around 6 p.m., police confirmed that six people had been found dead inside the high school, as well as the suspected shooter, with what appeared to be a self-inflicted injury. Another victim died en route to hospital.

Two additional victims were found dead at a secondary residential location “believed to be connected to the incident,” Supt. Floyd said, though he would not provide details on that connection.

Police continued to search homes and properties in the area “to determine whether anyone else may be injured or otherwise linked” to Tuesday's events.

On Wednesday, the provincial government was sending trauma counsellors to the community to aid students and parents.

School district officials say the high school where the shooting took place and also Tumbler Ridge Elementary School will be closed for the rest of the week. The district says supports will be made available at locations that have not yet been determined.

Attorney-General Pam Bondi testifies before a House Judiciary Committee oversight hearing on Capitol Hill in Washington on Wednesday.Tom Brenner/The Associated Press

Attorney-General Pam Bondi launched into a wide-ranging, passionate defence of President Donald Trump, repeatedly shouting at Democrats during a combative hearing in which she postured herself as the Republican's chief protector and tried to turn the page from persistent criticism of the Justice Department's handling of the Jeffrey Epstein files.

Besieged by questions over Epstein and accusations of a weaponized Justice Department, Bondi aggressively pivoted in an extraordinary speech in which she mocked her Democratic questioners, praised Trump over the performance of the stock market and openly aligned herself as in sync with a president whom she painted as a victim of past impeachments and investigations.

“You sit here and you attack the President and I'm not going to have it,” Bondi said. “I am not going to put up with it.”

With victims of Epstein sitting behind her in the hearing room, Bondi defended the department's handling of the files related to the wealthy financier's sex trafficking investigation that have dogged her tenure. But she repeatedly refused to directly answer questions from Democrats who have accused her of perpetuating a cover-up and ignoring victims.

In her opening remarks, Bondi told the victims to come forward to law enforcement with any information and about her abuse and said she “deeply sorry” for what they had suffered.

“Any accusations of criminal wrongdoing will be taken seriously and investigated,” Bondi said.

 

The Associated Press

Bondi's appearance before the House Judiciary Committee comes a year into her tumultuous tenure that has amplified concerns that the Justice Department is using its law enforcement powers to target political foes of the president.

Just a day earlier, the department had sought to secure charges against Democratic lawmakers who produced a video urging military service members not to follow “illegal orders.” But in an extraordinary rebuke of prosecutors, a grand jury in Washington refused to return an indictment. 

The committee chairman, Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, opened the hearing by repeating talking points that the Justice Department, under Democratic President Joe Biden, was weaponized against Donald Trump and conservatives. Democrats and many good government advocates say it is Trump's own administration that has politicized law enforcement.

“What a difference a year makes. Under Attorney-General Bondi, the DOJ has returned to its core missions – upholding the rule of law, going after the bad guys and keeping Americans safe,” Jordan said.

Lutnick says he ‘barely had anything to do with' Epstein amid calls to resign

Democrats excoriated Bondi over haphazard redactions in the files that has kept secret the names of abusers but exposed private and intimate details about victims and also included nude photographs.

“Your department has shown a pattern of redacting the names of powerful predators,” said Rep. Pramila Jayapal, a Washington Democrat, reading from an e-mail involving a withheld name and referencing a “torture video.”

She asked victims of Epstein's abuse to raise their hand if they had been unable to meet with the Justice Department. Jayapal noted that “every single survivor has raised their hand.”

Bondi has struggled to move past the backlash over her handling of the Epstein files since distributing binders to a group of social media influencers at the White House in February, 2025. The binders included no new revelations about Epstein, leading to even more calls from Trump's base for the files to be released.

Members of Congress were at the department earlier this week to look through unredacted versions of the files. As part of an arrangement with the Justice Department, lawmakers were given access to the over 3 million released files in a reading room with four computers and were allowed to take handwritten notes.

Opinion: How did Jeffrey Epstein become Jeffrey Epstein?

Democrats have accused the department of redacting information that should have been made public, including information that could lead to scrutiny of Epstein's associates. Meanwhile, survivors have slammed the department for inconsistent or non-existent redactions that allowed for the inadvertent release of nude photos and other private information.

Department officials have defended their handling of the files, saying they took pains to protect survivors, but that errors were inevitable given the volume of the materials and the speed at which the department had to release them. The Associated Press and other media organizations are still reviewing millions of pages of documents, many of them previously confidential.

An AP review of records shows that while investigators collected ample proof that Epstein sexually abused underage girls, they found scant evidence the well-connected financier led a sex trafficking ring serving powerful men. Videos and photos seized from Epstein's homes in New York, Florida and the U.S. Virgin Islands did not depict people being abused or implicate anyone else in his crimes, a prosecutor wrote in one 2025 memo.

The case involving lawmakers' video to military service members could provide additional fodder for Democrats to hammer Bondi and question how the Justice Department is using its investigative authority.

The video, featuring Democrats who are veterans or have experience in the intelligence community, angered the administration – Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, in particular.

The Justice Department opened an investigation into the video in which Democratic Sens. Mark Kelly of Arizona and Elissa Slotkin of Michigan, along with four other Democrats, urged U.S. service members to follow established military protocols and reject orders they believe to be unlawful.

A grand jury in Washington on Tuesday declined to issue any indictments. It wasn't immediately clear whether prosecutors had sought indictments against all six lawmakers or what charge or charges prosecutors attempted to bring. But it marked the latest instance of a grand jury rebuffing the Justice Department in cases involving critics of the administration.

Raskin said a document in the files also undermines Trump's claim that he kicked Epstein out of Mar-a-Lago.

Support justice-driven, accurate and transparent news — make a quick donation to Truthout today! 

President Donald Trump has repeatedly claimed that he had “nothing to do with” Jeffrey Epstein. But his name reportedly appears in the unredacted files at least a million times, Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Maryland) said on Tuesday after being granted access to the documents.

Raskin told Axios that he searched Trump's name in the files on Monday, and it came up “more than a million times.”

This is a clear contradiction to what Trump has claimed about his involvement with the child sex trafficker. 

Raskin has also told the press that he has found direct evidence undermining Trump's claim that he barred Epstein from staying at his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida. Trump has maintained that he banned Epstein from Mar-a-Lago when he was continually poaching staff from the spa, including 16-year-old Virginia Giuffre, and exposing himself to employees.

However, Raskin said that there is a document within the files saying that Trump never banned him, according to a 2009 email exchange between Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell. In the conversation, Epstein told Maxwell of a conversation he had with his lawyer, who spoke with Trump.

“Trump is paraphrased and quoted as saying, ‘No, Jeffrey Epstein was not a member of Mar-a-Lago, but he was a guest at Mar-a-Lago, and no, we never asked him to leave,'” Raskin said of the exchange to Axios.

Raskin's findings are a drastic departure from previous reports finding that there are 38,000 mentions of Trump, his wife, or Mar-a-Lago in the redacted files that were released by the Trump administration at the end of January. 

MS NOW reporter Matt Fuller noted that, if Raskin's search was accurate, then it means that “the Department of Justice redacted more than 96% of the mentions of Trump.”

Raskin has accused the Trump administration of carrying out a “cover up” in regard to the files, and has said that he and other lawmakers found “tons of completely unnecessary redactions, in addition to the failure to redact the names of victims” when they reviewed the unredacted files. 

“The DOJ is giving Members of Congress just four computers in a satellite office to read the unredacted Epstein File of more than 3 million documents. Working 40 hours a week on nothing else but this, it would take more than seven years for the 217 Members who signed the House discharge petition to read just the documents they've decided to release (and there are 3 million still being withheld),” said Raskin in a post on X. 

“This is what a cover up looks like,” Raskin said.

The White House has been on the defense. On Monday, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche asserted over multiple posts on X that “DOJ is hiding nothing” and it is “committed to transparency.” 

This, of course, ignores the fact that the Trump administration has redacted huge swaths of the documents, with officials actually removing some redactions after Raskin and Representatives Ro Khanna (D-California) and Thomas Massie's (R-Kentucky) outcry on Tuesday.

On the House floor on Tuesday, Khanna named six men whose names he said were redacted from the official release of the files after he and Massie reviewed the unredacted documents at the DOJ for two hours on Tuesday. Those people were Les Wexner, a prolific Ohio billionaire, Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem, an influential Emirati businessman, and four others whose identities are still relatively unknown: Nicola Caputo, Salvatore Nuara, Zurab Mikeladze and Leonic Leonov.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+national+news+site:cnn.com","Breaking down the evidence DOJ used to justify searching a Fulton County elections office","https://www.cnn.com/2026/02/10/politics/fulton-county-search-warrant-annotated","Wed, 11 Feb 2026 03:48:00 GMT","


            President Donald Trump's long-running stolen-election crusade entered a potentially fraught new phase recently, with the FBI search of an elections office in Fulton County, Georgia.
    


            Some fear it could be a precursor to an even more heavy-handed Trump intervention in American elections.
    


            And a big question after the search was how it got the go-ahead from a magistrate judge. After all, searches require probable cause of a crime, and the magistrate judge, Catherine Salinas, was not exactly some reputed judicial extremist or election skeptic; according to Lawfare, she had previously worked for a public defender's office and clerked for a Clinton appointee.
    


            Maybe there was some new information that suddenly lent some credence to claims of malfeasance in Fulton County in 2020?
    


            Or, as it turns out, maybe not.
    


            The affidavit that was used for the search warrant application was made public on Tuesday, and it overwhelmingly recycles old claims about voting irregularities that have either been debunked or haven't gone anywhere.
    


            The application also relies heavily on information from prominent election-deniers whose claims have failed to produce the voter-fraud smoking gun Trump has sought over the past five-plus years.
    


            In addition, the affidavit cites no evidence of any actual criminal intent.
    


            Let's annotate some key parts from the affidavit.
    


“Following the November 3, 2020, presidential election, there were many allegations of electoral impropriety relating to the voting process and ballot counting in Fulton County, Georgia. Some of those allegations have been disproven while some of those allegations have been substantiated, including through admissions by Fulton County.”






            The combination of “electoral impropriety,” “ballot counting” and “substantiated” paint a dire picture. But a misleading one.
    


            While it's true that certain aspects of Fulton County's election administration were not perfect – and officials have acknowledged as such – there has been no proof offered of widespread fraud. Similarly, dozens of lawsuits from Trump's campaign and allies failed after the 2020 election – nearly all of them, in fact.
    


            And it's never been demonstrated that any of the problems owed to anything other than human or administrative errors. Which, in this context, usually aren't treated as crimes.
    


“If these deficiencies were the result of intentional action, it would be a violation of federal law regardless of whether the failure to retain records or the deprivation of a fair tabulation of a vote was outcome determinative for any particular election or race.”






            The key word there is “if.” The affidavit doesn't cite any real evidence of criminal intent.
    


            In one case, it cites a member of the state election board who “believed” she had witnessed “an intentional act.” In another, it cites a data analyst who “concluded that what he observed could be intentional but was not partisan.”
    


            Criminal intent isn't required to convince a magistrate to find probable cause to approve the warrant. But the lack of evidence on that front is notable given previous reviews of the election have failed to turn up any evidence of it.
    


            Two high-profile reviews of Fulton County's elections, including an extensive “Performance Review Board” report, both found significant problems but no evidence of fraud or misconduct. Georgia's GOP governor, Brian Kemp, and secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger, have both frequently defended the election results.
    


“The FBI criminal investigation originated from a referral sent by Kurt Olsen, Presidentially appointed Director of Election Security and Integrity.”






            The warrant application cites a number of prominent election-deniers.
    


            Olsen is a lawyer who played a key role in challenging the 2020 election, including working on a lawsuit to nullify the results of key states that Trump lost. Such lawsuits overwhelmingly failed. He had multiple phone calls with Trump on January 6, 2021, when rioters stormed the US Capitol.
    


            Olsen was also sanctioned over what a federal judge found to be “false, misleading and unsupported factual assertions” about the 2022 Arizona gubernatorial campaign, which Republican Kari Lake lost.
    


            He was recently made a special government employee in the Trump administration.
    


            The affidavit also cites another person who tried and failed to overturn Lake's loss, Clay Parikh.
    


“[Witness No. 1] filed a complaint with the Georgia State Election Board on July 8, 2022, alleging, among other things, that during the Recount of the 2020 Election there were 17,852 missing ballot images from the reported results on the Georgia Secretary of State's website.”






            This is a years-old claim, and a spokesman for Georgia's Republican secretary of state has explained it.
    


            Basically, there were about 17,000 fewer ballots counted during a recount than in earlier counts, because the county used the same name on two batch files, USA Today has reported. The count was later corrected through a process called “reconciliation.”
    


            And while the affidavit cites missing ballot images as potential evidence of a crime, Reuters has reported that it's not clear that the law at the time of the election required such ballot images to be saved.
    


“[Witness No. 5] concluded there were duplicate ballots included in both the Original Count and the Recount. Further, [the witness] identified new ballots as well as test ballots in the Recount that did not appear in the Original Count.”






            This refers to the so-called “duplicate ballot” issue. And among the issues cited in the affidavit, it's perhaps the most legitimate. But there's still no real evidence of malfeasance.
    


            State officials in 2024 acknowledged a little more than 3,000 duplicate ballot images. But duplicate ballot images are not the same as counted votes, and officials couldn't determine that any of them were actually tabulated in the recount.
    


            “If the ‘3,000 duplicate ballot images' had been counted as votes … the results would have been off by 3,000 — and they were not,” a spokesman for the Georgia secretary of state told PolitiFact back then.
    


            A local official cited human error for the duplicate ballot images.
    


“[Witness No. 8] recalled receiving one batch of ballots that contained 110 ballots. [She] said she noticed quickly that those ballots seemed different. Of the 110 ballots, 107 had the exact same votes for each candidate on the ballot. These ballots were also pristine in that they had not been folded. She said the 107 were labeled as absentee ballots but they were too clean to be absentee ballots, in her opinion. She also said the texture of the 107 ballots felt different from all the other ballots and the bubbles were all filled in the same.”






            This refers to the so-called “pristine ballots” theory. A judge in 2021 dismissed a lawsuit that relied on these claims.
    


            The secretary of state's office reviewed the claims and said it was “unable to substantiate the allegations that fraudulent or counterfeit ballots were counted.” They found no ballots that appeared to be counterfeits.
    


            An official in that office has explained that some overseas and military ballots might not be the right size for scanners, so those votes can be transferred to ballots that can be scanned and might appear more “pristine.”
    


            The affidavit notably makes no mention of any theories about foreign election interference. That should ratchet up questions as to why Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard was present at the FBI search. (Gabbard's job generally revolves around foreign threats, not domestic law enforcement.)
    


            The affidavit also does not address a pretty significant potential problem with any ensuing prosecutions: the passage of time. The statute of limitations is generally five years, and the 2020 election is now just outside that window. That might not matter to the extent this is about record retention – one of the crimes the affidavit cites requires keeping records for 22 months after an election, so the statute would expire five years after that. But it could matter for more severe potential offenses.

The Federal Aviation Administration reopened the airspace around El Paso International Airport in Texas on Wednesday morning, just hours after it announced a 10-day closure that would have grounded all flights to and from the airport.

US Representatives Veronica Escobar and Tony Gonzales said they learned of the closure of airspace around El Paso in the morning, hours after the Federal Aviation Administration shut down the airspace.

▶ Follow live updates on the airspace around El Paso

WASHINGTON (AP) — The sudden and surprising airspace closure over El Paso, Texas, stemmed from the Pentagon's plans to test a laser for use in shooting down drones used by Mexican drug cartels, according to three people familiar with the situation who were granted anonymity to share sensitive details.

That caused friction with the Federal Aviation Administration, which wanted to ensure commercial air safety and the two agencies sought to coordinate, according to two of the people.

Despite a meeting scheduled later this month to discuss the issue, the Pentagon wanted to go ahead and test it, prompting the FAA to shutter the airspace. It was not clear whether the laser was ultimately deployed.

Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said earlier that a response to an incursion by Mexican cartel drones had led to the airspace closure and that the threat had been neutralized. Drone incursions are not uncommon along the southern border.

Officials at the White House, FAA and Department of Transportation did not respond immediately Wednesday to request for comment about the dispute. The Pentagon said it had nothing to add to its statement that largely mirrored Duffy's comment.

The FAA had originally announced a 10-day closure of the airspace, confusing travelers at the airport in the border city with a population of nearly 700,000 people. The order was lifted a few hours later. No Mexican airspace was closed.




Duffy said in a post on X that the FAA and the Defense Department “acted swiftly to address a cartel drone incursion. The threat has been neutralized and there is no danger to commercial travel in the region.” Duffy said normal flights were resuming Wednesday morning. He did not say how many drones were involved or what specifically was done to disable them.

Rep. Veronica Escobar, a Democrat whose district includes El Paso, said neither her office, the city of El Paso nor airport operations received advance notice. She said she believed the shutdown was not based on Mexican cartel drones in U.S. airspace, saying that “is not what we in Congress have been told.”

Pentagon officials declined to comment on Escobar's remarks and Texas Gov. Greg Abbott's office referred questions to the FAA.

“I believe the FAA owes the community and the country an explanation as to why this happened so suddenly and abruptly and was lifted so suddenly and abruptly,” Escobar said during a news conference. The shutdown had been expected to create significant disruptions given the duration and the size of the metropolitan area around El Paso. 

“The information coming from the federal government does not add up,” Escobar said. 




Rep. Tony Gonzales, whose district covers an area that stretches for about 800 miles (1,300 kilometers) along Texas' border with Mexico, said cartel drone sightings are common.

“For any of us who live and work along the border, daily drone incursions by criminal organizations is every-day life for us. It's a Wednesday for us,” Gonzales said.

Asked about the drone explanation provided by U.S. officials, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said she had “no information about the use of drones on the border.” She noted that if U.S. authorities have more information they should contact Mexico's government.

Steven Willoughby, the deputy director of the counter-drone program at the Department of Homeland Security, told lawmakers in July that cartels are using drones nearly every day to transport drugs across the border and surveil Border Patrol agents. 

More than 27,000 drones were detected within 500 meters (1,600 feet) of the southern border in the last six months of 2024, he testified, mostly at night. Homeland Security has said agents have seized thousands of pounds of methamphetamine, fentanyl and other drugs in recent years that cartels were trying to fly across the border using drones.

El Paso is hub of cross-border commerce alongside Ciudad Juárez. The Mexican city is home to about 1.5 million people, and some of its residents are accustomed to taking advantage of facilities including airports on both sides of the border. That easy access to the U.S. has also made Juarez, like other border cities, attractive to Mexico's drug cartels seeking to safeguard their smuggling routes for drugs and migrants headed north and cash and guns moving to the south.

El Paso International Airport said in an Instagram post after the closure was announced that all flights to and from the airport would be grounded through Feb. 20, including commercial, cargo and general aviation flights. Local newscasts showed stranded travelers with luggage lining up at airline ticket counters and car rental desks at the El Paso airport hours after flights were grounded. 

The airport posted later Wednesday morning that its operations had resumed and encouraged travelers to contact their airlines for the most up-to-date flight information.

Mexican defense and navy secretaries will meet with Northern Command officials in Washington on Wednesday in a meeting attended by representatives of several other countries, Sheinbaum said during a news conference. Sheinbaum said the Mexican officials would “listen” in the meeting and that her government would look into “the exact causes” of the closure. 

El Paso Mayor Renard Johnson said at a news conference that he didn't hear about the closure until after the alert was issued and he called the failure to communicate that to the city unacceptable.

“Decisions made without notice and coordination puts lives at risk and creates unnecessary danger and confusion,” Johnson said. “This was a major and unnecessary disruption, one that has not occurred since 9/11.”

The airport describes itself as the gateway to west Texas, southern New Mexico and northern Mexico. Southwest, United, American and Delta all operate flights there, among others.

A similar 10-day temporary flight restriction for special security reasons remained in place Wednesday morning around Santa Teresa, New Mexico, which is about 15 miles (24 kilometers) northwest of the El Paso airport. FAA officials did not immediately explain why that restriction remained in place.

U.S. Sen. Ben Ray Lujan of New Mexico, a Democrat, said in a statement: “Keeping our communities informed and safe is critical. I'm demanding answers from the FAA and the administration about why the airspace was closed in the first place without notifying appropriate officials, leaving travelers to deal with unnecessary chaos.”

The airspace closure upset travel plans on both sides of the border.

María Aracelia was pushing two roller suitcases across the pedestrian bridge from Ciudad Juarez to El Paso Wednesday morning. She had a round-trip flight to Illinois scheduled for the afternoon.

After receiving a text at 4 a.m. telling her about the 10-day closure, she scrambled to try to find other options, even how to get to another airport. Then came a notification that the El Paso airport had reopened.

“This is stressful and there isn't time to make so many changes, especially if you need to get back for work,” Aracelia said.

The department and the FBI were also conducting a court-authorized search Tuesday night at a location in Rio Rico, about an hour's drive south of Tucson. (AP Video by Ty O'Niel)

Authorities investigating the disappearance of Nancy Guthrie more than a week ago released the first surveillance images Tuesday, showing a masked person on her porch the night she went missing. Authorities have not identified any suspects.

TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) — Fresh surveillance images from Nancy Guthrie's porch the night she went missing, coupled with intense police activity across Arizona and the detention of a man had raised hopes that authorities were nearing a major break.

By Wednesday, however, the man said he had been released after questioning, leaving it unclear where the investigation stood into last week's disappearance of Guthrie, the 84-year-old mother of “Today” show host Savannah Guthrie.

FBI agents fanned out across a neighborhood about a mile from Guthrie's home on Wednesday morning, knocking on doors and searching through the dense desert terrain filled with cactus, bushes and boulders. 

A day earlier, authorities said they had stopped a man near the U.S.-Mexico border, just hours after the FBI released videos of a person wearing a gun holster, ski mask and backpack and approaching Nancy Guthrie's home in Tucson. The man told several media outlets early Wednesday that he was released after several hours and had nothing to do with Guthrie's disappearance last week. 

Authorities have not said what led them to stop the man Tuesday night and had not confirmed he was released. The sheriff's department said its deputies and FBI agents also searched a location in Rio Rico, a city south of Tucson where the man lives. 




It was the latest twist in an investigation that has gripped the nation since Nancy Guthrie disappeared on Feb. 1. Until Tuesday, it seemed authorities were making little headway in determining what happened to her or finding who was responsible.




The black and white images released by the FBI showing a masked person trying to cover a doorbell camera on Guthrie's porch marked the first significant break in the case. But the images did not show what happened to her or help determine whether she is still alive.

FBI Director Kash Patel said investigators spent days trying to find lost, corrupted or inaccessible images. 

Even though the images do not show the person's face, investigators are hopeful someone will know who was on the porch.

“You can see their girth, the shape of their face, potentially their eyes or mouth,” said former FBI agent Katherine Schweit. 

Authorities have said for more than a week that they believe Nancy Guthrie was taken against her will. She was last seen at home Jan. 31 and reported missing the next day. DNA tests showed blood on her porch was hers, authorities said.

Savannah Guthrie posted the new surveillance images on social media and said the family believes their mother is still alive. 

The longtime NBC host and her two siblings have indicated a willingness to pay a ransom. 

It is not known whether ransom notes demanding money with deadlines that have already passed were authentic, and whether the family has had any contact with whoever took Guthrie. 

TMZ reported it received a message Wednesday from someone claiming to know the kidnapper's identity and that they unsuccessfully tried to reach Savannah Guthrie's brother and sister. The person asked for bitcoin in exchange for the information, TMZ said. The FBI did not immediately respond to a message.

Authorities have said Nancy Guthrie takes several medications and there was concern from the start that she could die without them.

WASHINGTON (AP) — A grand jury in Washington refused Tuesday to indict Democratic lawmakers in connection with a video in which they urged U.S. military members to resist “illegal orders,” according to a person familiar with the matter.

The Justice Department opened an investigation into the video featuring Democratic Sens. Mark Kelly and Elissa Slotkin and four other Democratic lawmakers urging U.S. service members to follow established military protocols and reject orders they believe to be unlawful. All the lawmakers previously served in the military or at intelligence agencies.

Grand jurors in Washington declined to sign off on charges in the latest of a series of rebukes of prosecutors by citizens in the nation's capital, according to the person, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss the matter. It wasn't immediately clear whether prosecutors had sought indictments against all six lawmakers or what charge or charges prosecutors attempted to bring. 

Grand jury rejections are extraordinarily unusual, but have happened repeatedly in recent months in Washington as citizens who have heard the government's evidence have come away underwhelmed in a number of cases. Prosecutors could try again to secure an indictment. 

Spokespeople for the U.S. attorney's office and the Justice Department didn't immediately respond to requests for comment Tuesday.




The FBI in November began contacting the lawmakers to schedule interviews, outreach that came against the backdrop of broader Justice Department efforts to punish political opponents of the president. President Donald Trump and his aides labeled the lawmakers' video as “seditious” — and Trump said on his social media account that the offense was “punishable by death.”

Besides Slotkin and Kelly, the other Democrats who appeared in the video include Reps. Jason Crow of Colorado, Chrissy Houlahan of Pennsylvania, Maggie Goodlander of New Hampshire and Chris Deluzio of Pennsylvania.

Slotkin, a former CIA analyst who represents Michigan, said late Tuesday that she hopes this ends the Justice Department's probe. 

“Tonight we can score one for the Constitution, our freedom of speech, and the rule of law,” Slotkin said in a statement. “But today wasn't just an embarrassing day for the Administration. It was another sad day for our country,” she said.

Kelly, a former Navy pilot who represents Arizona, called the attempt to bring charges an “outrageous abuse of power by Donald Trump and his lackies.”

“Donald Trump wants every American to be too scared to speak out against him,” Kelly said in a post on X. “The most patriotic thing any of us can do is not back down.”

In November, the Pentagon opened an investigation into Kelly, citing a federal law that allows retired service members to be recalled to active duty on orders of the defense secretary for possible court-martial or other punishment. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has censured Kelly for participating in the video and is trying to retroactively demote Kelly from his retired rank of captain.

The senator is suing Hegseth to block those proceedings, calling them an unconstitutional act of retribution. During a hearing last week, the judge appeared to be skeptical of key arguments that a government attorney made in defense of Kelly's Jan. 5 censure by Hegseth.

Heading to Washington to meet with US President Donald Trump, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Tuesday said he will present the American leader with Israel's “principles” regarding negotiations with Iran.

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump said Wednesday that he insisted to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that negotiations with Iran continue as the United States pushes for a nuclear deal with Tehran.

Trump held a lengthy White House meeting with the Israeli leader as the U.S. has massed what the president calls an “armada” of American forces in the Middle East for a potential strike on Iran.

Netanyahu is pushing for the U.S. to expand its demands on Iran to include the Islamic Republic ending support for proxy groups such as Hamas and Hezbollah and limiting its ballistic missile program. Trump offered measure hope that a diplomatic breakthrough with Iran can still happen.

“Last time Iran decided that they were better off not making a Deal, and they were hit with Midnight Hammer — That did not work well for them,” Trump said in a post on his Truth Social platform. “Hopefully this time they will be more reasonable and responsible.”

—

THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP's earlier story follows below.

WASHINGTON (AP) — As President Donald Trump says he believes Iran wants to make a deal on its nuclear program, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu arrived at the White House on Wednesday with his own urgent message: Expand the talks further. 

The visit from Netanyahu — their seventh meeting in Trump's second term — comes as both Tehran and Washington are projecting cautious optimism after holding indirect talks in Oman on Friday about how once again to approach negotiations over Iran's nuclear program.




“We'll see what happens. I think they want to make a deal,” Trump said in an interview Tuesday with Fox Business Network's Larry Kudlow. “I think they'd be foolish if they didn't. We took out their nuclear power last time, and we'll have to see if we take out more this time.”

He added, ”It's got to be a good deal. No nuclear weapons, no missiles.”

Netanyahu's office says he wants those talks to include limits on Iran's ballistic missile program and support for militant groups such as Hamas and Hezbollah.

“I will present to the president our outlook regarding the principles of these negotiations — the essential principles which, in my opinion, are important not only to Israel, but to everyone around the world who wants peace and security in the Middle East,” Netanyahu said Tuesday before leaving Israel.

It remains unclear how much influence Netanyahu will have over Trump's approach toward Iran. Trump initially threatened to take military action over Iran's bloody crackdown on nationwide protests in January, then shifted to a pressure campaign in recent weeks to try to get Tehran to make a deal over its nuclear program.

Iran is still reeling from the 12-day war with Israel in June. The devastating series of airstrikes, including the U.S. bombing several Iranian nuclear sites, killed nearly 1,000 people in Iran and almost 40 in Israel. 

Trump, at the time, said the U.S. action had “obliterated” Iran's nuclear capabilities, though the amount of damage remains unclear. Satellite photos of nuclear sites have recently captured activity, prompting concern Iran could be attempting to salvage or assess damage at the sites. 

Israel has long called for Iran to cease all uranium enrichment, dial back its ballistic missile program and cut ties to militant groups across the region. Iran has always rejected those demands, saying it would only accept some limits on its nuclear program in return for sanctions relief. 

Washington has built up military forces in the region, sending an aircraft carrier, guided-missile destroyers, air defense assets and more to supplement its presence. Arab and Islamic countries, including Turkey and Qatar, have been urging both sides to show restraint, warning that any strike or retaliation could have destabilizing consequences for a region already strained by the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza.

That conflict is sure to come up with Trump planning to hold the first meeting next week of his Board of Peace, which was initially framed to oversee future steps of the U.S.-brokered Gaza ceasefire plan but has taken shape with Trump's ambitions of resolving other global crises.

Earlier Wednesday, Netanyahu met with Secretary of State Marco Rubio at Blair House, across the street from the White House. The prime minister signed to be part of the board, which could indicate he might skip its first official meeting. 

On Iran, Trump said Friday that his special envoy, Steve Witkoff, and son-in-law Jared Kushner had “very good” talks and more were planned this week. But the Republican president kept up the pressure, warning that if Iran did not make a deal over its nuclear program, “the consequences are very steep.”

Iran's foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, made similar comments, saying there will be consultations on “next steps.” He also said the level of mistrust between the two longtime adversaries remains a “serious challenge facing the negotiations.” 

He signaled that Iran would stick to its position that it must be able to enrich uranium — a major point of contention with Trump.

Netanyahu met with Witkoff and Kushner shortly after arriving in Washington on Tuesday evening and they gave him an update on the talks held with Iran in Oman, the prime minister's office said. 

Araghchi said in November that Iran was no longer enriching uranium due to the damage from last year's war. 

Before the war, Iran had been enriching uranium up to 60% purity, a short, technical step away from weapons-grade levels. The U.N. nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency, had said Iran was the only country in the world to enrich to that level that was not armed with the bomb.

Iran has been refusing requests by the IAEA to inspect the sites bombed in the June war. Even before that, Iran has restricted IAEA inspections since Trump's decision in 2018 to unilaterally withdraw the U.S. from Iran's 2015 nuclear deal with world powers.

Rep. Eric Swalwell, who is also a California gubernatorial candidate, challenged Acting ICE Director Todd Lyons to step down or be seen as siding with 'killers.'

Acting ICE Director Todd Lyons refused to resign under pressure from Rep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif., who offered him the ultimatum to do so, or ""side with the killers.""

The heated exchange during Tuesday's House Homeland Security Committee hearing isn't the first time Swalwell has confronted ICE over its mass deportation operations. He previously co-authored the ""ICE OUT Act"" with fellow committee member Rep. Daniel Goldman, D-N.Y., which would strip qualified immunity from federal immigration agents.

Near the close of his questioning, Swalwell told Lyons that continuing to lead ICE is a ""choice"" and highlighted his preceding decorated military and law enforcement career.

""You are what I would call ‘otherwise employable'. I think most people would agree this is not the only job that you can get. But since you've been on this job, women have been dragged by their hair through streets. A 6-year-old child battling stage-four cancer has been deported. And it turns out he was a U.S. citizen,"" Swalwell claimed.

The Alameda lawmaker, who is also running for governor, said people are fleeing ICE ""through the fields where they work"" and that ""disgraceful"" statements from DHS brass should convince Lyons to find a new job.

""Will you stand with the kids who you're supposed to protect, or will you side with the killers bringing terror to our streets? Mr. Lyons, will you resign from ICE?"" Swalwell asked, as a poster of a child appeared behind him.

Lyons replied, ""No sir, I won't,"" and then took issue with the poster Swalwell's staff had produced.

""That child that you're showing right there, the men and women of ICE took care of him when his father abandoned him and ran from law enforcement,"" Lyons said, referencing the case of Adrian A.C. Arias, an Ecuadorian national targeted by ICE.

Arias ""abandoned"" his 5-year-old child to flee authorities, leading Democrats and some in the press to claim that DHS had targeted the child, who went into their custody.

""For the child's safety, one of our ICE officers remained with the child while the other officers apprehended Conejo Arias,"" a DHS official said of the situation. ""ICE did not target a child.""

Swalwell also pressed Lyons on comments made at a Border Security Expo suggesting immigration enforcement and deportation operations be as efficient as Amazon Prime delivery.

""Mr. Lyons how many times has Amazon Prime shot a mom three times in the face?"" Swalwell asked — appearing to reference the shooting of Renee Good in Minneapolis.

""None,"" Lyons said.

""It's the square root of zero, that's right,"" Swalwell shot back, before Lyons countered that his Amazon comment had come in the context of remarks made on improving the technology around DHS's work, including efficiency and artificial intelligence areas.

""I did say at the end of it, but we deal with human beings, so we can't be like them. That's the key part that you're leaving out,"" Lyons said.

At the end of Swalwell's remarks, Chairman Andrew Garbarino, R-N.Y., ceded the floor to Rep. Michael Guest, R-Miss., who offered a friendlier exchange with Lyons.

Fox News' Jeff Paul reports the latest on the reversal after officials announced the airport would be closed for 10 days. 

Drones operated by Mexican drug cartels breached American airspace and were soon disabled by the U.S. military, the Trump administration announced Wednesday.

The breach took place near El Paso International Airport in Texas, leading the Federal Aviation Administration to temporarily close the airport late Tuesday. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy confirmed the breach and lifted the airspace restriction on Wednesday.

""The FAA and DOW acted swiftly to address a cartel drone incursion,"" Duffy announced in a statement on X, referring to the Department of War. ""The threat has been neutralized, and there is no danger to commercial travel in the region.""

""The restrictions have been lifted and normal flights are resuming,"" he added.

He did not say how many drones were involved or what specifically was done to disable them.

The FAA's initial announcement had said the El Paso airport would be closed for a period of 10 days, which would have been unprecedented for a U.S. city. The FAA had cited ""special security reasons"" for the initial closure.

El Paso, a border city with a population of nearly 700,000 people and larger when including the surrounding metro area, is a hub of cross-border commerce alongside the neighboring city of Ciudad Juarez in Mexico. The brief closure did not include Mexican airspace.

Rep. Veronica Escobar, a Democrat whose district includes El Paso, had urged the FAA to lift the restrictions in a statement Wednesday morning. There was no advance notice given to her office, the city of El Paso or airport operations, she said.

""The highly consequential decision by FAA to shut down the El Paso Airport for 10 days is unprecedented and has resulted in significant concern within the community,"" Escobar said. ""From what my office and I have been able to gather overnight and early this morning there is no immediate threat to the community or surrounding areas.""

The incident came the same day that the Texas Department of Public Safety issued a warning about a ""fake memo circulating online and through media outlets announcing temporary 10-day road closures in the El Paso area.""

Nick Wright joins Colin Cowherd to discuss Super Bowl LX, Sam Darnold's legacy, and whether or not the Los Angeles Lakers need an overhaul. 

Seattle Seahawks fans will undoubtedly come out in droves for Wednesday's Super Bowl celebration, but for students partying, it will hurt their attendance records.

Seattle Public Schools announced earlier this week that schools will not only stay open, but going to the parade will not count as an excused absence.

""Seattle is buzzing with excitement as we celebrate the Seattle Seahawks' Super Bowl victory! Moments like this bring our city together, spark pride across generations, and remind us of the power of shared experiences in our community,"" Seattle Public Schools Chief Operations Officer Fred Podesta said in a letter. ""As the city plans celebrations, including a victory parade planned for Wednesday, Feb. 11, at 10 a.m., we want families to know that Seattle Public Schools will remain open with the normal early-release Wednesday schedule.

""Keeping schools open is an important part of maintaining stability, safety, and continuity for our students. For many families, schools provide not only learning, but also meals, transportation, specialized services, and trusted routines. Remaining open allows us to support students' academic progress while ensuring essential services continue for those who rely on them …

""We encourage families to celebrate this historic moment in ways that work best for your household, while also helping us keep learning strong across the district. Thank you for your partnership and support as we balance celebration with our shared commitment to students. Go Hawks!""

The celebration will begin at Lumen Field at 10 a.m. PT with a parade commencing an hour later throughout the city.

It's the second time the Seahawks have taken the Lombardi Trophy to the Pacific Northwest, also winning Super Bowl XLVIII in New Jersey against the Denver Broncos.

It was an 11-year wait for revenge for Seattle, who defeated the New England Patriots over a decade after Malcolm Butler's infamous interception at the goal line.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","The surprising day jobs of 15 US Olympians, from a clown to a dentist","https://www.businessinsider.com/olympic-athletes-day-jobs-2026-2","Wed, 11 Feb 2026 16:49:00 GMT","

To the world, the Olympics may look like a full-time job, but for many athletes, it's a second one.

""I have two full-time jobs,"" Team USA curler Korey Dropkin told KARE 11, a local Minnesota television station. ""One is curling … my other job is a realtor.""

Meanwhile, his mixed doubles partner, Cory Thiesse, works at a wastewater company for a steady paycheck that allows her to compete.

Their experience is common among Olympians. The International Olympic Committee does not pay athletes directly for competing or winning medals. Instead, the IOC redistributes 90% of its income — about $4.2 million per day — to National Olympic Committees and international federations, according to the organization. Those bodies then decide how to support athletes in their countries.

In the US, that includes medal bonuses — currently $37,500 for gold, $22,500 for silver, and $15,000 for bronze — but athletes receive those amounts only if they reach the podium. For sports like curling, biathlon, and skeleton, where sponsorships and broadcast revenue are limited, that often isn't enough to fund a career.

Artistic swimmer Anita Alvarez told Business Insider last year she once supplemented a $250 monthly Team USA stipend with shifts at a sporting goods store. Even after that stipend rose to $1,900 a month, she said it was ""stressful"" trying to stay ""focused and dialed in on the Olympic training"" while rushing to work after long days in the pool.

Support models vary widely from country to country. In Italy, where the Winter Olympics are being held, many top athletes are formally employed by military and police sports groups, effectively placing Olympians on the government payroll. In the UK, athletes receive National Lottery-funded performance awards designed to help cover living and training costs.

Team USA is also experimenting with new financial backstops. A recently announced donation by financier Ross Stevens will provide American Olympians with $200,000 in total benefits to help reduce long-term financial insecurity. But the payout comes after the Games, not during the years when athletes pay for travel, coaching, equipment, and time away from work.

Until the financial model changes, many Olympic careers will continue to be built around a stable paycheck.

Here are 15 athletes whose day jobs help fund their time on the world stage.

It's perhaps unsurprising that Cochran-Siegle started skiing when he was just 2: His mother, Barbara Ann Cochran, was also an Olympian, winning gold in slalom at the 1972 Games in Sapporo, Japan.

A three-time Olympian, Cochran-Siegle, 33, won silver in the super-G on Wednesday. He also earned a silver medal for the same event at the 2022 Beijing Olympics.

During his off-season, he works at his cousins' maple syrup farm, Cochran's Slopeside Syrup, in Richmond, Vermont, a gig he's had since he was 18.

""Depending on the time of year it typically involves either boiling maple syrup or pulling taps from trees once the sap run has finished,"" he told NBC in 2022. ""For me it's less of a job and more of a way to come home and help out with my cousin's family business. It's also a great way to be productive while spending time outside in the woods with family, exploring our Cochran family land.""

He's also a part-time engineering student at the University of Vermont, The Athletic reported.

Curling doesn't offer guaranteed contracts or league salaries, so athletes often build parallel careers during the four-year Olympic cycle.

In the years leading up to the Milano Cortina Winter Games — where he won a silver medal in the mixed doubles curling final on Tuesday — Korey Dropkin split his time between curling competitions and the housing market.

He began curling at age 5 at Broomstones Curling Club in Massachusetts and later moved to Duluth to train. A graduate of the University of Minnesota Duluth, Dropkin, now 30, became a licensed realtor, working across northern Minnesota and Wisconsin while competing internationally.

Cory Thiesse, a Minnesota-based curler who earned silver with Dropkin in mixed doubles curling on Tuesday, works full-time in wastewater testing at an environmental lab. Thiesse's role involves testing water for mercury levels.

Her mother, a former competitive curler herself, is her boss at the lab.

""That really is helpful for getting time off to go compete, and I just feel really grateful to have a job that pays the bills while I'm able to go and compete in curling,"" Thiesse, 31, told KARE11.

Paige Jones' Olympic schedule ran alongside online coursework in biomedical engineering at the University of North Dakota. At the end of the degree, she hopes to pursue dentistry.

""I always think of school as balance to my life as an athlete,"" she told UND's website. ""It gives me something to think about when I'm not on the hill. I don't want to be ruminating about ski jumping all the time — it's so easy to get in your head, especially when the jump only lasts about five seconds.""

Born and raised in Park City, Utah, Jones started downhill skiing at age 3 before discovering ski jumping at 9 through a school program. She progressed to international competitions as a teenager.

Her breakthrough came at the 2021 FIS Nordic World Championships, where she became the first woman to jump an Olympic large hill at a world championships event, per Team USA.

After missing the Beijing Olympics due to an injury, Jones, now 23, rebuilt her form and earned a spot on Team USA for the 2026 Games.

Cleveland-born boxer Morelle McCane, 31, started boxing at 17, then pieced together a rotation of quick jobs while working toward the Paris Olympics.

The Houston Chronicle reported that her odd-job list included working as a daycare supervisor, a mailroom worker, and even dressing up as a children's birthday-party clown.

""You just have to find what you can for the moment sometimes,"" McCane told the Chronicle in 2024, explaining that better-paying employers typically want longer commitments than an Olympic schedule allows.

Peterson, 34, graduated from the University of Minnesota School of Dentistry in 2018 and now works as a dentist in White Bear Lake, Minnesota.

She started curling at the age of 8 when her parents — themselves a dentist and a dental hygienist — signed up for a curling league and enrolled their daughters in a junior league, per her Team USA bio.

The sisters made their Olympic debuts at the Beijing Games in 2022.

Tabitha Peterson, 36, a Minneapolis-born curler and multi-time Olympian, has built her sports career alongside a clinical one. She studied at the Minnesota College of Pharmacy and shuffled between being a curler and a pharmacist.

""I've gotta get some hours in and get a paycheck,"" Peterson told KARE 11 in a recent interview, adding that there are many similarities between curling and pharmacy in that both require ""intense focus and attention to detail.""

Keely Cashman's Olympic journey included coffee orders and espresso machines: The skier, 26, worked as a barista at her family's coffee shop in Strawberry, a small town of around 80 people in California.

""I try to be someone who can show the kids that you don't have to come from a fancy academy to make it to the Olympics,"" she told KETV.

Alpine skiing can offer endorsement upside for some athletes, but outside the podium tier, income can fluctuate season to season.

For Cashman, the coffee shop provided steady work between competitions and injuries.

Austin Florian, 31, didn't grow up sliding headfirst down icy tracks. He was a ski racer in Southington, Connecticut, before discovering skeleton while attending Clarkson University in Upstate New York.

Florian graduated from Clarkson with an engineering degree and later worked in manufacturing engineering in Connecticut while pursuing national team status.

By the time he qualified for the 2026 Games, Florian had turned into an elite starter, and he'd done it while holding down engineering work.

The Montana native, 33, competed in the Olympics in 2014, 2018, and 2022.

""Like most sports, skiing has an offseason and I had to stay productive,"" he wrote on his website. ""So during the summer in Park City I started to play around with painting and, like my ski career, the art started to progress and began to take off.""

In 2022, Business Insider reported that Wilson was selling pieces for roughly $100 to several hundred dollars.

He added, ""It has been a huge help to pay for my expenses in my ski career.""

Chris Plys' Olympic timeline is punctuated by responsibility.

After serving as an alternate at the 2010 Winter Games in Vancouver, Plys returned to the Olympic stage in Beijing in 2022. In between, life intervened. His father died of cancer in 2012, and Plys left college to take over the family's food brokerage business.

""It was the first major thing that I had gone through after the Olympics, and I just was forced to grow up fast,"" Plys told USA Today in 2022.

The Duluth native, 38, balanced running the company with elite curling competition.

The New Jersey native — who didn't take up long-track speedskating seriously until her late teens — balanced international competition with a part-time role as a processor at a finance company.

It paid off. Goetz, now 31, made her Olympic debut at Beijing 2022, finishing seventh in the 1,000 meters and competing in the 500. She followed that with back-to-back World Championship medals and six World Cup victories in the seasons after Beijing.

In 2019, she also self-published a cookbook, ""Mindful Meals,"" which chronicles her move to Salt Lake City and her learning to cook while training at an elite level.

Long before women's skeleton made its Olympic debut, Lea Ann Parsley was responding to emergency calls in Ohio.

Parsley became a professional firefighter in the mid-1990s and was named the state's Firefighter of the Year in 1999 after helping rescue a mother and daughter from a burning home. Around the same time, she was quietly making history in a different arena — she became the first American skeleton athlete to win a World Cup medal.

She joined the US Skeleton Team in 1998 and quickly rose through the ranks, eventually earning seven World Cup medals. In 2002, she won silver at the Salt Lake City Olympics in the first-ever Olympic women's skeleton race.

Her silver medal remains one of the biggest achievements in American women's sliding sports.

After retiring from competition, she earned a nursing degree and built a career in healthcare and emergency response.

Vermont native Susan Dunklee built one of the most successful American biathlon careers of her generation while studying and working in environmental science.

As a member of the Craftsbury Green Racing Project in Vermont, she promoted sustainability, alongside endurance sports, in her community.

""I'm involved with a lot of the environmental work, helping out in the gardens, monitoring the water quality in the local lake, and teaching local kids about living a sustainable lifestyle,"" she told EcoAthletes.

She retired from competition after the 2022 Beijing Olympics and started a new chapter as the running director for the Craftsbury Outdoor Center. She has also helped coach other biathlon athletes.

A three-time Olympian and silver medalist at the Biathlon World Championships, Dunklee has spoken about the financial realities of competing in biathlon, one of the least commercialized winter sports in the US.

Before Alex Deibold stood on an Olympic podium, he was helping other riders get there.

In 2014, ESPN reported that Deibold attended the 2010 Vancouver Games as a technician for the US snowboardcross team: waxing, tuning, and preparing boards for competition. Four years later, he returned to the Olympics not as a staff member but as an athlete.

The turnaround was dramatic. Deibold won bronze in snowboardcross at the 2014 Sochi Winter Games, completing one of the more unlikely arcs of that Olympic cycle.

He retired from competitive snowboarding in 2023.

The US military intercepted Mexican cartel drones that breached US airspace, a Trump administration official said on Wednesday, explaining why the government made the rare decision to temporarily restrict flights over El Paso.

The official told Business Insider that ""Mexican cartel drones breached US airspace,"" adding that the Pentagon ""took action to disable the drones.""

The Federal Aviation Administration and Pentagon ""have determined there is no threat to commercial travel,"" the official added.

It's unclear how the US military disabled the cartel drones — whether they were shot down or jammed with electronic warfare technology — or if they were carrying any drugs. The Pentagon declined to provide additional information about the incident.

A social media account for the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering, which advises Pentagon leadership on cutting-edge technology, published a photo showing what appears to be a laser destroying a small drone with the caption ""defend the homeland,"" suggesting that directed energy may have been involved in the El Paso incident.

Fort Bliss, a major US Army installation in El Paso, could not immediately be reached for comment on the incident.

Cartels in Latin America have a history of using drones for drug-related operations, including for smuggling.

Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said in a social media post that the FAA and Pentagon ""acted swiftly"" to address what he described as a ""cartel drone incursion.""

The FAA earlier issued a surprise notice shutting down the airspace above El Paso, a major city in west Texas on the US-Mexico border, and halting all flights up to 18,000 feet for 10 days due to ""special security reasons."" The restricted area covered a 10-mile radius.

The restrictions went into effect from 11:30 p.m. MT on Tuesday and were scheduled to last until the same time on February 20. The FAA warned that the US ""may use deadly force"" if an aircraft became ""an imminent security threat."" It did not offer more details about the situation.

Rep. Veronica Escobar, whose congressional district includes El Paso, called the FAA's decision ""unprecedented.""

However, the FAA said shortly before 7 a.m. MT on Wednesday that the temporary airspace closure over El Paso had been lifted, adding that ""all flights will resume as normal."" The agency did not share additional details about the bizarre, hourslong incident, which appeared to catch local lawmakers by surprise.

In recent years, access to drones has become easier for both state and non-state actors, prompting Western militaries to explore low-cost methods to counter them, including both kinetic and electronic technologies.

These concerns are top of mind among Western countries following a string of drone incursions across Europe near the end of 2025, during which Russian drones violated the airspace of multiple NATO states and unidentified drones were spotted above critical infrastructure — including airports — in other allied countries.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:cnbc.com","David Einhorn says the Fed will cut 'substantially more' than two times. So he's betting big on gold","https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/11/david-einhorn-says-the-fed-will-cut-substantially-more-than-two-times-so-hes-betting-big-on-gold.html","Wed, 11 Feb 2026 17:42:34 GMT","



In this article

Greenlight Capital's David Einhorn anticipates the Federal Reserve will issue more interest rate cuts this year than what's being anticipated and that's giving him greater confidence in his gold bet.

While rate cut expectations diminished a bit Wednesday following the much better-than-expected January jobs report, traders are still currently pricing in a more than 88% chance that the central bank will make two quarter percentage point cuts by the end of the year, according to the CME FedWatch Tool.

But Einhorn said that the market viewing the latest jobs figures as a reason not to cut is ""wrong."" In fact, he thinks the rate cuts number could be higher than that, as he expects Kevin Warsh – President Donald Trump's pick to succeed Jerome Powell as Fed chair – is going to be able to persuade the committee to do so.

""If we have 4% or 5% inflation, sure, then he won't be able to persuade people, but otherwise he's going to argue productivity,"" Einhorn said on CNBC's ""Money Movers"" to Sara Eisen on Wednesday, adding that Warsh, in his view, is going to take the position of cutting ""even if the economy is running hot.""

""I think by the time we get to the end of the year, it's going to be substantially more than two cuts,"" he continued.

The hedge fund manager also owns gold, which sold off at the end of last month after Trump announced Warsh as his nominee for Fed chair, as the move eased anxieties on Wall Street surrounding Fed independence.

The yellow metal – typically viewed as an inflation hedge – has since seen some recovery, with gold futures being up more than 17% this year. That's after it surged more than 60% in 2025 amid threats to central bank independence as well as heightened geopolitical tensions and unstable trade policy. Since 2024, it's surged more than 120%.

Einhorn — who gained notoriety in 2008, when he bet against Lehman Brothers at the Sohn Investment Conference just months before the investment bank declared bankruptcy — pointed out that gold has actually gone up over the past couple years as a result of ""becoming the reserve asset"" to own among central banks around the world.

""U.S. trade policy is very unstable, and it's causing other countries to say we want to settle our trade in something other than U.S. dollars,"" he said.

In the long term, he said that a reason to own gold is due to the fact that the current relationship between our fiscal and monetary policies ""don't make any sense."" He also said that other major developed currencies around the world are ""as bad or worse"" than the U.S.

The U.S. dollar suffered its biggest single-day drop since April 2025 last month after Trump said he wasn't concerned about the currency's recent weakness.

""There are some issues that sometime over the next number of years could play out with some of the major currencies,"" he said.

Deeming betting on more cuts as ""one of the best trades out there right now,"" Einhorn said he was also long futures on SOFR (Secured Overnight Financing Rate), which essentially is a bet that short-term rates will continue to go lower.

Lyft CEO David Risher defended the company's fourth-quarter results Wednesday, telling CNBC that consumer demand remains strong. 

""We have record profits, generated over a billion dollars in cash, and that's a result of our customer-obsessed strategy, which just keeps working and growing the company,"" he told CNBC's ""Squawk Box."" ""So, love what we're seeing, and really no softness on the consumer side at all.""

Shares sank 15% Wednesday as ridership numbers disappointed Wall Street.

The ride-sharing company reported 29.2 million active riders for the quarter, falling short of 29.5 million expected by analysts. Rides totaled 243.5 million for the period, missing estimates of 256.6 million.

Risher highlighted Lyft teen accounts and the company's acquisition of European taxi app FreeNow as future growth drivers for the company. Lyft's launch of teen accounts on Monday came more than two years after rival Uber.

Lyft issued soft first-quarter guidance, expecting bookings to fall between $4.86 billion and $5 billion, versus a FactSet estimate of $4.93 billion. The company projected an adjusted EBTIDA of $120 million to $140 million, compared to a FactSet consensus of $139.8 million.

As robotaxis continue to expand, Risher noted Lyft's planned autonomous vehicle rollout.

""We're positioned super well. We've got great partnerships with Waymo, with Baidu, with others,"" Risher said. ""We'll be starting to bring some of their technology, some of their self-driving cars onto the roads in places like Nashville, [Tennessee], in 2026.""

Lyft's fourth-quarter revenue fell in line with expectations at an adjusted $1.76 billion. The company reported an adjusted 16 cents in earnings per share, beating expectations of 12 cents. 

Both revenue and earnings per share had several exclusions and adjustments. 

Risher also drew attention to Lyft demand during the Super Bowl, which he said had 13% to 15% volume growth year over year, with faster pickups and lower surge pricing than competitors.

Bitcoin's short-lived bounce faded on Wednesday as the volatility in the world's largest cryptocurrency continued.

Bitcoin was trading at around $66,166 at 10:21 a.m. ET on Wednesday, down roughly 4% on the day. 

The digital coin has been on a downward trajectory since hitting an all-time high above $126,000 in October with the sell-off intensifying over the last month. Bitcoin dropped below $70,000 on Feb. 5 and slid to hold just above $60,000, which is seen as a key level.

Bitcoin then recovered from those lows and was back above $70,000, but has struggled to push higher from that, remaining in the range of $66,000 and $72,000.

On Thursday, bitcoin was around 47% lower than its record high.

Several factors have weighed on crypto markets, including volatility in technology stocks in the U.S., with which crypto assets often move in tandem with. 

Meanwhile, the Feb. 5 sell-off was triggered by a wave of liquidations — when traders are forced to close positions if the price of bitcoin hits a certain point. This has a cascading effect, which can exacerbate selling. Those liqudiations have since slowed down.

Investors are also considering whether there will be a shift in U.S. monetary policy following U.S. President Donald Trump's nomination of Kevin Warsh for Fed chair late last month. 

Selling from issuers of bitcoin exchange-traded funds, or ETFs, which are large holders of the digital coin,  led to outflows from these ETFs. That added to the pressure on the digital coin. However, in the last three days, bitcoin ETFs have recorded net inflows.

Market participants are looking at whether bitcoin's typical cycle is intact. This refers to the historical pattern after an event known as halving, which often leads to new all-time highs for the cryptocurrency and a subsequent crash before new highs.

Bitcoin's halving — an event written into its code that happens every four years —reduces the rewards given to bitcoin miners and effectively slows down the supply of bitcoin on the market. The supply squeeze typically precedes rallies to fresh record highs for bitcoin. The most recent halving took place in April 2024. 

There has been a debate as to whether the typical bitcoin cycle is over or if the patterns are breaking. But investors and analysts suggest the cycle is very much intact. 

""2026 I expect to be a bear leg to the four-year cycle,"" Steven McClurg, CEO of Canary Capital, told CNBC on Wednesday. ""We have experienced several four-year cycles since bitcoin has launched and this is no different than any other."" 

McClurg added that he expects bitcoin to fall to as low as $50,000 in the summer before ""things turn around in the fall."" 

Markus Thielen of 10X Research told CNBC last week that bitcoin could fall to the $50,000 level.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=bitcoin","Why Bitcoin (Not Aid) Is Giving Peruvian Kids Shoes, Education, And Real Hope","https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/motiv-builds-bitcoin-circular-economies-empowering-750-peruvian-families-weekly","Wed, 11 Feb 2026 18:35:52 GMT","

In Peru's diverse landscapes—from Andean highlands to coastal surf towns and Amazonian outposts—Bitcoin is quietly taking root, not through top-down mandates or corporate adoption but through grassroots efforts that blend humanitarian aid with Bitcoin's sense of financial sovereignty. 

At the forefront is Motiv Peru, a non-profit co-founded by Rich Swisher and Valentin Popescu, which has spent years equipping underserved and unbanked communities to use Bitcoin for everyday needs, education, and local trade. What began as a simple shoe donation program in 2019 has evolved into a network of about 10 active zones with hubs in Lima, Cusco, and Huanchaco and satellite programs in Tarapoto and Iquitos, among others, serving over 750 families weekly. 

The Motiv team is 50 strong, plus volunteers, and is actively demonstrating Bitcoin's potential as a tool for long-term empowerment in the developing nations rather than short-term foreign aid relief. Most profound of all, Motiv has developed a non-profit strategy that is having deep and lasting social impact, while bootstrapping Bitcoin circular economies, fulfilling an early Bitcoin vision, ‘banking the unbanked'.What did Motiv figure out that other fiat NGO's have not, and what does Bitcoin have to do with it?

Peru has an old and curious history with Bitcoin. One of the first documented real-world uses of Bitcoin involved Peruvian alpaca socks. In early 2011, merchants like Grass Hill Alpacas accepted Bitcoin for wool socks and other goods, exported them from the South American country to the U.S., as noted in Bitcoin Wiki entries and contemporary forum discussions on Bitcointalk. This paralleled legendary moments in Bitcoin history like the famous Laszlo Hanyecz pizza purchase in May 2010.

By 2025 the Peru's crypto landscape had grown amid regional trends, emerging as one of the largest hubs of Bitcoin adoption in the world. Chainalysis data from 2025 shows Latin America handling significant volumes, with Peru recording around $28 billion in crypto transaction value—part of a broader regional surge driven by remittances, inflation hedging, and smartphone access enabling wallets. 

Motiv's origins trace to 2019. Founded by Swisher, a retired U.S. military and police officer with experience in international business, and Valentin, a Romanian expat with experience in non-profit work and logistics, who had lived in Peru since 2007. 

They met while building a playground in a remote Cusco highland village. While Valentin was approached by Jonathan, a seven-year-old orphan living in dire conditions—a mud hut with few possessions, malnourished, and isolated. His mother had passed away months earlier, and his father was the town drunk. “I carried him on my shoulders, and all the kids came around shouting ‘Jonathan, Jonathan!' He was the star,” Valentin told Bitcoin Magazine in an exclusive interview. When offered a granola bar, Jonathan started sharing it with the other kids despite his own hunger. “This is the orphan of the village, the most looked-down-on kid… and he's thinking about others. My mind, my heart exploded.”

Seeing the extreme need Jonathan was in, Swisher and Valentin called in some donors and managed to buy him a full outfit, a jacket, shoes, pants, and a hat, essential protection from the punishing cold of the Andes highlands. But there was a problem, seeing the gifts brought to Jonathan, the other kids were jealous, they too needed shoes and much more, in this isolated village of Peru. 

Valentin promised the rest of the kids they, too, would get shoes, good shoes. In the rough terrain of the Andes, high-quality footwear is like a 4×4; for many kids, it means the difference between going to school or not, because the journey they need to make is that rough. That's when the Happy Steps program was born, and for all intents and purposes, when Motiv found its purpose. Two months later, they returned to the village with shoes for everyone, bought with donations from Swisher's network, establishing a yearly program to support similar villages upgrading their footwear. 

As part of the program, the Motiv team and other adults who volunteer wash the children's feet, often tattered by the elements and rough terrains. Then they give the child the new pair of shoes. Valentin's experience in this remote village taught him an important lesson, which he shared in the interview: “I understood that the story isn't me, a foreigner, coming to feel good about doing this. But what we are trying to do is push so that Peruvians can serve and be leaders in the community. Being a leader isn't talking; it's serving.”

Next year came around, and Motiv was getting ready to release another batch of shoes, but the year was 2020, and COVID-19 and the corresponding lockdowns were ravaging the country's health and economy. Valentin called Swisher, “Look, we have this situation; we had planned this amount for shoes, so I'm going to do one thing. Why don't you talk to the donors instead of buying shoes now? Well, we have to buy food.”Right as Valentin might have been, non-profit donations don't quite work that way. Swisher talked to the donors but returned with bad news. When donations are made for a specific program or purpose, you can't just pivot at the last minute; the donors refused. But there was another option; Swisher mentioned that “he knows someone who knows someone who knows someone who has Bitcoin” that could buy shoes and food. Valentin recalled his reaction: “This isn't the time for jokes, Rich.”But the Bitcoin donor was serious. He would fund the shoes program this year and cover other essential supplies like food for the village, to help them survive COVID. But there was one condition. Everything had to be paid for in Bitcoin. 

“I started looking for a store, but I didn't find any. I was looking for a big store or something. ” Recalled Valentin, “eventually, I found a kiosk that accepted Bitcoin, crypto, everything. And the guy told me, ‘I don't have many things.' We bought some little things from him, but it wasn't what we needed… We're talking hundreads of people, right?” At this point, Motiv was looking to provide supplies to 50 families, a triple-digit number of people. The kiosk merchant solved the immediate food supplies mission, but he realized he was going to have to orange pill some vendors to get scale. 

The second merchant was Olger the shoemaker. Olger had supplied Motiv in previous shoe donation campaigns, so a relationship already existed, but COVID had hit him hard. He lost his wife and job during the pandemic and was left with three kids to take care of alone. Olger, rather than turn to alcoholism as many did during those hard times, doubled down on his vocation and started teaching people to make shoes, while also accepting Bitcoin from Motiv and becoming a crucial partner of the Happy Steps program. 

From there, Motiv began organizing a list of merchants and educating them about Bitcoin. They quickly faced negative responses, financial scams of many kinds, crypto included, had savaged the country a few times by this point, so a very simple and different approach to Bitcoin evangelism was needed. Rather than promise financial independence or preach the cypherpunk utopia, Valentin simply sold Bitcoin as a payments tool and taught these merchants to use it as they wished. From this premise, Motiv started to snowball.

Fast forward a few years, and Motivn Peru is a well-oiled machine. As merchants got introduced to Bitcoin as a payment method, they began getting interested in it as a technology, and basic Bitcoin and financial literacy education programs followed, hosted at Motiv centers in major locations across Peru. Various education programs were developed to answer the questions of merchants and users alike in an organized manner. 

Valentin tells us that today Motiv teaches Peruvians about Bitcoin from Monday to Saturday in 15 different locations, touching over 750 families. Motiv events in  2025 reached over 6000 people of all ages, including the Copa Bitcoin soccer tournament, a Christmas event, and various fairs and educational activities. The total number of individual bitcoin transactions made as a result of these efforts ranges between 25 and 30 thousand, with Blink as their entry level go to wallet.

U.S. seized 127,271 BTC now down $6B as price falls; victims await outcome of ongoing Prince Group fraud and forfeiture litigation.

NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES, February 11, 2026 /EINPresswire.com/ -- Crypto recovery attorney Marc Fitapelli announced today that the United States government's federal Bitcoin holdings have declined by approximately $6 billion in potential market value. The losses stem from 127,271 Bitcoin seized from the Prince Group on October 14, 2025, pursuant to a civil asset forfeiture action. At the time of seizure, Bitcoin was trading at approximately $115,000 per coin, placing the total value near $15 billion. As of February 11, 2026, Bitcoin's market price has fallen to roughly $70,000 per coin, reducing the value of the seized assets by approximately $6 billion.

On October 14, 2025, the U.S. Department of Justice also unsealed an indictment charging Chen Zhi, chairman of Cambodia-based Prince Holding Group, with wire fraud and money laundering.  According to the United States Attorney, Chen Zhi allegedly operated forced-labor scam compounds that carried out large-scale “pig butchering” cryptocurrency fraud schemes. Prosecutors allege victims in the United States and worldwide were defrauded out of billions of dollars through coordinated online investment scams.

The Bitcoin at issue is currently in U.S. government custody pending resolution of the criminal and civil forfeiture proceedings against Chen Zhi.  Civil asset forfeiture is a legal doctrine rooted in old English admiralty law, where governments seized pirate ships and smuggling vessels by proceeding “in rem” or against the property itself rather than the owner. That concept carried into American law and expanded significantly in the 1980s during the war on drugs, when Congress strengthened federal forfeiture statutes to allow the government to seize assets suspected of being connected to crime, often before a criminal conviction.  Now, the Federal government is using civil asset forfeiture to target criminal organizations that are involved in cryptocurrency scams. While forfeiture can serve important law enforcement purposes, it is not designed primarily as a victim restitution system. Seized assets may remain frozen for years during litigation, and victims' attorneys must often pursue separate remission processes to recover funds. 

On March 6, 2025, the White House issued an Executive Order establishing a U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, directing that Bitcoin “finally forfeited” in criminal or civil proceedings be deposited into the reserve and held as a long-term strategic asset rather than immediately liquidated. Importantly, Bitcoin does not become part of the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve until the forfeiture becomes final. The Prince Group case remains ongoing, and there remains a possibility that the defendant could prevail and recover the seized assets back from the United States government. Until final adjudication, the status and ultimate disposition of the Bitcoin remain legally unsettled. 

If a court ultimately rules in favor of the defendant, the assets must be returned. If the forfeiture is upheld, federal law provides mechanisms for restitution or remission to identifiable victims. In principle, the system contemplates eventual return to victims. In practice, however, the process is complex, slow, and heavily procedural.  Civil forfeiture litigation can take years to resolve. During that time, seized digital assets remain in government custody, exposed to extreme market volatility. Victims do not control the timing of liquidation, the pace of litigation, or the strategic decisions made about whether assets are held or sold. If the forfeiture fails, the assets may go back to the defendant. If the forfeiture succeeds, victims must navigate a separate administrative remission process that is discretionary and does not guarantee full repayment. 

If you or someone you know was a victim of a pig butchering cryptocurrency scam or any other online investment fraud, you may have independent legal options beyond the government's forfeiture process. Victims should not be forced to sit on the sidelines while litigation drags on, and asset values fluctuate.

U.S. economy adds 130,000 jobs in January, exceeding expectations

Gold, silver prices rise with upcoming payrolls data in focus

Would a stock market crash trigger a global recession? Here's what CE says

Wall Street's biggest clients keep buying stocks — selectively

Ethereum (ETH-USD) trades around $1,930–$1,950, down roughly 3–5% on the day and close to 14% lower over the past week. The coin sits about 60% below its all-time high near $4,950, with more than 38% erased in the last month alone. At these levels, roughly 41.5% of addresses are in profit, while about 58% are carrying unrealized losses, so most late-cycle buyers are under water and any bounce faces heavy overhead supply from participants waiting to exit near breakeven around $2,000–$2,150. The $2,000 zone has already flipped from support into resistance, confirming that the short-term structure in Ethereum (ETH-USD) remains negative until that band is reclaimed on a sustained closing basis.

Large wallets with at least 1,000 ETH now control less than 75% of total supply for the first time in seven months, after disposing of or redistributing roughly 1.5% of circulating coins since December. That shows deliberate de-risking at the top end in response to volatility and macro uncertainty. At the same time, mid-tier addresses holding 1–1,000 ETH have lifted their share above 23%, and sub-1 ETH wallets now hold a record 2.3% of supply, with much of that linked to staking and long-only strategies. Ownership of Ethereum (ETH-USD) is slowly migrating away from a handful of very large entities toward a broader base of smaller and mid-size holders, which lowers single-point concentration risk but also makes rallies more dependent on distributed buying instead of a few whales driving aggressive flows.

Ethereum (ETH-USD) – Cost basis stress for whales, ETFs and accumulation wallets

Spot price in Ethereum (ETH-USD) is now trading below the key cost zones of several dominant cohorts. A dense cluster between about $1,879 and $1,898 contains roughly 1.36 million ETH in realized positions and currently acts as a pivot where short-term traders and long-term capital clash on every test. Accumulation addresses – wallets that only receive ETH and never send out – show an average cost around $2,580, which is firmly above current market levels. Spot ETF exposure is under even heavier pressure, with estimated entry levels around $3,500, leaving many regulated vehicles down approximately 40–45%. With ETH trading near $1,950, long-duration capital is deep in the red, which is why defending the $1,800–$2,000 corridor is critical to avoid sliding into a multi-quarter capitulation phase where these holders are forced to lock in losses.

Although the price profile is weak, on-chain flows show that Ethereum (ETH-USD) is not in a pure liquidation environment. More than 220,000 ETH have recently been withdrawn from exchanges, the largest net outflow since October, and a single large venue saw about 158,000 ETH leave in one day. Sustained net withdrawals mean fewer coins available on order books and usually signal that assets are being moved into self-custody, staking contracts or cold storage rather than being staged for immediate sale. Earlier in the cycle, when DeFi TVL started rolling over, exchange inflows picked up and outflows faded, confirming that capital was shifting into more liquid, potentially sell-ready positions. The current swing back towards strong outflows indicates the market has transitioned from forced de-leveraging into a phase where aggressive spot buyers are selectively absorbing supply at lower levels.

The weakness in Ethereum (ETH-USD) is reinforced by what is happening in DeFi. Total Value Locked across Ethereum protocols has fallen from around $75.6 billion when ETH traded near $3,232 to roughly $55–56 billion now, after printing a three-month low near $51.7 billion. That roughly $20 billion contraction shows that a meaningful slice of on-chain capital has rotated out of lending pools, DEX liquidity and yield strategies, either into stablecoins, other chains or off-chain instruments. Historically, falling TVL has been mirrored by rising exchange inflows or softening outflows, as users unwind long-term positions and seek liquidity. Even with the latest exchange withdrawals, TVL has not reclaimed the mid-$60B band, which means the fundamental utilisation of the Ethereum DeFi stack remains under pressure. Until TVL rebuilds toward and above $70B, any strong rally in Ethereum (ETH-USD) will be fighting a headwind from lower protocol activity and subdued fee generation.

Despite the TVL drag, accumulation metrics for Ethereum (ETH-USD) are exceptionally strong. Addresses that only receive ETH and never send out have taken in about 1.3 million ETH over five days, worth roughly $2.6 billion at current prices, pushing their holdings to a record 27 million ETH. That represents more than a 20% increase in balance so far in 2026 while the market price has fallen by around 34.5%. Large spikes in inflows to these wallets have repeatedly preceded significant upside phases: a 380,000 ETH daily inflow in late June 2025 was followed by an almost 85% rally within a month, and a later spike in November 2025 was followed by a move of about 25%. These historical patterns do not guarantee a repeat, but they underline that aggressive spot absorption at depressed prices has often marked the early stages of major upswings in Ethereum (ETH-USD).

Spot ETFs linked to Ethereum (ETH-USD) remain under clear mark-to-market stress, with units trading far below estimated average entry levels near $3,500. Nevertheless, recent sessions have shown steady net inflows, including days with more than $50 million in fresh capital. That behaviour confirms that these vehicles are being used as strategic allocation tools rather than tactical short-term trading products. For institutions that cannot hold native ETH on-chain, ETF units provide convenient exposure, and continued buying into weakness transforms those funds into a slow but persistent source of demand under spot price. As long as ETF inflows remain positive while Ethereum (ETH-USD) trades below their cost basis, this channel acts as a structural absorber of supply from stressed holders, helping to anchor medium-term downside even if short-term volatility remains high.

The latest leg down in Ethereum (ETH-USD) is closely tied to cross-asset turbulence triggered by extreme moves in metals, especially gold. Late January saw trillions of dollars in gold market capitalization swing within a single session, forcing margin calls that spilled into equities, credit and crypto. In that context, even resilient digital assets sold off as portfolios were de-leveraged to meet collateral demands elsewhere. Some high-profile macro voices now describe the current phase as a crypto “mini-winter” rather than a full structural bear market, arguing that gold has probably peaked for 2026 while Bitcoin and Ethereum are on track to outperform over the next legs of the cycle. That framing positions Ethereum (ETH-USD) as an asset caught in a violent rotational clean-up between old hedges like gold and newer macro diversifiers, rather than a network facing an existential collapse of its core thesis.

With roughly 58% of Ethereum addresses now holding coins at a loss, the network is firmly in a realized-loss majority environment. In this regime, every push lower risks triggering incremental selling from participants capitulating out of underwater positions, while any sharp recovery into previously traded zones meets heavy overhead supply. Each revisit of $2,000, $2,150 or $2,440 will confront layers of holders who bought there and have been waiting for price to get back to their entry levels. That dynamic creates thick resistance bands and explains why rallies in Ethereum (ETH-USD) can stall multiple times beneath the same levels before either breaking through impulsively or rolling over if structural demand is insufficient. The psychological weight of trapped capital is a real constraint until enough supply changes hands at discounted prices to reset the holder base.

From a pure chart perspective, Ethereum (ETH-USD) trades inside a clear descending channel and has just confirmed a clean break below the $2,000 floor, turning that round number into fresh resistance. Spot is currently drifting around $1,930–$1,950 with a visible demand zone flagged around $1,800–$1,850. Momentum indicators show exhausted conditions: the RSI has slipped to roughly 28 on key timeframes, signalling an oversold state where sharp short-covering rallies are common. Any credible recovery sequence now starts with a decisive reclaim of $2,000 followed by a push through $2,150–$2,200. Above that, $2,440 is the first serious pivot that needs to be overcome to neutralise the immediate downtrend, and the broader bearish structure only weakens meaningfully once Ethereum (ETH-USD) trades convincingly above the $2,780–$2,800 band.

Key supports are layered beneath spot in tight succession. The first horizontal shelf sits near $1,960, where Ethereum (ETH-USD) has already attempted to stabilise several times. Below that, the $1,880–$1,898 region overlaps with the concentrated cost basis for around 1.36 million ETH, making it a decisive battleground where failure would push a large cohort further into loss. If that band gives way on daily closes, the market's focus will shift to approximately $1,845 as the final major defence before a deeper reset. A break there opens scope toward $1,750–$1,760, with further high-volume zones around $1,580 and $1,230 linked to previous trading clusters and realized price distributions. Those lower levels only become central if the current effort to build a base between $1,800 and $1,900 is rejected by the market and forced selling accelerates again.

Some longer-term technical frameworks still flag the $1,000–$750 zone as a possible destination if the present structure fully breaks down. Those paths assume the move below $2,000 marks the beginning of a multi-month capitulation, with DeFi TVL stuck near the lows, ETF inflows fading and macro risk assets rolling over in tandem. Under that scenario, Ethereum (ETH-USD) would likely slice through $1,580 and $1,230 before ultimately forming a major low in the four-figure or even high triple-digit range. At this stage, on-chain behaviour does not support that extreme as the base case: accumulation addresses are at record highs, exchange balances are draining and institutions are still buying. Nonetheless, these tail levels must be recognised as part of the risk map in a market that has already demonstrated how quickly liquidity can vanish once confidence is shaken.

Recent money flow dynamics explain why the last rebound attempt in Ethereum (ETH-USD) collapsed. Between February 6 and 9, price bounced off local lows, but the Chaikin Money Flow remained below zero and failed to break its own descending trendline, signalling that institutional-scale capital was not backing the move. When price rises while CMF stays negative, rallies are often driven by short covering and retail flows rather than durable accumulation, and they frequently unwind violently as soon as buying pressure fades. The subsequent break of the bear flag's lower boundary and the renewed sell-off matched this template and opened up technical room for an additional 40–50% decline if left unchecked. The small recent uptick in whale holdings, from about 113.56 million ETH to 113.62 million, is an early hint that larger players are starting to re-engage near support zones, but the size of that change is still modest relative to the earlier distribution.

The incentive for whales to defend current levels is clear from their cost structure. Large holders trimmed positions as Ethereum (ETH-USD) broke down, taking aggregate holdings from roughly 113.91 million ETH to 113.56 million. The subsequent rebuild of around 60,000 ETH shows that they are beginning to lean into the $1,880–$1,900 band instead of exiting aggressively. Allowing price to decisively breach that cost block and the nearby $1,845 support would drive a large portion of their inventory further into loss and could ignite a more disorderly liquidation cycle. As long as spot remains close to their most recent accumulation zones, it is rational for whales to drip-feed bids and slow the descent, especially with ETF flows and accumulation addresses absorbing a meaningful part of the available float.

For Ethereum (ETH-USD) to transition from a tactical downtrend into a durable recovery, three conditions need to align. First, price must reclaim and hold above the $2,000–$2,150 region to invalidate the latest breakdown and signal that recent selling was a shakeout rather than the start of a new structural leg lower. Second, DeFi TVL must recover convincingly toward and through the $60–70B range, showing that users are redeploying capital into on-chain strategies instead of sitting in cash or rotating to other ecosystems. Third, capital flow indicators such as CMF must turn positive during advances, confirming that institutional-style buying is supporting rallies instead of leaving them to speculative short squeezes. A sustained move above $2,440 would be the first signal that these conditions are coming together; a later break of $2,780–$2,800 would strongly suggest that the broader uptrend in Ethereum (ETH-USD) is re-asserting itself.

Across all layers, Ethereum (ETH-USD) shows a split profile. Structurally, the chart is still bearish below $2,150, with a clear descending channel, a broken $2,000 floor, soft DeFi TVL and a holder base where 58% of addresses are in loss. At the same time, spot absorption is unusually strong: 1.3 million ETH accumulated in five days, 27 million ETH locked in accumulation wallets, 220,000 ETH withdrawn from exchanges and continuous ETF inflows despite deep unrealized drawdowns. Momentum is oversold, and cost-basis clusters offer nearby reference points for risk management. Taken together, this combination justifies a high-risk Buy-on-weakness stance rather than a clean Sell or passive neutral posture, with accumulation focused around and below the $1,900–$1,800 band and a clear technical invalidation if Ethereum (ETH-USD) loses the $1,750–$1,745 support area on a closing basis and begins to accelerate toward the $1,580 and $1,230 downside targets.

What to Know:

Recent market chatter has exploded around filings suggesting major institutional players, including Goldman Sachs, are gaining exposure to XRP. $153M of it to be more specific.

The filings reflect holdings in existing trust products, as institutional capital carves out territory in assets like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and now XRP, our digital economy grows more powerful but also dangerously fragmented.

This matters because institutional adoption isn't one big event; it's a slow-burn process. First comes Bitcoin, then Ethereum, and now the market is testing the waters for other large-cap altcoins. Each new institutional product, whether it's a trust or a future ETF, creates another silo of liquidity. Capital can flow into XRP, sure, but moving that value over to the Bitcoin or Solana ecosystem remains a complex, high-friction mess of wrapped assets and vulnerable bridges.

The market is cheering for mainstream validation while simultaneously building taller walls between its most important ecosystems.

What good is a multi-trillion-dollar market if its value is trapped on digital islands? This underlying tension is setting the stage for the next wave of innovation: foundational infrastructure designed to tear those walls down.

This is where LiquidChain ($LIQUID) makes its entrance.

The Problem Hiding Behind the Headlines

While the market focuses on which single asset will win the institutional race, the smarter question is how these assets will eventually interact.

An ETF for XRP would be a huge milestone, legitimizing it for a new class of investors. However, it does nothing to solve the chronic problem of fragmented liquidity that plagues decentralized finance (DeFi).

A portfolio manager holding $BTC via an ETF can't easily deploy that capital into a Solana-based yield farm without a painful process of selling, wiring fiat, and re-buying on a separate chain. This is the fundamental friction holding DeFi back from true mainstream scale.

And that's the exact challenge LiquidChain ($LIQUID) is engineered to solve. It operates as a Layer 3 protocol designed to be a cross-chain liquidity layer, fusing the liquidity of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana into a single, unified environment. Instead of forcing developers to build separate dApps for each ecosystem, LiquidChain offers a ‘Deploy-Once Architecture.'

A protocol can be deployed just once while accessing users and capital from three of the largest blockchains simultaneously. For users, its ‘Single-Step Execution' abstracts away the complexities of cross-chain swaps, making the multi-chain world finally feel like a single platform.

Explore the $LIQUID presale.

An Infrastructure Play for a Multi-Chain World

As institutional interest validates individual assets, the value of the underlying infrastructure that connects them grows exponentially.

This is where LiquidChain positions itself. It's not just another DeFi application; it's a foundational layer aiming to become the go-to plumbing for value transfer between major blockchains. The project is still in its early stages, offering a compelling entry point for those who see where the market is headed.

According to its official site, the LiquidChain presale has already raised an impressive $546k, with the $LIQUID token priced at just $0.0136.

 This kind of traction suggests a strong appetite for solutions addressing real, persistent problems. The project's tokenomics are centered on utility, with $LIQUID used for liquidity staking rewards and as gas for transactions on the network. This creates a direct link between the growth of the LiquidChain ecosystem and the value of its native token.

While the market is distracted by the speculative buzz around which altcoin might get the next ETF, LiquidChain represents a more fundamental thesis: the ultimate winner won't be a single chain, but the technology that unifies them all. For investors, this presents a ground-floor opportunity to get involved in a project building for the next generation of DeFi.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=blockchain","Robinhood launches its own blockchain as part of broader push into tokenized stocks","https://fortune.com/2026/02/10/robinhood-launches-test-version-of-its-own-blockchain/","Wed, 11 Feb 2026 01:38:00 GMT","

Robinhood announced on Tuesday evening that a developers' version of its custom-built blockchain, known as Robinhood Chain, is now live. The move, announced at the Consensus event in Hong Kong, comes as the company accelerates its push into crypto-based financial services, including tokenized versions of popular stocks.

Robinhood Chain, which the company teased last June, is currently in the so-called testnet phase. That means it is publicly visible but restricted to a limited number of partners and participants who can test its infrastructure and introduce experimental features. In coming months, the “mainnet” version of Robinhood Chain will go live and be used to process customer transactions.

“We now have Alchemy, LayerZero, Chainlink, and other big crypto players. But moving forward, when the mainnet is live, customers will be able to interact directly with it,” Robinhood's SVP of crypto, Johann Kerbrat, told Fortune.

Kerbrat added that Robinhood Chain will support transactions both in its self-custody crypto wallet, and also in the main Robinhood app. He noted that, on a customer level, the blockchain will be a seamless experience and many people will be unaware they are even using it.

Robinhood Chain itself is built on a technology called Arbitrum, a so-called layer 2 blockchain that sits atop Ethereum, and is designed to process transactions in batches in order to make them cheaper and more efficient. Arbitrum is one of two dominant layer 2 technologies in the Ethereum world. The other is called Optimism, and is used by Robinhood rival Coinbase, which has adapted it for its own popular Base blockchain.

The launch of Robinhood Chain comes as the company is in a push to embrace tokenization, which CEO Vlad Tenev last year described as a freight train coming to financial markets. The term describes turning various assets into digital tokens, including stocks, that can be traded on a blockchain in the same way as Ethereum.

Robinhood's blockchain announcement came the same day the company reported fourth-quarter earnings for 2025. The earnings showed a fourth-quarter profit of $605 million, or 66 cents a share, which beat analysts' estimate of 63 cents. Robinhood posted weaker than expected revenue, however, leading shares to fall in after-hours trading.

Correction to: Nature https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06186-2 Published online 14 June 2023

Our manuscript included a phylogenomic study of the evolutionary relationship between eukaryotes and Asgard archaea, showing that eukaryotes likely emerged from a bona fide Asgard archaeal ancestor. Our results suggested that eukaryotes and the heimdallarchaeial order Hodarchaeales form a monophyletic group. A set of 57 phylogenetic markers (NM57) was central to reach these conclusions. After the publication of our study, we noticed that three of these markers were partially redundant, as they belong to paralogous families. We have therefore reduced this dataset to 54 non-redundant markers (NM54; we removed markers M127, M028, and MA54) and used the same methodology to re-run all phylogenomic analyses presented in the paper.

The results of the analyses of the corrected dataset are consistent with the original findings: while we observe small variations in statistical support, the overall trends support that eukaryotes are placed within Heimdallarchaeia, as sister-group to the order Hodarchaeales when both Susko-Roger-4 (SR4)-recoding and Fast-site removal (FSR) treatments were combined.

University of Texas spinout Apptronik, a builder of humanoid robots for Google DeepMind among others, on Wednesday announced that it re-opened its Series A to raise a total of $935 million for the round.

While the company did not disclose the valuation, TechCrunch separately learned that its post-money valuation is now about $5.3 billion.

Apptronik previously announced a $350 million Series A a year ago, but demand was so strong, according to the company, that it expanded the round to $415 million. Now it has raised another $520 million from earlier investors Google, Mercedes-Benz, and B Capital, alongside some new investors.

While it may sound like the startup is just selling off ever bigger chunks of itself at its Series A price, that's not exactly what's happening. The company says its investors have paid progressively more for shares in each subsequent extension — valuing it at roughly triple the initial Series A valuation of around $1.75 billion, according to PitchBook.

Why not just call this a Series B then? The company says it is still in early stages of development and was not actively seeking funding —  rather it was dealing with inbound interest, says a source close to the company.

Fair enough. Another $520 million in a year, especially at a higher valuation, would be hard to turn away, particularly for tech as expensive to build as bipedal robots. Closely watched competitor Figure AI, for instance, had raised nearly $2 billion total since its 2022 founding before announcing a further $1 billion round last fall.

Part of the excitement over Apptronik is that it has partnered with Google DeepMind, as well as GXO and Mercedes-Benz, to deliver what the industry calls embodied AI — robots capable of perceiving their environment and taking physical action based on reasoning, rather than just following fixed instructions. The robot is being built for tasks like unloading trailers, picking warehouse inventory, and tending machinery, the company says.

Despite retaining the early-stage funding label, Apptronik is no Johnny-come-lately to this field. As we've previously reported, its humanoid work dates all the way back to 2013, three years before the company was formally founded. That's when members of the Human Centered Robotics Lab from the University of Austin at Texas competed in the NASA-DARPA Robotics Challenge, working on a robot called Valkyrie. Since then, the space agency has maintained a partnership with Apptronik as the company has readied its own humanoid robot, named Apollo.

The founders of Upside Robotics met in 2023 because they were both looking to build an impact-driven company that touched climate and agriculture. Less than a year later, they were sleeping in a camper on the side of a Canadian corn field building their robotics startup.

Waterloo, Ontario-based Upside Robotics builds lightweight solar-powered autonomous robots that deliver right-sized amounts of fertilizer and nutrients to crops when they need it. The company's software runs on proprietary algorithms to decipher when and how much fertilizer the plants need using weather and soil data.

Upside's robots currently work on corn plants — one of the most fertilizer-intensive crops — which was chosen by Upside for that exact reason, Jana Tian, co-founder and CEO, told TechCrunch.

After Tian and Sam Dugan, co-founder and chief technology officer, met at the Entrepreneurs First accelerator, they decided to focus on reducing fertilizer waste using robots because it fit squarely into the center of the Venn diagram of their interests. It also leaned well toward their backgrounds.

Dugan had been building robots since he was 10 years old and Tian had years of experience as a chemical engineer in the food division at Unilever.

Customer discovery with farmers further confirmed this was an area farmers were willing to pay for a better way.

“Traditionally, the way the fertilizer has been applied, only 30% of the total fertilizer gets taken by the crop, so a majority of it gets wasted,” Tian said. “Farmers usually do one application per season, so they have to front-load a lot of the fertilizer. But the crops need the fertilizer during the season as well. We knew there was that problem that a lot of our growers really wanted different solutions to.”

The pair formally founded Upside Robotics in 2024 and then hit the fields — literally.

“We actually bought a camper trailer, and we moved around field to field,” Dugan said. “We stayed on the side of the field every night, and we would be walking, sometimes around the clock. We have spent every hour of the day in a corn field at some point in time.”

Dugan built a robot in two weeks so they could start to test their idea. This device was a remote-controlled car that Dugan and Tian would operate manually. They'd follow the robot around the fields to collect data and demonstrate how the fertilizing system would work to farmers.

“We did our manual applications in year one, and that allowed us to iterate super fast, not just kind of on the hardware side, but learning by being with the farmers,” Tian said. “Some of our farmers said that we spent probably more time than they did in a lifetime in their fields. That allowed us to wrap up quickly. Neither of us were farmers, so that gave us firsthand experience into what it is like to basically be a farmer.”

After spending the 2024 season proving the company's concept, they spent that off-season developing the fourth generation of their robot for the 2025 growing season. They went from 70 acres in 2024 to 1,200 acres in 2025.

Now, the company is gearing up to serve more than 3,000 acres in the upcoming 2026 season with 100% customer retention since the beginning. Upside reported that it has thus far helped its customers cut fertilizer use by 70%, which equates to around $150 in savings per acre per season.

Upside recently raised a $7.5 million seed round led by Plural with participation from Garage Capital and the founders of Clearpath Robotics.

The funding will be used to continue to fund research and development and to keep up with demand — there are more than 200 farms on their waitlist. The company also hopes to expand out of Canada with a target of breaking into the U.S. corn belt.

“People always question if farmers are going to adopt new solutions, and they certainly are, and that's something that we've learned firsthand, as long as you can provide them with a clear [return on investment] and a clear reason of why this technology was built,” Tian said. “In our case, it wasn't something that we actually had to sell to farmers. In a lot of cases, our farmers actually asked for this solution.”

Reading your mail, WhatsApp and bank transactions? May be OK if your LLM runs locally, but even then, if it has any way to send data to the outside world without you checking it, maybe not even. You don't want your LLM to send your private mail (including photos) or bank statements to somebody who uses prompt injection to get that data.Thinking of prompt injection: we need LLMs with a Harvard architecture (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_architecture), so that there is no way for LLM data inputs to be treated as instructions.

I've found primer on agent sandboxes [0] is a great reference on sandboxing options and the trade-offsFor agents there's a tension between level of restriction and utility. I think a large part of OpenClaw's popularity is that the lack of restriction by default has helped people see the potential utility of agents. But any agent that isn't just for trying things out requires consideration of what it should and should not be able to do and from there the decision around the best combination of sandboxing and authorization.At work, we've found it helpful to distinguish coding agents vs product agents. Coding agents have the ability to add new execution paths by pulling in external code or writing their own code to run. Product agents have a strictly defined set of tools and the runtime prevents them from executing anything beyond that definition. This distinction helps us reason about what sandboxing is required.For data permissions it's trickier. MCP uses OAuth for authentication but each server can have different expectations for access to the external service. Some servers let you use a service account where you can narrow the scope of access but others assume a token minted from an admin account which means the MCP server might have access to things beyond what the agent using the server should.So for that, we have an MCP proxy that lets us define custom permissions for every tool and resource, and at runtime makes permission checks to ensure the agent only gets access to the subset of things we define ahead of time. (We're using SpiceDB to implement the authorization logic and checks) This works well for product agents because they can't add new execution paths. For coding agents, we've tinkered with plugins/skills to try to do the same but ultimately they can build their way around authorization layers that aren't part of the runtime system so it's something we're still trying to figure out.---[0] https://www.luiscardoso.dev/blog/sandboxes-for-ai

Another useful primitive is surrogate credentials: the agent never handles real API keys or tokens. A proxy swaps in real values only for scoped hosts on the way out. This keeps the access the agent has locked inside the container; surrogate credentials are not valid outside.My Claude Code over email project demonstrates both of these: https://github.com/airutorg/airut

The ""lethal trifecta"" is a limited view on security, as it's mostly concerned with leaking data. This solution focuses on a different aspect: the ability of rogue actions (instead of rogue communications per #3).

As cancer survival rates continue to improve, long-term outcomes have become a central concern for adolescents and young adults treated for the disease. For many patients diagnosed during their reproductive years, parenthood is a major public health concern. Clinicians are increasingly required to address the risk for infertility before treatment begins and to support patients through complex reproductive decisions after treatment.

Researchers at the Research Laboratory on Human Reproduction (RLHR) at the Université Libre de Bruxelles (ULB), Brussels, Belgium, are advancing fertility preservation approaches prior to chemotherapy.

Laboratory work focuses on fertility preservation prior to chemotherapy. The program is led by Isabelle Demeestere, MD, PhD, research director at ULB, and is embedded in a multidisciplinary framework developed in collaboration with oncology centers in Belgium and across Europe. Ongoing clinical research examines how newer anticancer therapies affect ovarian function and evaluates pharmacologic strategies designed to reduce treatment-related gonadotoxicity.

Speaking with MediQuality, a Medscape Network platform, Margherita Condorelli, MD, gynecologist specializing in oncofertility at the Hôpital Erasme Fertility Clinic of Brussels University Hospital (H.U.B.), said, “Our laboratory has been involved in several oncofertility studies, including CHANCE, BROVALE, and FAMHOPE. Some of these are ongoing; others we've completed.”

She is currently pursuing her PhD in breast cancer (BC) oncofertility management at the ULB's RLHR, working under the supervision of Demeestere. Her research focuses on the critical question of how assisted reproductive technologies and newer cancer treatments affect fertility in young patients with BC. What is their impact on cancer outcomes?

“This involves enrolling patients from Erasmus Hospital and Queen Fabiola Children's University Hospital, both of which are part of the Brussels University Hospital (H.U.B.) network affiliated with the ULB.”

The CHANCE study examined anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) as a predictive factor for the risk for future infertility in prepubertal and pubertal patients treated for cancer. The BROVALE study evaluated the efficacy and safety of controlled ovarian stimulation (COS) combined with the aromatase inhibitor letrozole for fertility preservation in patients with BC. fAMHOPE was a prospective multicenter cohort study assessing COS in patients newly diagnosed with BC; however, the study was discontinued following the implementation of new European clinical trial regulations.

The ULB team has also contributed to major international trials, including the POSITIVE study, which has influenced clinical decision-making regarding pregnancy planning in patients receiving endocrine therapy for hormone receptor-positive BC.

“This study allowed us to assess ovarian reserve through hormone analysis, particularly AMH,” Condorelli said.

Patients treated for BC face an increased risk for infertility related to anticancer therapy and age at diagnosis. As a result, some patients interrupt adjuvant endocrine therapy earlier than the recommended minimum of 5 years to attempt pregnancy.

The multicenter POSITIVE trial, conducted by the International Breast Cancer Study Group, evaluated whether temporarily interrupting adjuvant endocrine therapy to attempt pregnancy was feasible and safe in young women with hormone receptor-positive early BC at sufficient risk for recurrence. This study also assessed fertility-related outcomes, pregnancy parameters, and cancer biology in young women. A complementary psycho-oncological study examined fertility concerns, psychological well-being, and decisional conflicts.

The RLHR also serves as a sponsor center for several academic studies. It was awarded a prestigious Horizon Europe grant to lead the PredictAYA project.

This 5-year initiative focuses on fertility-related outcomes in adolescent and young adult patients aged 15-39 years who have been treated for cancer. PredictAYA brings together 18 partners from 10 European countries and is funded through Horizon Europe with a total budget of €6,329,134.26.

Despite their high survival rates, many young adults experience late effects of cancer treatment, including infertility and toxicity to other organs. These long-term consequences remain poorly characterized and are rarely addressed in current clinical guidelines.

Running until May 2030, PredictAYA integrates clinical research, epidemiology, pharmacogenetics, and experimental science to identify patients at the highest risk for late treatment-related toxicity and to clarify the underlying biological mechanisms. Demeestere leads the project on reproductive health, sexuality, and post-cancer quality of life.

The PredictAYA team will also collect data on patient-reported care preferences and psychosocial outcomes. Researchers are developing biomarkers to identify individuals at an increased risk for organ toxicity, support targeted screening and personalized counseling, and explore the genetic factors associated with treatment-induced toxicity.

The findings of PredictAYA will be disseminated to patients, healthcare professionals, caregivers, researchers, policymakers, and the public. This project aimed to provide clinical recommendations and support policies that prioritize long-term outcomes for young cancer survivors and their families in Europe.

“We are part of the teams that contribute to the drafting of guidelines, and we participate in the collection of data,” said Condorelli. “Our laboratory evaluates medically assisted reproduction in these young patients, the likelihood of success, and the associated oncologic risk for recurrence.”

Additional studies on RLHR have focused on preserving ovarian function during chemotherapy. Early studies examined the protective effect of gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists administered during chemotherapy in patients with lymphoma, helping to establish international collaborations and confirming the laboratory's expertise in evaluating chemotherapy-induced gonadotoxicity.

The laboratory now serves as a reference center for several national and international studies.

“We evaluate all gonadotoxic anticancer treatments, but our primary focus is cyclophosphamide,” said Condorelli. “Its toxicity profile is well established, which allows detailed analysis of treatment-related ovarian damage.”

Throughout most of her life, Katie Neu, a 31-year-old Massachusetts resident with Crohn's disease, has struggled with insurance barriers.

Diagnosed at age 10, Neu was initially required by Medicaid to fail 5-aminosalicylate therapy before advancing to other treatments. Even after starting biologics, her disease remained uncontrolled, eventually requiring surgical removal of 13 inches of small intestine and a bladder reconstruction as a teenager. 

Later, access to infusions of vedolizumab required another battle with Medicaid. As a young adult managing her own health insurance, Neu once received a $26,000 bill for a vedolizumab infusion, which was only lowered after a switch to the insurer's preferred infusion center.

More recently, after moving to her husband's insurance plan, Neu faced a new barrier to covering her then-therapy, risankizumab. A pharmacy benefit manager informed her that her next dose would not be approved in time, and she would need to try a lower dose first. 

“I was bawling my eyes out,” Neu told Medscape Medical News.

The higher dose was eventually approved. However, the stress led to a flare, just the latest toll of her decades' long battle against insurance barriers.

Like Neu, many young adults with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) struggle to cope with insurance barriers.

The analysis, based on a 2023 Crohn's & Colitis Foundation survey, found that young adults aged 18-25 were more likely than older adults or pediatric patients' caregivers to face step therapy requirements, experience delays in medication access, and struggle navigating insurance barriers. 

Although the analysis included a relatively small number of respondents — 229 young adults among 1781 total respondents — clinicians say the results mirror what they routinely see in practice. 

The study findings were published in January in the journal Crohn's & Colitis 360.

Among young adult respondents, 35% reported being subject to step therapy mandates, compared with 27% of adults and 20% of pediatric caregivers. The same percentage (35%) of young adults said they were “not confident at all” in knowing what questions to ask their insurer when coverage issues arose.

More than two-thirds (69%) of young adults reported difficulty accessing medications due to insurance barriers, compared with 61% of adults and 59% of pediatric caregivers. Approximately 1 in 5 experience delays in receiving a medication of a month or longer, and a similar proportion reported an adverse health event because they had not taken a medication.

Lead author Ross M. Maltz, MD, associate professor of clinical pediatrics at The Ohio State University College of Medicine, Columbus, said it is unclear why young adults are more frequently subject to step therapy. A possible explanation may be insurance transitions, such as aging off a parent's plan. In such cases, a young patient may have been stable on a particular medication for years, only to find the new plan insists on step therapy, Maltz told Medscape Medical News.

With step therapy, insurers usually require that a patient fail one or more less expensive drug therapies, said Laura Wingate, chief education, support, and advocacy officer for the Crohn's & Colitis Foundation. As a consequence, patients are often “receiving suboptimal treatment for an aggressive disease,” Wingate told Medscape Medical News.

The financial toll can be severe for young adults, who may still be in school, not working, or already carrying student loan debt. 

“Trying to dig themselves out of that hole can be extremely challenging,” said Maltz. 

“The survey highlights that this is a particularly vulnerable group of people,” said Frank Scott, MD, associate professor of medicine at the Crohn's and Colitis Center at the University of Colorado, Anschutz School of Medicine, Aurora. “They may have greater issues with regards to financial security,” and less experience with “navigating the process.” 

Delays in access to advanced therapies often lead to increased reliance on steroids to control symptoms in the interim, Scott told Medscape Medical News. Even short-term steroid exposure is associated with weight gain, mood swings, insomnia, fracture risk, infections, and blood clots. 

Scott has also seen patients hospitalized because of worsening symptoms during delays, with some ultimately requiring surgery because they could not access recommended therapy in time.

Scott served as lead author of the latest American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) clinical guidelines on the pharmacological management of moderate-to-severe Crohn's disease, which he noted call for payors to align formularies with the “wealth of evidence” supporting the early use of advanced therapies, primarily biologics.

“We didn't write this guideline to follow insurance rules,” said AGA guideline co-author Siddharth Singh, MD, Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Department of Medicine, Mayo Clinic Arizona, Scottsdale, in a statement that accompanied their release. “Insurance coverage should follow the evidence.” 

Although the growing availability of IL-23 inhibitors and lower-cost biosimilars has expanded treatment options in IBD, insurers continue to erect barriers to their use.

“Step therapy hasn't gone away,” said Wingate. “If anything, it's really become a more entrenched policy,” with a greater focus on the same advanced therapies that “are very effective at getting people into remission and controlling disease.”

Thirty-nine states have enacted some form of protection against step therapy. However, these laws tend to only apply to certain health plans and only in those states. Approximately 60% of non-elderly Americans are covered by the federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) law and not subject to these protections.

Wingate noted that the Crohn's & Colitis Foundation supports federal legislation such as the Safe Step Act, which would codify exceptions to step therapy for ERISA-regulated health plans. The bill has been introduced multiple times over the last decade but has yet to advance in Congress. 

The foundation also advocates for an expedited appeals process for those already stable on a medication. Such a model would ensure that an approval or denial is issued within 24 hours for urgent cases and within 72 hours for non-emergent cases. 

Both Maltz and Scott said their institutions employ resources to help patients challenge step therapy and prior authorization decisions, but that they were likely the exception, not the rule.

At Nationwide Children's Hospital in Columbus, Ohio, where Maltz serves as director of research at the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Center, transition programs help adolescents develop the skills necessary to manage their medical care independently. 

“They know how to navigate, who to contact, and how to be an advocate for themselves,” Maltz said. 

Scott serves on the leadership team for Qorus, the Crohn's & Colitis Foundation's national quality improvement initiative, which provides patient education tools and standardized prior authorization letters to help streamline the process. 

For her part, Neu now advises fellow patients through social media and blogging, encouraging self-advocacy. Yet she emphasized that clinician advocacy is just as critical.

“That is the game changer,” said Neu.

The survey of young adults was funded by the Crohn's & Colitis Foundation. Neu disclosed that she provides consulting services on the patient experience for pharmaceutical companies. Maltz and Scott reported no conflicts.

Edited by Antara Ghosh

Among people with epilepsy, more severe depressive symptoms were linked to greater cognitive burden on the EpiTrack — a validated tool for screening cognitive impairment in epilepsy, and the association persisted after adjusting for frequencies of seizures and interictal epileptiform abnormalities and anti-seizure medication burden.

""Screening for depressive symptoms and cognitive dysfunctions should be strongly recommended for global clinicians caring for PwE [people with epilepsy],"" the authors of the study wrote.

This study was led by Biagio Maria Sancetta, Università Campus Bio-Medico di Roma, Rome, Italy. It was published online on January 28, 2026, in Epilepsia.

The study was limited by the lack of a complete neurocognitive and neuropsychological assessment, potential sample bias due to the high proportion of patients with drug-resistant epilepsy, a heterogeneous sample, and the self-reported nature of the BDI-II scale. Additionally, the cross-sectional design limited generalisability and the ability to draw causal inferences.

The funding source of the study was not explicitly reported. The authors declared having no conflicts of interest.

Genome Canada has launched the genCARE project, which aims to improve health outcomes for Black Canadians by uncovering genetic variants unique to that population. The Black-led project will undertake genome sequencing of more than 10,000 Canadians of African ancestry, focusing on hypertensive disorders, type 2 diabetes, and triple-negative breast cancer. Genome Canada is an independent, federally funded not-for-profit organization.

“For medicine to be precise for our populations, we need to ensure that the genome data relate to those populations,” Upton D. Allen, MBBS, administrative lead of genCARE and professor of pediatrics at the University of Toronto, Toronto, told Medscape News Canada. “We want to enroll a sufficiently large number of people that will allow us to have meaningful conclusions and analyses around three disorders. We will also include individuals with other medical conditions and those who are otherwise completely healthy with no known medical issues.”

The information gleaned from this project could enhance prevention and treatment strategies for Black Canadians who have any of the three chronic conditions of interest. “The issue is how we might get individuals in a position to benefit from the advances brought about by precision medicine,” said Allen.

Participants who self-identify as Black individuals will be recruited over a 4-year period. Blood samples will be acquired for the purposes of sequencing DNA, and socioeconomic and demographic information will be captured through questionnaires, explained Allen. Project leaders and community leaders will collaborate in the recruitment of participants.

“The first part of the project is to increase the diversity of the [genetic] dataset to have better representation of African ancestry,” Loydie A. Jerome-Majewska, PhD, professor of pediatrics and human genetics at McGill University in Montreal, told Medscape News Canada. “Only then can we compare and identify things in individual patients and controls.” Jerome-Majewska is leading the genetic research in Quebec.

In addition to DNA sequencing, the investigators will perform transcriptomic analyses. “For a subset of patients, we are looking at the transcripts that are expressed, which will give us additional insights,” said Jerome-Majewska. The project may permit investigators to identify genes and RNA transcripts that may correlate with phenotype severity among patients with triple-negative breast cancer or patients with preeclampsia during and after pregnancy.

Expanding Canada's genetic data will augment the statistical power in any analysis and have downstream effects in clinical practice. “We try to use all of these [genetic] sequences to make predictions about disease progression or drug efficacy,” said Jerome-Majewska. “If you don't have the sequence of the population that has African ancestry, then you can't make predictions.”

This research will have value in clinical practice, said Marco Marra, PhD, professor of medical genetics at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver. “Such studies are important because there are different disease risks in different populations. Some of those risks have to do with access to the health system or lack thereof, and some of those risks have to do with genetic factors,” said Marra.

Genome sequencing and deeper genetic understanding may lead to discoveries that enhance the treatment of various conditions and inform approaches to prevention, he added. “There's the idea that one would discover a variant or detect a variant with special significance in specific populations, which could be used to improve health and disease management. It could be that a variant may, for example, confer an enhanced risk of cancer or a risk of reacting negatively to a medication.”

Patients who carry a cancer risk variant might be monitored carefully so that if, for example, cancer does develop, it can be caught at an early stage, treated, and cured, explained Marra.

“If a cancer risk variant is found in family members who don't have cancer, it may imply the need for enhanced monitoring in such family members,” said Marra. “It may mean the family members gain access to screening technologies at a higher frequency or undergo other interventions, depending on the disease.”

Without the findings from this project, patients might be managed inappropriately, according to Marra. “There may be a lack of information that could otherwise be used to put them on the right medical path,” he said. “Ensuring we have studied diverse populations will reveal features that are going to bring benefit to the people at risk of serious illnesses.”

Allen, Jerome-Majewska, and Marra reported having no relevant financial relationships.","{'href': 'https://www.medscape.com', 'title': 'Medscape'}","health"

Wambach is first major sports figure to depart agency

Agency founder had emailed with Ghislaine Maxwell

LA Olympics chief has faced calls to step down

Former US soccer star Abby Wambach has announced she is leaving the Wasserman talent agency and called for its founder and LA 2028 Olympics CEO, Casey Wasserman, to resign after emails between him and Ghislaine Maxwell were revealed in the Jeffery Epstein files.

The two-time gold medalist and World Cup winner shared a statement on Wednesday saying she was leaving Wasserman, an agency that represents an extensive roster of athletes and celebrities across the sports and entertainment industries.

Several musical artists, including pop star Chappell Roan, have cut ties with the agency since Wasserman's correspondence was revealed in the files. Wambach is the first figure of note from the sports world to publicly depart.

“I read Casey Wasserman's correspondences in the Epstein files. I know what I know, and I am following my gut and my values,” Wambach wrote on Instagram. “I will not participate in any business arrangement under his leadership. I also need to say this: I'm grateful to my agent, who I've known for almost 20 years and trust.

“Casey should resign. He should leave, so more people like me don't have to. I am unclear of my next steps. That's OK with me, I just know where I can't be.”

This article includes content provided by Instagram. We ask for your permission before anything is loaded, as they may be using cookies and other technologies. To view this content, click 'Allow and continue'.

Wambach had been represented by Wasserman for at least 15 years. She retired from professional soccer in 2015 after a 15-year career during which she scored 184 international goals, the second most all-time. She has since written two books and hosts a podcast with her wife, Glennon Doyle.

Documents released last month by the US government included flirtatious email exchanges between Wasserman and Maxwell in 2003.

Wasserman, who is also chair of the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics organising committee, released an apology on 31 January, saying: “I deeply regret my correspondence with Ghislaine Maxwell,” which he said occurred “long before her horrific crimes came to light”.

“I never had a personal or business relationship with Jeffrey Epstein. As is well documented, I went on a humanitarian trip as part of a delegation with the Clinton Foundation in 2002 on the Epstein plane. I am terribly sorry for having any association with either of them,” he said.

Maxwell was charged with conspiring with Epstein to sexually abuse teenage girls and was convicted in 2021 on five counts of sex trafficking and abuse of minors. She is serving a 20-year prison sentence. Epstein's death in a New York jail cell in 2019 was ruled a suicide and came a month after he was indicted on federal sex-trafficking charges.

Wasserman has not been accused of criminal wrongdoing by any of Epstein's victims, but he has faced calls to step down from his CEO post at the agency and as LA Olympics chair.

The Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday that the LA 2028 organizing committee had called a meeting to address Wasserman's status as chair.

Wasserman's website says its soccer clientele includes US women's national team stars Mallory Swanson, Sophia Wilson and Naomi Girma, along with the now-retired Alex Morgan. On the men's side, its roster includes US star Weston McKennie, Real Madrid's Fede Valverde and Liverpool legend Jamie Carragher.

The agency also represents top players in the NFL, NBA, WNBA and MLB, along with actors such as Brad Pitt and Adam Sandler.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","soccer"

Mauricio Pochettino has revealed that he told Donald Trump the U.S. men's national team can win the World Cup on home soil this summer.

The USMNT head coach and U.S. president crossed paths in December at the World Cup draw in Washington, D.C.

Pochettino recounted the meeting during an appearance on the High Performance Podcast.

""At the draw of the World Cup, I met Donald Trump for a few minutes. He asked me: ‘What do you think, coach. Can you win the World Cup?'

“I said, ‘Of course, Mr. President.' Because it's the USA. The American dream is there. The American culture is about being first, being number one. When we accepted the challenge to go there it's because we really believe that we can win. 

""After a year and a half working there, people start to feel that we can win. The last few camps in October and November, we competed against very good teams and we started to show that possibility to perform well.""

He added: ""We are going to have the support of a massive country and all its fans. To try and push us to run, score goals, and make tackles. I think that will be a massive boost for us.""

The USMNT had an excellent end to 2025, winning four of its last five matches including a 5-1 thrashing of Uruguay in its last game of the year.

Pochettino's side has been drawn into Group D alongside Australia, Paraguay and a European team yet to be determined.

Should it advance, the U.S. would move onto the knockout stage where it would have to win five consecutive matches to take home the World Cup.

In its entire history, the USMNT has won just one World Cup knockout match.

Pochettino's right-hand man, assistant coach Jesus Perez, also appeared on the podcast and said that the team lacked ""basics"" when the pair took over in the fall of 2024.

""We found that there was a lack of basics for whatever reason,"" Perez said. ""They (the USMNT) were in a transition. 

""What we did was assess things and implement our vision. We didn't go there to teach anyone, to show them how to do things. Just to convince a group of players and staff that we can be competitive.""","{'href': 'https://www.usatoday.com', 'title': 'USA Today'}","soccer"

World Cup

Group L

 Bradley Collyer - PA Images

England will prepare for this summer's World Cup with friendly games against New Zealand and Costa Rica in south Florida, the Football Association has announced.

Thomas Tuchel's side will face New Zealand on Saturday, June 6 and Costa Rica on Wednesday, June 10 – the latter a week before their opening game of the tournament against Croatia in Arlington, Texas on June 17.

The venues for both friendlies are yet to be announced but they promise to give England a flavour of the heat which is likely to be a fixture of the tournament, and their supporters a chance to earn loyalty points (or ‘caps') which may help them to secure tickets for coveted knockout games if their side progresses to the latter stages.

England will also play Ghana and Panama in Boston and New Jersey respectively in Group L, and could face potentially gruelling showdowns with Brazil, Argentina and Spain in the knockouts if they top their group.

New Zealand, who are set to appear at a third men's World Cup, will face Iran, Egypt and Belgium in Group G but Costa Rica narrowly missed out on qualifying for a seventh men's finals.

Tuchel's squad will be based at the Swope Soccer Village – one of Sporting Kansas City's training complexes – in Kansas City, Missouri for the duration of the tournament.

The German's side, who will be among the favourites for the tournament despite not winning the World Cup since 1966, will play their final fixtures on home soil against Uruguay and Japan next month, having comfortably topped their qualification group with a 100 per cent record.

England reached the quarter-finals of the last World Cup in Qatar in 2022, narrowly losing to eventual runners-up France, and were beaten semi-finalists in Russia in 2018.

Andriy Shevchenko, president of the Ukrainian Association of Football (UAF) and former footballer, is hoping to meet Gianni Infantino at UEFA's Congress in Brussels.

This comes after the FIFA president spoke out against banning Russia and Israel from international football earlier this month. Shevchenko is hoping now to speak to Infantino to convey “information about the war in Ukraine and our position”.

In 2022, both FIFA, the world football governing body, and its European counterpart UEFA banned the Russian national team from competing after the country invaded Ukraine. But in an hour-long interview with Sky News on February 2, Infantino claimed Russia's ban “has not achieved anything” and revealed he will be looking at removing the ban, as well as possibly changing FIFA's statutes to prevent similar sanctions in the future.

“We have to,” Infantino responded when asked, by Yalda Hakim, host of The World on Sky News, whether he is going to explore lifting the ban.

“Definitely. Because this ban has not achieved anything, it has just created more frustration and hatred.”

On the possibility of changing the governing body's statutes to stop national teams being banned, Infantino went further and said they “should actually never ban any country from playing football because of the acts of their political leaders”.

“It's a good sign,” Alexei Sorokin, the Russian FA's representative, told reporters in Brussels, Belgium, when asked for his response to Infantino's comments. “(At) least we took it that way.”

However, Infantino received widespread condemnation for his views, particularly from Ukraine, with the UAF releasing a statement hours later opposing the 55-year-old's suggestion.

“We do not agree with the claim that the ban against the aggressor is ineffective,” the UAF's statement read. “We believe that exclusion from participation in competitions is an effective method of pressure on the aggressor.

“The potential reintegration of any Russian national teams poses a threat to the safety and integrity of competitions.”

At a press conference in Ukraine on Monday, Shevchenko said: “The UAF responded immediately to Infantino's comment. You all saw our statement. We clearly stated our position, which has not changed: while the war continues we are adamantly opposed to Russians returning to football.

“Over these days there has been communication with FIFA representatives at different levels.

“At the moment, the FIFA Council is not considering the return of Russians. I am planning a meeting with Gianni Infantino to once again convey, in concrete terms, information about the war in Ukraine and our position.

“Colleagues from different associations support us. While this support remains with us and is united, the return of Russians to competitions is not being considered.”

And now Shevchenko, who is in Brussels for the UEFA Congress on Thursday, is hoping to meet Infantino in person at the event to discuss the matter.

Andrii Sybiha, Ukraine's foreign affairs minister, described Infantino as a “moral degenerate” following his comments on Russia.

“679 Ukrainian girls and boys will never be able to play football — Russia killed them,” Sybiha posted on social media.

“And it keeps killing more while moral degenerates suggest lifting bans, despite Russia's failure to end its war. Future generations will view this as a shame reminiscent of the 1936 Olympics.”

The UAF has opened its doors in Kyiv to help colleagues who are left without electricity or heating and has also set up a space for children to visit. Employees without electricity, heating or warm water have also been able to stay overnight, as well as being able to shower in the changing rooms.

The to-do list is still long — plus there's a new wrinkle thrown in by the Town of Foxborough to smooth — but local organizers of this summer's World Cup crossed off a big one on Tuesday.

The official FanFest site will be Boston City Hall Plaza, near where a host of public officials gathered to announce the selection of the long-suspected location.

“Today, the city, our partners at the state, and Boston 26 are thrilled to announce that our official FIFA World Cup fan festival will be held right in the heart of our city, right outside the most beautiful building in the city, on City Hall Plaza,” said Mayor Michelle Wu. “We renovated City Hall Plaza just a few years back, precisely so that it could be the gathering space that has been needed. We look forward to hosting many, many large community events, but this one will truly be special. Thousands of residents and visitors will gather to cheer on their teams downtown, bringing energy, economic investment, and a global spotlight to our businesses and communities.”

Other, less-extensive fan celebration sites around the city and state are planned.

FEATURED VIDEO

Wu, Governor Maura Healey, House Ways and Means committee chair Aaron Michlewitz, Meet Boston president Martha Sheridan, and Boston 26 host committee CEO Mike Loynd were on hand for the announcement, along with Lieutenant Governor Kim Driscoll, six city councilors, and a bevy of other city officials.

FanFest is a FIFA-mandated event held in each of the 16 North American cities hosting the 104 games from mid-June to mid-July. The idea behind FanFest in part is for it to serve as a public gathering space for fans to watch games on giant videoboards with an array of food, beverages, and entertainment to fill in any downtime.

With tickets to the seven games being played at Foxborough's Gillette Stadium scarce and expensive, the site also allows tourists and locals shut out from a firsthand experience to gain a communal one.

Other cities revealed plans, some elaborate, months ago.

Boston 26 has been trying to nail down details of the main FanFest, delayed by receiving only $10 million of the $20 million it is seeking in state funding to help, in part, with FanFest costs.

The speakers Tuesday were in front of a colorful and detailed rendering of what the FanFest could look like on the plaza, with throngs milling about a well-lit panoply of tents, tables, playspace, stages, and screens.

Asked if the FanFest can be executed to the fullest extent by organizers without a guarantee of the extra $10 million, Loynd said that it was too soon to say.

“That's what this month will tell us. I can't guarantee you, for example, this hospitality area will be exactly like that,” said Loynd, gesturing to the screen behind him. “It's not only funding, it's timing to get all the visuals properly done.”

Michlewitz said members of the Legislature are working toward “making sure that we put some more money into this.

“Obviously, this thing is going to cost money, so we have a lot of work to do, we still have a lot of stuff that we have to iron out. We're going to get there, we're going to make it work.”

Charging admission is not ruled out, but Loynd said free admission is the aim.

“No, we're really determined to make it free at this point,” said Loynd. “We do have to fund it, but our goal is to make this a free experience.”

It's still unclear how many days the festival will be held.

Last week, the specter of no games at all being played in Foxborough was raised by that town's select board.

Unless the town is paid upfront the $7 million-plus it needs for enhanced security needs, it said it will withhold granting the entertainment license FIFA needs to stage the games at Gillette.

Loynd expressed optimism that the commotion will subside.

“We've been in detailed conversations with FIFA and the stadium on this, and I think we'll come to a very good conclusion,” said Loynd, who said he was on the telephone with Foxborough officials Monday night. “This licensing process is always difficult. The stadium has been doing it for many years, so it's nice and easy, but this one's not so easy, [there's] a bunch of complicated issues we're facing. The answer is: I'm comfortable that we'll be there. We have a meeting in another week with them, in a select board meeting, where we anticipate almost all of the details being wrapped up.”

Healey agreed.

“I think all this is going to get worked out and covered,” she said. “We have every interest in making sure that we have a tremendous event here in Massachusetts and down in Foxborough, and I know that the state is working closely with local officials.

“This is a big production, make no mistake about it. It's the equivalent of seven Super Bowls in a very short period of time. So there's a lot of work and a lot of planning that's already gone on into security and safety and transportation, and I'm confident that all the parties can work out what they need to with the town of Foxborough, and that everything will go forward.”

Victoria Mboko saved match point in an all-teenage Qatar TotalEnergies Open third round to score her first win over Mirra Andreeva, reversing the result of the Adelaide final to advance to her second WTA 1000 quarterfinal.

The rivalry is on.

The two leading teenagers in the world faced off for the second time this season in the Qatar TotalEnergies Open third round, and this time it was a classic. No. 10 seed Victoria Mboko reversed the result of January's Adelaide final to defeat No. 5 seed Mirra Andreeva 6-3, 3-6, 7-6(5) in 2 hours and 10 minutes for the first time. Andreeva held one match point at 5-4 in the third set, but squandered it with a double fault.

Doha: Scores | Draws | Order of play

The result was 19-year-old Mboko's third career Top 10 win, and she advances to her second career WTA 1000 quarterfinal following her surprise run to last year's Montreal title. She also becomes the second player this year to win from match point down twice, joining Magdalena Frech -- Mboko also saved two match points against Anna Kalinskaya in the Adelaide second round, winning that contest 6-2, 3-6, 7-6(6).

Mboko has now won 13 of her past 14 three-set matches since the final round of Wimbledon qualifying last year, where she missed five match points and fell to Priscilla Hon 4-6, 7-6(4), 6-1. Following that tournament, her only loss in a deciding set has come against Elise Mertens at the United Cup in January. She'll face either No. 2 seed Elena Rybakina or Zheng Qinwen next in Doha.

Here's how a riveting contest played out in each set.

Tennis-wise, the story of the first set was Mboko's superior aggression. Keeping her point construction simple but effective, she slammed the ball from side to side with both power and consistency. Throughout the opener, the Canadian tallied 15 winners, including five aces, to Andreeva's five.

She also won a significant mental battle to claim the set. In the Adelaide final, Mboko had made a quick start with a 3-0 lead -- only for Andreeva to win 12 of the next 13 games to take the title. Once again, she leapt out to 3-0, but found herself pegged back to 3-3 as Andreeva began mixing up her play.

But this time, Mboko halted her opponent's momentum. At 3-3, she staved off two break points and found two consecutive forehand winners to escape with the crucial hold.

Andreeva had enjoyed limited success by deploying slices and drop shots in the first set, but in the second she began to throw the kitchen sink at Mboko. She saved four break points for an important hold in the opening game, the fourth of those with a drop shot-pass combination. In the very next game, she came up with a brilliant point construction -- two moonballs, followed by a double-handed drop shot from above shoulder height and then a winning lob -- en route to breaking.

Slowing the pace of the rallies and breaking up Mboko's rhythm paid dividends. Boxed in by Andreeva's variety, Mboko's ability to find openings was limited -- and though she was only drawn into 11 unforced errors in the second set, her winner count was reduced to eight. It was still hard-fought to the end -- this time, it was Mboko who levelled at 3-3 before Andreeva pulled away at the end of the set -- but it was the 18-year-old who had dragged the match back on to her terms.

Appropriately, the third set saw the highest level of tennis from both teenagers at the same time. The early stages saw a series of magnificent exchanges as they tried to out-manoeuvre each other, with Andreeva capturing the first break for 2-1 but immediately getting pegged back. Perhaps most impressively, Mboko rose to the challenge of Andreeva's variety, sending it back with creativity of her own and patiently going toe-to-toe in the extended rallies.

""I didn't really have a specific tactic against her,"" Mboko explained afterwards. ""But I know she slices really well, and she hits really low. I think she forced me to hit those [slices and spins]. She covers the court really well, so I think for me it was just trying to find the little window to open the court. Yeah, I just found myself hitting those kinds of shots because that's all I felt I could do.""

As the set reached its climax, the tennis became edgier. At 4-4, Mboko coughed up a pair of double faults to concede her serve -- only for Andreeva to repay the favor in the next game, missing a match point with a double fault of her own. But the quality returned in the deciding tiebreak, which saw five points decided by clean winners. The best of those proved decisive: an angled backhand pass on the run by Mboko which gave a her a 5-3 lead, the first time in the tiebreak that one player had a two-point advantage over the other.

Though Mboko's backhand let her down on her first two match points, she continued to trust in that shot -- and closed out her third match point with an inside-out winner from that wing, her 38th of the day.

""I feel like I came out with some very clutch shots at the end,"" said Mboko. ""I think we both were pretty tired when it came to the tiebreak. I think I felt like I was lucky enough to have some good shots in the great moments.""

Victoria Mboko saved match point in an all-teenage Qatar TotalEnergies Open third round to score her first win over Mirra Andreeva, reversing the result of the Adelaide final to advance to her second WTA 1000 quarterfinal.","{'href': 'https://www.wtatennis.com', 'title': 'WTA Tennis'}","tennis"

F1 Bahrain Testing 2026: Day 1 Highlights

Colapinto: 'Personal priority is to get a lot of mileage'

Red Bull Team Principal Laurent Mekies has elaborated on why they chose Isack Hadjar to partner Max Verstappen for the 2026 season.

Laurent Mekies is adamant that Isack Hadjar's potential is ""mega"", with the Red Bull Team Principal heaping praise on the youngster's “maximum intensity” approach to his pre-season training.

It was announced ahead of last season's finale that Hadjar would partner four-time World Champion Max Verstappen at the senior Red Bull team for 2026, replacing Yuki Tsunoda who has stepped back into a reserve driver role. At sister team Racing Bulls – where Hadjar originally caught the eye – lone rookie Arvid Lindblad will join forces with Liam Lawson.

The second seat at the team has presented a unique challenge since Verstappen became their lead driver, with both Lawson and Tsunoda struggling to match his performances in 2025 in their time alongside him as team mate.

Prior to last year, the likes of Sergio Perez, Alex Albon and Pierre Gasly also failed to live up to the Dutchman's performance levels in the second Red Bull car.

However, the Milton Keynes-based squad are hopeful that Hadjar will be able to deliver, especially with the major change in regulations for 2026 that will see an overhaul in the power units and aerodynamics of the car.

Asked how the team will protect Hadjar from the scrutiny of performing alongside Verstappen at the recent Autosport Business Exchange, Mekies said: ""We are not hiding behind the fact that we need to do a better job with that second car, and that includes the second part of last year.

""Yes, we made some progress with Yuki, but not at the level that we felt we should have reached, so we are aware that we need to do a better job there. There is no easy solution. It's a complex equation that we approach as such. Now, I think Isack comes with incredible raw speed.

“We think the level at which he started last year, his starting speed was outstanding – at the level of the very best. But then we equally believe that the big guys, the champions – not only do they have an incredible starting point, but they progress.

“It's not only progressing with maturity or with your dialogues with the engineers, they actually go faster. We have seen that with Isack last year at Racing Bulls, so we are convinced that the potential is mega.”

After a rough start saw him crash on the formation lap at the Australian Grand Prix, the Frenchman quickly found his rhythm, achieving a podium at Zandvoort and becoming a regular in Q3.

That momentum could prove to be crucial this season as all 22 drivers must adapt to the new cars as fast as possible – something which Mekies is confident Hadjar's pre-season routines will help with.

""I guess in some respects, the fact that everything's changed in 2026, he's also been given a reset about how you go about extracting as much as you can from the car,” the Team Principal said.

""He has been taking it from day one with maximum intensity. He has moved to London. He's on the sim as we speak and is there quite a few days each week.

“He's fully aware of the challenge. He has his feet on the ground. He's a very humble guy, and we are going to support him 360 [degrees] to make sure that he can express his talent in that car.""

F1 Bahrain Testing 2026: Day 1 Highlights

Colapinto: 'Personal priority is to get a lot of mileage'

Whether you want to plan a full-throttle day out or something a little more low-key, Valentine's Day is the perfect excuse to celebrate your shared love of Formula 1 with your friends or significant other. From race-inspired nights in, to unforgettable experiences further afield, here are some F1-themed date ideas to help you celebrate.

Valentine's Day is on the horizon, and you might be wondering how to spend the day of love. Now, this doesn't have to mean candlelit dinners and soppy playlists – especially if Formula 1 plays a big part in your relationship!

Whether you bonded over cancelling Sunday plans for race day, have heated strategy debates or even argue about your favourite circuits, there are plenty of ways to put a little (or large!) F1 spin on the most romantic day of the year.

If staying in feels more your style, there are plenty of options for something a little more intimate:

Have a Grand Prix-inspired night in

The premise is simple: pick one of your favourite race weekends and build your evening around it! Start off with a Grand Prix-inspired menu – whether it be an Italian night for Monza or Imola, tacos and margaritas for Mexico, or an Australian-inspired spread to mark the pending season opener in Melbourne. Pair it with a themed cocktail or mocktail (a Singapore Sling would go down a treat!) and suddenly dinner transports you straight to the circuit.

Once you've plated up, pull up highlights from Grands Prix gone by – the races that made you fall in love with that circuit in the first place – then settle in and enjoy.

Front row seats on the sofa

Thankfully, sometimes the best date night doesn't even need a reservation. Grab some popcorn, dim the lights and settle in for a movie night. Whether it's F1 The Movie (Apple TV), Rush (Netflix), Senna (Netflix), or one of the many documentaries on the sport, it's an easy win for a relaxed and cosy evening in. Front-row seats and full control of the rewind button – what more could you want?

Get crafting!

If you're feeling crafty and after a Valentine's date idea that's low-pressure but still super meaningful, making F1-inspired beaded bracelets is always a winner. Settle in with some snacks, and pick your favourite drivers' names or numbers, team colours, or even some iconic meme quotes to adorn your accessory! Whether you end up swapping bracelets at the end of the night or end up keeping them as good-luck charms for the season ahead, it's a low key but wholesome evening.

If you or your partner fancies yourselves a budding engineer, why not fuel that passion by spending the evening crafting your favourite teams' F1 car... in LEGO of course! Every team is represented, and sets range from quick builds to something a little more time consuming – so there's something to suit every skill level. Put some music on, pour a drink, and see which of you has the patience and precision of a race engineer!

If you're up for getting out and doing something a little different, here are some ways to spend the evening out together:

Lights out at F1 Arcade

If you're both missing F1 (and let's face it, who isn't?), the F1 Arcade makes for a really fun Valentine's date. With F1 Arcades in London, Birmingham, Boston, Atlanta, Washington, Philadelphia, Denver and Las Vegas it is the perfect way to get a mid-winter motorsport fix.

Jump into the simulators, have a laugh comparing lap times, then slow things down a little with good food, cocktails and music once the racing's done. Race as much or as little as you want – but a little competition never hurt anyone!

Karting date

If you are a competitive couple, then how better to celebrate Valentines Day than going up against each other on track? Going karting is a great option to fuel your love for adrenaline... or perhaps even to settle any disagreements you may have!

If you head to F1 DRIVE in London, then there's also the option for dinner and drinks to enjoy post-chequered flag. Perhaps buying the drinks or letting the winner choose the playlist on the way home is a suitable forfeit for the runner-up?

If you're thinking of something bigger than a single night, there are plenty of ways to make Valentine's Day feel unforgettable...

Book a table at Ristorante Cavallino

If you're the kind of couple who loves a romantic getaway, then we reckon this one could be hard to beat. A table at Ristorante Cavallino in Maranello sits right next to Ferrari's base, and that alone gives the evening a sense of occasion, not just for the Tifosi, but any motorsport fan.

While it might be hard to justify a trip away for a single meal, this works perfectly as part of a bigger romantic trip. Jet off to Italy, soak up the country's deep-rooted love for motorsport and turn the dinner into one stop on a longer adventure. With Florence, Venice and Bologna all within reach, it's easy to imagine this becoming the start of a memorable Italian road trip!

Prep a Las Vegas Grand Prix wedding

Though slightly unconventional, an F1-themed wedding doesn't get more on-brand than saying “I do” at the Las Vegas Grand Prix over race weekend!

The bright pink chapel has become a staple of the paddock in recent years, with plenty of F1-obsessed couples tying the knot – often with an Elvis impersonator conducting the ceremony (this is Las Vegas after all). While some decide to get married on impulse during the weekend itself, others plan the whole trip around their wedding, making it a perfect Valentine's Day idea to start plotting together.

And who knows... maybe a rogue F1 driver will even pop up to officiate your ceremony (we're looking at you Valtteri Bottas!)

Plan a race weekend together

There's nothing that says “I'm committed” than making future plans and having things to look forward to together. Planning a race weekend turns the day into the start of an adventure rather than just a one-off date. Picking a Grand Prix that you are both itching to attend and imagining yourselves trackside gets the excitement levels rising after a few months without racing.

It doesn't have to be complicated or stressful – you can chat about which races you'd love to go to, which corner you'd like to watch the race from, perhaps plan the travel, or even pick your team colours and outfits for the weekend. Simply dreaming together about the trip and the fun you'll have on race day can be a Valentine's activity in itself.

F1 Bahrain Testing 2026: Day 1 Highlights

Colapinto: 'Personal priority is to get a lot of mileage'

Lewis Hamilton has shared further details on his current situation following the departure of his former Ferrari race engineer Riccardo Adami.

Lewis Hamilton has opened up on the “difficult decision” to part ways with former race engineer Riccardo Adami, with the seven-time World Champion suggesting that not yet having a permanent replacement could be “detrimental” for him.

Following Hamilton's first season at Ferrari it was confirmed that Adami would move to a role within the team's academy, meaning that Hamilton will work with a new race engineer.

Carlo Santi – who formerly worked with Kimi Raikkonen during the Finn's time with the Scuderia and was active at the remote garage – has since replaced Adami in the role but Hamilton has indicated that this may only be an interim measure.

Whilst speaking to media including F1.com during official pre-season testing in Bahrain, Hamilton was asked how the changes that had been made to his team over the winter were unfolding and whether he would have preferred to have a permanent race engineer in place before the season.

“Firstly, with Riccardo it was a pretty difficult decision to make, and I'm really, really grateful for all the effort he put in last year, and his patience – it was a difficult year for us all,” the 41-year-old explained.

“It's actually quite a difficult era, because it's not long-term, the solution that I currently have – it's only a few races, and so early on into the season it's going to all be switching up again and I'll have to learn to work with someone new.

“So that's detrimental for me too, [going into] a season where you want to arrive with people that have done multiple seasons, that have been through thick and thin, and I can't.

“But it is the situation that I'm faced with, and I'll try and do the best that I can. The team is trying to do the best they can to make it as seamless as possible.”

Following the two official pre-season tests in Bahrain – held across February 11-13 and February 18-20 – the first race of the campaign, the Australian Grand Prix, takes place on March 6-8.

F1 Bahrain Testing 2026: Day 1 Highlights

Colapinto: 'Personal priority is to get a lot of mileage'

Max Verstappen and Red Bull caught Toto Wolff's eye as pre-season testing got under way for 2026.

Toto Wolff made clear that Mercedes “have to get our act together” as pre-season testing develops at the Bahrain International Circuit, after taking note of a “very, very strong” Max Verstappen and Red Bull.

Mercedes made a smooth, productive start to 2026 and F1's all-new era of regulations at the recent Barcelona Shakedown, where drivers George Russell and Kimi Antonelli racked up plenty of laps aboard the team's W17 challenger.

However, when the F1 paddock reconvened in Sakhir for the first official pre-season test, Wolff turned the focus away from the Silver Arrows and onto the competition – in particular talking up Red Bull and their all-new power unit.

While he noted that “everything goes according to the plan” for Mercedes so far, Wolff continued: “It isn't smooth sailing. We have complications on the car balance, which are a little bit more articulated here than they were in Barcelona, obviously due to the hot conditions.

“We've seen a very, very strong Verstappen, so we have to get our act together, all of us, and then maybe by the end of the test we will understand more whether what we've done is good or good enough.”

Pushed on how impressed he has been by Red Bull, with Verstappen topping the first morning of the Bahrain test, Wolff joked: “Well, I was hoping that they were worse than they are!

“They've done a very good job. The car, the power unit, are the benchmark at the moment, I would say. Then, obviously, you have Max in the car. That combination is strong.”

Wolff also took a moment to give Mercedes' stance on the compression ratio chatter – and a perceived advantage his power unit division have been able to find – doing the rounds in the paddock ahead of the new season.

“I think how this whole thing has come about is blown out of proportion,” he said. “If our competitors would know how little difference it makes, the standpoint would be a little bit silly to give it so much importance.

“But this is F1, how it's always been, there's political lobbying, trying to influence how the regulations are made, and that's okay.”

Mercedes and the rest of the F1 field will be back in action when testing resumes in Bahrain on Thursday morning.

F1 Bahrain Testing 2026: Day 1 Highlights

Colapinto: 'Personal priority is to get a lot of mileage'

Red Bull's latest F1 show run in the United States will include an outing from Yuki Tsunoda.

Red Bull test and reserve driver Yuki Tsunoda will return to the cockpit of a Formula 1 car later this month when he takes part in a special demonstration event in America.

Tsunoda, who lost his full-time F1 seat at the end of last season, is set to appear at a show run on the streets of San Francisco – backed by Red Bull partner Ford – on February 21.

Also on the list of attendees are former F1 driver Scott Speed, who will drive a Racing Bulls machine around Marina Boulevard, as well as Ford off-road star Mitch Guthrie and freestyle motorcross rider Aaron Colton.

“I can't wait to get back behind the wheel of an F1 car, and to do that in [the] RB7 in San Francisco will be amazing,” said Tsunoda, referring to Red Bull's double title-winning 2011 design.

“I'm really looking forward to getting out there, doing some donuts and making some real F1 noise in front of the crowds.”

Tsunoda will be on standby for both Red Bull and Racing Bulls through the upcoming F1 campaign, should either team require a substitute driver – as well as providing support off the track.

The 25-year-old Japanese racer started his career with AlphaTauri (now known as Racing Bulls) back in 2021, spending just over four seasons there before earning a promotion to Red Bull.

However, he followed a long list of drivers who struggled to make an impression alongside Max Verstappen and was dropped from the team's racing line-up for 2026.

The singer also flipped off ""the haters and the trolls"" who accused him of faking his vocals.


													By
												

	Hannah Dailey



Kid Rock is clarifying a few key details about Turning Point's “All-American Halftime Show” after some people accused him of lip-synching during the program held on Super Bowl Sunday.


	In a video posted to Instagram on Tuesday (Feb. 10) — two days after the inaugural event was broadcasted between halves of the Big Game — the musician denied using a pre-recorded track to fake his vocals, but confirmed that his performance was pre-taped rather than aired live. According to him, the confusion was caused by editors in post-production not quite lining up the audio of his performance of rapid-fire track “Bawitdaba” to the video, making it look like he was lip-synching.

	











	“If I was ever going to lip-synch, which I wouldn't, that would be the last song I would ever … do it to,” Kid Rock explained in the clip, in which he stands next to his DJ, Paradime, who performed with him for Turning Point. “We've performed this song every night on tour since 1998.”


	“It's extremely difficult for them to line up the sync,” Kid Rock conceded, noting he feels “confident” it would have come together perfectly if the editors had been given more time. “That song takes so much energy. I'm flipping mics, I'm jumping around like a rabid monkey on stage … I have nothing but good things to say not only about Turning Point, but the production team that they work with. Nobody's perfect or gets it right every time.” 

	











	“For the haters and the trolls out there …,” he added before flipping off the camera.


	Also in the video, Kid Rock and Paradime demonstrated how tricky “Bawitdaba” is to perform live, with the DJ needing to fill in some lines for the hip-hop/country star so he can take enough breaths in between bars. Nevertheless, Kid Rock says he executed it live while pre-filming the Turning Point show and blamed “fake news media” for spreading misinformation about him lip-synching.


	“The problem is people amplify this all over the internet … they did it to Bad Bunny, in his defense,” he said in the clip, referencing how some people took it seriously when Benito joked on Saturday Night Live that everyone had “four months to learn” Spanish before his Super Bowl Halftime Show. “They do it far too often, especially in the fake news media, the left-wingers, crazy libt–ds.”


	Kid Rock was just one of several artists on the bill for the “All-American Halftime Show,” which Turning Point hosted for the first time ever to counterprogram against Bad Bunny's official NFL halftime show (which, for comparison, was performed live on the field at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, Calif., on Feb. 8). Brantley Gilbert, Lee Brice and Gabby Barrett also shared the Turning Point USA stage for the alternate mid-game concert, which drew in about 6.1 million concurrent live viewers.

Senior Managing Editor


	“It's come to my attention that I've just lost the ability to captivate. It's like my husband, my students even my daughter, my entire personhood…useless.” So says Rachel Weisz in the opening of the first trailer for Vladimir, Netflix‘s upcoming limited series adaptation based on Julia May Jonas' novel.


	Enter Vladimir, played by Leo Woodall, who suddenly turns Weisz's middle-aged obsessive college professor's life upside down.


	Per the series logline, “When a passionate but reckless professor's world begins to unravel, she finds herself dangerously fixated on her magnetic new colleague. As boundaries blur and secrets simmer, she'll risk everything to bring her most scandalous fantasies to life.”

	











	At one point in the trailer, Woodall reveals to a clearly enamored Weisz that he “has a thing for crazy girls.” The connection gets stronger and stronger until they're eventually entwined in a steamy affair, but what is real and what is imagined? Weisz reaches out to touch Woodall, saying “Sorry, I just wanted to be sure you were here in the flesh.” “As opposed to what?” asks Woodall, to which Weisz replies, “Oh, in my dreams.”




			Watch on Deadline		







	In addition to Weisz and Woodall, series regular cast includes John Slattery, Ellen Robertson and Jessica Henwick. Cast also includes Matt Walsh, Kayli Carter, Miriam Silverman, Mallori Johnson, Tattiawna Jones and Louise Lambert.


	The eight-episode series is written, created and executive produced by Jones. Weisz also executive produces alongside Sharon Horgan, Stacy Greenberg and Kira Carstensen (Merman), Jason Winer & Jon Radler (Small Dog Picture Company), Shari Springer Berman and Robert Pulcini.

	Directors include Berman and Pulcini (101, 102), Francesca Gregorini (103, 106, 107) and Josephine Bornebusch (104, 105).


	20th Television is the studio.


Vladimir premieres March 5 on Netflix.

Disney has been censured by the UK's Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) for running a digital Predator: Badlands ad featuring a severed body.


	The Mouse House has been banned from running the ad in its current form after the ASA ruled that it was likely to “cause fear or distress for young children.”


	The digital video poster went live in November, featuring Dimitrius Schuster-Koloamatangi's character Dek holding aloft a smaller, human figure, which had been severed in two.


	The still was followed by other shots of the Predator character alongside the words: “Welcome to a world of hurt.” The ASA said it received two complaints about the ad from people who were concerned it was “inappropriate and disturbing” for children.

	In correspondence with the UK advertising regulator, Disney defended the digital poster, arguing that it had prepared the ad with a “sense of responsibility.”

	The company said the severed body was that of a “synth,” or robot, and was not human. Disney added that the image appeared for less than two seconds within a 10-second trailer, and was commensurate with a film of its rating and nature.


	The ASA said: “Whilst we acknowledged Twentieth Century Studio's comment that the smaller figure was not actually a human, but rather a ‘synth' robot, we considered that was not clear from the ad, and that the figure was likely to be interpreted as a human. 


	“We further considered that the realistic depiction of the smaller figure's severed torso and exposed spine was gory and likely to be disturbing to younger children.”

	











	A Disney spokesperson said: “We acknowledge the ASA's ruling. We take our responsibilities to audiences very seriously and strive to work closely with partners to meet the required standards.”

It's a robot!

Those censors know that Predatpr isn't for kids, right?

Right. Where did they run this ad? Was it during kids' programming?

Also, Badlands was SO good!

Another bitcoin demand has been sent regarding Nancy Guthrie's kidnapping — this time, in exchange for information on her purported abductor.

The individual sent a note to TMZ Wednesday morning after allegedly unsuccessful attempts to reach the missing 84-year-old's children — Savannah Guthrie, Annie Guthrie and Camron Guthrie.

“If they want the name of the individual involved then I want 1 Bitcoin to the following wallet,” the message read, according to the outlet.

One bitcoin is currently the equivalent of nearly $67,000, per Crypto.com.

“Time is more than relevant,” the note, which has since been forwarded to the FBI, continued.

The legitimacy of the new message has yet to be verified.

The bitcoin address associated with the new message is different from the one in previous ransom notes sent to local Tucson, Ariz., news stations.

The original messages requested $6 million — and a deposit of approximately $152 worth of bitcoin was made into that account Tuesday.

Three days prior, Savannah and her siblings told the alleged kidnapper in an emotional Instagram video that they “will pay.”

The trio explained, “We beg you now to return our mother to us, so that we can celebrate with her. This is the only way we will have peace. This is very valuable to us.”

The “Today” show co-anchor, Annie and Camron have been begging the public for help in identifying the person, with the FBI offering a $50,000 reward last week.

On Tuesday, they released the first photos and videos of the alleged criminal approaching Nancy's front door while armed and masked.

“Someone out there recognizes this person,” Savannah subsequently wrote via Instagram. “We believe she is still out there. Bring her home.”

Her husband, Michael Feldman, did the same, writing, “Please help us.”

Nancy was last seen at her home the evening of Jan. 31, and the matriarch was declared missing the following day.

From the bayou to the Big Apple.

Lana Del Rey and husband Jeremy Dufrene enjoyed a date night at the Ralph Lauren fall 2026 fashion show at NYC's Jack Shainman Gallery Tuesday evening, dressed in matching distressed leather jackets from the all-American fashion label.

The “Summertime Sadness” songstress paired her archival blazer with a romantic ruffled top, bias-cut embroidered skirt, cowboy boots and cascading curls, while her swamp-tour-guide spouse teamed his worn-in jacket with dark denim, wraparound sunglasses and a Double RL trucker hat.

We spied the usually-private duo posing for plenty of photos together on the step-and-repeat, even sharing a sweet kiss for the cameras before heading to their seats. Post-show, they stuck around to chat with fellow showgoers and well-wishers.

They weren't the only famous couple in Ralph's front row; Anne Hathaway brought along husband Adam Shulman, while Rebecca Hall was joined by spouse Morgan Spector. Other celebs in attendance included Lili Reinhart, Ariana DeBose, Emilia Jones and Diana Silvers.

After meeting in 2019 during one of the airboat captain's popular alligator tours, Del Rey and Dufrene married in an intimate waterfront ceremony in Des Allemandes, La., in 2024.

The bride said “I do” wearing a custom dress from LA-based label Cinq featuring a lacy ruffled neckline and softly gathered tulle skirt punctuated with feminine bows.

“When we met, I realized pretty immediately that I loved him, but that it might get difficult because of what I was bringing to the table. Jeremy said, ‘I work with alligators—I have tough skin,'” Del Rey told W in 2025.

“And he is a man of his word. All the things that made me upset—and there were so many!—he would just listen and say, ‘You be you—and I'll just love you more.'”

Calling Dufrene “the most impactful person in my life,” the musician added, “He's quiet in public, but around me he talks all the time.”

If you watched the Super Bowl on Sunday, you had your pick of dystopian advertising campaigns to fixate on, be they AI-generated spots for vodka or ads about how we're all poor and unhealthy. Still, one campaign for Ring doorbells stood out. The ad purports to use AI and cameras across neighborhoods to help find lost dogs and surely not for any other sinister reason. Of course, this ad already generated a good bit of discussion online. Yesterday, one of the internet's foremost dog experts, known on Bluesky, YouTube, X, and the rest as WeRateDogs, broke down how the ad is manufacturing consent for mass surveillance. 

“Neither Ring's products nor business model are built around finding lost pets, but rather creating a lucrative mass surveillance network by turning private homes into surveillance outposts, and well-meaning neighbors into informants for ICE and other government agencies,” says WeRateDogs' Matt Nelson in a clip posted to Bluesky. “Ring has stated that it does not have a partnership with ICE. They do however have a partnership with Flock Safety, a private surveillance firm and license plate tracking system that provides data, including Ring footage, to law enforcement agencies through a warrantless and anonymous community request service, which is then turned over to ICE, the FBI, and even the Navy.” Nelson then goes on to cite a report from 404 Media, published in May, demonstrating how ICE has already been using this data. Another instance showed a Texas police department warrantlessly searching 83,000 cameras to look for a woman who had an abortion. 

As the video also points out, it's not even particularly good at finding dogs. The commercial claims to find one lost dog per day, which accounts for 0.03% of the lost dog reports filed to Ring annually. “If you are genuinely concerned about keeping your pets safe and maximizing your chances of finding them if they're lost, get them microchipped,” the video concludes. “You can do this at any vet and even some shelters. Just make sure you register it with up to date info.” And maybe keep that info out of the hands of Ring.

The Guthrie family has voiced their desperation to get their matriarch, Nancy Guthrie, home after her disappearance on February 1. As law enforcement work tirelessly to locate her, new details have emerged suggesting she was forcibly taken from her home in Arizona. A spotlight has been shone on the Guthrie family, and this is everything to know about Nancy's late husband, Charles Guthrie. 

Charles and Nancy had three children: their famous daughter, “Today” news anchor Savannah Guthrie; a son, Camron Guthrie; and a daughter, Annie Guthrie. After Charles' untimely passing, Nancy raised their children alone. 

“We lost my dad suddenly and shockingly,” Savannah said in a 2023 interview, CNN reports. “And my mom was so strong, and set aside her own grief in many ways, just to be there and make sure we could all move forward together.” 

Savannah continued to praise Nancy, saying, “She loves us, her family, fiercely, and her selflessness and sacrifice for us, her steadfastness and her unmovable confidence is the reason any of us grew up to do anything.”

Charles passed away in 1988 from a heart attack, People reports. At the time of his death, Savannah was 16 and in high school. Years later, she reflected on her loss in an interview with People in February 2024. “My father died when I was 16. I think about him all the time,” she said. “He was deep and complicated, and he didn't talk to us like little kids. He told us things that I didn't understand at the time but later would remember, long after he died.” 

In an interview with People in February 2024, Savannah spoke about the impact of her father's death on the family. “The loss of my father was shocking and devastating. It cracked open our family and crushed us,” she said. “He was our center. We just idealized him and adored him. He was larger than life, and funny, and charming, and adorable. His loss was so sudden and so shocking.”

Savannah Guthrie and her husband, Michael Feldman, named their second child after her father. Born in December 2016, he is named Charles Max Guthrie Feldman, but the couple affectionately calls him Charley.

In a 2014 essay for “Today,” Savannah Guthrie shared insights into who her father was and the qualities he possessed. “My father was a seemingly unlikely mix of qualities: always strong, sometimes terrifying, loyal to the end, and disarmingly gentle and tender when it counted,” she said. “He was also tall, affectionate and funny; he had that personality that people describe as ‘lighting up the room.' He was a 5,000-watt bulb who could turn a mundane trip to the post office into a rip-roaring tale. People adored him and gravitated towards him.”

Kim Gordon has shared a techno-skeptical second single from her new album, Play Me. Moni Haworth directed the video for “Dirty Tech,” in which the Sonic Youth legend hangs in an empty corporate office dotted with bits of office clutter. Check it out below.

The single returns Gordon to her recent milieu of underground trap aesthetics, after alt. rocker “Not Today” led the LP. She reflects on the song in a press release: “I was kind of musing about, is my next boss going to be an AI chatbot? We're the first ones whose lights are going to go out—not the tech billionaires. It's so abstract that people can't comprehend.”

Matador will release Play Me, Gordon's follow-up to The Collective, on March 13.

							By 

	David Fear



	She's a sly one, that Emerald Fennell! The actor turned filmmaker starts off her Wuthering Heights — the gajillionth take on Emily Brontë's swooning Gothic novel, yet somehow the first one to feature Heathcliff sniffing his true love's fingers after catching her in onanistic interlude — with the sound of heavy breathing and rapid moaning. The screen is black. The average viewer imagines all sort of carnal activities happening, titillated by what might appear onscreen once the visuals kick in. What greets us is the sight of a public hanging. That panting isn't ecstatic. It's a series of last gasps. A mass of men, women, and children watch as the hooded figure twitches and jerks on the end of a rope. Several boys point out that the convict has a “stiffy” as he prepares to shuffle off this mortal coil. A stern nun shushes them.


	Once the prisoner ceases his danse macabre, the crowd goes wild. No sooner has this public execution ended than we cut to a couple getting extremely hot and heavy right by the gallows. They may be fucking around, but Fennell is not. She's planting a flag. Two minutes in, and the dual forces of sex and death are already forever intertwined. Here, there is no petite mort or grande mort, just Thanatos and Eros high-fiving each other on the Yorkshire Dales. Once you've unleashed the forces of one, the film suggests, the other won't be far behind.

	











	There are better adaptations of Wuthering Heights, and there are far, far worse adaptations of Wuthering Heights. Yet you will certainly not find a hornier version of this material than Fennell's fast-and-loose spin on the torrid tale of Heathcliff and Catherine, childhood pals turned paramours who can never truly be together and genuinely can't keep their hands off each other. It may in fact be the horniest literary adaptation ever made. (All apologies, Brokeback Mountain.) Stopping at the mark in which their doomed love story reaches its natural climax, the Saltburn writer-director excises the more ghostly attributes associated with the book's back half, while keeping all of the ghastly ones intact. The cruelty exercised by these lust-driven denizens of a crumbling country estate is the point here. So is the sense that repression, revenge, and a ridiculous amount of irony must inevitably give way to sex. Lots and lots and lots of sex.

	A long time ago, young Cathy (Charlotte Mellington) lived with her wastrel of a father, Mr. Earnshaw (Martin Clunes), and her companion Nelly (Vy Nguyen) at the manor known as Wuthering Heights. One night, Earnshaw goes out for his evening's gambling and degeneracy and returns the next morning with a new resident for the household. He had been aghast to see a young boy being beaten in the street (“This isn't Liverpool!” the old man exclaims. “Or Bristol!”), and has brought the child home to live with them. This urchin (Adolescence's Owen Cooper) has no name. Cathy calls him “Heathcliff,” after her late brother. Mr. Earnshaw wields his charity like a cudgel with the lad, and occasionally beats him with much less metaphorical blunt instruments. But the two youngsters couldn't be closer. Until they grow up to be Margot Robbie and Jacob Elordi, at which point they'll spend the rest of the movie striving to be much, much, much closer.


	Casting two of the most smoldering contemporary actors on the planet clearly stacks the deck, and carries on the long tradition of pairing a dashing figure of brooding handsomeness (Laurence Olivier, Ralph Fiennes) with a breathless screen beauty (Merle Oberon, Juliette Binoche). When filmmakers have tried to skew slightly earthier, as in Jacques Rivette's 1985 version, the result is a sort of grungy take on traditional Gothic tropes. Other versions, like Andrea Arnold's brilliant 2011 stab at adapting Brontë's parable, push the book's racial aspects and class divide to the forefront.


	Fennell's interpretation is all about channeling pleasure — the sexual pleasure of abandoning yourself to amour fou, of course, with a strong emphasis on the fou. But aesthetic pleasure above all. So much depends on the way a red dress falls across an equally radiantly red floor, or the manner in which the billowing train of a white wedding dress trails behind Cathy as she crosses the moors. The squish of strongly kneaded dough is amplified in a way to make palms sweat. Sight and sound are all extra-ribbed for your you-know-what, but the movie is sensual in a way that aims to engage not just eyes and ears, but all of the senses at once. Broken eggs placed in bed as a prank are an excuse for Heathcliff to let the goo drip suggestively across his calloused hand. A slug symbolically leaves glistening slime on a window. Wallpaper is crafted to replicate a young woman's skin, complete with freckles. Did we mention the finger-sniffing?

	It's all in the service of arousal — theirs, yours — and when Fennell and her performers mash all the right buttons at once, the effect is purposefully overwhelming. When we talk about this Wuthering Heights years from now, we may dutifully note the fleeting look that passes across Robbie's face when she hears Heathcliff joke about taking a woman in town as a wife. Or mention the manner in which Elordi somehow defies basic physics and lifts Robbie up by her corset strings. Or reference the shot in which the scruffy young man first reappears as a Harlequin romance-novel cover star emerging from the northern mist, clad in a gentry's finery and rocking a gold tooth like he was the world's sexiest buccaneer.


	But what will inevitably be first in the conversation is the sequence in which two servants engage in rough role-play in a barn. The stablehand puts a bridle in the housemaid's mouth, then ties her wrists. Cathy peers down at them through a hole in the floorboards. Right as they began to consummate their after-hours affair, a hand goes across Cathy's mouth. It's Heathcliff. He then uses his other hand to cover her eyes, while lying on top of her. The camera stays on a close-up of Robbie's face, as the pair listen to what's going on beneath them. You genuinely worry that the film print (or digital equivalent thereof), the screen, and perhaps the theater itself might catch on fire.


	It's shortly after that standout scene of voyeurism and libidinous stirrings that Heathcliff overhears a conversation between Cathy and Nelly (now played by Hong Chau) about a marriage proposal his beloved has received from their rich neighbor, Edgar Linton (Shazad Latif). He leaves. She marries. He returns years later, having made his fortune and become the owner of Wuthering Heights. They proceed to fuck on the sly as much as humanly possible. Edgar becomes collateral damage in this roundelay of forbidden passions. So does Isabella (Alison Oliver), a young woman living in Cathy's house who's smitten with Heathcliff. It will all end badly, as so many tales of moral trespasses in the Victorian era must.

	Robbie has always been the type of actor who knows how to shift subtly in a way that lets a camera capture the alchemy of conflicting emotions, which comes in handy as a counterpoint to the big swings happening behind that camera. (See that aforementioned fleeting look of worry over losing Heathcliff to a townie.) She leaves her mark on Cathy, a role that requires no shortage of blushing cheeks and hands on feverish foreheads. This is really Elordi's movie, though. He's an ideal candidate for a “hero” characterized by mercurial moods and furrowed brows and inspiring irresistible longing, able to come off as forlorn one moment and Fuckboi of the Year the next. This is his second turn as a Gothic-lit protagonist after last year's Frankenstein, and at this juncture, he may as well start going down the list and checking off the genre's tortured souls. Do Jane Eyre's Mr. Rochester next!

	











	Having hit the ground running with the one-two punch of Promising Young Woman (2020) and Saltburn (2023), Fennell immediately showed a knack for provocation and a willingness to poke social-issue bears, even if the aim-to-grasp ratio tended to fall short. Satire is not what you would call her strength. But overheated, hyperventilating melodrama suits her quite nicely, and though her adaptation takes more liberties with Brontë's novel than a stablehand does with a bondage-loving housemaid, she's an expert at whipping up flurries. It may not be enough to simply give folks the same old mix of shirtless chores and furtive glances, dark shadows and whipping winds — in other words, yet another prestige take on a canonized-in-amber work of fiction. Perhaps a more perverse, expressionistic route is required. Perhaps we need a dozen montages — a petulance montage, a marital-boredom montage, a hot-movie-stars-ticking-off-Kama-Sutra-positions montage — where only a few might actually be required. Go batshit or go home. Fennell chooses the former, and flawed or not, this drunk-on-pheromones take is all the better for it.

Alien experts have been calling new UFO footage from Colombia the clearest footage ever, and witnesses of the potential alien craft claim that it powered off their phones.

A newly released clip from Colombia is going viral because the object looks unusually sharp, stable, and close, and even more unusually, like the daily driver of a little green man.

The sighting is being linked to a strange tech glitch that the witnesses swear happened in real time.

Now the footage is spreading fast, and the debate is heating up just as quickly.

The video was reportedly filmed over Yumbo in Colombia's Valle del Cauca region on December 23, 2025, at around 7:33pm.

According to the report, a woman named Natalia captured the moment from a rural area as a disc-shaped object with a dome moved through the sky, maybe with a little visitor from space at the wheel.

What's making people stop scrolling is the detail. 

The object appears to look like a sci-fi movie flying saucer rather than just a dot, and the report claims it moved smoothly and with control, without obvious wings, propellers, or any clear sign of conventional propulsion.

The footage was shared publicly by UFO investigator and journalist Jaime Maussan, who has a long history in the UFO world.

At the same time, there have not been any official statements confirming what the object was, which has left plenty of room for theories ranging from advanced human tech to a drone, CGI, or something non-human.

The strangest detail is what the witnesses say happened to their devices while they were recording.

Natalia and another witness reported that their Samsung phones suddenly powered off while they were filming.

The report also says the object flew low and close to high-voltage power lines, and some people have speculated that electromagnetic interference could have been what powered off their phones.

It's not proof of anything on its own, but it's the kind of detail that makes this clip feel different from the usual blurry, far-away sightings of non-specified sky dots.

For now, the video sits in that familiar gray zone: clear enough to spark serious chatter, but still without a confirmed explanation.

And as it keeps circulating, it is quickly becoming one of the most talked-about new UFO footage of early 2026.

            Newly released government evidence from last year's Border Patrol shooting of a Chicago woman revealed body camera footage from the shooting, previously unseen text messages from the agent who shot her and praise from the then-top Border Patrol official just hours after the incident. The documents released by federal prosecutors were obtained by CNN affiliate WLS.
    


            A judge ordered the release last week, clearing the way for key evidence in the case to be made public, including body camera footage, text messages and emails. Charges have been dropped against the woman, but she and her attorney argue the footage would have public value in the wake of a pair of deadly shootings involving federal agents in Minneapolis earlier this year.
    


            Marimar Martinez, a 30-year-old American citizen, was shot multiple times by a Customs and Border Protection agent after her vehicle and a CBP vehicle collided amidst the immigration crackdown in Chicago – named Operation Midway Blitz – on October 4.
    


            Federal prosecutors, alleging she rammed the agent's car, charged her with assaulting, resisting or impeding federal officers. Martinez acknowledged she had been following Border Patrol vehicles before she was shot but denied any wrongdoing.
    


            The government's case dramatically fell apart a month later as Judge Georgia Alexakis dismissed the case at prosecutors' request, saying the government's handling of it had caused her “to question the narrative being put forward.”
    


            The newly released evidence obtained by WLS includes body camera footage from one of the agents in the Border Patrol vehicle that collided with Martinez's car. It shows agents in the federal government's vehicle with weapons drawn moments before the shooting.
    


            “Camera's on,” an agent can be heard saying, with much of the body-cam video seen through the trigger guard of a long firearm the agent is holding.
    


            “Do something, b*tch,” one agent is heard saying, over the sound of repeated honking from outside the vehicle.
    


            “It's time to get aggressive and get the f**k out, because they're trying to box us in,” an agent says, seconds before the driver can be seen turning the wheel sharply to the left. The body-cam jostles, the vehicle stops and agents are heard saying, “we've been struck,” apparently reporting the collision to dispatch.
    


            The driver exits the vehicle, and gunshots are heard roughly two seconds later. The agent wearing the body camera gets out of the vehicle seconds later, though he does not appear to face the direction of Martinez's car.
    


            Before the footage was released, Martinez's attorney, Christopher Parente, lamented that while CBP agent Charles Exum had a body camera, he was not wearing it at the time of the shooting.
    


            Among the evidence is an email from top Border Patrol official Gregory Bovino, who emailed Exum hours after the shooting, offering to delay his retirement beyond the agency's customary 57-year-old retirement age “in light of your excellent service in Chicago.”
    


            “You have much yet left to do!!” he added. Bovino has since left his post as head of the federal immigration operation in Minnesota after President Donald Trump announced he was dispatching White House border czar Tom Homan in his stead last month.
    


            Exum exchanged messages in other chats saying, “Awe, I cry,” and “That hurt my feeling,” in response to a text that Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker “is saying bad things about you this morning.”
    


            In one picture, Exum receives messages of support, calling him a “legend among agents.”
    


            “Beers on me when I see you at training,” one message said.
    


            Martinez's request to put all of the government's evidence into the public eye comes as the Trump administration faces intense criticism for rushing out narratives in the fatal shootings of US citizens Renee Good and Alex Pretti in Minneapolis that appeared to be contradicted by video.
    


            The administration's framing of the deadly shootings in Minneapolis was part of the motivation for the request to modify the protective order in the case and release the evidence, said Parente.
    


            “Ms. Martinez believes certain information disclosed in her case, and currently subject to the Protective Order, would be useful for both the public and elected officials to know regarding how DHS responds in cases where their agents use deadly force against US citizens,” wrote Parente, who also said he plans to announce a civil lawsuit arising from the shooting.
    


Woman shot by border patrol five times speaks out



            DHS initially said Martinez deliberately rammed her car into an unmarked CBP vehicle, prompting Exum to exit his vehicle and open fire defensively. Martinez alleges the CBP vehicle sideswiped her car, and Exum opened fire even though she deliberately turned to avoid him once he got out of his vehicle. She was hit in the arm and leg as she drove away.
    


            Martinez “was armed with a semi-automatic weapon,” DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin posted October 4 on X. But Parente told CNN the weapon was a licensed handgun Martinez kept in her purse and did not touch during the incident; an account never disputed by government attorneys in court.
    


            FBI Director Kash Patel retweeted a video claiming to show the encounter between Martinez and the CBP, but it actually showed a different Chicago-area incident that had no connection to Martinez.
    


            The DHS focus on Martinez being an armed protester was mirrored controversially in the fatal shooting of Pretti, with administration officials repeatedly suggesting his possession of a gun while protesting made him inherently dangerous to officers. Videos of the altercation did not show Pretti ever brandishing or reaching for the weapon.
    


            In the Martinez case, the judge skeptically questioned several aspects of the government's use of force, noting the agent had bragged about the shooting in a text message.
    


            “I fired 5 rounds, and she had 7 holes. Put that in your book boys,” Exum wrote to colleagues.
    


            In court, Exum tried to explain the text messages, “I take pride in my shooting skills,” he said.
    


            The agent also defended his use of force against Martinez, saying his life was at risk.
    


            “I did what I had to do,” he told the court.
    


            “That means illegal actions have legal consequences.”
    


Border Patrol agent appeared to brag about his accuracy after shooting Chicago woman five times, messages in court reveal



            Judge Alexakis was infuriated by the government's decision to release the agent's damaged car from impound days after the shooting, allowing Exum to drive it home to Maine – more than 1,000 miles from the scene – before defense attorneys could examine it.
    


            Martinez's attorney said allowing him to release the evidence gathered in the case was necessary to “combat the continuing harm to her reputation.”
    


            The judge declined to order the release of Flock camera footage – outdoor cameras that can read license plates and identify other details about vehicles as they drive by.
    


            That footage, Parente said, is less paramount than an admission from the US Attorney's Office and DHS saying Martinez is not a domestic terrorist and that they made a mistake.
    


            DHS has never retracted its public accusations against Martinez, referring questions about the decision to drop the case to the Justice Department. Although McLaughlin acknowledged the video publicized by Patel was incorrect, she again in January described Martinez and co-defendant Anthony Ian Santos Ruiz, who was driving a different vehicle, as “domestic terrorists,” CBS News reported.
    


            Martinez will attend President Donald Trump's State of the Union address on February 24 as a guest of Illinois Democratic Rep. Jesús “Chuy” García, Parente said in a court filing last week.
    


            McLaughlin told CNN in a statement it is “shameful” García plans to bring Martinez to the State of the Union, again accusing her of being “a known doxxer who attacked law enforcement,” and calling Martinez and Ruiz “rioters.”
    


            “It's unfortunate to see someone who has sworn an oath to uphold the Constitution demonize federal law enforcement and prioritize politics over public safety with his guest decision,” said McLaughlin.

The Arizona politician has wasted millions of dollars while blocking U.S. efforts to bring reliable news to repressive countries.

This article was featured in the One Story to Read Today newsletter. Sign up for it here.

She wanted to be governor of Arizona. She wanted to be a senator from Arizona. She wanted to run Voice of America, to be MAGA's broadcaster to the world. Then she wanted to shut down Voice of America, after Donald Trump and Elon Musk turned against it. She wanted to play a big role in the MAGA movement, to live up to the phrase she's used to describe herself: “Trump in heels.” But Kari Lake has achieved none of those things.

Instead, during her 11 months as the de facto leader of the U.S. Agency for Global Media, Lake has done profound damage to America's foreign broadcasters, and to America's ability to communicate with the world. USAGM runs Voice of America and gives grants to, among others, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, Radio Free Asia, and the Open Technology Fund, which helps people access information in places including Russia and Iran. During her tenure, Lake has ceded influence to Chinese and Russian state media all over the world, as their broadcasters have taken over slots from canceled U.S. programs. She has hampered the U.S. government's ability to inform foreign audiences in times of crisis. She blocked RFE/RL from using USAGM's transmission equipment, which meant that during mass street protests and an internet blackout in Iran recently, the broadcasters' Persian-language service, Radio Farda, had to rent from commercial contractors. Voice of America's Spanish-language service, which once reached tens of millions of people in Latin America, was unavailable during the U.S. military's intervention in Venezuela because it had been shut down months earlier.

Anne Applebaum: The U.S. surrenders in the global information wars

But even while Lake presided over the destruction of an agency vital to U.S. national-security interests and the squandering of taxpayer dollars—more on this later—she often seemed to be focused on other things. Throughout the past year, she has posted on X constantly, sometimes many times a day, about Arizona politics (“Arizona elections are theater. Everyone knows it”); Somali immigration; Ashli Babbitt; Melania Trump's movie; even former Ohio Governor John Kasich, whom she called “a pussy.” Although head of an agency whose broadcasters are mandated by law to be nonpartisan and editorially independent, she has four photographs of President Trump at the top of her X feed, where she has also pinned a long, wild screed about unspecified electoral fraud (“Why is NO ONE talking about this during a week when a lot of people are TALKING??? I think I know—because there is BIG money in keeping the corrupt, rigged elections going”).

Yet if Lake's intention is to win Trump's favor by broadcasting conspiracy theories, she is failing at that too. In October, she was spotted waiting in a White House lobby, hoping to see Trump, according to two GOP operatives. “Kari has been here for hours,” a White House aide told one of the operatives that day. “She's going to run, and she's asking for the endorsement.” Lake, who was rumored to be mulling a run for Congress in Arizona, eventually shared her pitch with a low-level aide who conveyed no enthusiasm for a third Lake candidacy, the same person said. The other Republican operative offered a similar account. When asked for comment on the episode, Lake responded in a statement that “every shred of this question is incorrect” and added, “The President has always been very gracious and generous when I have requested time with him.”

Whatever she does next, Lake will leave behind immense damage, as well as a legal quagmire, not least because the legal basis for her current position is peculiar. Because Trump removed most members of the bipartisan, Senate-confirmed board that oversees USAGM, depriving it of a quorum, Lake could not formally be appointed head of VOA. The head of USAGM has to be confirmed by the Senate, but for whatever reason, Trump didn't want to go through the process. That's why Lake arrived at USAGM with the title “special adviser.” She was promoted to “deputy CEO”; later she began calling herself the “acting CEO.” During a sworn deposition in two lawsuits brought by fired employees, she admitted that she had no documentation confirming her appointment to the latter position.

Once in place, several current and former staffers told us, Lake made little effort to understand the agency, its mission, or even the point of journalistic independence. A television-news anchor in Phoenix for more than two decades, she had a very limited background in international journalism, and during congressional testimony revealed that she did not know, for example, what language is spoken in Armenia, although VOA had an Armenian service. During her deposition, she could not think of any countries in Asia, other than China, that might not have adequate sources of free information; apparently North Korea did not come to mind.

Although she had no experience working with any of the institutions before, she did not initially consult with senior officials at the broadcasters. Rohit Mahajan, the chief communications officer for RFA, said that leaders of all of the broadcasters had approached Lake, and continue to do so, but to little effect. Michael Abramowitz, the director of Voice of America, said he tried unsuccessfully to engage Lake both directly and through intermediaries. In the end he met her twice, once by accident in a hallway and once when he came to hand her a briefing book prepared by his staff. She took it and indicated she would read it, but he never heard back. (Lake declined to comment on these specific allegations due to ongoing litigation.)

But that was not unusual; she kept her distance from others as well, multiple current and former staffers said. One VOA staffer reckons that she wasn't in that building “more than a couple of times” in a six-month period. In the deposition, Lake said she primarily spent time at the State Department, where she was eventually given an office. But she didn't ask many people to meet her there either. In her statement, Lake defended her commitment to the job, saying, “Frankly, most of your ‘sources' probably wish I didn't work so hard.”

The VOA staffer also said that new appointees then working with Lake seemed “distrustful of federal employees, as part of the so-called deep state.” Among these appointees were John Zadrozny, an anti-immigration campaigner and DHS official in the first Trump administration; Mora Namdar, who contributed to the Heritage Foundation's Project 2025; and Frank Wuco, a former talk-radio host known for promoting birtherism and several other conspiracy theories.

A former USAGM executive nevertheless said some employees were initially hopeful about Lake, given her television experience. Perhaps, some thought, the outlet could have found an on-air role for her, or even created her own show. Another former employee said they had prepared proposals for institutional reform. But whatever plans Lake had originally made for the broadcasters ended in mid-March, when Trump signed an executive order designed to close the entire agency. Lake admitted under oath that this decision caught her by surprise. Nevertheless, perhaps egged on by criticism from the Trump aide Ric Grenell and from Musk—who described the broadcasters, collectively reaching hundreds of millions of people, as “radical left crazy people talking to themselves”—Lake instantly rushed to demolish the institution, even denigrating VOA as “rotten to the core.”

With the help of DOGE, she immediately began trying to cut grants to RFA, RFE/RL, and other agencies, forcing them to make emergency cuts in staff and programming. USAGM also fired about 500 VOA contractors, many of whom were journalists with unique language skills and contacts in difficult parts of the world. Because they are what Abramowitz described as “the guts of the language services,” people with years of experience and deep knowledge of their countries, their departure meant that many VOA programs became impossible to produce. Eventually most were shut down.

In addition, about 800 full-time employees were placed on paid administrative leave. During the following months, Lake and her team repeatedly tried to fire the agency staff, including journalists, editors, and tech support. But because Lake's authority to discharge employees was uncertain, and because she and her aides did not comply with strict rules about so-called reductions in force in the federal government, Lake's team kept running into legal hurdles that they seem not to have anticipated.

Even as Russian and Chinese state media were replacing American news reporting, USAGM was obligated to pay salaries and benefits to hundreds of people placed on leave. A minority report from the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations estimates that from March 15 through July 18 alone, USAGM paid hundreds of people more than $69 million not to work, and that cost has continued to grow. As of August, more than 500 people were still on administrative leave, still receiving salaries and benefits, and still barred from performing their duties. In September, a judge blocked another attempt to fire them. Since then, the federal government has likely paid them about $50 million more—an estimate based on average salary levels at the agency—while still preventing them from doing their jobs. Lake's statement did not refute these numbers but instead blamed an “activist judge” for obstructing her plans.

Lake has taken the position that she is required by law to maintain merely a statutory minimum service at VOA, something far smaller than the broadcasts previously produced in 49 languages. Lake initially preserved service in only four languages (Mandarin, Dari, Pashto, and Farsi) but later added a few more, including Korean and Kurdish. Yet even as she continues to pay hundreds of experienced journalists and federal workers to remain on administrative leave, sources at VOA and USAGM told us that she is hiring more and more contractors. This may be because, as she has testified, she truly believes USAGM and its broadcasters are “rotten to the core.”

Toluse Olorunnipa: Kari Lake's attempt to deport her own employees

Regardless, she seems to be replacing some journalists with propagandists. By law, all of the broadcasters are supposed to be nonpartisan, with a firewall between the journalists and the U.S. administration. The State Department puts out the administration's views; the broadcasters are meant to be reporters, a distinction particularly important in places that don't have any other independent media. But some of VOA's newer material doesn't appear to meet that standard. One recent article, originally published in Chinese, echoed the false claims that Trump likes to make about his own record: “Trump combined his dealmaking ability with diplomacy based on the concept of ‘peace through strength' to secure agreements halting and restraining eight global conflicts in 2025.” VOA's Mandarin-language Instagram feed recently began posting heroic, Photoshopped images of Trump with misty American flags and helicopters in the background.

In practice, this is another kind of waste. Trump did not halt or restrain eight global conflicts, and obvious pro-Trump puffery isn't going to have the same kind of influence among Mandarin-speaking audiences as, say, the extraordinary reporting once done by Radio Free Asia's Uyghur-language service, which had to be shut down when funding to the broadcaster was cut and only recently reopened with a limited service. In 2017, RFA broke the story of the Chinese government's mass arrests of Uyghur people in Xinjiang, part of a crackdown that has since forced some 1.8 million people into concentration camps. This story also had an impact on international perceptions of China in a way that fictional tales of Trump's diplomacy will not.

Lake's decisions about USAGM property have also taken their toll. Before Trump returned to office, the agency had begun to move into new quarters. Its old building, constructed in 1939 for the Social Security Board, needed expensive renovations; reportedly had ancient, faulty wiring; was far too big; and was generally unsuitable for modern journalism. After an extensive search and a lengthy negotiation, the service contracted to lease a smaller office building on Pennsylvania Avenue. Although the total price tag of the 15-year lease was more than $200 million, a number that looks large, the annual cost was reportedly lower than that of the agency's former quarters. The owner gave USAGM two years' free rent, as well as an additional nine months without rent to move into the building; the previous leaseholder threw in office furniture as well. According to USAGM's previous CEO, the savings from the deal would have come to more than $150 million over the course of the lease. Renovations had begun, and some staff had already moved in.

In March, Lake abruptly canceled the lease. The former USAGM executive and another person with knowledge of the transaction say that she and her team did not follow the specified termination procedures. Lake's team did not want to reimburse the owner's costs, which the people close to the deal said initially came to about $16 million. The executive believes that this is because any payment undercut their argument that “it's cheaper to get rid of these things than to keep them.” Theoretically, the building's owner could add to the list of lawsuits against Lake, and a court could now hold USAGM, and thus U.S. taxpayers, liable for the entire 15-year lease. (In her statement, Lake maintained that canceling the lease reduced the agency's costs and will save more than $225 million over 10 years.)

Meanwhile, office leases and other contracts around the world have been canceled, sometimes incurring additional costs, by VOA as well as the other broadcasters, staffers said. Further losses are mounting. USAGM also continues to pay to update and maintain its transmission capabilities in multiple countries around the world, even though they are now being used less often, and even though Lake has prevented some of the services from using them. Lake is also engaged in a series of lawsuits, some of which she appears to have made only minimal effort to fight. RFE/RL has won several cases that have allowed it to remain open. Employees of VOA, RFA, and the Middle East Broadcasting Network have also received favorable court rulings.  One federal judge, Royce Lamberth, a President Ronald Reagan appointee, has pointed out that when Congress appropriated $260 million to VOA for 2025, it did not intend the money to be used to cut programming and keep employees at home. “The legal term for that is ‘waste,' he said, “and it is precisely what federal appropriation law aims to avoid.”

No one can say Lake lacks enthusiasm for the cause of shutting down the agency. During the course of the year, she has railed against USAGM, baselessly accused Voice of America of taking instruction from the Chinese Communist Party, and canceled visas for the foreign employees of the broadcasters, forcing them to leave the United States immediately and, in the case of some from repressive countries, scramble to find somewhere safe to live. “There was no caretaking to deal with that issue at all,” said Kathryn Neeper, director of strategy at USAGM, now on administrative leave. Lake did take time to make a slick video about the new VOA building whose lease she canceled, describing it as luxurious and overpriced.

More recently, after congressional appropriators began talking about bringing the agency's funding back, she switched tack. She visited the Miami headquarters of Radio Martí—which is part of the Office of Cuban Broadcasting, beloved by Cuban American politicians, the broadcaster least affected by her purge—and even met staff last week at the main headquarters of RFE/RL in Prague.

She has lauded the work of the skeleton VOA services in Persian and installed a new leader for them—albeit a controversial, seemingly partisan one—even as she continued to prevent RFE/RL's Radio Farda from accessing transmission services. Lake asserted in her statement that RFE/RL leaders “were putting out a message that was counter to US policy” and that she was helping them “align their messaging with American foreign policy and national security strategy.” But that assertion again reflects a deep misunderstanding of what RFE/RL is supposed to do. According to long-standing statute, the broadcaster has “professional independence,” providing not American messaging but real journalism in places where there are few alternatives.

Lake herself never pretends not to be partisan, keeping up a constant stream of praise and adulation for Trump, the “Trump Kennedy Center,” Charlie Kirk, and other MAGA heroes. But the Lake era at USAGM might look very different, even to Republicans, once the costs and losses of her year in charge are counted. Not only has she wasted money; she hasn't won many arguments. In recent weeks, Congress rejected Lake's requests to cut funding to a bare minimum and allotted USAGM something approaching previous levels of funding. Lake will retain the ability to undermine the broadcasters, but her expensive, monthslong, legally dubious attempt to destroy them has so far failed.

Tom Nichols: They're cheering for Trump in Moscow—again

The uncertain future of her role might explain why Lake was said to be sitting in a White House waiting room in October, trying to get the president's endorsement for a congressional race. But even if she had his blessing, a return to Arizona politics will be difficult. The Republican consultant and pollster Paul Bentz told us that MAGA voters in Arizona have moved on from Lake: “MAGA's got other people that they've put at the forefront,” Bentz said. “They've got better candidates that they like more.” In October, a “war room” account on X affiliated with her past campaigns accused Fox News and Bret Baier of blacklisting her.

In her statement, Lake did not directly answer a question about whether she would seek a congressional seat, saying only, “If and when I decide to run for office, The Atlantic will be the very last to know.” Soon after allegedly being turned away at the White House, Lake also bought a condo in her native Iowa, according to MS Now, perhaps to try her luck in politics there. She can then explain to Iowa voters how much damage she did to American interests and communications around the world, as well as what happened to the hundreds of millions of dollars she squandered on their behalf.

XAI brought staffers together for an all-hands on Tuesday night, shortly after the company lost its second cofounder in less than 48 hours.

Musk did not directly address the departures of company cofounders Tony Wu and Jimmy Ba, but thanked those who had left for their contributions to the company.

Musk said that the company would continue to carry on despite the recent exits, and said that the staff who had left were not necessary for the future of xAI.

The xAI CEO also discussed a restructuring, though it's unclear what it could look like. Wu and Ba both left the company shortly after their responsibilities were changed, Business Insider previously reported.

The all-hands meeting also addressed Musk's plans for data centers in space. Musk has said SpaceX's recent acquisition of xAI will allow the company to more quickly deploy cosmic data centers, and previously discussed having Tesla's Optimus robot man the facilities.

The New York Times was the first to report on the meeting.

Over the last few days, several other staffers posted that they had left the company.

I left xAI today. It was truly rewarding to contribute to grok imagine video series: 0.9 as our first release, then 1.0 that recently topped across competitive leaderboards and user feedback. I see a mix of humble craftsmanship and ambitious vision throughout the team. They…

A spokesperson for xAI did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

XAI had previously scheduled an all-hands meeting for last week, after it was announced that SpaceX had acquired xAI. That meeting was canceled at the last minute, people with knowledge of the event said.

In a Q&A sent to staff about the acquisition, the company said the two companies would mostly stay separate in their work and branding, at least for the time being, Business Insider previously reported. The combined company continues to prepare for a ""possible IPO in 2026,"" according to the memo.

""Whether it actually happens, when it happens, and at what valuation are still highly uncertain,"" it said.

SpaceX, which Musk founded in 2002, has reportedly been gearing up for an initial public offering that could value it at $1.5 trillion.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:cnbc.com","Bill Ackman reveals stake in Meta, says it has 'deeply discounted valuation'","https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/11/bill-ackman-meta-valuation.html","Wed, 11 Feb 2026 18:25:31 GMT","



Bill Ackman's Pershing Square revealed a sizable stake in Meta on Wednesday.

""We believe Meta's current share price underappreciates the company's long-term upside potential from AI and represents a deeply discounted valuation for one of the world's greatest businesses,"" stated the fund's annual investor presentation.

The position amounts to 10% of Pershing's capital as of the end of 2025.

Meta shares are off by 16% over the last 12 months on fears it is spending too much on artificial intelligence. The company in its fourth-quarter earnings report in January projected AI-related capital expenditures to total in the range of $115 billion to $135 billion in 2026.

""We believe concerns around META's AI-related spending initiatives are underestimating the company's long-term upside potential from AI,"" stated the Pershing presentation.

Pershing noted that Meta currently trades at a 22 times its projected earnings over the next 12 months, cheap considering how much AI is set to rev up future earnings growth. Alphabet, Apple and Nvidia all have higher forward P/Es.

Pershing added the stake in the fourth quarter. The fund bought positions in Amazon, Hertz and Meta in 2025, according to the presentation with the Amazon and Hertz stakes previously disclosed.

Last year, Pershing outperformed the S&P 500, with the fund's net asset value increasing by 20.9% vs. the index's 17% return.

Crypto Insight UK director Will Taylor argued in a new video that XRP is “trading different” this cycle and said he sees a credible path for it to challenge Ethereum's long-held No. 2 position, with an outside chance of even pressuring bitcoin if the right mix of narrative and market structure lands.

The “XRP Curveball” Theory

Taylor anchored his thesis to a comment he highlighted from Mark Yusko, a well-known bitcoin-focused investor, who warned of a potential “curveball” tied to XRP and a future where policymakers clamp down on private stablecoins. Yusko, in Taylor's telling, speculated that a “CBDC version” could emerge where authorities effectively steer users away from assets like USDT and USDC, a framing Taylor said resonated with what parts of the XRP community have anticipated for years.

“Now, what have I been saying about XRP this cycle? I've said that it looks different,” Taylor told viewers. “I've said that I think it will challenge ETH for spot number two. And I also think that there's a potential that it challenges Bitcoin for the number one spot this cycle. And I know that a lot of people don't agree… but that's actually what I think.”

Taylor was careful to frame the idea as a non-base-case scenario while emphasizing why he believes XRP is uniquely positioned if US policy and institutional incentives shift in its favor. He pointed to Ripple's US footprint, its endurance through regulatory “trials and tribulations,” and what he characterized as proximity to political power in Washington. In his view, those factors could matter if the next phase of crypto adoption is shaped as much by compliance architecture as by ideology.

He also cited comments from Ray Dalio, referenced via an interview Taylor said aired “yesterday,” where Dalio discussed a future of reduced transactional privacy and the risk of being “shut off” if politically disfavored, a scenario Taylor linked to broader CBDC discourse. Taylor emphasized that his point was not whether such an outcome is desirable, but that traders should position for what they think is most likely to happen, not what they want to happen.

“If I could change the way that I thought the world was going to be, I would put my capital somewhere else and I'd make the world a different place,” Taylor said. “But I'm not born in a world that I get to choose what happens in the future. But I am born into a world where I get to see what I think is going to happen and place my bets accordingly. It's just like trading. You don't trade or place an investment on something you want to happen. You place it on something that you think is going to happen.”

XRP Vs. ETH Vs. BTC

On the market-structure side, Taylor focused on bitcoin dominance, arguing it is “really, really tight” on Bollinger Bands, a condition he reads as a volatility setup. He revisited a historical example where an 11% bitcoin pullback preceded what he described as a 490% XRP surge, and argued that, historically, drops in bitcoin dominance have tended to coincide with sharp XRP outperformance.

Taylor's core claim is that the compression in dominance has persisted for roughly six months and is now at levels he compared to an earlier era, “before ETH and ICOs”, when dominance dynamics looked structurally different. He allowed for the opposite outcome, where dominance squeezes higher and bitcoin “sucks the liquidity in,” but said he increasingly favors a downside dominance break that would mechanically strengthen the case for altcoin beta, with XRP as a candidate beneficiary if narrative catalysts arrive alongside the move.

Taylor also leaned on Binance volume comparisons across three-day candles, arguing XRP's recovery volume looked more aggressive than the preceding selloff, while he said sellers appeared more dominant in ETH and BTC over the same framing. He tied that relative read to XRP cross charts versus ETH and BTC, describing repeated attempts at range resistance and suggesting a “positive price action” trigger could accelerate XRP's relative breakout.

He flagged near-term calendar items, including yesterday's Clarity Act meeting and the XRP Community Day today, while cautioning against assuming a reflexive pump. Still, Taylor's broader point was about positioning into a regime shift he believes could arrive quickly, pointing to visible liquidity concentrated above spot levels on his charts, extending from roughly $1.50 up toward $4.30, with comparatively less liquidity stacked below.

“I think people are going to be shocked when we start to reverse and we reverse quickly,” Taylor said, arguing that a fast upside move could force traders out of short-term positioning. He then mapped his most bullish path: bitcoin returning to new highs – he floated 150K and “180-ishk plus” as targets – while bitcoin dominance “nukes,” setting up what he called “crazy price action” for XRP if it captures share of that dominance unwind.

At press time, XRP traded at $1.3594.

The universal translator may be closer than you think, at least if you're a T-Mobile customer.

The U.S. mobile carrier announced today that it will begin testing an AI-powered live translation feature. The company describes it as the “world's first real-time agentic AI platform built directly into a wireless network.”

That means the feature will work on any device connected to T-Mobile's 4G or 5G networks, whether that's a flip phone or the latest smartphone, and it won't require downloading a separate app or new subscription.

T-Mobile says the feature supports real-time translation on calls in over 50 languages.

“Some of the biggest barriers wireless customers face are the simplest ones — like being able to understand each other,” said T-Mobile CEO Srini Gopalan in a press release. “When language gets in the way, the network gets reduced to just a signal — and that's not who we are. By bringing real-time AI directly into our network, we're delivering more than connectivity — turning conversations into community, starting with Live Translation.”

The company opened registration for a free beta test, which will begin this spring for selected users. To initiate Live Translation, customers will have to simply dial 87 on their keypad during a call.

“Once Live Translation is turned on during a call, it listens and translates as you speak, helping each person hear the conversation in their preferred language. It all happens quickly and seamlessly, so the conversation keeps flowing,” the company said on its website.

Only one person on the call needs to be on the T-Mobile network for the feature to work.

The beta is meant to gradually test the service before a commercial launch later this year. T-Mobile said it will notify users when the beta period ends and give them the option to add Live Translation to their line.

T-Mobile did not immediately respond to a request for comment asking about when the feature will officially launch or if it will come with additional costs.

The press release highlights several potential use cases, including multilingual households, making reservations abroad, and small businesses trying to serve customers who speak different languages.

Live translation has become one of the more practical uses of AI, and tech companies have jumped on it. Apple introduced live translation that works in person and during calls for its AirPods last year. Google also recently rolled out live translation capabilities in its mobile Translate app that provides real-time on-screen and audio translations in over 70 languages.

England will complete their preparations for the World Cup with friendlies against New Zealand and Costa Rica.

Thomas Tuchel's side are hoping to end 60 years of hurt by reigning supreme in North America this summer.

They will play their final warm-up matches in Florida, facing New Zealand on June 6 before taking on Costa Rica four days later, with the tournament kicking off the following day.

The venues are yet to be announced, but are expected to be in Tampa, Orlando or Miami and will give the squad chance to acclimatise to what are expected to be sweltering conditions.

England will then head into camp in Kansas City, where they will be based at the Soccer Swope Village for the duration of the tournament.

The Missouri city was their preferred location, despite two of their group games and several potential knockout matches being on the east coast.

Swope Soccer Village is one of the training bases of MLS side Sporting Kansas City and has state-of-the-art facilities.

England are in Group L, meaning they will be among the last sides to take to the field in the tournament.

They begin against Croatia in Dallas on June 17, six days after the tournament opener, then head to Boston to take on Ghana on June 23 before closing their group stage against Panama in New Jersey on June 27.

England have not played New Zealand since a tour Down Under in 1991, winning 1-0 and 2-0 under Graham Taylor.

They have met Costa Rica more recently, suffering defeat in the disappointing 2014 World Cup group stage and then winning in a home friendly ahead of the 2018 edition.

Preparations for the tournament begin in earnest next month with Wembley friendlies against Uruguay and Japan – their last matches in the country before jetting off two-and-a-half-months later.","{'href': 'https://uk.sports.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Sports UK'}","soccer"

Real Madrid and UEFA have announced an “agreement of principles” to resolve their legal disputes related to the failed April 2021 Super League project.

In October 2025, Madrid set out to seek a reported €4.5billion (£3.9bn; $5.2bn) in damages from UEFA. The Spanish club believed the breakaway project promoted by Madrid president Florentino Perez would have been worth a “substantial” amount to the club, had it been successful.

Madrid's potential legal case against UEFA was based on an understanding that Madrid's rights had been seriously damaged based on a 2023 European Union Court of Justice (ECJ) ruling that UEFA, European football's governing body, had infringed the EU's rules on free competition with a threatening response to the initial Super League project.

Talks between senior figures at UEFA and Madrid have taken place over recent months to resolve the situation, with a breakthrough coming in a statement released by both the governing body and La Liga club on Wednesday afternoon.

“Following months of discussions conducted in the best interests of European football, UEFA, European Football Clubs (EFC), and Real Madrid CF announce that they have reached an agreement of principles for the well-being of European club football, respecting the principle of sporting merit with emphasis on long-term club sustainability and the enhancement of fan experience through the use of technology,” the statement said.

“This agreement of principles will also serve to resolve their legal disputes related to the European Super League, once such principles are executed and implemented.”

The dispute began after Madrid were one of 12 English, Spanish and Italian clubs attempting to launch a new competition to rival the Champions League in 2021. Those plans collapsed almost immediately after fan outrage, especially in England, and threats of heavy sanctions from UEFA.

Most of the original 12 clubs involved backed out of the project within a few days. Juventus remained involved until June 2024 and Barcelona only formally left the idea on February 7.

Super League organisers A22 and Real Madrid took a legal case against UEFA to the ECJ, which ruled in 2023 that  “the FIFA and UEFA rules making any new interclub football project subject to their prior approval, such as the Super League, and prohibiting clubs and players from playing in those competitions, are unlawful”.

Madrid-based A22 has continued to work on different versions of a Super League, which was renamed the Unity League, with a proposal for all games to be streamed online for free to all fans. A22 also released the same statement as UEFA and Madrid on Wednesday afternoon.

The agreement was welcomed by European Commissioner for Intergenerational Fairness, Youth, Culture and Sport Glenn Micallef who said: “A win for sporting merit and unity. Congratulations to UEFA on today's agreement of principles which will serve to resolve their legal disputes related to the European Super League.”

Wednesday's joint announcement allows both sides to claim a measure of victory, but this development looks clearly like a win for UEFA and a potentially embarrassing climb-down by Madrid and the Super League.

Senior contacts at UEFA and Madrid were keen to frame the agreement as something positive for football, a declaration of peace after a tense period, and the two sides said that they would continue to discuss ideas for further reform and potential changes to the Champions League format.

Sources familiar with the thinking of the Bernabeu hierarchy have claimed credit for the new Champions League league-phase format introduced for the first time in the men's game last season, which has arguably brought more drama and tension to the early months of the tournament.

These sources also said that the Super League's idea of streaming all games for free would also now be considered by UEFA, even though a bumper new rights deal up to 2031 along the current existing model was announced last November.

However, it is difficult to see Madrid's move from claiming €4.5bn (£3.85 bn; $6.1bn) in damages to announcing peace and hoping for further dialogue as anything other than an acceptance that they have lost the war over the Super League.

Madrid and promoters A22 did win some battles along the way, and there was a measure of vindication for their side in the 2023 ECJ ruling that UEFA had overstepped its authority.

The writing has still been on the wall for the breakaway project for a long time now, and at times Perez and his allies have appeared like marooned soldiers fighting on in a remote location while unaware that their war has long been over everywhere else.

Barcelona's formal exit last weekend came as no surprise, given how club president Joan Laporta had moved much closer to UEFA chief Aleksander Ceferin and his EFC counterpart, the Paris Saint-Germain president Nasser Al-Khelaifi, recently. Ceferin and Al-Khelaifi are currently together at UEFA's Executive Committee in Brussels, and walked in 20 minutes late to a meeting as Wednesday's news broke.

This announcement also comes at a tough time for Perez, who is currently facing tough fights on a number of different fronts.

There were chants of ‘Florentino resign' at the Bernabeu just last month, with fans unhappy at the team having lost to Barcelona in the Spanish Supercopa final in the last game of Xabi Alonso's short spell as coach, before then being eliminated from the Copa del Rey at the hands of second-tier Albacete in new coach Alvaro Arbeloa's first game in charge.

Perez, 78, has also announced a controversial change in Madrid's member-owned structure, allowing private investment for the first time, although a vote on the issue proposed last November appears to have been postponed for the time being.

Legal issues around the recent expensive renovation of Madrid's Bernabeu stadium are also proving problematic. Peace on the Super League front at least leaves Perez and his close circle of advisors and senior executives freer to concentrate on those battles closer to home.

FIFA on Wednesday finalized a one-time switch to Canada from Mexico for winger Marcelo Flores, thereby making the 22-year-old eligible to be selected by coach Jesse Marsch for this summer's World Cup.

Revealed on FIFA's Change of Association Platform, the switch for the now former Mexico international cements a recent effort by Canada to include Flores following an unofficial call-up as a training player last November. In January, the Arsenal academy product was also called up by Marsch but was unable to take part due to his change of association not being completed.

Previously involved in a push-and-pull between both countries, Flores initially committed to Mexico after a debut in 2021, but didn't earn minutes for the senior national team since 2022.

Flores was born in Canada and also eligible to play for Mexico through his father. He now closes out his time with El Tri with three caps while beginning a new international chapter with Canada as he seeks a possible World Cup call-up.

He plays in Liga MX for Tigres, and this season he is off to his best start with three goals and an assist in his first seven games of 2026. Before transferring to Tigres in 2023, he spent a season on loan from Arsenal to Real Oviedo in 2022.

With just months to go until the start of the World Cup, Flores will now aim to be selected by Marsch for Canada's next friendlies against Iceland on March 28 and Tunisia on March 31.

Also recently noted by FIFA's Change of Association Platform was a switch last week for Real Betis' Álvaro Fidalgo to Mexico from Spain.","{'href': 'https://www.espn.com', 'title': 'ESPN'}","soccer"

Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta has expressed his sympathy for Thomas Frank after he was sacked by rivals Tottenham Hotspur on Wednesday. Spurs sit only five points clear of the Premier League's relegation zone having failed to win a single game in domestic competition in 2026, despite managing to finish fourth in the league phase of the Champions League.

Frank leaves Spurs as statistically the worst-ever manager of a big-six Premier League club. Tottenham are at serious risk of being dragged into a fight to beat the drop having now gone eight league matches without a win. The decision to sack Frank was announced on Wednesday.

Spurs said in a statement: ""The Club has taken the decision to make a change in the Men's Head Coach position and Thomas Frank will leave today.

""Thomas was appointed in June 2025, and we have been determined to give him the time and support needed to build for the future together.

""However, results and performances have led the Board to conclude that a change at this point in the season is necessary.

""Throughout his time at the Club, Thomas has conducted himself with unwavering commitment, giving everything in his efforts to move the Club forward. We would like to thank him for his contribution and wish him every success in the future.""

At a press conference on Wednesday afternoon, Arsenal boss Arteta was asked for his thoughts and feelings on the club's north London rivals deciding to part company with their manager.

""Well, always very sad news when you have a colleague that doesn't continue doing his job because Thomas is an excellent coach, he's an extraordinary man as well and he's proven that in the league. We know where we are. We know that our responsibility is beyond just performance,"" Arteta replied. ""That sometimes result dictates what happens with us. We wish him all the very best for whatever he decides to do next.""

Arteta was also quizzed on whether the Premier League is becoming more impatient, while it was put to him that Spurs have now cycled their way through eight different managers during his time in the Arsenal dugout.

""I don't know. I don't think you can just take every example in the same possible way. I think in the context of every club it is very different but it's always a possibility,"" he added.

""I think every era is different at every club and we have in this Premier League two of the most iconic managers with Arsene and Sir Alex as well for so many years. That has changed a lot from both clubs. I don't know.

""It depends on many factors. In my opinion the first one is if you have the players right behind you and they enjoy what they do and they believe in what you do, it's a big thing. Then you have to win a lot of games because at the end, if you don't do that, you're not going to continue in the job, and that's the reality of our job.""

According to the Daily Telegraph, Frank disillusioned the Tottenham dressing room with his persistent praise of Arsenal. A source said: ""He was constantly going on to the players about Arsenal and they quickly got sick of it. Even before and after the game at the Emirates, he was telling them how good Arsenal were. The feeling among some was very much 'just shut up about Arsenal'.""

Frank also upset supporters by mentioning Arsenal's 'Invincibles' team in his opening press conference when insisting Spurs would '100 percent lose games', while he was also spotted drinking from an Arsenal-branded cup prior to their defeat to Bournemouth in January.

As a polished cops-versus-bandits melodrama set in Los Angeles, there's a familiarity to Bart Layton's Crime 101 that's impossible to shake. The film seems destined to slide comfortably into streaming libraries beside its primary influences—namely, the works of Michael Mann and William Friedkin, which is not bad company to keep. Yet this proximity inevitably invites comparisons to those directors' filmographies, and after two-and-a-half hours of watching Chris Hemsworth's posh, morally gray, crisis-stricken jewel thief grimace his way through sleek L.A., the parallels won't always be flattering. 

Taken on its own merits, Crime 101 is a sturdy offering for those who miss losing an afternoon at the movies with a reasonably engrossing drama made for adults. Adapting Don Winslow's novella, Layton delivers a mannered, sober crime saga stripped of ostentation and notable for its uncommonly polite genre restraint. It's less interested in shocking or scandalizing the viewer than hanging out with them for a spell. Considering the cast of heavyweights with whom Hemsworth keeps company—Halle Berry as an insurance agent whose days of wooing the elite are wearing thin, Mark Ruffalo as a rumpled cat-dad detective, Nick Nolte as a fence who conducts business at noodle stands—that's an invitation worth accepting. 

But for all his fascination with criminality and duplicity—themes which defined his nonfiction films The Imposter and American Animals, and proliferate here—Layton flinches at the violent and sexual extremes that define so much of his chosen genre, casting his film as a kinder, gentler variation on mood pieces like Miami Vice or To Live And Die In L.A. This is not to say there isn't violence or sex in Crime 101; both are present, but they're calibrated to sustain tension or deepen character, not titillate genre hounds out for a fresh jolt. Layton proves adept at keeping his drama at a simmer—boosted by the thrumming moodiness of Blanck Mass' score, it's almost a cinch—yet he rarely lets it boil over. When he does, like in a car chase midway through the film or a somewhat botched heist involving a jumpy, bottle-blond Barry Keoghan, Layton cuts away before leaving too much of a mess behind.

He keeps the film relatively tidy, using Mann's Heat as his most conspicuous influence while scaling that film's ensemble down to a functional three-hander. Hemsworth plays Mike, a thief whose modus operandi exploits Highway 101, a stretch of asphalt that provides plump targets and swift getaways. It's fitting, then, that Mike finds himself searching for an off-ramp from this lone-wolf criminal career, and not a moment too soon; unbeknownst to him, his route has already attracted the attention of Detective Lubesnick (Ruffalo), who needs to collar the serial thief to salvage both his career and what remains of his self-worth, both diminished by advancing middle age and an image-conscious LAPD.

Mike's longstanding dealings with his fence, Money (Nolte), are already fractured by the film's opening sequence, a street-level robbery that begins smooth as silk but takes a sudden turn when Mike—distracted by too many variables—misses a hidden gun during the holdup, and the shot goes off too close to its mark. Despite Layton's overall caution, he finds a propulsion to this sequence that speaks to Mike's hypercompetence and contrasts nimbly with Money's blunt-force approach. With this fissure in place, Mike and Det. Lubesnick's parallel schemes begin to circle around Sharon (Berry), whose disenchantment with her ornamental role at an elite insurance firm (she fails to lure a merrily odious tycoon played by Tate Donovan) compels her to capitalize on her access to the city's upper crust—before her employers decide she has aged out of usefulness.

Before the plot's gravitational pull draws them together, the three leads function agreeably within their characters' fraught private lives. The first hour clearly presents their motives, and, with some effort, the improbable coincidences that otherwise poetically connect their social and professional distances. Secondary characters—like Maya (Monica Barbaro), who falls for Mike despite his spartan, serial-killer digs and economical relationship with the truth, and Ormon (Keoghan), that squirrelly robber who seethes under a motorcycle helmet and shadows Mike in anticipation of his next heist—are more vaguely rendered. While this sketchiness feels deliberate in Ormon's case (he's plainly engineered to fit the Waingro wild-card role from Heat), he instead comes off like a refugee from a Temu production of Good Time.

This remoteness actually complements the frustratingly elusive Mike, who smolders just fine when Hemsworth is in Blackhat mode, but appears merely to sulk when Layton's screenplay attempts to elucidate his inner turmoil. In the latter sequences, we can glimpse the lousier movie Crime 101 could have been had Layton pulled it from the oven too early, and it's difficult not to grow fidgety when Keoghan, Barbaro, and Hemsworth dominate the frame while richer, more grounded performances (Berry provides an essential wellspring of charisma) hover nearby. When Crime 101 finally pulls into its soft landing, it feels right that Layton leaves behind no lasting scars; with well-crafted characters like Sharon around, we naturally want them to get away clean.

While Sundance 2026 is already in our rearview, some of the best films of the previous year's festival are just now getting ready to come out for wider audiences. That includes Cole Webley's heartbreaking John Magaro-starrer “Omaha,” which premiered in competition at last year's festival and will hit theaters this spring.

Per its official logline, it is “set against the backdrop of the 2008 economic crisis, [and] follows a struggling father (Magaro) who sets out with his two children, Ella and Charlie, on a journey across the American West. What begins as a seemingly spontaneous trip gradually reveals deeper emotional stakes, as his daughter Ella begins to sense that her father may be carrying a more complicated truth.”

As I wrote in my own Sundance review of the film, “For a good portion of Cole Webley's feature directorial debut, ‘Omaha,‘ we remain as in the dark about what's happening as the pair of plucky kid stars (Molly Belle Wright and Wyatt Solis) who serve as two members of the tight-knit family trio at its center. That's a feature, not a bug, as Robert Machoian's screenplay may be steady in doling out information and clever in what it obscures, but those choices put the audience on even keel with the heart of this heartbreaking family drama.”

The film‘s performances truly recommend it, and I also noted that “Magaro's performance … teeters between moments of profound grief and a hard-won desire to show his kids a good time. As they slip through roadside gas stations, he pauses for fast food, ice cream, kite-flying, and more, all set against the starkly beautiful American West. … While Magaro's performance anchors the film, strong turns from both Wright and Solis give added depth. So too does Webley and [screenwriter Robert] Machoian's obvious interest in their young characters' perspectives and experience; ‘Omaha' is often not just seen, but felt through their eyes.”

At Sundance, Webley told IndieWire about the impact he was already seeing at the film's early screenings. The night before Webley and his cast joined the IndieWire studio for a chat, he said a man approached him and “just couldn't stop talking about how he wanted to go home and tell his dad, who raised him and his two siblings as a solo dad, about this movie. He was so impacted by it. … I get that this movie will not be for every human out there, but … the thing that's right under the surface for us is how much we love our families. And that is what is resonating.”

That wasn't just an isolated incident. After the film's Sundance debut, it played at several other festivals around the globe, where it picked up numerous accolades and admirers.

 










Those accolades include: a best film (first features) win at the Jakarta World Cinema festival, a jury prize from the Deauville American Film Festival, an audience award at Nashville, grand jury and best feature win at DIFF, the Jordan Ressler First Feature Award at Miami, and a raft of wins at the Richmond International Film Festival (including a grand jury prize for best feature, best director for Webley, best actor for Magaro, best acting, and Rising Star awards for both Solis and Wright).

Greenwich Entertainment will release the film in New York on Friday, April 24, and in theaters nationwide this May. Check out the first full trailer for “Omaha” below.
