F1 Bahrain Testing 2026: Day 1 Highlights

Colapinto: 'Personal priority is to get a lot of mileage'

Red Bull's latest F1 show run in the United States will include an outing from Yuki Tsunoda.

Red Bull test and reserve driver Yuki Tsunoda will return to the cockpit of a Formula 1 car later this month when he takes part in a special demonstration event in America.

Tsunoda, who lost his full-time F1 seat at the end of last season, is set to appear at a show run on the streets of San Francisco – backed by Red Bull partner Ford – on February 21.

Also on the list of attendees are former F1 driver Scott Speed, who will drive a Racing Bulls machine around Marina Boulevard, as well as Ford off-road star Mitch Guthrie and freestyle motorcross rider Aaron Colton.

“I can't wait to get back behind the wheel of an F1 car, and to do that in [the] RB7 in San Francisco will be amazing,” said Tsunoda, referring to Red Bull's double title-winning 2011 design.

“I'm really looking forward to getting out there, doing some donuts and making some real F1 noise in front of the crowds.”

Tsunoda will be on standby for both Red Bull and Racing Bulls through the upcoming F1 campaign, should either team require a substitute driver – as well as providing support off the track.

The 25-year-old Japanese racer started his career with AlphaTauri (now known as Racing Bulls) back in 2021, spending just over four seasons there before earning a promotion to Red Bull.

However, he followed a long list of drivers who struggled to make an impression alongside Max Verstappen and was dropped from the team's racing line-up for 2026.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As he prepares to defend his maiden World Championship, Lando Norris has been assessing how his approach differs to race winners of past and present, including Max Verstappen. Lando Norris believes it is “clear” that he has a “different mentality” to Max Verstappen, with the Briton reflecting on what motivates his own desire to win and the areas that he still wants to improve on. Following his maiden World Championship triumph, Norris is preparing to defend his title in the 2026 season, a year in which a wave of new technical regulations will come into effect. Speaking to a select group of media, including F1.com, the McLaren driver looked ahead to the upcoming campaign and said of his championship victory: “I have that feeling, one day – if I don't achieve something again – I have something to always fall back on and I'll always be proud, no matter what people say.” Norris was later quizzed on whether he felt that other serial race winners might have also adopted this approach, with the 26-year-old going on to explain how he feels that he differs to his 2025 title rival – and four-time World Champion – Verstappen. “I can't answer on what went before and what those guys thought, but I think it's quite clear that I have a different mentality and a different approach to say what Max has – good or bad, you decide,” said Norris. “I know there are still areas where I'm not at the level I need to be, and it's still a good level but when you are fighting these guys you need to be close to perfection. “My motivation to win is exactly the same,” Norris explained. I certainly have to find my own way and not disregard what other people have done in the past, but just understand what is always going to motivate me. “A lot of my motivation is not just picturing me on the top step of the podium or holding up a trophy – a lot of it is being with the team and allowing them to have the trophies and party and celebrate and that kind of thing. “I'm not too fussed about what other people have thought about stuff, but my motivation is just as high to try and win again.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Adrian Newey's first Aston Martin F1 car was formally presented in Saudi Arabia on Monday evening. Adrian Newey has described the “emotional journey of passion” behind his very first Aston Martin design, while praising the team for the “huge strides” they are making in terms of working together more cohesively. F1 design guru Newey joined Aston Martin early last year and played a pivotal role in the newly-launched AMR26, which appeared for the first time at the Barcelona Shakedown and was officially presented in Saudi Arabia on Monday. [When] we ran the car briefly at Barcelona for a day and a half, it was all black, partly in truth because we didn't have time to paint it! “Funnily enough, Lawrence [Stroll, Aston Martin team owner] and I, when it first pulled out of the garage, with Lance [Stroll] driving, we were standing next to each other in the pit lane, and I think we were both quite close to having a tear in our eye. Since his time onboard, and around that recent managerial reshuffle, Newey believes the workforce at Aston Martin's state-of-the-art Silverstone headquarters have become a more unified and effective team. Lawrence's vision and investment into this building have given us, without doubt, the best facilities in F1, and that's a tremendous asset. “But it's clearly only one part of the equation. Aston Martin are now turning their attention towards this week's opening pre-season test at the Bahrain International Circuit, where the F1 grid will continue to learn about their 2026 challengers. While Newey's AMR26 attracted plenty of attention and comments at the Barcelona Shakedown, the Briton is keeping expectations in check ahead of the campaign getting under way – while stressing how quickly cars are likely to change in the first year of a new ruleset. “I think this year there's likely to be a huge amount of development. I would imagine that for many teams, including to an extent ourselves, the car that they ran in Barcelona will be a fair bit different to the car they actually race in Melbourne. That [development] pace, I'm sure, will continue through the season.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Colapinto: 'Personal priority is to get a lot of mileage' Whether you want to plan a full-throttle day out or something a little more low-key, Valentine's Day is the perfect excuse to celebrate your shared love of Formula 1 with your friends or significant other. Now, this doesn't have to mean candlelit dinners and soppy playlists – especially if Formula 1 plays a big part in your relationship! Whether you bonded over cancelling Sunday plans for race day, have heated strategy debates or even argue about your favourite circuits, there are plenty of ways to put a little (or large!) Start off with a Grand Prix-inspired menu – whether it be an Italian night for Monza or Imola, tacos and margaritas for Mexico, or an Australian-inspired spread to mark the pending season opener in Melbourne. and suddenly dinner transports you straight to the circuit. Thankfully, sometimes the best date night doesn't even need a reservation. Grab some popcorn, dim the lights and settle in for a movie night. Front-row seats and full control of the rewind button – what more could you want? If you're feeling crafty and after a Valentine's date idea that's low-pressure but still super meaningful, making F1-inspired beaded bracelets is always a winner. Settle in with some snacks, and pick your favourite drivers' names or numbers, team colours, or even some iconic meme quotes to adorn your accessory! If you or your partner fancies yourselves a budding engineer, why not fuel that passion by spending the evening crafting your favourite teams' F1 car... in LEGO of course! Every team is represented, and sets range from quick builds to something a little more time consuming – so there's something to suit every skill level. Put some music on, pour a drink, and see which of you has the patience and precision of a race engineer! If you're up for getting out and doing something a little different, here are some ways to spend the evening out together: If you're both missing F1 (and let's face it, who isn't? ), the F1 Arcade makes for a really fun Valentine's date. With F1 Arcades in London, Birmingham, Boston, Atlanta, Washington, Philadelphia, Denver and Las Vegas it is the perfect way to get a mid-winter motorsport fix. Jump into the simulators, have a laugh comparing lap times, then slow things down a little with good food, cocktails and music once the racing's done. If you are a competitive couple, then how better to celebrate Valentines Day than going up against each other on track? If you're the kind of couple who loves a romantic getaway, then we reckon this one could be hard to beat. A table at Ristorante Cavallino in Maranello sits right next to Ferrari's base, and that alone gives the evening a sense of occasion, not just for the Tifosi, but any motorsport fan. Jet off to Italy, soak up the country's deep-rooted love for motorsport and turn the dinner into one stop on a longer adventure. With Florence, Venice and Bologna all within reach, it's easy to imagine this becoming the start of a memorable Italian road trip! Though slightly unconventional, an F1-themed wedding doesn't get more on-brand than saying “I do” at the Las Vegas Grand Prix over race weekend! While some decide to get married on impulse during the weekend itself, others plan the whole trip around their wedding, making it a perfect Valentine's Day idea to start plotting together. And who knows... maybe a rogue F1 driver will even pop up to officiate your ceremony (we're looking at you Valtteri Bottas!) Picking a Grand Prix that you are both itching to attend and imagining yourselves trackside gets the excitement levels rising after a few months without racing.</p>
