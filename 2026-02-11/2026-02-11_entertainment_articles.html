                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>If you watched the Super Bowl on Sunday, you had your pick of dystopian advertising campaigns to fixate on, be they AI-generated spots for vodka or ads about how we're all poor and unhealthy. The ad purports to use AI and cameras across neighborhoods to help find lost dogs and surely not for any other sinister reason. “Neither Ring's products nor business model are built around finding lost pets, but rather creating a lucrative mass surveillance network by turning private homes into surveillance outposts, and well-meaning neighbors into informants for ICE and other government agencies,” says WeRateDogs' Matt Nelson in a clip posted to Bluesky. “Ring has stated that it does not have a partnership with ICE. They do however have a partnership with Flock Safety, a private surveillance firm and license plate tracking system that provides data, including Ring footage, to law enforcement agencies through a warrantless and anonymous community request service, which is then turned over to ICE, the FBI, and even the Navy.” Nelson then goes on to cite a report from 404 Media, published in May, demonstrating how ICE has already been using this data. As the video also points out, it's not even particularly good at finding dogs. The commercial claims to find one lost dog per day, which accounts for 0.03% of the lost dog reports filed to Ring annually. “If you are genuinely concerned about keeping your pets safe and maximizing your chances of finding them if they're lost, get them microchipped,” the video concludes. “You can do this at any vet and even some shelters.

While Sundance 2026 is already in our rearview, some of the best films of the previous year's festival are just now getting ready to come out for wider audiences. That includes Cole Webley's heartbreaking John Magaro-starrer “Omaha,” which premiered in competition at last year's festival and will hit theaters this spring. What begins as a seemingly spontaneous trip gradually reveals deeper emotional stakes, as his daughter Ella begins to sense that her father may be carrying a more complicated truth.” As I wrote in my own Sundance review of the film, “For a good portion of Cole Webley's feature directorial debut, ‘Omaha,‘ we remain as in the dark about what's happening as the pair of plucky kid stars (Molly Belle Wright and Wyatt Solis) who serve as two members of the tight-knit family trio at its center. That's a feature, not a bug, as Robert Machoian's screenplay may be steady in doling out information and clever in what it obscures, but those choices put the audience on even keel with the heart of this heartbreaking family drama.” The film‘s performances truly recommend it, and I also noted that “Magaro's performance … teeters between moments of profound grief and a hard-won desire to show his kids a good time. As they slip through roadside gas stations, he pauses for fast food, ice cream, kite-flying, and more, all set against the starkly beautiful American West. … While Magaro's performance anchors the film, strong turns from both Wright and Solis give added depth. So too does Webley and [screenwriter Robert] Machoian's obvious interest in their young characters' perspectives and experience; ‘Omaha' is often not just seen, but felt through their eyes.” … I get that this movie will not be for every human out there, but … the thing that's right under the surface for us is how much we love our families. Those accolades include: a best film (first features) win at the Jakarta World Cinema festival, a jury prize from the Deauville American Film Festival, an audience award at Nashville, grand jury and best feature win at DIFF, the Jordan Ressler First Feature Award at Miami, and a raft of wins at the Richmond International Film Festival (including a grand jury prize for best feature, best director for Webley, best actor for Magaro, best acting, and Rising Star awards for both Solis and Wright).

The Berlin Film Festival is upon us, with more than 200 films in all shapes, sizes, and forms coming to Germany from February 12 – 22. Unlike some of the other majors, Berlin is known for celebrating nonfiction filmmaking across its competition sections. The Panorama section, bent around unconventional international fare, brings at least one docufiction standout to Berlin this month: “Tristan Forever.” It hails from the writing/directing team of Tobias Nölle and Loran Bonnardot, but is in fact about Bonnardot itself. IndieWire reveals the trailer and more exclusive details below. For 30 years, Bonnardot, a doctor from Paris, maintained a friendship with a fisherman from Tristan da Cunha, known as the most isolated island in the world, deep out in the South Atlantic Ocean. The film follows Bonnardot on one last trek, and this time he hopes to stay there forever. But will the selective island council of just 230 people accept him? Related Stories ‘Omaha' Trailer: A Heartbreaking John Magaro Anchors This Festival Favorite ‘The Singers' Trailer: An Oscar Short Nominee for Our Times, from a Story Written in 1850 “What drives a doctor from Paris to embrace such an isolated community, and what compels these islanders to live so removed from the outside world? The volcanic island has become Loran's spiritual refuge, its inhabitants his chosen family and the fisherman Martin his best friend. A film that pursues the question of where one's soul belongs, oscillating between documentary, fiction and the dreams of its protagonist.” “Tristan Forever” premieres Sunday, February 15, in the Berlin Film Festival‘s Panorama section. Rediance is handling international sales as the film, which blends documentary and narrative, seeks worldwide distribution.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Lana Del Rey and husband Jeremy Dufrene enjoyed a date night at the Ralph Lauren fall 2026 fashion show at NYC's Jack Shainman Gallery Tuesday evening, dressed in matching distressed leather jackets from the all-American fashion label. The “Summertime Sadness” songstress paired her archival blazer with a romantic ruffled top, bias-cut embroidered skirt, cowboy boots and cascading curls, while her swamp-tour-guide spouse teamed his worn-in jacket with dark denim, wraparound sunglasses and a Double RL trucker hat. We spied the usually-private duo posing for plenty of photos together on the step-and-repeat, even sharing a sweet kiss for the cameras before heading to their seats. Post-show, they stuck around to chat with fellow showgoers and well-wishers. They weren't the only famous couple in Ralph's front row; Anne Hathaway brought along husband Adam Shulman, while Rebecca Hall was joined by spouse Morgan Spector. Other celebs in attendance included Lili Reinhart, Ariana DeBose, Emilia Jones and Diana Silvers. The bride said “I do” wearing a custom dress from LA-based label Cinq featuring a lacy ruffled neckline and softly gathered tulle skirt punctuated with feminine bows. Jeremy said, ‘I work with alligators—I have tough skin,'” Del Rey told W in 2025. “And he is a man of his word.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The film seems destined to slide comfortably into streaming libraries beside its primary influences—namely, the works of Michael Mann and William Friedkin, which is not bad company to keep. Yet this proximity inevitably invites comparisons to those directors' filmographies, and after two-and-a-half hours of watching Chris Hemsworth's posh, morally gray, crisis-stricken jewel thief grimace his way through sleek L.A., the parallels won't always be flattering. Taken on its own merits, Crime 101 is a sturdy offering for those who miss losing an afternoon at the movies with a reasonably engrossing drama made for adults. Adapting Don Winslow's novella, Layton delivers a mannered, sober crime saga stripped of ostentation and notable for its uncommonly polite genre restraint. It's less interested in shocking or scandalizing the viewer than hanging out with them for a spell. Considering the cast of heavyweights with whom Hemsworth keeps company—Halle Berry as an insurance agent whose days of wooing the elite are wearing thin, Mark Ruffalo as a rumpled cat-dad detective, Nick Nolte as a fence who conducts business at noodle stands—that's an invitation worth accepting. This is not to say there isn't violence or sex in Crime 101; both are present, but they're calibrated to sustain tension or deepen character, not titillate genre hounds out for a fresh jolt. Layton proves adept at keeping his drama at a simmer—boosted by the thrumming moodiness of Blanck Mass' score, it's almost a cinch—yet he rarely lets it boil over. It's fitting, then, that Mike finds himself searching for an off-ramp from this lone-wolf criminal career, and not a moment too soon; unbeknownst to him, his route has already attracted the attention of Detective Lubesnick (Ruffalo), who needs to collar the serial thief to salvage both his career and what remains of his self-worth, both diminished by advancing middle age and an image-conscious LAPD. Mike's longstanding dealings with his fence, Money (Nolte), are already fractured by the film's opening sequence, a street-level robbery that begins smooth as silk but takes a sudden turn when Mike—distracted by too many variables—misses a hidden gun during the holdup, and the shot goes off too close to its mark. Secondary characters—like Maya (Monica Barbaro), who falls for Mike despite his spartan, serial-killer digs and economical relationship with the truth, and Ormon (Keoghan), that squirrelly robber who seethes under a motorcycle helmet and shadows Mike in anticipation of his next heist—are more vaguely rendered. While this sketchiness feels deliberate in Ormon's case (he's plainly engineered to fit the Waingro wild-card role from Heat), he instead comes off like a refugee from a Temu production of Good Time. This remoteness actually complements the frustratingly elusive Mike, who smolders just fine when Hemsworth is in Blackhat mode, but appears merely to sulk when Layton's screenplay attempts to elucidate his inner turmoil. When Crime 101 finally pulls into its soft landing, it feels right that Layton leaves behind no lasting scars; with well-crafted characters like Sharon around, we naturally want them to get away clean.

                </div>
                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The actor turned filmmaker starts off her Wuthering Heights — the gajillionth take on Emily Brontë's swooning Gothic novel, yet somehow the first one to feature Heathcliff sniffing his true love's fingers after catching her in onanistic interlude — with the sound of heavy breathing and rapid moaning. The average viewer imagines all sort of carnal activities happening, titillated by what might appear onscreen once the visuals kick in. What greets us is the sight of a public hanging. A mass of men, women, and children watch as the hooded figure twitches and jerks on the end of a rope. Several boys point out that the convict has a “stiffy” as he prepares to shuffle off this mortal coil. No sooner has this public execution ended than we cut to a couple getting extremely hot and heavy right by the gallows. They may be fucking around, but Fennell is not. Here, there is no petite mort or grande mort, just Thanatos and Eros high-fiving each other on the Yorkshire Dales. There are better adaptations of Wuthering Heights, and there are far, far worse adaptations of Wuthering Heights. Yet you will certainly not find a hornier version of this material than Fennell's fast-and-loose spin on the torrid tale of Heathcliff and Catherine, childhood pals turned paramours who can never truly be together and genuinely can't keep their hands off each other. It may in fact be the horniest literary adaptation ever made. So is the sense that repression, revenge, and a ridiculous amount of irony must inevitably give way to sex. A long time ago, young Cathy (Charlotte Mellington) lived with her wastrel of a father, Mr. Earnshaw (Martin Clunes), and her companion Nelly (Vy Nguyen) at the manor known as Wuthering Heights. One night, Earnshaw goes out for his evening's gambling and degeneracy and returns the next morning with a new resident for the household. He had been aghast to see a young boy being beaten in the street (“This isn't Liverpool!” the old man exclaims. “Or Bristol!”), and has brought the child home to live with them. Cathy calls him “Heathcliff,” after her late brother. Mr. Earnshaw wields his charity like a cudgel with the lad, and occasionally beats him with much less metaphorical blunt instruments. But the two youngsters couldn't be closer. When filmmakers have tried to skew slightly earthier, as in Jacques Rivette's 1985 version, the result is a sort of grungy take on traditional Gothic tropes. Other versions, like Andrea Arnold's brilliant 2011 stab at adapting Brontë's parable, push the book's racial aspects and class divide to the forefront. Fennell's interpretation is all about channeling pleasure — the sexual pleasure of abandoning yourself to amour fou, of course, with a strong emphasis on the fou. The squish of strongly kneaded dough is amplified in a way to make palms sweat. Sight and sound are all extra-ribbed for your you-know-what, but the movie is sensual in a way that aims to engage not just eyes and ears, but all of the senses at once. Broken eggs placed in bed as a prank are an excuse for Heathcliff to let the goo drip suggestively across his calloused hand. Wallpaper is crafted to replicate a young woman's skin, complete with freckles. Unsettled Debts and Sugar Babies Create Chaos in ‘Euphoria' Season 3 Trailer Charli XCX Stomps on a Table and Breaks the ‘Chains of Love' in New Music Video Jacob Elordi Teases ‘Incredible' ‘Euphoria' Season 3: ‘I'm Really Excited' When we talk about this Wuthering Heights years from now, we may dutifully note the fleeting look that passes across Robbie's face when she hears Heathcliff joke about taking a woman in town as a wife. Or mention the manner in which Elordi somehow defies basic physics and lifts Robbie up by her corset strings. Cathy peers down at them through a hole in the floorboards. Right as they began to consummate their after-hours affair, a hand goes across Cathy's mouth. It's shortly after that standout scene of voyeurism and libidinous stirrings that Heathcliff overhears a conversation between Cathy and Nelly (now played by Hong Chau) about a marriage proposal his beloved has received from their rich neighbor, Edgar Linton (Shazad Latif). He returns years later, having made his fortune and become the owner of Wuthering Heights. Edgar becomes collateral damage in this roundelay of forbidden passions. So does Isabella (Alison Oliver), a young woman living in Cathy's house who's smitten with Heathcliff. It will all end badly, as so many tales of moral trespasses in the Victorian era must. Britney Spears Sells Rights to Her Entire Music Catalog All of the Hidden Symbols and Meanings You May Have Missed in Bad Bunny's Super Bowl Set Pearl Jam Is ‘Between Eras' But ‘Excited About the Future,' Eddie Vedder Says Robbie has always been the type of actor who knows how to shift subtly in a way that lets a camera capture the alchemy of conflicting emotions, which comes in handy as a counterpoint to the big swings happening behind that camera. (See that aforementioned fleeting look of worry over losing Heathcliff to a townie.) She leaves her mark on Cathy, a role that requires no shortage of blushing cheeks and hands on feverish foreheads. He's an ideal candidate for a “hero” characterized by mercurial moods and furrowed brows and inspiring irresistible longing, able to come off as forlorn one moment and Fuckboi of the Year the next. This is his second turn as a Gothic-lit protagonist after last year's Frankenstein, and at this juncture, he may as well start going down the list and checking off the genre's tortured souls. Having hit the ground running with the one-two punch of Promising Young Woman (2020) and Saltburn (2023), Fennell immediately showed a knack for provocation and a willingness to poke social-issue bears, even if the aim-to-grasp ratio tended to fall short. Satire is not what you would call her strength. But overheated, hyperventilating melodrama suits her quite nicely, and though her adaptation takes more liberties with Brontë's novel than a stablehand does with a bondage-loving housemaid, she's an expert at whipping up flurries. It may not be enough to simply give folks the same old mix of shirtless chores and furtive glances, dark shadows and whipping winds — in other words, yet another prestige take on a canonized-in-amber work of fiction. Perhaps a more perverse, expressionistic route is required. Rolling Stone is a part of Penske Media Corporation.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni seemed to be on the same fashion wavelength as they arrived at an NYC courthouse Wednesday for the start of a heated legal battle. The duo — who have been locked in a public dispute since before their 2024 film “It Ends With Us” hit theaters — showed up in coordinating outfits for the occasion, both wearing army green jackets punctuated with pops of pink. Lively suited up in an oversized blazer and pants paired with a light green striped sweater, which was layered over a pink striped button-up shirt. The 38-year-old actress, who played a flower shop owner in the film and incorporated florals into many of her “It Ends With Us” press looks, added a pink floral pin to her jacket pocket. She carried a matching green suede bag and wore boots in the same shade. Lively's husband, Ryan Reynolds, was not with the star as she entered the closed hearing, but it's possible she chose to channel her spouse at court; Reynolds wore a similar green suit and floral accent to the New York premiere of “It Ends With Us” in August 2024. His wife, Emily Baldoni, went monochromatic in a tan coat and beige sweater dress. There has been much back-and-forth between Baldoni and Lively, who starred in the Colleen Hoover novel adaptation and clashed behind the scenes. In December 2024, Lively filed a lawsuit against Baldoni, accusing him of sexual harassment, which he vehemently denied. Unsealed communications have drawn several A-listers into the case, including Taylor Swift, Scarlett Johansson and Ben Affleck.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Paging Dr. Kay Scarpetta — we're gonna need you to scrub back in for this one. The adaptation of Patricia Cornwell's best-selling novels unfolds across two timelines. The first tracks a young Kay Scarpetta (Rosy McEwen) from her beginnings as a chief medical examiner in the late '90s; the second flashes forward to Kay's present-day (Kidman) return to her hometown, where she resumes her former position while investigating a grisly murder. Kay's sister Dorothy, played by Amanda Righetti (young) and Jamie Lee Curtis, wishes she wouldn't. The forensic crime thriller was adapted for streaming by Liz Sarnoff (Barry, Lost). “As Scarpetta pursues justice, she must navigate complicated relationships, including the fraught dynamic with her sister Dorothy Farinelli, confront long-held professional and personal grudges, and face secrets that threaten to unravel everything she's built.” More than 120 million copies of Cornwell's novels have been sold worldwide since the Kay Scarpetta character's debut in 1990. David Gordon Green directed five episodes and is executive producer alongside Amy Sayres.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Nicole Kidman is Dr. Kay Scarpetta, a medical examiner trying to unmask a serial killer in the upcoming Prime Video series Scarpetta, premiering March 11. Based on Patricia Cornwell's bestselling Kay Scarpetta book series, Scarpetta centers on the titular character, an unrelenting medical examiner, who, with skilled hands and an unnerving eye, is determined to serve as the voice of the victims, unmask a serial killer, and prove that her career-making case from 28 years prior isn't also her undoing. Prime Video Greenlights Adaptation Of Chloe Walsh's BookTok Sensation 'Boys Of Tommen' As Internationals Boss Nicole Clemens Sets Out Stall 'Spider-Noir' Unveils New Photos Of Nicolas Cage's The Spider, Robbie Robertson, Cat Hardy & Janet Not only is Scarpetta pursuing justice, but she's also navigating complicated relationships like the fraught dynamic with her sister Dorothy Farinelli (Jamie Lee Curtis). As you can see in the trailer, the leading cast is stacked with multiple award nominees and winners, including Bobby Cannavale as Detective Pete Marino, with Simon Baker as FBI profiler Benton Wesley, and Ariana DeBose as Kay's tech-savvy niece Lucy Watson. The additional cast includes Rosy McEwen, Amanda Righetti, Jake Cannavale, and Hunter Parrish, who portray the past versions of Kidman, Curtis, Cannavale, and Baker's characters, respectively.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As law enforcement work tirelessly to locate her, new details have emerged suggesting she was forcibly taken from her home in Arizona. A spotlight has been shone on the Guthrie family, and this is everything to know about Nancy's late husband, Charles Guthrie. After Charles' untimely passing, Nancy raised their children alone. “We lost my dad suddenly and shockingly,” Savannah said in a 2023 interview, CNN reports. Charles passed away in 1988 from a heart attack, People reports. At the time of his death, Savannah was 16 and in high school. I think about him all the time,” she said. He told us things that I didn't understand at the time but later would remember, long after he died.” In an interview with People in February 2024, Savannah spoke about the impact of her father's death on the family. “The loss of my father was shocking and devastating. It cracked open our family and crushed us,” she said. Born in December 2016, he is named Charles Max Guthrie Feldman, but the couple affectionately calls him Charley. In a 2014 essay for “Today,” Savannah Guthrie shared insights into who her father was and the qualities he possessed. “My father was a seemingly unlikely mix of qualities: always strong, sometimes terrifying, loyal to the end, and disarmingly gentle and tender when it counted,” she said. “He was also tall, affectionate and funny; he had that personality that people describe as ‘lighting up the room.'

In another interview, “Carlos” said his wife was the one driving when authorities pulled them over. “Once I saw they were following me, I pulled over,” he told ABC15 Arizona reporter Ford Hatchett outside of the detention center. “They didn't even have to put a traffic stop or anything. I got off the car, and they arrested me as soon as I got out of the car.” He added that authorities didn't tell him what was going on until detectives arrived. “They told me I was being detained for kidnapping. When asked about the Pima County Sheriff's Department's announcement that a person of interest had been detained, he admitted he was “not happy” about becoming involved. The FBI is still offering a $50,000 reward for information about Nancy or her abductor. Shortly after the release of surveillance images and video, Savannah Guthrie reposted them on her Instagram, saying, “We believe she is still alive.

Gugu is almost 12 years old and, like many Brazilian kids, dreams of becoming a soccer player. His grandmother Dilma cares for the boy, with her warmth and open-mindedness, giving him the space to be – well, simply himself. But subtle changes begin to shake up their routines, and Dilma becomes increasingly frail. Worried that he could lose the only safe space he has ever known, Gugu becomes more and more determined to keep his and his grandmother's world intact. Berlin Competition: Ilker Catak on 'Yellow Letters' and Why Artists Must Show Spine Timing Is Everything: Berlin's Market Opens With Full Pockets, Big Packages and New Buyers Deberton directed Gugu's World based on a script by André Araújo. THR can premiere an exclusive trailer for Gugu's World, inviting you into a world of tenderness coming under threat. What moved me first was the idea of a child who doesn't yet have the words to name who he is, but already feels that something essential is at risk. Gugu lives in a fragile balance between affection and fear of losing the only place where he feels protected and understood. The relationship with his grandmother is central because it represents unconditional care, even when it is imperfect or unspoken. I was drawn to that emotional territory: a queer childhood lived through gestures, silences and imagination, rather than declarations. This felt very honest, delicate, and close to my own childhood memories, and also to those of André Araújo, the screenwriter. Childhood, the desire to belong, fear of loss, and affection are emotions that can be recognized anywhere in the world. How did you find Yuri as your young star? Finding Yuri was a long and very careful process. Together with Luciana Vieira, our casting director, we were looking not only for a talented child actor, but for someone with emotional openness, imagination, and a strong on-screen presence. A combination of vulnerability and vitality that felt perfect for Gugu. It was beautiful to see how naturally he connected with Teca Pereira and Lázaro Ramos. How do you think about music and its importance in film? My uncle, who helped raise me, worked producing cassette tapes with hits, and I would listen to those songs sitting on his lap. “Time After Time” (Cyndi Lauper) and “Sentimental Demais” (Altemar Dutra) were part of that universe, and in Gugu's World these songs, together with contemporary Brazilian hits, help us enter both Gugu's inner and outer worlds. Is there anything else you would like to highlight? Gugu's World is the result of an intense collaboration across many departments, and we are very proud of the team we assembled. I was fortunate to find producing partners such as Karen Castanho, Bianca Villar, Fernando Fraiha, João Macedo, Marcelo Pinheiro, Fred Burle, Ariadne Mazzetti, and Lázaro Ramos.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In the days since, police officials and federal agents have aided in efforts to locate the 84-year-old woman, who is believed to have been taken from her home against her will. Here's everything we know about the search and disappearance, so far. On Feb. 3, Donald Trump told reporters at a bill signing that he would be willing to commit additional federal resources as the search continues, according to Variety, noting that it is a “very unusual situation, but we're going to find out.” On Feb. 1, Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos said that while it is “not standard” to have homicide detectives assist on a missing person's case, or to even have the sheriff involved, “the scene at the house also has some concerns for us.” It could take a number of days for the DNA results to return. “It is a race against time, and I hope that window hasn't closed.” He added: “We believe [Nancy] was taken out of the home against her will, and that's how this investigation is moving.” Authorities in Pima County are helming the search with assistance from the FBI. “They're the lead right now and we have to respect that, but we are there to help them anywhere we can on ransom notes or otherwise,” FBI Director Kash Patel said during an appearance on Fox News. Patel added that local authorities notified the FBI of an alleged ransom note received. “Every lead and tip is important; we are aggressively pursuing and looking into every single one,” said John Edwards, the assistant special agent leading the FBI office in Tucson. 88-CRIME is offering a $2,500 reward for information leading to an arrest or arrests in Nancy's disappearance. The Pima County Sheriff's Department is asking those with potential evidence to submit it via an online tip portal put in place on Feb. 1. They are searching for images and videos that could aid in the investigation. It is not known what she was wearing at the time of her disappearance. Nancy does not suffer from cognitive issues, which allowed authorities to rule out the potential of this being a case of someone with dementia wandering off. She does have some mobility issues and requires daily medication, Nanos previously said, adding that missing doses could be life-threatening. According to CNN, through a source briefed on the investigation, Nancy's pacemaker sent a signal to her iPhone on Sunday, Feb. 1, at around 2 a.m. Nancy's iPhone was also discovered to have been left at her home. While detectives are no longer operating at her home as an active scene, they did note that there were signs of forced entry. Person of Interest Detained in Connection With Nancy Guthrie's Disappearance Is Released Savannah Guthrie Calls on Public for Help Finding Missing Mom: ‘We Are in an Hour of Desperation' Savannah Guthrie Tells Mother's Suspected Kidnappers ‘We Will Pay' in New Video On the morning of Wednesday, Feb. 4, the Pima County Sheriff's Department issued a statement on X clarifying that “at this point, investigators have not identified a suspect or person of interest in this case.” This came after unverified reports made unsupported claims about members of the Guthrie family. That evening on Wednesday, Guthrie and her two siblings, Annie and Camron, posted a tearful video, in which they spoke directly to Nancy's kidnapper. “We live in a world where voices and images are easily manipulated. Nanos also revealed at the latest press hearing that there is currently no suspect or person of interest. Though someone was detected on a camera in the home, Nanos noted this could have been an animal, and that there was no point of forced entry in Nancy's home. Blood detected by the front door was identified as Nancy's, while other items that were submitted haven't been returned yet. There were multiple ransom letters reported; the FBI confirmed that one was an imposter and another had details with facts that appeared to be connected to their investigation. According to authorities, the Guthrie family has not been given proof of life. Before Nanos took questions from the press, FBI special agent Heith Janke said there was now a $50,000 reward. “This is an 84-year-old grandma that needs vital medication for her wellbeing. Guthrie and her siblings have continued to plead for their mother's safe return in videos shared on Instagram. We beg you now to return our mother to us so that we can celebrate with her.” Guthrie nor authorities have detailed the message they received. On Feb. 9, Guthrie asked for the public's help in locating her mother. The “previously inaccessible” images were uncovered after authorities spent several days working with “private sector partners” to recover any images or video footage from Nancy's home that “may have been lost, corrupted or inaccessible due to a variety of factors, including the removal of recording devices.” The video that these images came form, the department said, was “recovered from residual data located in backend systems.” Bring her home,” wrote Savannah in the caption, directing anyone with information to contact police. Along with the new images, Fox News reported that authorities had started taking DNA samples from people who were working near Nancy's home. The news suggested that police had uncovered DNA belonging to someone other than Nancy at the crime scene, and that they were looking to eliminate new suspects or possibly generate fresh leads.This article was updated with information from the latest press conference on Feb. 5.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Expressing anger over Wasserman's apology, in which the executive said he “deeply regret[s]” his communications with Maxwell, Cosentino called for Wasserman to step down from his post and for the agency to change its name, among other demands. Since Cosentino's Instagram post went live, several more artists — mainly indie acts — have responded to the controversy. Though these responses have varied somewhat, most have either announced their exit from the agency over the revelations or seemingly threatened to leave if Wasserman isn't held accountable for his actions. The growing number of artist defections is now continuing to snowball into a major issue for Wasserman and his namesake agency, which represents such superstars as Ed Sheeran, Coldplay, SZA, Noah Kahan, Lorde and Kenny Chesney. Will any of those other big acts follow Roan's lead? Below, we've rounded up every Wasserman artist who has spoken out on the issue. We'll continue updating the list as more of them make their feelings known. No artist, agent or employee should ever be expected to defend or overlook actions that conflict so deeply with our own moral values. “My heartfelt thanks goes out to my personal team, some of whom I have respected, trusted and worked with for close to a decade. Brown, vocalist of the indie duo, slammed Wasserman's apology in an Instagram post, writing that his “‘deepest regrets' and PR apologies mean nothing in the wake of violence against women and children caused by Jeffrey Epstein, Ghislaine Maxwell, and their accomplices. We cannot live in a world that allows for this injustice to occur with no consequence. Brown added that she, her bandmate Nick Amos and their manager “have no interest in being affiliated with Casey Wasserman and have absolutely zero intention of condoning his actions by silently remaining under his namesake banner. “Continuing to be represented by a company led by and named after Casey Wasserman goes against our values and cannot continue,” the statement continued. For the sake of his staff we hope that he steps down from the company and it is rebranded, but until that happens or we find a new home at a new agency we will not continue to be associated with Wasserman.” On Monday (Feb. 9), the rock band released a statement on Instagram, writing that its members were “hugely disappointed and disgusted” to learn of Wasserman's association with Maxwell, adding that his “actions are abhorrent and disturbing on every level” and that he must “remove himself and his name from the agency.” In a long and wide-ranging Instagram post on Monday (Feb. 9), Alexis Krauss, one-half of the duo Sleigh Bells, said that while she would “love to just leave Wasserman Music” over the revelations, she and her bandmate Derek E. Miller would not “because I love and respect our agent and I trust him to make the decision that is best for himself, his family and his artists. Krauss added, “In my opinion it's not the responsibility of the artists, especially those struggling to make a living, to fix these broken systems. I'm not saying we're powerless, but without systemic change and accountability for those at the highest levels of power, no meaningful change is going to occur. … None of these corporations are going to bat an eye if Sleigh Bells bails on them. It'll just leave us losing more money on tour and making less streaming income than we do now. The pop duo, composed of Amelia Meath and Nick Sanborn, announced that it had left the agency following the revelations about Wasserman, writing that they are “so reprehensible that we can no longer allow our work to have any association with him or his name. We have been with our amazing agent for our entire career (since way before Wasserman acquired their former company in 2021), but she is just one of hundreds of brilliant agents, assistants, and other employees whose lives have been completely upended by both his behavior and his inability to be accountable of this actions. “In light of the deeply disturbing news that has come to life regarding Casey Wasserman, I will no longer be represented by the agency,” she wrote. “It is devastating to witness how power in this industry is so often protected from accountability for choices that cause irreversible harm, and I will not tolerate it. “I want to be clear that there are many good and trustworthy people at Wasserman whose lives and livelihoods have been collaterally impacted by this. I know many within the organization are equally enraged and devastated by what has come to light. “I am currently working closely with my team as we take the proper next steps to appropriately restructure moving forward.” Later in her statement, Perez added a note of support for the agency's staff, writing that they “deserve the space to determine how they move through this transition with my support. One man's actions should not define or dismantle the futures of so many honest and dedicated individuals. Lazy reporting, This is not ‘every artist' that has spoken out.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Kid Rock is clarifying a few key details about Turning Point's “All-American Halftime Show” after some people accused him of lip-synching during the program held on Super Bowl Sunday. In a video posted to Instagram on Tuesday (Feb. 10) — two days after the inaugural event was broadcasted between halves of the Big Game — the musician denied using a pre-recorded track to fake his vocals, but confirmed that his performance was pre-taped rather than aired live. “If I was ever going to lip-synch, which I wouldn't, that would be the last song I would ever … do it to,” Kid Rock explained in the clip, in which he stands next to his DJ, Paradime, who performed with him for Turning Point. “We've performed this song every night on tour since 1998.” “It's extremely difficult for them to line up the sync,” Kid Rock conceded, noting he feels “confident” it would have come together perfectly if the editors had been given more time. Also in the video, Kid Rock and Paradime demonstrated how tricky “Bawitdaba” is to perform live, with the DJ needing to fill in some lines for the hip-hop/country star so he can take enough breaths in between bars. Nevertheless, Kid Rock says he executed it live while pre-filming the Turning Point show and blamed “fake news media” for spreading misinformation about him lip-synching. “The problem is people amplify this all over the internet … they did it to Bad Bunny, in his defense,” he said in the clip, referencing how some people took it seriously when Benito joked on Saturday Night Live that everyone had “four months to learn” Spanish before his Super Bowl Halftime Show. Kid Rock was just one of several artists on the bill for the “All-American Halftime Show,” which Turning Point hosted for the first time ever to counterprogram against Bad Bunny's official NFL halftime show (which, for comparison, was performed live on the field at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, Calif., on Feb. 8). Brantley Gilbert, Lee Brice and Gabby Barrett also shared the Turning Point USA stage for the alternate mid-game concert, which drew in about 6.1 million concurrent live viewers.
