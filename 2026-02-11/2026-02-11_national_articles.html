                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>FBI agents were going door to door in Annie Guthrie's neighborhood Tuesday afternoon, briefly speaking to residents as the search for Nancy Guthrie continues. A person was detained for questioning Tuesday in the kidnapping of Nancy Guthrie, hours after the FBI released surveillance videos of a masked person wearing a handgun holster outside Guthrie's front door the night she vanished from her Arizona home. The department and the FBI were also conducting a court-authorized search Tuesday night at a location in Rio Rico, about an hour's drive south of Tucson. Authorities investigating the disappearance of Nancy Guthrie more than a week ago released the first surveillance images Tuesday, showing a masked person on her porch the night she went missing. Sheriff's officials block the entrance to a road where a home was being searched in Rio Rico, Arizona, on Tuesday, Feb. 10, 2026, in connection to the investigation of Nancy Guthrie's disappearance. An investigator looks inside a culvert in the neighborhood where Annie Guthrie, whose mother Nancy Guthrie has been missing for more than a week, lives just outside Tucson, Ariz., on Tuesday, Feb. 10, 2026. TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) — Fresh surveillance images from Nancy Guthrie's porch the night she went missing, coupled with intense police activity across Arizona and the detention of a man had raised hopes that authorities were nearing a major break. By Wednesday, however, the man said he had been released after questioning, leaving it unclear where the investigation stood into last week's disappearance of Guthrie, the 84-year-old mother of “Today” show host Savannah Guthrie. FBI agents fanned out across a neighborhood about a mile from Guthrie's home on Wednesday morning, knocking on doors and searching through the dense desert terrain filled with cactus, bushes and boulders. The man told several media outlets early Wednesday that he was released after several hours and had nothing to do with Guthrie's disappearance last week. Authorities have not said what led them to stop the man Tuesday night and had not confirmed he was released. The sheriff's department said its deputies and FBI agents also searched a location in Rio Rico, a city south of Tucson where the man lives. Until Tuesday, it seemed authorities were making little headway in determining what happened to her or finding who was responsible. But the images did not show what happened to her or help determine whether she is still alive. FBI Director Kash Patel said investigators spent days trying to find lost, corrupted or inaccessible images. Authorities have said for more than a week that they believe Nancy Guthrie was taken against her will. She was last seen at home Jan. 31 and reported missing the next day. DNA tests showed blood on her porch was hers, authorities said. Savannah Guthrie posted the new surveillance images on social media and said the family believes their mother is still alive. It is not known whether ransom notes demanding money with deadlines that have already passed were authentic, and whether the family has had any contact with whoever took Guthrie. TMZ reported it received a message Wednesday from someone claiming to know the kidnapper's identity and that they unsuccessfully tried to reach Savannah Guthrie's brother and sister. The FBI did not immediately respond to a message. Authorities have said Nancy Guthrie takes several medications and there was concern from the start that she could die without them.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Federal Aviation Administration reopened the airspace around El Paso International Airport in Texas on Wednesday morning, just hours after it announced a 10-day closure that would have grounded all flights to and from the airport.

Passengers wait in line at the El Paso International Airport after all flights were grounded on Wednesday, Feb. 11, 2026. ▶ Follow live updates on the airspace around El Paso WASHINGTON (AP) — The sudden and surprising airspace closure over El Paso, Texas, stemmed from the Pentagon's plans to test a laser for use in shooting down drones used by Mexican drug cartels, according to three people familiar with the situation who were granted anonymity to share sensitive details. That caused friction with the Federal Aviation Administration, which wanted to ensure commercial air safety and the two agencies sought to coordinate, according to two of the people. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said earlier that a response to an incursion by Mexican cartel drones had led to the airspace closure and that the threat had been neutralized. Drone incursions are not uncommon along the southern border. Officials at the White House, FAA and Department of Transportation did not respond immediately Wednesday to request for comment about the dispute. The order was lifted a few hours later. Duffy said in a post on X that the FAA and the Defense Department “acted swiftly to address a cartel drone incursion. The threat has been neutralized and there is no danger to commercial travel in the region.” Duffy said normal flights were resuming Wednesday morning. He did not say how many drones were involved or what specifically was done to disable them. Rep. Veronica Escobar, a Democrat whose district includes El Paso, said neither her office, the city of El Paso nor airport operations received advance notice. She said she believed the shutdown was not based on Mexican cartel drones in U.S. airspace, saying that “is not what we in Congress have been told.” Pentagon officials declined to comment on Escobar's remarks and Texas Gov. Greg Abbott's office referred questions to the FAA. Rep. Tony Gonzales, whose district covers an area that stretches for about 800 miles (1,300 kilometers) along Texas' border with Mexico, said cartel drone sightings are common. “For any of us who live and work along the border, daily drone incursions by criminal organizations is every-day life for us. Asked about the drone explanation provided by U.S. officials, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said she had “no information about the use of drones on the border.” She noted that if U.S. authorities have more information they should contact Mexico's government. More than 27,000 drones were detected within 500 meters (1,600 feet) of the southern border in the last six months of 2024, he testified, mostly at night. Homeland Security has said agents have seized thousands of pounds of methamphetamine, fentanyl and other drugs in recent years that cartels were trying to fly across the border using drones. El Paso is hub of cross-border commerce alongside Ciudad Juárez. The Mexican city is home to about 1.5 million people, and some of its residents are accustomed to taking advantage of facilities including airports on both sides of the border. El Paso International Airport said in an Instagram post after the closure was announced that all flights to and from the airport would be grounded through Feb. 20, including commercial, cargo and general aviation flights. Local newscasts showed stranded travelers with luggage lining up at airline ticket counters and car rental desks at the El Paso airport hours after flights were grounded. The airport posted later Wednesday morning that its operations had resumed and encouraged travelers to contact their airlines for the most up-to-date flight information. Mexican defense and navy secretaries will meet with Northern Command officials in Washington on Wednesday in a meeting attended by representatives of several other countries, Sheinbaum said during a news conference. “This was a major and unnecessary disruption, one that has not occurred since 9/11.” Southwest, United, American and Delta all operate flights there, among others. A similar 10-day temporary flight restriction for special security reasons remained in place Wednesday morning around Santa Teresa, New Mexico, which is about 15 miles (24 kilometers) northwest of the El Paso airport. FAA officials did not immediately explain why that restriction remained in place. U.S. Sen. Ben Ray Lujan of New Mexico, a Democrat, said in a statement: “Keeping our communities informed and safe is critical. María Aracelia was pushing two roller suitcases across the pedestrian bridge from Ciudad Juarez to El Paso Wednesday morning. She had a round-trip flight to Illinois scheduled for the afternoon. Then came a notification that the El Paso airport had reopened. “This is stressful and there isn't time to make so many changes, especially if you need to get back for work,” Aracelia said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>• Nine people have been killed and dozens wounded after a shooting at a school and home in northeast British Columbia, Canada on Tuesday afternoon. A seventh person died en route to hospital, while the bodies of two people were found at a home in the town, which has just 2,400 people. Police have told CNN they are currently unable to confirm the suspect's identity. • Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney has told people in Tumbler Ridge “the nation mourns with you.” Mass shootings are rare in Canada, a country with much stricter gun laws than the US. The Peace River South School District has set up support services following the “tragic and deeply traumatic” mass shooting at Tumbler Ridge Secondary School. A support space for the school community has been established at Tumbler Ridge Community Centre, where mental health professionals will be providing support over the next few days. “We recognize that the trauma and impact of this loss are immeasurable. There is no timeline for how each of us will process this grief and immense loss, both individually and as a community,” Christy Fennell, superintendent of the school district said in a letter to families. “While words often feel inadequate in the face of such loss, coming together can help reduce isolation and remind us that we are not alone,” she added. Canada's opposition leader Pierre Poilievre said he was devastated by the “appalling shooting” in Tumbler Ridge as he headed into a caucus meeting in Ottawa earlier this morning. “The fact that this took place at a secondary school, it makes it even more tragic,” Poilievre told reporters at Parliament Hill earlier today. “As a father, I can't even imagine the phone calls that parents might have received. I can't imagine the heartache and hell that they're living through at this moment,” he added. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney has cleared much of his schedule for Wednesday following news of the school shooting in Tumbler Ridge, British Columbia. Carney's new schedule retained his caucus meeting with members of his party in Parliament this morning, as well as a statement in the House of Commons this afternoon. “We are unable to confirm identity publicly at this time,” Staff Sergeant Kris Clark, a senior media relations officer for the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, told CNN on Wednesday. Updates will be provided as more information becomes available, she added. Police previously said they know the identity of the suspect but did not give further details, and declined to say if they were a child. Nathalie Provost, a Canadian MP who survived the 1989 École Polytechnique massacre in Montreal, has responded to yesterday's school shooting by highlighting the lasting trauma such incidents leave behind. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said last year that Provost “knows that guns designed to kill people don't belong on our streets.” Meanwhile, Manitoba Premier Wab Kinew said that schools “should always be places of safety and care.” “Manitoba stands with our friends and relatives in British Columbia as they grieve this heartbreaking loss,” he posted on X. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney has told people in Tumbler Ridge “the nation mourns with you,” as Canadians wake up after a “difficult day” that saw its worst school shooting in decades. “This morning, parents, grandparents, sisters, brothers in Tumbler Ridge will wake up without someone they love. Canada stands by you,” Carney said at Parliament Hill in Ottawa early today, while holding back tears. King Charles III, who is Canada's head of state, said he and his wife Queen Camilla were “profoundly shocked and saddened” to learn of yesterday's deadly attack at Tumbler Ridge Secondary School in British Columbia. The monarch described Tumbler Ridge as a community where “every child's name will be known and every family will be a neighbour.” He expressed sorrow for those affected by what he described as a “senseless act of brutal violence.” King Charles thanked police officers, healthcare staff and first responders for their efforts. The Prince and Princess of Wales echoed King Charles' sentiment in a post on the Kensington Royal X account, saying, “We stand with all Canadians.” It has just turned 7.45 a.m. in Tumbler Ridge, British Columbia, where at least nine people were killed and dozens were injured in two shootings yesterday, including one at a secondary school. Police said yesterday that two people were found dead in a residence, and another six people were found dead inside Tumbler Ridge Secondary School, with one more dying while being transported to hospital. Around 27 people were also found injured, two of whom have “serious or life‑threatening injuries,” according to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP). At a news conference yesterday, RCMP Superintendent Ken Floyd said that police “are not in a place now to be able to understand why and what may have motivated this tragedy.” When asked about the shooter, Floyd said that authorities were “still trying to determine a lot about the shooter at this stage,” adding that police believed that they had identified the suspect but declined to share any more details. “I think we will struggle to determine the ‘why,' but we're gonna try and do our best to determine what transpired that day and what led up to this tragic event,” he said. We can hear now from a councillor in Tumbler Ridge, the town where Tuesday's deadly school shooting took place. “I really appreciate the outpouring of support that we've received from a national level, international level,” Chris Norbury told CNN affiliate CBC News. “Please continue to send any support you can because as much as I believe in Tumbler Ridge – I know we will get through this – we will definitely need all the support we can get.” Norbury, whose wife is a teacher and was among those held in lockdown at the school yesterday, said he personally knew many of the children impacted. Officers did not name any of the victims on Tuesday night and would not say how many of the dead were children. “Knowing that I can't see them anymore, that we won't see them anymore, that their family has to live with this incredible loss … Just the fear of something happening to my family is almost unbearable.” Norbury added that despite the challenges facing Tumbler Ridge, he knows it is a “strong” and “resilient” community. Jarbas Noronha, a teacher at Tumbler Ridge Secondary, shared a Facebook update to let his relatives know he was safe following yesterday's deadly shooting. The educator expressed disbelief at what he and his school community had endured, saying no young person should have this experience. “I don't wish on any school age child to have to go through what my students went through today,” he added. Tuesday's deadly attack in Canada is the worst school shooting for decades. Witnesses said at least two gunmen fired indiscriminately into a crowd of worshipers. Some other deadly incidents have not been related to firearms. At around 1.30 p.m., alarms began to sound in the school, announcing a lockdown and ordering that classroom doors be closed. A student said he and his classmates used tables to barricade themselves in. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) soon issued a “shelter in place” warning, telling Tumbler Ridge residents to lock their doors and stay inside until further instruction. The RCMP said a suspect had been found dead, but that its officers were working to determine whether a second suspect was involved. Six were found dead when police arrived at the school, and another person died en route to hospital. At 5.45 p.m., police called off the emergency alert, saying they did not believe there were any outstanding suspects “or ongoing threat to the public.” Police said the alleged shooter was found “deceased with what appears to be a self-inflicted injury.” Around 25 others were wounded, they said. The school has 160 students from Grades 7 to 12 (typically aged 12-18). This small size has led to a “tremendous sense of community, as we tend to create strong and enduring relationships among staff and students,” its website says. One of the school district's most recently uploaded newsletters is a guide to risk assessments for threats of student violence, which outlines the behaviors that warrant such an assessment to be initiated. Speaking to Gloria Macarenko on Canada's CBC News, Trent Ernst said residents alerted him to reports of an active shooter via Facebook. “My wife works at the district office and they were locked down,” Ernst said, adding that his eldest daughter, who works at a daycare centre beside the school where the shooting took place, remained on lockdown for an extended time. Ernst said unsubstantiated reports have spread quickly, causing panic. Addressing the devastation felt throughout his community, he described an otherwise peaceful town unfamiliar with tragedy. These things are things that happen elsewhere, they don't happen here,” Ernst said, becoming emotional as he added, “And that's been shattered.” Canadian law requires citizens to undergo robust background checks before obtaining a gun license. In Canada, there are an estimated 35 guns per 100 residents compared to 121 firearms for every 100 residents in the US, according to a 2018 Small Arms Research project report. This is higher than most other provinces or territories. The alarm sounded soon after Darian Quist got to his class at Tumbler Ridge Secondary School early yesterday afternoon. When he realized it wasn't a drill, Quist, a Grade 12 student, and his classmates “got tables and barricaded the doors,” he told CBC Radio West. Quist and his classmates waited in the barricaded building for about two hours, he said. Some began to share “disturbing” photos of “what was actually happening” elsewhere in the school, “showing blood and things like that.” Waiting outside in the parking lot was Shelley Quist, his mother. As reports trickled in, she began to realize what was unfolding. “It's one of those things where you just never think this is going to happen.” she added. “While there are no words that can ease the pain or help fully process such a profound loss, please know that our thoughts and prayers are with you during this time of unimaginable grief and sorrow,” the team wrote in a post on X yesterday. The Canucks also sent “love, strength, and support to those who were injured or deeply affected by this heartbreaking tragedy.” If you're just joining us, here's what we know about the fatal attacks so far: Canada's Prime Minister Mark Carney has said that he is devastated by the “horrific shootings” that took place in Tumbler Ridge, northeast British Columbia yesterday. Carney offered his “prayers and deepest condolences” to the loved ones of the victims, who he said were lost to “horrific acts of violence.” “I join Canadians in grieving with those whose lives have been changed irreversibly today, and in gratitude for the courage and selflessness of the first responders who risked their lives to protect their fellow citizens,” he said. Police found six people dead and dozens injured when they arrived at the school early on Tuesday afternoon.</p>

Eric Swalwell, who is also a California gubernatorial candidate, challenged Acting ICE Director Todd Lyons to step down or be seen as siding with 'killers.' Acting ICE Director Todd Lyons refused to resign under pressure from Rep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif., who offered him the ultimatum to do so, or "side with the killers." The heated exchange during Tuesday's House Homeland Security Committee hearing isn't the first time Swalwell has confronted ICE over its mass deportation operations. He previously co-authored the "ICE OUT Act" with fellow committee member Rep. Daniel Goldman, D-N.Y., which would strip qualified immunity from federal immigration agents. Near the close of his questioning, Swalwell told Lyons that continuing to lead ICE is a "choice" and highlighted his preceding decorated military and law enforcement career. "You are what I would call ‘otherwise employable'. I think most people would agree this is not the only job that you can get. But since you've been on this job, women have been dragged by their hair through streets. A 6-year-old child battling stage-four cancer has been deported. And it turns out he was a U.S. citizen," Swalwell claimed. Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.) speaks during a House Judiciary Committee hearing with FBI Director Kash Patel in the Rayburn House Office Building on Sept. 17, 2025. The Alameda lawmaker, who is also running for governor, said people are fleeing ICE "through the fields where they work" and that "disgraceful" statements from DHS brass should convince Lyons to find a new job. Lyons replied, "No sir, I won't," and then took issue with the poster Swalwell's staff had produced. "That child that you're showing right there, the men and women of ICE took care of him when his father abandoned him and ran from law enforcement," Lyons said, referencing the case of Adrian A.C. Arias, an Ecuadorian national targeted by ICE. Arias "abandoned" his 5-year-old child to flee authorities, leading Democrats and some in the press to claim that DHS had targeted the child, who went into their custody. Swalwell also pressed Lyons on comments made at a Border Security Expo suggesting immigration enforcement and deportation operations be as efficient as Amazon Prime delivery. Swalwell asked — appearing to reference the shooting of Renee Good in Minneapolis. "It's the square root of zero, that's right," Swalwell shot back, before Lyons countered that his Amazon comment had come in the context of remarks made on improving the technology around DHS's work, including efficiency and artificial intelligence areas. Protesters, using whistles to alert neighborhoods to ICE activity, face off with Minneapolis police officers in Minneapolis, Minn., on Jan. 24, 2026. "I did say at the end of it, but we deal with human beings, so we can't be like them. At the end of Swalwell's remarks, Chairman Andrew Garbarino, R-N.Y., ceded the floor to Rep. Michael Guest, R-Miss., who offered a friendlier exchange with Lyons. Charles Creitz is a reporter for Fox News Digital. He joined Fox News in 2013 as a writer and production assistant.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>• Detained person released: Authorities have released a person detained for questioning in Rio Rico, about 60 miles south of Tucson, CNN affiliate KNXV reported. • New letter: TMZ reported it received a “bizarre letter” via email this morning from someone purporting to know who Guthrie's kidnapper is and demanding a single Bitcoin in exchange for the information. • Surveillance video: The FBI yesterday released doorbell camera footage from outside Nancy Guthrie's front door taken the morning she disappeared on February 1, showing a masked, armed person. Separately, FBI Director Kash Patel said the agency is looking at “persons of interest” in the case, in which authorities say the 84-year-old was taken against her will from her Arizona home. A man in Rio Rico, Arizona, who says he was detained yesterday for questioning in the investigation of Nancy's Guthrie disappearance spoke to reporters outside his home again today. Asked what he wants following the interrogation, the man who identified himself as Carlos responded, “To clear my name. Carlos said his mother-in-law was told by an investigator he was stopped Tuesday as a result of an anonymous tip following yesterday's release of Nest camera video from Nancy Guthrie's home. Carlos said he was shocked when the investigators told him why they wanted to question him regarding his recent whereabouts. “It's about a kidnapping,” Carlos said an FBI agent told him, to which he said he responded, “What the f**k? Carlos said after questioning him and searching his home and vehicle, investigators gave no indication they planned to return. TMZ is reporting it received a “bizarre letter” via email earlier this morning from someone purporting to know who Nancy Guthrie's kidnapper is and demanding a single Bitcoin in exchange for that information. TMZ, along with CNN affiliates KOLD and KGUN, also received the initial ransom notes for Nancy Guthrie. They are saying they know who the kidnapper is and will give that information up for one Bitcoin,” TMZ founder Harvey Levin told Fox News this morning. “They said they want one Bitcoin sent to a Bitcoin address that we have confirmed is active, a real address. And as they put it, time is ‘more than relevant,'” Levin added. When asked by CNN about the new note, the FBI said, “Outside of our previously issued statements, we have no updates to share at this time.” TMZ reports it received the note just before 8 a.m. A makeshift tribute outside of Nancy Guthrie's home shows support for the family as the investigation into her abduction enters its 11th day. A CNN crew at the scene this morning saw a man leaving pink flowers next to the candles and signs reading ‘Please pray” and “Your neighbors stand with you.” The makeshift display has grown by a few items since a couple days ago. Investigators have still not been able to locate the mother of “Today” host Savannah Guthrie, a law enforcement source told CNN. “When you crowdsource something like that, it means an awful lot.” On a serene street in Rio Rico, Arizona, the wrought iron gates were closed to the driveway of the house occupied by a man who identified himself to reporters as Carlos. No law enforcement vehicles were seen in the neighborhood this morning. Carlos told reporters yesterday he may have delivered something to Nancy Guthrie's home at some point but did not know who she is and had no involvement in her disappearance. Investigators acknowledged detaining a “subject” for questioning yesterday but have not commented on the account given by Carlos. Obtaining video footage of a masked man outside Nancy Guthrie's home, a major breakthrough in the case, largely came down to Google's technical expertise, a person familiar with the investigation told CNN. However, the process was so technically complex that investigators were unsure if it would be successful, the source said. Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos initially said there was “no video available” because Guthrie “had no subscription” to Google's video recording service, which keeps videos from Nest cameras accessible in Google's cloud. Yesterday, FBI Director Kash Patel wrote on social media that authorities, “working closely with our private sector partners,” recovered some video “from residual data located in backend systems” in the Guthrie case. Read more about how the video was recovered. FBI agents are looking at more than one individual as a “person of interest” in the disappearance of Nancy Guthrie, the bureau's director, Kash Patel, told Fox News last night. Patel did not elaborate on who might be under suspicion, but said authorities were undergoing a process to eliminate anyone who may not actually be involved. The FBI's first priority is finding Guthrie, Patel said, and “right behind that is to find anyone and any others involved in this kidnapping case to make sure they're brought to justice.” There have been an number of developments since the FBI yesterday released doorbell camera footage from outside Nancy Guthrie's front door, showing a masked, armed person. CNN's Helen Regan and Jessie Yeung contributed to this reporting. They better do their job and find the suspect that did it so they can clear my name, and I'm done,” Carlos told reporters as he returned home, according to a video from New York Times reporter Nicholas Bogel-Burroughs. “Look at what I'm putting my family through. Not just them, even my parents in Tucson,” he adds, gesturing to the home behind him. The man told CNN affiliate KNXV that he was held in custody from around 4 p.m. to after midnight, and was asked questions “like where I was, what hours,” before being told, “I'm free to go.” The man who was questioned has not been identified by authorities. When asked how he felt after investigators told him why he'd been detained as part of the Guthrie investigation, Carlos answers: “What the f**k am I doing here? Carlos told KNXV that as a delivery driver, he might have delivered a package to Guthrie's home, but he didn't know her. The abduction of Nancy Guthrie has brought national attention to the kidnapping of older Americans, but FBI statistics show such cases are rare, especially for adults over 50. Victims 50 and older accounted for only 10% of those cases. Yesterday, officials released a video showing a person tampering with Guthrie's front door camera before she was reported missing. Her family did not recognize the individual, according to NBC. This is another factor that makes the Guthrie case so uncommon. Most abductions do not involve strangers; only about 9% of all kidnappings and abductions last year were committed by someone unknown to the victim, according to the FBI. Separately, the NCIC Missing Person and Unidentified Person Statistics report for 2024 found that of 258,849 missing persons cases that year, only 4% involved adults. A vast majority — 95% — were runaways, according to the report. About 0.9% were classified as abductions by a non-custodial parent, and 0.1% as abductions by a stranger, the statistics show. CNN's Erin Burnett talks to AI expert Kristian Hammond about how technology will be used to identify the person who abducted Nancy Guthrie.

Officials have outlined several ways people can contact law enforcement if they have any actionable tips regarding the disappearance of Nancy Guthrie: 1-800-CALL-FBI, 88-CRIME, 520-351-4900, or tips.fbi.gov. Authorities have released a person who was being questioned in Rio Rico, about 60 miles south of Tucson near the Mexico border, according to CNN affiliate KNXV. Authorities have still not been able to locate the mother of “Today” host Savannah Guthrie, a law enforcement source told CNN. Here's a timeline of all the developments since her disappearance.

Seattle Seahawks fans will undoubtedly come out in droves for Wednesday's Super Bowl celebration, but for students partying, it will hurt their attendance records. Seattle Public Schools announced earlier this week that schools will not only stay open, but going to the parade will not count as an excused absence. Moments like this bring our city together, spark pride across generations, and remind us of the power of shared experiences in our community," Seattle Public Schools Chief Operations Officer Fred Podesta said in a letter. "As the city plans celebrations, including a victory parade planned for Wednesday, Feb. 11, at 10 a.m., we want families to know that Seattle Public Schools will remain open with the normal early-release Wednesday schedule. "Keeping schools open is an important part of maintaining stability, safety, and continuity for our students. For many families, schools provide not only learning, but also meals, transportation, specialized services, and trusted routines. Remaining open allows us to support students' academic progress while ensuring essential services continue for those who rely on them … "We encourage families to celebrate this historic moment in ways that work best for your household, while also helping us keep learning strong across the district. Thank you for your partnership and support as we balance celebration with our shared commitment to students. Sam Darnold of the Seattle Seahawks celebrates with the Vince Lombardi Trophy after winning Super Bowl LX against the New England Patriots at Levi's Stadium on Feb. 8, 2026 in Santa Clara, California.

A person was detained for questioning Tuesday in the kidnapping of Nancy Guthrie, hours after the FBI released surveillance videos of a masked person wearing a handgun holster outside Guthrie's front door the night she vanished from her Arizona home. The department and the FBI were also conducting a court-authorized search Tuesday night at a location in Rio Rico, about an hour's drive south of Tucson. Authorities investigating the disappearance of Nancy Guthrie released the first surveillance images Tuesday showing a masked person with what looked like a handgun holster on her porch the night she went missing more than a week ago. Officials said a person has been detained for questioning in the disappearance. Sheriff's officials block the entrance to a road where a home was being searched in Rio Rico, Arizona, on Tuesday, Feb. 10, 2026, in connection to the investigation of Nancy Guthrie's disappearance. An investigator looks inside a culvert in the neighborhood where Annie Guthrie, whose mother Nancy Guthrie has been missing for more than a week, lives just outside Tucson, Ariz., on Tuesday, Feb. 10, 2026. RIO RICO, Ariz. (AP) — Fresh surveillance images from Nancy Guthrie's porch the night she went missing, coupled with intense police activity across Arizona and the detention of a man had raised hopes that authorities were nearing a major break. By Wednesday, however, the man said he had been released after questioning, leaving it unclear where the investigation stood into last week's disappearance of Guthrie, the 84-year-old mother of “Today” show host Savannah Guthrie. Just hours after the FBI released videos Tuesday of a person wearing a gun holster, ski mask and backpack and approaching Nancy Guthrie's home in Tucson, authorities said they had stopped a man near the U.S.-Mexico border for questioning. The man told several media outlets early Wednesday that he was released after several hours and had nothing to do with Guthrie's disappearance last week. The sheriff's department said its deputies and FBI agents also searched a location Tuesday night in Rio Rico, a city south of Tucson where the man lives. Until Tuesday, it seemed authorities were making little headway in determining what happened to her or finding who was responsible. But the images did not show what happened to her or help determine whether she is still alive. FBI Director Kash Patel said the videos were pulled from data on “back-end systems” after investigators spent days trying to find lost, corrupted or inaccessible images. “Even when you have a person who appears to be completely covered, they're really not. Authorities were back near Guthrie's neighborhood on Tuesday, using vehicles to block her driveway. Investigators have said for more than a week that they believe Nancy Guthrie was taken against her will. She was last seen at home Jan. 31 and reported missing the next day. DNA tests showed blood on her porch was hers, authorities said. Savannah Guthrie posted the new surveillance images on social media Tuesday. She said the family believes their mother is still alive and provided phone numbers for the FBI and county sheriff. The longtime anchor of NBC's morning show and her two siblings have released a series of video statements pleading for the return of their mother and indicating a willingness to pay a ransom. It is not known whether ransom notes demanding money with deadlines that have already passed were authentic, and whether the family has had any contact with whoever took Guthrie. Authorities have described Nancy Guthrie as mentally sound but with limited mobility. She takes several medications and there was concern from the start that she could die without them, Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos has said repeatedly.</p>

Kid Rock details his experience headlining Turning Point USA's 2026 halftime show on ‘The Ingraham Angle.' Kid Rock is firing back at critics who accused him of lip-syncing during Turning Point USA's halftime show. After social media lit up with claims that his performance of "Bawitdaba" didn't match the video feed, the rocker took to X to shut it down. "My halftime performance was pre-recorded but performed live. No lip-syncing like the haters and fake news are trying to report. When they synced the cameras to my performance on ‘Bawitdaba,' it did not line up as I explain in this video," Kid Rock wrote. Kid Rock addressed the lip-syncing controversy surrounding his "Bawitdaba" performance. In an accompanying video, he made it clear that the controversy was because of a production glitch — not a faked performance. "That song is chaos," he began to explain. So the Turning Point event, they sent me a first cut [after] we taped it, my comment was, ‘the sync is off.' They were trying to line up … It was very difficult for them, because somebody clearly wasn't super familiar with the song … It could have been done had we had more time." Turning Point USA streamed on YouTube at the same time as the Super Bowl halftime show featuring Bad Bunny. Kid Rock — a longtime supporter of President Donald Trump — shared the stage with country stars Lee Brice, Brantley Gilbert and Gabby Barrett. Social media erupted with lip-syncing claims after Kid Rock's Turning Point USA show performance. Within hours, clips of the performance were circulating online, with critics claiming the rock veteran wasn't singing live. Kid Rock says that narrative is flat-out wrong. "So I have nothing but good things to say — not only about Turning Point, but the production team that they work with," he continued. And by the way, most of you know this … Some of you in the entertainment world can look at that and be like, ‘oh, the sync is off.' But they had to lie and say, ‘Oh, he was lip-syncing.' Kid Rock wore a very patriotic outfit while visiting President Trump at the White House in April 2025. "They did it to Bad Bunny, in his defense, when they were saying he said ‘You have four months to learn Spanish.' But they do it far too often, especially in the fake news media." He doubled down during a previous appearance on Fox News' "The Ingraham Angle," after host Laura Ingraham described the performance as "out of whack." "It was out of sync," Kid Rock said. "Actually, just to have some fun with the haters. I can't answer all the trolls, but it's going to be some fun. My DJ, who actually raps that song with me, he was not lit up." Bad Bunny performed during the halftime of Super Bowl LX. If he were actually lip-syncing, he argued, the mistake wouldn't have happened in the first place. "It was just a syncing issue that they had, and I know they tried to get it right. Stephanie Giang-Paunon is an entertainment writer for Fox News Digital.

But in a tweet on Wednesday morning, the FAA announced that the “temporary closure” had been lifted and that there was “no threat to commercial aviation.” Early reports on what went wrong seemed to agree that drones were a part of the explanation, but exactly what role they played was a matter of confusion. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy tweeted on Wednesday that “the FAA and DOW [Department of War] acted swiftly to address a cartel drone incursion.” However, Rep. Veronica Escobar, a Democrat who represents the El Paso area in Congress, told reporters on Wednesday morning that an incursion by Mexican drones was “not the information that we in Congress have been told” and that the current explanations were still muddled. There was not a threat, which is why the F.A.A. lifted this restriction so quickly,” she said, according to the New York Times. US Northern Command has reported around 1,000 drones crossing the US-Mexico border per month. CNN reported that the closure was due to “US military activity related to drug cartels,” including “unmanned aircraft operations and laser countermeasure testing,” citing an administration official. Citing an industry source, it reported that the Department of Defense had “been operating unmanned aircrafts, or drones, against drug cartel operations from a base near El Paso's airport without sharing information with the FAA.” None of this quite explains why the closure was supposed to last for 10 days, which would be by far the longest security interruption to a major city's air service since 9/11. It's an idea that President Trump has repeatedly suggested since his first term, but that he threatened again in the wake of January's Venezuela raid. Last summer, Trump signed an order directing the US military to take action against several drug cartels. The CIA has reportedly stepped up secret drone flights over Mexico itself.

The Federal Aviation Administration lifted its airspace closure over El Paso and New Orleans just hours after instituting it, following a Mexican “cartel drone incursion” into U.S. airspace.

The FAA originally instituted the shutdown for 10 days, through Feb. 21, but it was lifted after a few hours, according to the Associated Press.

“The FAA and DOW acted swiftly to address a cartel drone incursion,” Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said in a statement. “The threat has been neutralized, and there is no danger to commercial travel in the region. The restrictions have been lifted and normal flights are resuming.”

The Washington Examiner reached out to the FAA for comment.

The order was issued without advance notice and went into effect on Feb. 10 at 11:30 p.m. local time, multiple sources reported. However, NOTAM mentioned that the airspace restriction at El Paso began on “Feb. 11 at 0630 UTC.”

“No pilots may operate an aircraft in the areas covered by this NOTAM (except as described),” information posted in an “Operating Restrictions and Requirements” section said. “EXCLUDING MEXICAN AIRSPACE.”

The official reason posted on the NOTAM for the closure was “Temporary flight restrictions for Special Security Reasons.”

FAA RESTRICTS FLIGHTS OVER NEW ORLEANS AND EL PASO AIRPORT FOR ‘SECURITY REASONS'

The sudden notification took many by surprise and left some travelers temporarily stranded.

An order to shut down all flights, including medivac and police helicopters, has no precedent in U.S. history, going beyond the nationwide shutdown after 9/11, CNN reported.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Two flight restrictions were issued by the Federal Aviation Administration on Wednesday morning for airspace over El Paso, Texas, and New Orleans. In Texas, arriving and departing flights out of El Paso International Airport in El Paso, Texas, have been suspended for 10 days, the FAA announced. The decision to halt air traffic was due to “special security reasons” and was revealed in an alert on the FAA's official “Notice to Air Missions” website. The order was issued without advance notice and went into effect on Feb. 10 at 11:30 p.m. local time, according to multiple sources. However, NOTAM mentioned that the airspace restriction at El Paso began on “Feb. “No pilots may operate an aircraft in the areas covered by this NOTAM (except as described),” read information posted in an “Operating Restrictions and Requirements” section. In New Orleans, a separate NOTAM was issued early Wednesday morning for five separate areas with a radius of “three nautical miles.” “No UAS operations are authorized in the areas covered by this NOTAM (except as described),” read the alert for New Orleans. No other information has been provided about the closures at this time. El Paso International Airport is considered a “major medium-hub” which services over 4 million passengers annually and nearly 98,000 “aircraft operations.” It has three runways and 15 gates in its terminal.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A Pentagon plan to use a high-energy, counter-drone laser without having coordinated with the Federal Aviation Administration about potential risks to civilian flights prompted Wednesday's unprecedented airspace shutdown over El Paso, Texas, multiple sources told CNN. Those accounts come as the Trump administration has claimed that a Mexican cartel drone crossing into US airspace is what triggered the 10-mile restriction centered on El Paso International Airport. Late Tuesday, the FAA abruptly issued a temporary flight restriction that immediately grounded all flights up to 18,000 feet around the city for 10 days, effectively shutting down El Paso International Airport. Roughly eight hours later, the restriction was lifted. Multiple sources from the federal government and US airlines told CNN that military activity near El Paso, including US drones monitoring cartel operations and the Pentagon's planned use of a high-energy laser designed to counter drones, raised immediate concerns for civilian traffic arriving and departing El Paso International Airport. Fort Bliss and its airfield, Biggs Army Airfield, sit just north of the commercial airport, which serves about 100 flights each day. FAA and Pentagon officials had been scheduled to meet February 20 to review potential impacts and mitigation measures for a test of the laser system, a technology the Pentagon has been testing in more remote areas of the country, multiple sources said. The 10-day restriction would have expired on February 21, one day after DoD and the FAA were set to meet. An administration official said Wednesday morning that the shutdown was triggered by Defense Department “action to disable” cartel drones. Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy posted to social media crediting the FAA and Defense Department with acting “swiftly to address a cartel drone incursion.” “The threat has been neutralized, and there is no danger to commercial travel in the region,” he wrote on X. Incursions along the southern border are extremely common and historically do not prompt such airspace closures. The Drug Enforcement Administration and other US security agencies have used facilities at the Biggs Army Airfield for years as part of efforts to monitor Mexico-based drug cartel operations, current and former US officials said. It is a hub of cross-border commerce alongside neighboring Ciudad Juárez in Mexico. Nearly 3.5 million passengers passed through El Paso International Airport in the first 11 months of 2025, according to its website. The US military has been testing laser-based air defenses against drones in recent months. Last summer, the Army conducted a live-fire exercise using directed energy weapons alongside more traditional air defense systems at Fort Sill, Oklahoma. And last fall, the Army put out a request to industry for ideas on a counter-drone Enduring-High Energy Laser (E-HEL) weapon system. It warned that additional actions could be taken for pilots who don't adhere to the restrictions, including suspension of flight certifications, criminal charges, and that the US government “may use deadly force” if an aircraft poses an “imminent security threat.” The sudden FAA restrictions seemed to catch pilots and air traffic controllers by surprise. “Just pass it on to everybody else, at 06:30 for the next 10 days, we're all at a ground stop,” a controller said. A pilot replied, “OK, ground stop 06:30 for how long?” The controller replied, “Apparently, we just got informed about 30 minutes to an hour ago.” “So for 10 days you guys are not open,” the pilot said, in disbelief. “Well, we'll be here, but no air traffic,” the controller said. Samuel, a traveler in El Paso, told CNN affiliate KFOX he was doing a book tour with a client and didn't get any notification from his airline. Democratic Rep. Veronica Escobar of Texas told reporters Wednesday that the closure of the El Paso International Airport was solely a FAA decision and that local officials — including members of Congress — were left completely in the dark before it happened. “They did not alert the El Paso city manager or the El Paso mayor,” Escobar said on a press call Wednesday morning.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump's long-running stolen-election crusade entered a potentially fraught new phase recently, with the FBI search of an elections office in Fulton County, Georgia. Some fear it could be a precursor to an even more heavy-handed Trump intervention in American elections. After all, searches require probable cause of a crime, and the magistrate judge, Catherine Salinas, was not exactly some reputed judicial extremist or election skeptic; according to Lawfare, she had previously worked for a public defender's office and clerked for a Clinton appointee. Maybe there was some new information that suddenly lent some credence to claims of malfeasance in Fulton County in 2020? The affidavit that was used for the search warrant application was made public on Tuesday, and it overwhelmingly recycles old claims about voting irregularities that have either been debunked or haven't gone anywhere. In addition, the affidavit cites no evidence of any actual criminal intent. Let's annotate some key parts from the affidavit. “Following the November 3, 2020, presidential election, there were many allegations of electoral impropriety relating to the voting process and ballot counting in Fulton County, Georgia. Some of those allegations have been disproven while some of those allegations have been substantiated, including through admissions by Fulton County.” The combination of “electoral impropriety,” “ballot counting” and “substantiated” paint a dire picture. While it's true that certain aspects of Fulton County's election administration were not perfect – and officials have acknowledged as such – there has been no proof offered of widespread fraud. And it's never been demonstrated that any of the problems owed to anything other than human or administrative errors. Which, in this context, usually aren't treated as crimes. In one case, it cites a member of the state election board who “believed” she had witnessed “an intentional act.” In another, it cites a data analyst who “concluded that what he observed could be intentional but was not partisan.” Two high-profile reviews of Fulton County's elections, including an extensive “Performance Review Board” report, both found significant problems but no evidence of fraud or misconduct. Georgia's GOP governor, Brian Kemp, and secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger, have both frequently defended the election results. “The FBI criminal investigation originated from a referral sent by Kurt Olsen, Presidentially appointed Director of Election Security and Integrity.” The warrant application cites a number of prominent election-deniers. He had multiple phone calls with Trump on January 6, 2021, when rioters stormed the US Capitol. Olsen was also sanctioned over what a federal judge found to be “false, misleading and unsupported factual assertions” about the 2022 Arizona gubernatorial campaign, which Republican Kari Lake lost. He was recently made a special government employee in the Trump administration. The affidavit also cites another person who tried and failed to overturn Lake's loss, Clay Parikh. Basically, there were about 17,000 fewer ballots counted during a recount than in earlier counts, because the county used the same name on two batch files, USA Today has reported. The count was later corrected through a process called “reconciliation.” This refers to the so-called “duplicate ballot” issue. But there's still no real evidence of malfeasance. State officials in 2024 acknowledged a little more than 3,000 duplicate ballot images. But duplicate ballot images are not the same as counted votes, and officials couldn't determine that any of them were actually tabulated in the recount. “If the ‘3,000 duplicate ballot images' had been counted as votes … the results would have been off by 3,000 — and they were not,” a spokesman for the Georgia secretary of state told PolitiFact back then. A local official cited human error for the duplicate ballot images. These ballots were also pristine in that they had not been folded. She said the 107 were labeled as absentee ballots but they were too clean to be absentee ballots, in her opinion. This refers to the so-called “pristine ballots” theory. The secretary of state's office reviewed the claims and said it was “unable to substantiate the allegations that fraudulent or counterfeit ballots were counted.” They found no ballots that appeared to be counterfeits. An official in that office has explained that some overseas and military ballots might not be the right size for scanners, so those votes can be transferred to ballots that can be scanned and might appear more “pristine.” The affidavit notably makes no mention of any theories about foreign election interference. That should ratchet up questions as to why Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard was present at the FBI search. (Gabbard's job generally revolves around foreign threats, not domestic law enforcement.) But it could matter for more severe potential offenses.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Law enforcement detained a person of interest on Tuesday in connection with the kidnapping of Nancy Guthrie, the mother of Today show co-host Savannah Guthrie. The Pima County Sheriff's Department confirmed the detainment in an X post on Tuesday night, writing, “Earlier today, Pima County Sheriff's Department deputies detained a subject during a traffic stop south of Tucson. The subject is currently being questioned in connection to the Nancy Guthrie investigation. Additional information will be released as it becomes available.” Law enforcement was preparing to search a location related to the person of interest in Rio Rico, Arizona, on Tuesday. The Pima County Sheriff's Department and the FBI have been working on the case for over a week after Nancy Guthrie disappeared from her Arizona home on Feb. 1. FBI Director Kash Patel released images of a possible suspect who was tampering with the doorbell camera outside of Nancy Guthrie's home while masked, saying later in a TV interview on Tuesday night that authorities were looking at multiple “persons of interest” in the case. Nancy Guthrie, who is 84, relies on a specific medication for her health, giving the investigation some urgency, according to her family and investigators. “We believe she is still alive. Anyone with information, please contact 1-800-CALL-FBI (1-800-225-5324) or the Pima County Sheriff's Department 520-351-4900,” Savannah Guthrie wrote.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The House failed to pass a procedural measure, called a “rule,” on a slate of bills that included language extending the prohibition of members calling up bills to repeal the administration's tariffs through July 31. The measure failed 214 to 217, with three Republicans — Reps. Thomas Massie (R-KY), Don Bacon (R-NE), and Kevin Kiley (R-CA) — joining all Democrats in voting against it. This is a blow to leadership and Johnson, making this the seventh rule failure he's faced since taking the speaker's gavel. He had narrowly avoided a rule failure multiple times over the last six months, often by flipping a handful of GOP holdouts by actively whipping them on the floor. Before Tuesday, the most recent party-line vote failure occurred in July involving cryptocurrency and appropriations bills. The vote on Tuesday sought to extend previous language that blocked tariff repeal resolutions from getting a vote, which expired at the end of January. Because of Tuesday's rule failure, any bills tucked into that measure sit at a standstill. “This is life with a small majority,” the speaker said. “I need unanimity every day, and we didn't get it tonight.” Johnson can only afford to lose one vote to still pass a bill along party lines, and he faced at least two Republican detractors heading into the vote. The speaker successfully staved off opposition from Reps. Tom McClintock (R-CA), Victoria Spartz (R-IN), or Mike Turner (R-OH), who have previously pushed back against tariffs. Reps. Zach Nunn (R-IA), Dan Newhouse (R-WA), and Spartz withheld their votes for a time, but all three ultimately voted “yes.” This came after Spartz said throughout the day on Tuesday that she was opposed to the measure, eventually flipping her vote as she has done on several other contentious bills this Congress. GOP attendance also proved to be an issue, with Rep. Greg Murphy (R-NC) not voting this week. But Rep. Wesley Hunt (R-TX), who has missed several votes while campaigning in the Texas GOP Senate primary, was present on Tuesday night and voted for the rule. The vote was held open for nearly an hour, with Democrats calling on Republicans to close it after it was clear that Massie, Bacon, and Kiley were not returning. Massie's opposing vote was unsurprising, as he often votes against party-line measures. He told the Washington Examiner that leadership “didn't try” to whip him. “You're gonna have to quit spending millions of dollars against me,” Massie said, “before I'll even consider compromising my principles.” I don't understand why this keeps coming up.” “Article I of the Constitution places authority over taxes and tariffs with Congress for a reason, but for too long, we have handed that authority to the executive branch,” Bacon said. I also oppose using the rules votes to legislate. Johnson has tried to avoid, as much as possible, putting contentious bills on the floor that could be politically damaging during the 119th Congress, particularly ahead of a competitive midterm election year. A resolution to repeal tariffs on Mexico “ripens,” or is allowed to be called up for a vote, on Wednesday, and a resolution to repeal tariffs on Brazil ripens next week.</p>
