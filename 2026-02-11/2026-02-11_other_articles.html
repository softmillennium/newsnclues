                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>I just have one word to say: WHAT? Disclaimer: There are mentions of death, diseases, and gruesome details in the content below. 18-year-old Paula Welden was a Bennington College student in Vermont. Some suggested that she had been distraught while she had headed out for the hike; others claimed that her home life was not as idyllic as her parents had told the police. However, none of these theories materialized, and the case went cold. To date, there is no knowledge of how she disappeared. On 23rd January, 1959, 10 hikers had gone for a winter trek through Russia's Ural Mountains. They were supposed to send a message back to their sports club three weeks after they had started the trek. When the club didn't receive any message by February 20th, they sent out a search party. And what they would go on to find was unsettling. The first five students seemed to have died from hypothermia, which can cause erratic behavior. Their injuries were so severe that their exact cause of death could not have been determined, and the investigation concluded that the hikers had died from a "compelling natural force." Some citizens wondered if it was the Soviet government covering something up. Traces of radiation were found on the hikers' clothes, which further fueled this theory. Other theories surrounding these mysterious deaths also included yetis, the KGB, and the CIA, although nothing concrete has come out of this. The mysterious part of this epidemic was that no one knew how it started or what caused it. This affected more than 1 million people, and led to an estimated 500,000 deaths. To add more suspense and enigma around this epidemic, no one seemed to have a clue about how it started or how the disease vanished, except for a few isolated cases. In late 2016, this strange illness was affecting American officials around the world, and it seemed to have begun in Cuba. This malady was then known as "Havana Syndrome," and it was seemingly ruining the health of diplomats, officers, and members of their families who were nearby at the time of these attacks. Members have felt this illness outside the White House and in several countries around the world, like China, Austria, Bulgaria, France, Georgia, Poland, Serbia, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. In 2024, a declassified intelligence study report stated that the most probable cause could be "pulsed electromagnetic energy" that could penetrate through building walls. Another report by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine stated in 2020 that weaponized microwaves could also be the cause of this syndrome. Local research gave an estimated number of more than 300 dogs having jumped off the bridge. At least 50 dogs have passed away due to this unexplained event. Some rational explanations state that the dogs get into a frenzy due to an overload of scents and the terrain. Some other explanations are more superstitious and paranormal in comparison. This is definitely an intriguing and creepy instance, which definitely needs to be explained quickly so that no more dogs go through this experience. Just as her political and personal life is etched in history books as highly significant, there is one final mystery regarding the queen and her husband, Mark Antony: where their tomb lies. After the Roman armies of Octavian defeated Cleopatra's forces, Cleopatra died by suicide after burying Antony, as he too had died. And so, Egypt fell under Roman rule. What history knows is that they were both buried together. Kathleen Martinez strongly believes that this port might be a key location in relation to Cleopatra's tomb; however, it has yet to be confirmed. But for now, the location of Cleopatra and Mark Antony's final resting spot still remains a mystery for the world. The tower has a range of 20 miles and flashes two white signals every 30 seconds. They only discovered that the lightkeepers were missing on a routine visit to the Lighthouse Tender Hesperus on 26th December, 1900. There was no evidence of the men disappearing or where they went; however, due to traces of bad weather, it was concluded that the men must have left the lighthouse for some purpose in the harsh weather and might have gotten caught in an unexpected wave, and swept into the sea. There are over 800 straight lines, 300 geometric figures, and 70 animal and plant designs, which are also called biomorphs. Some of them stretch over 30 miles, while the biomorphs range from 50 to 1200 feet in length. Maria Reiche battled to protect the site and also fought for her theories regarding the lines' astronomical and calendrical purpose. Some of the lines are seen to overlap, and some lines look both ancient and of modern origin. Johan Reinhard, a National Geographic Explorer-in-Residence, stated in his book The Nazca Lines: A New Perspective on Their Origin and Meanings: "It seems likely that most of the lines did not point at anything on the geographical or celestial horizon, but rather led to places where rituals were performed to obtain water and fertility of crops." The remains were first discovered by a patrolling British forest ranger in 1942. When the snow melts, the skeletons are visible, sometimes with flesh attached and some quite well preserved. Over the years, scientists and anthropologists have studied the remains and remain puzzled over the origin of these bodies and how they ended up in this state. They were aged between 35 and 50, all of reasonably good health. It was assumed that the skeletons were of a single group of people who died at once due to an incident in the 9th century. However, the latest study might just prove these assumptions wrong. This study revealed that the skeletons were genetically diverse and their time of death was separated in time by as much as 1000 years. Nonetheless, we still do not know the exact reason why there are so many remains at this lake, how they died, and where the people came from. In 1900, Greek divers discovered a wreckage off the coast of Antikythera. More than 300 objects were found, but none were more intriguing and mysterious than the Antikythera mechanism, the world's first "computer." This mechanism was discovered on what is believed to be a trading or cargo ship. In the 1970s, the importance of this bronze mechanism was uncovered as it was revealed that the device was a complex machine with at least 30 gear wheels. In 2016, it was revealed that much of the inscription and texts on its surface suggested that it was a philosopher's guide to the galaxy. The size of this device is that of a shoebox, with dials on the front and back. We still do not know how this artifact got onto a Roman ship or the precise use of this device. This fired-clay disc was discovered in 1908, written in a language that nobody has been able to identify or decipher. It was found 40 miles south of Heraklion, Crete, in Phaistos. This artifact was found in the site's Old Palace, which dates back to 1900-1700 BC. It is an ancient decorated cylinder made of fired clay. It has symbols etched on both its sides. What is the disc's purpose or meaning? A linguist in 2017 claimed that it might have been a prayer to the Minoan earth goddess, Aphaia. Experts have still not agreed on one singular explanation behind this disc and the language inscribed on it. On March 8th, 2014, a flight flying from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing disappeared after takeoff with 227 passengers and 12 crew members on board. Flight 370 took off at 12:41 AM from Kuala Lumpur. The last voice communication from the crew onboard was at 1:19 AM, and then at 1:21 AM, the plane's transponder, which communicated with the air traffic control, was shut off just as they were about to enter Vietnamese airspace. A multinational search, which was led by Australia, failed to locate the flight. Though pieces of debris discovered later, that were believed to be from the plane along the East Africa coast and on Indian Ocean islands. However, no main wreckage or bodies have been recovered. In 1587, John White, along with 118 men, women, and children, went on an expedition from England for the New World. They reached Roanoke Island near present-day North Carolina on July 22nd. During the first few months, there were scarce resources, tense relations with the Indigenous Algonquian, and harsh winter conditions. John White sailed back to England for more supplies but only returned three years later. There were just two clues left: the word 'CRO' carved into a tree and the word 'CROATOAN' carved into a palisade. There were no signs of a struggle or hasty escape, but simply that the colonists had vanished. Some evidence to back this theory is that there were objects found within Croatoan villages that only English settlers had owned. Nonetheless, the real reason and fact behind this unusual disappearance are still highly debated. It was quite far away from the nearest water source, town, or trade route. There is also no evidence that it used to be someone's home or that it was of political significance. So why was it built in the first place? According to one legend, the local duke, who was determined to eradicate any rumors of hellish happenings, had a young prisoner lowered into the hole. No one expected the hole to be so deep. When they heard a scream from the hole, they pulled the prisoner back up, and seemingly, the boy had aged 40 years and was found in an incredibly disturbed state. After this incident, the duke took action and built the Houska Castle directly on top of it.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Last updated on Feb 11, 2026 at 4:36 PM (UTC+4) Edited by Amelia Jean Hershman-Jones Alien experts have been calling new UFO footage from Colombia the clearest footage ever, and witnesses of the potential alien craft claim that it powered off their phones. A newly released clip from Colombia is going viral because the object looks unusually sharp, stable, and close, and even more unusually, like the daily driver of a little green man. The video was reportedly filmed over Yumbo in Colombia's Valle del Cauca region on December 23, 2025, at around 7:33pm. The object appears to look like a sci-fi movie flying saucer rather than just a dot, and the report claims it moved smoothly and with control, without obvious wings, propellers, or any clear sign of conventional propulsion. The footage was shared publicly by UFO investigator and journalist Jaime Maussan, who has a long history in the UFO world. At the same time, there have not been any official statements confirming what the object was, which has left plenty of room for theories ranging from advanced human tech to a drone, CGI, or something non-human. Natalia and another witness reported that their Samsung phones suddenly powered off while they were filming. The report also says the object flew low and close to high-voltage power lines, and some people have speculated that electromagnetic interference could have been what powered off their phones. For now, the video sits in that familiar gray zone: clear enough to spark serious chatter, but still without a confirmed explanation.

He specializes in history, space, strange science, and anything out of the ordinary. Her areas of expertise include health, medicine, psychology, and neuroscience. In 2017, Kendall Jenner made it public that she had a wall in her living room painted a very specific shade of pink. "Baker-Miller Pink is the only color scientifically proven to calm you AND suppress your appetite. While a celebrity making strange claims is par for the course (there are a lot of celebs out there, odds are some of them are going to have some weird beliefs), the idea hasn't sprung from nowhere. In fact, there have been quite a few studies looking into the possibility that "Baker-Miller pink", sometimes known as "Drunk-Tank Pink", is good for reducing anxiety and aggressive/hostile behavior. For instance, as of 2015 around 20 percent of prisons and police stations in Switzerland had at least one cell painted in Baker-Miller pink, with some prisons in the US, the UK, and Austria doing the same. So, where did this idea come from, and is there any truth behind it? During one experiment, collaborator John N. Ott suggested that perceiving certain colors could even have an effect on muscle strength and performance. His results suggested that color had an effect on the participants, relaxing them, but only when they were shown a certain shade of pink. "I experimented upon myself and noted that my blood pressure, pulse, and heart rate was unaffected by exposure to this shade of pink. However, after intentionally increasing cardiovascular activity through a series of intense physical exercises, I found that this color had a marked effect on lowering my heart rate, pulse and respiration as compared to other colors," Schauss wrote in one paper, adding that he initially put this down to experimenter bias. "I awoke one night from a thought that suggested the pink color might have an effect on human aggression. If my heart beat, blood pressure, and pulse, could be reduced by a color, what effect might it have on aggressive behavior?" Schauss enlisted various collaborators and attempted to study the possibility in real-world settings. In one experiment, with the help of the San Bernadino County Probation Department and supervised by psychologist Dr Paul Boccumini, youths at a detention center were used as subjects. When the youths became upset or difficult, they would be placed into a room painted in this shade of pink, or another room on the wing. "Within 10 minutes, each youth sufficiently calmed down so that he or she could be returned to the main hall." In other experiments, Schauss found that the shade reduced physical strength, when compared to showing participants in tests a shade of blue. While that may sound pretty neat, or worthy of further investigation at least, there is something of a replication problem. Though many prisons began to paint cells or other rooms in Baker-Miller pink, there wasn't much in the way of supporting evidence. Further study, including work by Schauss, found little or no effect. It likely won't surprise you that this particular room was the site of many incidents, and the investigators attempted to track levels of aggression over time, before and after it was painted this shade of pink. "No overall aggression-reduction attributable to pink was indicated," they added. Further studies that investigated the hypothesis, and attempted to blind experimenters, found little evidence for any effect. "Our results rather speak against an aggression reducing impact of the color pink," the authors of one 2014 paper, who placed prisoners in either pink or white rooms and then logged aggressive incidents, found. "This finding is especially important as earlier studies that emphasize an aggression reducing effect of the color pink suffer from methodological shortcomings, but nevertheless inspired many prisons to paint their cells in pink color. Looking at less dramatic claims – that color affects grip strength – the same team cited a 1988 study that found no supporting evidence. "Significant results were only found in the less important Digital-Symbol measure and this result was attributed to learning effects." Apart from this, the effect observed was very small.</p>

Her scientific interests include genomics, personalized medicine, and bioethics. They were admitted with diagnoses ranging from meningitis and multiple sclerosis to delirium. But none of these symptoms fit neatly into any known disease, and one new symptom – lethargy, or sleepiness – distinguished it as a new phenomenon. It was categorized as either acute or chronic, though the two phases often blended together. "Acute encephalitis lethargica often presented as a gradual onset of non-descript flu-like symptoms, including malaise, low-grade fever, pharyngitis, shivering, headache, vertigo, and vomiting," a 2017 review of the topic explains. Within half an hour she was asleep, and died 12 days later." The disease was further broken down into other categories, some of which were deadlier than others. "Most notably, patients experienced an overwhelming desire to sleep and would sleep for abnormally long periods of time, but were easily awakened and often aware of everything that had transpired around them while in this state of pseudosomnolence," the review explains. "The mortality rate for the somnolent-ophthalmoplegic form was higher than that of other forms of encephalitis lethargica, exceeding 50%; however, a greater number of survivors experienced few or no long-term sequelae than in the other forms." EL, thought to have caused over half a million deaths, grew more distressing as the disease went on. "[The patients] would be conscious and aware – yet not fully awake; they would sit motionless and speechless all day in their chairs, totally lacking energy, impetus, initiative, motive, appetite, affect or desire; they registered what went on about them without active attention, and with profound indifference," Dr Oliver Sacks, who treated patients for the disease, wrote of his time spent at the Beth Abraham Hospital in New York in the 1960s in his book Awakenings. Patients could expect rigidity in their limbs, and to be immobile for long periods of time. "The chronic phase was characterized by parkinsonism, but sleep disturbances, oculomotor abnormalities, involuntary movements, speech and respiratory abnormalities, and psychiatric disorders were also common features," the 2017 review explains. The two diseases arrived and ended with similar timings, and so it makes sense that people would think that they are linked. However, looking at cities in the US between 1918 and 1923, no link was found between the two diseases, which appeared to arrive separately. One idea is that EL was neural damage resulting from the influenza epidemic, though with a delayed onset, as it was only noticed once enough damage had been done in the brain. More recently, a study looking at the few available brain tissue samples from patients concluded that an enterovirus – a group of viruses that includes polio, spread through coming into contact with secretions from an infected patient – was the likely cause of the disease. However, there is no overall consensus in what caused this bizarre and distressing disease. In 1927, having killed around 500,000, EL largely stopped circulating, and all but disappeared. While the disease disappearing is what's known as a "good thing", without knowing its cause we do not know how likely it is that similar diseases will emerge in the future. "Unless another cause of classical EL is positively identified, its return in the context of another influenza pandemic remains formally possible," one study concludes, though they add that this would bring a bright side. "Such a recurrence would provide an opportunity to establish the etiology of EL using modern methods."</p>

But amid all the fanfare, Gilani's X account — from which he tweeted as @chunkyfila, after formerly using his own name as a handle — passed unnoticed, despite numerous extreme views he expressed or amplified on the platform. After Jewish Insider requested comment, Gilani deleted his X and LinkedIn profiles; he also set his Instagram profile, which also uses @chunkyfila as a handle and formerly linked an empty — now deleted — account for Brain Child, to private. They definitely do not reflect Brad's views,” said spokeswoman Lauren Hitt. Gilani's social media activity includes numerous posts and retweets assailing Israel, which he has called a “settler project country.” In January 2025, just a few months before “Hot Girls for Zohran” launched, Gilani retweeted a post by Holocaust revisionist Ian Carroll — a recurring guest on Tucker Carlson's show — in which Carroll suggested that Israel was implicated in the Kennedy assassination and the 9/11 attacks. JFK famously wanted them registered as a foreign agent right before he was shot.” The post further repeated the long-debunked “dancing Israelis” conspiracy theory, which falsely claims Mossad agents had advance notice of 9/11. Last May, he shared another X user's assertion that “‘Israel has a right to exist' is a racist, anti-Palestinian dog whistle which implies the extermination of the Palestinian People.” Gilani has also repeatedly authored or promoted tweets sympathetic to or supportive of Hamas, in March 2024 sharing a post claiming that the bargaining table position of the terrorist organization — which rejects Israel's existence and which initiated the latest wave of the conflict with its rampage into Israeli territory on Oct. 7, 2023 — is “we want lasting peace and our basic human rights.” He also retweeted a clip of former Hamas chief Yahya Sinwar, who was killed by Israeli forces in October 2024 after he masterminded the previous year's attacks, with a caption that read, “Does the world expect us to be well-behaved victims while we are getting killed? For us to be slaughtered without making a noise?” Gilani also retweeted a post that attacked stylistic differences between the Time cover honoring Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who is Jewish, as “Person of the Year” and the issue announcing Sinwar's death as “A tale of two ethnicities.” In November 2023, Gilani reacted to a tweet decrying a Hamas rocket that struck an Israeli kindergarten in Sderot by writing, “I thought this was satire for a second.” He further boosted tweets mocking or dismissing Jewish Americans' concerns about rising antisemitism, retweeting one post stating that such fear “makes me laugh” because of how American Muslims purportedly downplay their own experience of Islamophobia, and another that sneered “really love the internet when I can watch videos of a Jewish pogrom in the West Bank where 3 Palestinians were killed and then see people on the Upper East Side tweeting about how unsafe they feel as Jews in New York after a Democratic primary election.” He also shared multiple posts denying or downplaying well-documented incidents of antisemitic violence during November 2024 riots in Amsterdam. In October 2024, after Iran launched more than 200 ballistic missiles and drones at Israel, he reposted a tweet, the text of which stated, “One side is cartoonishly evil in this war, and it ain't Iran.” On June 13, 2025, when Israel severely damaged Iranian nuclear sites and military installations, Gilani tweeted about the news, saying, “May Allah protect the children of this earth. Those who have to learn about the perils of war before getting to experience the simple pleasures of this dunya.” One day later, he retweeted a post stating “Tell Iran we voting for a Muslim in NYC please let them know lmao.” Gilani has also repeatedly signal-boosted individuals and organizations linked to the global propaganda network controlled by Beijing-based tech mogul Neville “Roy” Singham, including CODEPINK, BreakThrough News and pundit Rania Khalek, who first became famous as an apologist for Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad on Russian state-owned media. And in July of last year, Gilani retweeted a post asserting “there is no negotiating with Israel,” which the user labeled “a racist supremacist state.” He also shared another post that called for “overwhelming military force” against Israel over its policies toward Gaza. He also shared multiple posts urging Mamdani not to abandon the slogan “globalize the intifada,” a phrase that has been invoked at anti-Israel demonstrations and criticized as an anti-Jewish call to violence, and which the now-mayor has distanced himself from but refused to condemn. In 2020, Gilani referred to then-candidate Joe Biden as “a pedophile with dementia,” while in 2024 he quote-tweeted the then-president with the message: “My prayer is that your heart stops beating.” He has also asserted that Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) “is going to hell.” He also urged a primary campaign against House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY), writing to City Councilman Chi Osse: “Let's get his ass.” Mamdani reportedly discouraged Osse from running against Jeffries, and intervened to block an endorsement of his candidacy from the Democratic Socialists of America. Gilani has also lashed out at City Councilwoman Inna Vernikov, a Jewish Republican representing parts of Brooklyn. He has also attacked Mamdani's close ally Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), tweeting at him “u a f*cking b*tch fr.” Gilani has vented strong anti-police sentiments, having written that “all cops are going to hell,” as well as “there's no such thing as a good cop” and “we literally do not give a f*ck about videos of cops or military on their knees. we won't be satisfied until the entire racist system is on its knees.” He has also tweeted “f*ck the police” on at least two occasions. As the NYPD cleared the anti-Israel encampments at Columbia University on May 1, 2024, Gilani retweeted a post which stated, “Cops are violent psychopaths who pray for a moment like this where they get to live out their rotten fantasies of beating and killing protestors,” and added, “Reform isn't real.” Additionally, Gilani shared a statement from activists at Emory University that labeled police “pigs.” The full ‘What We Are Watching' updates are available only for paid subscribers.Please log in if you already have a subscription, or subscribe to access the latest updates.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>For nearly five decades, Steven Spielberg has helped define what alien stories mean to movie audiences. While details remain tightly controlled, early trailers suggest a story centered on humanity learning, all at once, that extraterrestrial life is real. It is also arriving at a moment when alien stories once again feel culturally charged. Before Disclosure Day lands in theaters on June 12, here is what we know and how it fits into Spielberg's long history with alien storytelling. Reflects real-world debate around UAP reports, declassified military footage and transparency in national security. Spielberg's alien films historically mirror threat eras, from Cold War tension to post-9/11 survival anxiety. Trailer hints at secrecy, global coordination and crisis messaging tied to unknown threats. Pop culture often shapes how civilians imagine crisis response, command structure and readiness timelines. Spielberg typically grounds global threats in personal experience, something that resonates strongly with service members. Disclosure Day follows a global moment of revelation: humanity becomes aware that aliens exist. The trailers hint at a darker tone than some of Spielberg's earlier alien films, with images of global panic, government secrecy and emotional fallout among ordinary people. The cast includes Emily Blunt, Josh O'Connor, Colin Firth, Eve Hewson and Colman Domingo, signaling a character-driven story rather than a purely spectacle-focused blockbuster. The bigger question many fans are asking is simple: why now? Spielberg's alien films have historically mirrored the emotional climate of their time. If that pattern holds, Disclosure Day could be less about aliens themselves and more about how modern society processes uncertainty, trust and global fear. Spielberg's first alien film arrived during peak late-Cold-War anxiety but rejected pure fear. Instead, Close Encounters treated aliens as unknowable but potentially transcendent. It also established a pattern Spielberg would return to repeatedly: aliens as mirrors of human obsession, hope and fragility. Instead of invasion narratives, Spielberg focused on loneliness, childhood and found family. grew out of an abandoned horror-leaning sequel concept to Close Encounters called Night Skies. Elements of that darker concept eventually fed into Poltergeist, Gremlins and E.T. More than two decades later, Spielberg returned to aliens with War of the Worlds, starring Tom Cruise. Unlike his earlier alien films, this one leaned hard into fear and survival. The movie grossed more than $600 million worldwide and captured a distinctly post-9/11 emotional tone. Though not primarily an alien movie, Crystal Skull technically marks another Spielberg entry into extraterrestrial storytelling. Still, it represents Spielberg engaging with the pulp sci-fi mythology of the 1950s, when alien stories often blended government conspiracy, ancient mysteries and Cold War paranoia. Early footage suggests Disclosure Day may explore those questions through personal stories rather than pure action spectacle. That approach would align closely with Spielberg's strengths as a filmmaker who uses genre to explore human psychology. Alien storytelling tends to rise during moments of global uncertainty. Historically, spikes have aligned with Cold War tension, technological leaps and cultural shifts in how humanity sees itself. In the modern era, that curiosity has returned through government UFO reports, declassified footage and renewed scientific conversations about life beyond Earth. The film is produced by Kristie Macosko Krieger and Spielberg for Amblin Entertainment, with Adam Somner and Chris Brigham serving as executive producers. Disclosure Day is set to open in theaters on June 12, 2026. Will it lean toward wonder, fear or something entirely new? If Spielberg's track record holds, the answer will likely be all three. What seems certain is that Disclosure Day will not just be about aliens arriving. It will be about what humanity becomes when faced with the impossible. And if Spielberg's past alien films are any indicator, that question may matter more than the aliens themselves.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As the search for 84-year-old Nancy Guthrie continues in Arizona, social media has become a parallel arena of speculation — with conspiracy theories, viral flight-tracking claims and unverified hospital rumours circulating widely online. Beyond that, officials have released limited details, leaving room for online conjecture to flourish. An X user, Paige Hearn, outlined what she described as the “Top 3 Wild Conspiracy Theories swirling around Nancy Guthrie's disappearance (Savannah Guthrie's mom) — remember, these are just online speculation & conspiracy theories, NOT facts! Authorities are investigating a real abduction/kidnapping with recent POI detention in Rio Rico, AZ. The sheriff's office has publicly pushed back against such claims, stating there is no evidence to support them. The FBI has previously warned that emerging AI technologies can complicate investigations, though there is no official indication that such tactics are involved in this case. Cartel or Border-Related Kidnapping — Given Rio Rico's proximity to the US-Mexico border, some posts have floated theories involving organised crime groups or cross-border activity. Speculation intensified further after online users began sharing alleged flight paths of a medical helicopter travelling between Rio Rico and Tucson. Claims about activity at Banner Hospital have not been independently verified. Another post circulating on X stated, “Nothing confirmed yet, but it does NOT appear the person flown-in to the hospital is Nancy Guthrie. Authorities still appear to be searching for her and other potential suspects.” Stay updated with the latest Trending,  India ,  World and  US news. Download the Mint app and read premium stories</p>

A closer look at the people and places shaping design, from inspiring interiors to exceptional products, in an expert edit by Wallpaper* global design director Hugo Macdonald. In Belgium's Genk, a new, otherworldly site has been unveiled. For its first edition, C-mine invited fashion designer Walter Van Beirendonck to create his version of a playground, which will remain in place for several years. Titling it ‘Welcome Little Stranger', the designer was inspired by extraterrestrial beings. He often creates work rooted in themes of identity, diversity and fantasy, all elements that can be found throughout his playground design. More importantly, Van Beirendonck created the space for children to feel belonging, individuality and freedom. To create the design, workshops were organised by Van Beirendonck and artist and former LUCA School of Arts student Emma Ribbens, where children from Genk were asked about extraterrestrial life and the role of play. Ribbens, a product and social designer, is driven by the belief that play is essential to society (it's a hot topic; just last summer, 21st Europe and Spacon created a blueprint calling for playgrounds to be reimagined). With her input, the design explores how to stimulate imagination and social connection, while leaving a positive impact on children. ‘Welcome Little Stranger is about wonder, the joy of discovery, and playing together – without limits.'

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The CW's Supernatural experienced longevity that is truly rare in genre television. Spanning nearly two decades and 15 seasons, Sam and Dean Winchester outlived nearly all of their TV contemporaries. It's more than difficult to keep an audience's attention for that long for various reasons. A primary pitfall that plagues long-running series is bloated mythologies and stakes that spiral out of control and repeat themselves. Rather, Supernatural used its world-ending rotating door of events to constantly place Sam and Dean under emotional distress. Throughout the history of Supernatural, Sam and Dean Winchester have faced everything from Leviathans, mythological figures and even God himself. The scope increased from season to season, but unlike other franchises, the focus kept getting smaller. Created by Eric Kripke, Supernatural famously started as a modern western, with two brothers exploring the various urban legends of small towns and backroads. The show's trick was that it never lost sight of this original vision, even as the villains and storylines increased in their magnitude. It's no secret to fans that Supernatural was supposed to end with the apocalypse arc in Season 5. Even when presented with the world-ending effect, saving Sam's soul was more important for Dean. The series not ending at its intended stopping point is further proof that fans cared more about the characters and their journey than a fitting conclusion. Viewers wanted more Sam and Dean; the specific storylines were secondary. For example, the opposite effect can be seen in the controversial latter seasons of HBO's Game of Thrones. The showrunners prioritized what they believed to be a fitting, cinematic conclusion that contrasted with the emotional logic of its characters. This led to Game of Thrones fans feeling betrayed by the finale, while fans of Supernatural clamored for more, even though Season 5 is considered a high point for the series. Supernatural's approach to its ever-rising stakes has led to it dominating streaming platforms years after the series finale. What mattered to viewers was the outcome the latest tragedy would have on Sam and Dean. That kind of endurance cannot be obtained by constantly introducing new threats, but by the lasting impact of well-written and relatable characters. The Winchesters are still a marketable powerhouse because the series never strayed too far from its foundation. The stakes were measured by emotional damage rather than shock value or body counts. Fans of Supernatural will point out that some of the show's most memorable moments came in the small, intimate scenes between Sam and Dean. The blueprint is there for future genre series to follow, but it's easier said than done. Share your opinions in the thread below and remember to keep it respectful.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Cognitive Warfare to Dominate and Redefine Adversary Realities: Implications for U.S. Special Operations Forces is authored by Jeremiah “Lumpy” Lumbaca, PhD and published by JSOU Press. Cognitive warfare goes far beyond traditional psychological operations; this new form of conflict combines cyber tools, psychological sciences, and neurosciences to alter perceptions and influence decision-making. In this occasional paper, Dr. Jeremiah Lumbaca argues that the U.S. is not yet prepared to face its adversaries using cognitive warfare tactics and proposes a way SOF can evolve to win in this new domain of conflict.” This form of conflict utilizes the intersection of cyber tools, psychological sciences, and neurosciences to achieve political or military objectives by altering enemy cognitive processes. This includes the deployment of cognitive contagions, ideologically charged constructs designed to spread virally across digital networks to embed specific patterns of thinking. Technological advancements in artificial intelligence and social media algorithms serve as the primary enablers for these operations. AI facilitates micro-targeting and the creation of hyper-realistic disinformation, such as deepfakes, while social media platforms prioritize engagement over accuracy. The report highlights that adversaries like the Chinese Communist Party and Iran already utilize these methods to erode internal cohesion and decision-making processes in contested regions. For U.S. Special Operations Forces, this environment necessitates a shift in organizational structure and training. Dr. Lumpy recommends the establishment of multi-disciplinary cognitive warfare cells at all echelons to include data scientists and behavioral psychologists.
