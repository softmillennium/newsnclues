                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>With less than 200 days to go until the U.S. men's national team kicks off the 2026 FIFA World Cup on home soil, the importance of gaining and maintaining form is becoming critical for Mauricio Pochettino's band of merry hopefuls. With 2025 in the rearview mirror for national team games after a successful November window yielded impressive wins over Paraguay and Uruguay, it's of paramount importance that players continue to shine for their clubs, building confidence to what will be the biggest occasion in the career of many who make the roster. Pochettino and his team will be watching closely, keeping particularly close tabs on those on the periphery, but they would have been pleased with what they saw this past weekend from a couple of USMNT's most established stars. Sign Up to Get Informed With SI FC. It had been over two months since Tim Weah had last scored for Olympique Marseille, but he found his way onto the scoresheet for the first time in Ligue 1 during his side's crushing 5–1 win over OGC Nice.Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Mason Greenwood had all but sealed victory for Marseille before Weah's strike in the 58th minute made it 4–0, but it was pleasing moment for the 25-year-old who was starting once more at right back. Fresh off a solid 67-minute showing for the USMNT against Paraguay, Joe Scally put in one of his best performances of the season with Borussia Mönchengladbach, playing the full 90 minutes in a 3–0 win over FC Heidenheim that extended the club's winning streak to four games. Scally led the match with 11 duels won, 13 defensive contributions, and 91% passing accuracy. Freese made several top-tier saves in his five stops as NYCFC rode Maxi Moralez's 27th-minute goal to qualify for their first Eastern Conference final since 2022, where they will face Lionel Messi and Inter Miami for a spot in MLS Cup. Malik Tillman became the first USMNT player in three years to score a goal and an assist in a Bundesliga match, as he helped Bayer Leverkusen to a 3–1 win over VFL Wolfsburg. The USMNT midfielder put himself in a perfect position to flick on an Alejandro Grimaldo cross into Jonas Hoffman, who scored the opening goal in the ninth minute. With Leverkusen already leading by a pair, Tillman scored his goal, finishing in the 33rd minute for his third goal in seven Bundesliga games this season. Christian Pulisic just loves the Derby della Madonnina as he scored his third goal in eight games against Inter Milan, leading AC Milan to a 1–0 win on Sunday. His 54th-minute finish came from a counterattack, as he found himself in the perfect spot to cash in on Alexis Saelemaekers' shot from distance, which Inter goalkeeper Yann Sommer had parried away. It was the first goal Pulisic had scored since Sept. 28 and it brought him to five goals in eight games, good enough for a tie atop the Serie A Golden Boot race, despite missing significant time due to injury.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Newcastle United are reportedly still keen on Inter Milan midfielder Davide Frattesi, as talk of a January exit continues to gain pace. But as his minutes continue to dry up under current boss Cristian Chivu, a Toon switch could be on the cards. According to Sport Witness, Newcastle were keen on signing the 26-year-old this summer but he ended up staying with the Italian giants. But after playing less than 200 minutes in Serie A this season, a Nerazzurri exit is in the offing. Indeed, Tuttomercatoweb reports that the Italian's path to the first team is being blocked by the likes of Petar Sucic and Piotr Zielinski, ergo, a January exit is 'very likely'. Inter rejected Newcastle's approach over the summer but that could be revisited in 2026. Back in August, Newcastle boss Eddie Howe did admit he would like another midfielder, in light of injuries to Joe Willock and Lewis Miley. Eventually, in what proved to be an eventful transfer window, which involved the Alexander Isak saga, they went on to sign Jacob Ramsey from Aston Villa. But that may not satisfy Howe's midfield needs with a lot of the season still to play. The former Bournemouth boss also downplayed Newcastle's chances of re-signing Nottingham Forest star Elliot Anderson, who was sold to the Tricky Trees last year to ease the Magpies' PSR (profit and sustainability) issues. We have not had any discussions on the January window. That will take focus for now," he said. "Certainly paying fees like that (£100 million), and I am not sure we are going to be in a position to do that. I am talking about that without any knowledge on January. It is just not really a window that big fees are usually paid. We can't let one transfer unbalance that." Get expert previews, data-driven predictions & winning insights with GOAL Tips on Telegram. While Frattesi is not playing a great deal at Inter, with his last start coming back on October 4, he is still featuring for his country. The Italian played in his nation's 4-1 defeat at home to Norway earlier this month, a game they led for a significant portion of the match. With Norway winning their World Cup qualifying group, Italy will have to go through the play-offs to reach the 2026 World Cup. After the game, Frattesi said: "It was two games in one. We knew that, with the goal difference, we wouldn't be coming into tonight's match with a good chance to qualify. "Explaining a 4-1 result is difficult, but I wouldn't call it humiliation. At least, that's how it felt to me on the pitch. It remains to be seen if Inter will entertain bids for Frattesi, whose contract runs until 2028, in January and if Newcastle are still keen on signing him.</p>

                </div>
                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ruben Amorim has offered a blunt assessment of Manchester United's academy pathway, admitting Chido Obi was promoted “too soon” last season while warning young stars that first-team opportunities must be earned. The head coach has yet to start a homegrown player in the Premier League this season, increasing scrutiny on whether young talent will feature during a congested winter schedule. His comments centred on two of United's most promising teenagers, Chido Obi and Shea Lacey, and whether either is ready to contribute meaningfully at the senior level. With Benjamin Sesko out and both Bryan Mbeumo and Amad Diallo set for Africa Cup of Nations duty, supporters have been looking toward Carrington prospects to fill upcoming gaps. Amorim, however, stressed that first-team readiness demands more than raw talent, and that neither player will be rushed for the sake of short-term needs. These measures, he explained, are designed to ensure that young players are physically and psychologically capable before stepping onto a Premier League pitch. “He [Chido] played last year, but I think it was too soon,” Amorim said when asked about Obi's chances of stepping in. On Lacey, he added: “I'm really happy with him. He struggled a little bit with injuries but they did a very good job balancing his body and you can sense he can manage more load during training. He has a lot of talent but when they come here they can sense the speed is completely different, so they need to spend more time with us to be prepared because our training is hard.” Amorim also addressed the broader academy link: “When you call a kid up to the first team, they need to behave really well. When we put these kids in to play in the Premier League, they will struggle, but will struggle less I think.” Get expert previews, data-driven predictions & winning insights with GOAL Tips on Telegram. His early months at Old Trafford saw him fast-tracked through the youth ranks, ultimately making eight senior appearances and becoming the youngest Premier League starter in Red Devils' history at 17 years and 156 days. Obi's development since then has been steady, but Amorim now believes the rapid exposure came “too soon”, reflecting the physical and psychological demands placed on a 16-year-old competing at senior level. His time with the U18s and U21s has shown glimpses of his prolific instincts, but the club's plan under Amorim is more focused on long-term growth. As United restructure their academy-to-first-team pathway, Obi is expected to spend more time under controlled development rather than immediate senior pressure. Lacey, meanwhile, has enjoyed a resurgent 2025 after overcoming an injury that halted his momentum the previous year. With United facing a packed winter schedule and losing two wingers to international duty, both Obi and Lacey may find themselves in contention for minutes, but only under Amorim's strict conditions. The Portuguese manager's comments make clear that opportunities will be earned through training standards and tactical readiness, not handed out due to injury crises. Manchester United will have a lot less tightly-packed fixture schedule in December compared to their European football-playing rivals. However, they will still play seven games in 30 days, starting with their clash against Crystal Palace on November 30.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Malik Tillman and Christian Pulisic celebrate their goals from the weekend Sebastian El-Saqqa/Alessio Morgese/Getty Images Whether it's on either flank, in an attacking central berth or even up front as part of a strike duo, the USMNT star delivers. On Sunday, pairing Rafael Leao in a front two for Milan, Pulisic scored the only goal of an important derby win against city rivals Inter. His strike showed the rest of Serie A that Milan, at their full-intensity best, can be in the Serie A title mix. Pulisic tops the scoring charts in Italy's top flight (five goals, level with Inter's Hakan Calhanoglu and Bologna's Riccardo Orsolini) and is approaching full fitness after missing four Milan games with a hamstring injury. Allegri first tried Pulisic as a striker in a competitive fixture in Milan's season-opening 2-1 defeat against Cremonese but, after testing out the idea of two false nines during pre-season, the Milan coach hinted it may happen again. Training together this week is an advantage because it increases the pace.” Determined to avoid any hint of complacency, Allegri also highlighted Milan's missed opportunities this term, times when he feels his side have lacked the right approach. But Pulisic, who has another firebrand as his international coach in Mauricio Pochettino, views the high standards as a big inspiration. ”We see a coach who wants to win,” Pulisic told DAZN. For the USMNT players who were not on international duty during the break, it was a weekend to remind everyone of their quality. Malik Tillman saw his older brother, Timothy, get two appearances for the USMNT in Philadelphia and Tampa, while he rested back in Germany. But on Saturday, Malik Tillman scored and assisted as Bayer Leverkusen secured a 3-1 victory away at Wolfsburg that nudged them into third place in the table ahead of Borussia Dortmund. The display continued a return to form for Tillman. After his summer move from PSV to Leverkusen, he took time to achieve lift-off, with his transition not helped when the manager who signed him, Erik ten Hag, was swiftly sacked. Missing games through injury has been another disruptive factor, but the undoubted ability that led to his €35million ($40m; £30m) transfer was evident at the weekend. He ticked off a statistical milestone, too, with Opta pointing out that he became the first United States international to record a goal and an assist in a Bundesliga match since Jordan Pefok for Union Berlin back in August 2022. Twenty-four hours earlier, Tim Weah had set the tone. His side thrashed Nice 5-1, and Weah's thunderous strike was one of the best goals as Marseille temporarily went top of France's Ligue 1. Gio Reyna's international break underlined what he can do, with the 23-year-old scoring against Paraguay, then assisting in last week's 5-1 win over Uruguay. He was introduced with 18 minutes remaining of the 3-0 win against Heidenheim. Reyna has only started one league game for the Bundesliga club he joined during the summer, after his once-promising career at Dortmund went stale. It seems he must continue to bide his time and convince Gladbach head coach Eugen Polanski he is ready to be a regular first-team player. No such problem for his compatriot Joe Scally, who was starting his ninth league game of the season and played the full match. In the Premier League, Chris Richards was back in one of the English top flight's best defences as Crystal Palace won again, beating Wolverhampton Wanderers 2-0. They were the first Premier League minutes Richards has missed for his club all season, and Palace fans will hope it was a one-off. It's Champions League time and Malik Tillman will get a tough test of his fine form as Leverkusen take on Manchester City tomorrow (3pm, Paramount+/DAZN). It will be an interesting game for Sergino Dest and Ricardo Pepi, too, as PSV head to Anfield to face a badly struggling Liverpool the following day (Wednesday, 3pm, Paramount+/ViX). In the Conference League, we might see if Richards has recovered when Crystal Palace take on Strasbourg (Thursday, 3pm, Paramount+/ViX). Then, on the weekend, Tyler Adams and Bournemouth travel to Sunderland (Saturday, 10am, Peacock Premium). He has also worked as a news and sport journalist for the BBC and hosts a podcast in his spare time.</p>

The US is moving to make it easier for football fans - including those from places once labelled by US President Donald Trump as "shithole countries" - to secure a visa to attend matches at next year's football World Cup.

Unveiled at the White House by Trump and FIFA chief Gianni Infantino, the FIFA Priority Appointment Scheduling System is aimed at expediting the US border process for holders of the 6 million match tickets being made available for the next men's World Cup.

"The United States is offering prioritized appointments so FIFA World Cup fans can complete their visa interviews and show they qualify," Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in November, advising that "now is the time to apply."

But Rubio had a warning for those who have already put money down on attending matches: "Your ticket is not a visa. It doesn't guarantee admission to the US."

Having a match ticket in the bag "guarantees you an expedited appointment," Rubio explained, reminding those planning to travel that "you're still going to go through the same vetting."

Sixteen cities - 11 in the US, three in Mexico and two in Canada - are scheduled to stage matches at the tournament, which with 48 competing nations will be twice the size of the 1994 World Cup, the other to be held in the US.

Forty-two of the 48 competing nations are confirmed, among them other past winners France, Germany, Spain, Uruguay and title-holder Argentina.

Another former champion, Italy, faces a play-off series in March next year along with 21 other teams hoping to win one of the six remaining slots.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The company set up to manage the failed European Super League, A22 Sports Management, has written to UEFA demanding pre-authorisation of its Unify League concept “within eight weeks”. In an 18-page letter sent to UEFA general secretary Theodore Theodoridis on Friday, A22 chief executive Bernd Reichart said its revamped idea is “fully consistent” with the Court of Justice for the European Union's (CJEU) landmark ruling in December 2023, which found that UEFA's approach to potential competitors breached EU law. That ruling has since been applied by a commercial court in Madrid, with UEFA recently failing to overturn that decision in a Madrid appeal court. “To date, three different EU courts, including the EU's highest court, have issued consistent rulings that leave no room for doubt: UEFA's abuse of its dominant monopoly position cannot stand, and its exclusionary practices must cease,” wrote Reichart. Incredibly, UEFA implemented its most recent non-compliant rules in June 2024, six months after the CJEU ruling. “As a result, UEFA is now exposed to substantial damage claims from injured parties, including clubs, players and A22.” Real Madrid revealed their intention to sue UEFA last month, when it emerged that they believe they are owed €4.5billion (£4billion, $5.2billion) in lost revenue over the stalled project's potential lifetime. Speaking at the club's annual general meeting on Sunday, Real Madrid president Florentino Perez said: “In 2021, UEFA was able to threaten the (12 ESL) clubs with expulsion, and they opened disciplinary proceedings against us. “Today, after our legal victories, the situation is radically different. La Liga and UEFA try to take away their importance but they treat us like fools. The strength of our case allows us to claim damages from UEFA. In his letter, which The Athletic has seen, Reichart also sets out the “compromises” A22 has made to its proposals, which have gone through several iterations, during seven months of talks with UEFA this year. Last December, A22 published its first Unify League plan, which called for a men's competition comprised of four leagues: Star, Gold, Blue and Union, with 32 teams each in the first two of those, and 16 in the last two. The clubs would then be split into groups of eight, playing each other home and away, guaranteeing a minimum of 14 games, before proceeding to a knockout competition. But A22, citing feedback from clubs, has now tweaked its proposal again as it has said it is willing to stick to UEFA's three-competition format, which means the Union League has been dropped and the Star, Gold and Blue leagues would have 36 teams each. The only difference from what we have now is that the leagues would be split into two 18-team groups with the clubs playing eight games each — four at home, four away — against eight different opponents, as per UEFA's new league-phase format. Its proposals for the women's competitions — an 18-team Star League and 16-team Gold League — are indistinguishable from the status quo, as are A22's plans for when all these games would be played. A22 also says it has made significant concessions to UEFA and European Football Clubs, the new name for the European Club Association, in terms of its governance proposals. This board would have veto rights regarding format changes, revenue distribution and commercial decisions. “We saw free-to-air football on television at the Club World Cup,” said Perez on Sunday, referring to DAZN's coverage of FIFA's revamped club competition this summer. We have Unify, which would allow us to broadcast the matches for free. “I can only think of one reason why UEFA wouldn't do it, because delaying it for a year means another year of million-dollar salaries for them.” That said, UC3, UEFA's new joint venture with EFC to market the Champions League and other club competitions, has recently enjoyed considerable success in selling its broadcast and sponsorship rights from 2027 onwards. It should also be noted that DAZN's decision to make its Club World Cup coverage free of charge followed a $1bn investment from the sports arm of Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, and the only major football league that is currently going to direct-to-consumer with a streaming offer is Ligue 1, a decision that has resulted in a dramatic drop in broadcast revenue for French clubs.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Mauricio Pochettino gets fired up during his news conference after the USMNT's win over Uruguay. In fact, I'm old enough to remember when the U.S. men's national team crashed out against Mexico in the Gold Cup final without much of a fight. I'm old enough to remember when, earlier in that same tournament, a succession of wins from a mostly MLS-based roster had some commentators wondering whether these players just wanted it more than their fancy teammates over in the Champions League. I'm old enough to remember when those same players got annihilated by Turkey and Switzerland just a few weeks earlier. And I'm old enough to remember when the majority of those U.S. fans rejoiced when the program replaced Gregg Berhalter with a proven world-class coach like Mauricio Pochettino. All of that happened ... within the past year and a half. As did this week's 5-1 win over Uruguay, which was powered by absolutely ridiculous finishing, fortuitous bounces and some poor goalkeeping: With seven months until the World Cup, it might not seem like there's much time left. From now until the summer, someone is going to get injured, someone is going to emerge out of nowhere, someone is going to stop playing for his club team, and the U.S. will either win or lose games that don't reflect the true quality of the team. Seven of those names were unsurprising: Howard, Onyewu, Bocanegra, Bradley, Donovan, Dempsey and Altidore all played over 1,000 minutes for the U.S. the previous year. Cherundolo wasn't much of a surprise, either. He'd only played 500-ish minutes the prior year thanks to a number of lower body injuries and the emergence of West Ham's Jonathan Spector, but he was the captain at Bundesliga club Hannover and he was fully healthy come South Africa. There weren't obviously better options than either of them. And then there was the one shocker: Robbie Findley, who played zero minutes for the U.S. in 2009 but emerged after a car accident that seriously injured Charlie Davies opened up a spot for him to play alongside Altidore. Among nonstarters in South Africa, only Jonathan Bornstein played more minutes (900-plus), but he lost his spot once Bob Bradley moved Bocanegra to fullback. And after Davies, the two most-used players in 2009 were Spector and midfielder Benny Feilhaber, who played heavy minutes off the bench in 2010. Herculez Gomez reacts to the United States' impressive 5-1 win over Uruguay. At the back, it was Fabian Johnson at right back and Damarcus Beasley on the left, with Geoff Cameron and Matt Besler in between. Manager Jurgen Klinsmann opted for a diamond midfield with Kyle Beckerman at the base and three shuttlers (Jermaine Jones, Bradley and Alejandro Bedoya). In 2013, Howard, Beasley and Altidore all played 1,000-plus minutes, while Dempsey, Bradley, Jones, Cameron and Besler all played at least 900. Bedoya clocked in around 820, while Beckerman played 680 and Johnson 580. That feels similar to the breakdown four years earlier. Howard, Beasley, Altidore, Dempsey, Bradley and Jones were all shoe-ins, while two of Besler, Cameron and Omar González (who played over 1,000 minutes in 2013) were expected to play in the center of the defense. If we say it was all but guaranteed that one of Besler and Cameron would start, then that lands us at seven clear starters once again. There was no Findley type on the field against Ghana in 2014, but there was, shockingly, no Landon Donovan, who played 800-plus minutes the year before. There was also no Eddie Johnson, who played 900-plus minutes in 2013 and seemed like a potential starter, and no Clarence Goodson, who featured in 880 minutes. From 2010 to 2014, the U.S. carried over four starters: Howard, Bradley, Dempsey and Altidore. Gab Marcotti talks about Gio Reyna's contribution to Mauricio Pochettino's USMNT. There was a three-man midfield for the first time: Tyler Adams, Weston McKennie and Yunus Musah. I think we can say that Turner, Adams, Robinson, McKennie, Zimmerman and Dest were penciled-in starters at this time in 2021. In 2021, Miles Robinson, Kellyn Acosta and Sebastian Lletget all played over 1,000 minutes. Robinson would've started in Qatar had he not torn an Achilles, while Acosta was sunset into a backup role with the emergence of Musah after the latter's one-time switch from England. Brenden Aaronson also played 800-plus minutes in 2021 but wasn't starting come the World Cup. To bring it all together: There have usually been around seven expected starters at the end of the year before the World Cup, one guy who will start if healthy, and then some combination of maybe-starters and outright surprises. Incredibly, very few of the most talented Americans have even hit 500 minutes this past year. These are the 11 players who broke that threshold: Matt Freese: 1,170 minutes Tim Ream: 1,108 Max Arfsten: 1,086 Chris Richards: 1,004 Alex Freeman: 976 Diego Luna: 953 Patrick Agyemang: 806 Malik Tillman: 765 Sebastian Berhalter: 704 Tyler Adams: 697 Luca de la Torre: 545 Some players below 500 minutes: Pulisic, Dest, McKennie, Musah, Weah, Turner, Sargent, Aaronson, Antonee Robinson, Folarin Balogun, Johnny Cardoso, Gio Reyna, Joe Scally, Tanner Tessman and Ricardo Pepi. Working from the 1,000-plus-minutes list, I think we can pencil in Freese, Ream and Richards all as starters. And I think we need to put Arfsten on the list, too. Pochettino clearly loves him, the switch to a back three helps cover up his matador tendencies out of possession, and the other option, Robinson, still hasn't started a Premier League game for Fulham this season. It's really hard to see anyone other than Adams starting in central midfield if he's healthy. It's also clear that Pochettino wants one of the three center backs to be more of a half-fullback-half-center-back -- this is what he did at Chelsea -- and Alex Freeman played that role and scored two goals (!?) It's also worth pointing out, not that I think this data is driving decision-making in any real way, but Freeman already looks like an all-time great MLS fullback, based on the goals-added metric from American Soccer Analysis. He won't turn 22 until after the World Cup. That's interesting, especially in light of recent comments by Canada manager Jesse Marsch, who suggested that managers might be able to rely on a smaller core of players than usual because the expanded World Cup means teams will have more days off between matches. I'm not sure whether Pochettino's approach is the right or wrong one, but it certainly makes this specific exercise a little trickier. If he's healthy, though, Balogun is clearly the best American striker -- he gets good shots unlike anyone else in the pool -- and he has played more minutes than any attacker since the Gold Cup. At right wing back, especially if Freeman is playing as a centerback-ish type, there's no real option other than Dest. He was injured for a good chunk of this year, so he didn't play much, but a wingback role also covers up his defensive inadequacies, and like Arfsten, he started the final two games of the year. Next to Pulisic, there are plenty of options: Luna, Tillman, McKennie, Weah, Reyna, maybe even Aaronson or Alejandro Zendejas. You've been asleep for half a decade if you're willing to confidently predict anything about Reyna's future, so he's out. Although he's currently injured, Tillman would be my pick. I'm not confident in this projection, but I think he gets a slight edge simply because he has played way more for Pochettino over the past year. Although they've played a lot, Sebastian Berhalter and de la Torre really don't make sense as starters. So it's between McKennie, Tessman, Musah and Cristian Roldan. Musah hasn't been called up since before the Gold Cup, so I'm not planting my flag there. McKennie wasn't called up this window, so he probably should be lower down my list, too. Reading the tea leaves suggests Roldan because of that one tea leaf that literally quotes Mauricio Pochettino as saying, "Cristian Roldan is maybe an example of if you want to build your perfect player." But it seems like there is one guy who comes out of nowhere to break into the starting XI every cycle. And given that he has appeared in only four games for the U.S. and didn't even get called up for the final two games in 2025, McKennie fits that bill. Now, my predicted lineup is almost definitely going to be incorrect. But with around seven guys who were key pieces this year, one injured star, and three players who have been in and out of the picture, it looks a lot like all of the other USMNT lineups that have started World Cups in recent years.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Meanwhile, in each of the 16 host cities, local organizers are in their communities drumming up both public enthusiasm and financial support for the mega-event. Further out of view, 600 specialists across 60-plus functional areas are putting in long hours inside FIFA's new Miami-area offices to deliver the biggest World Cup in history. It's the nucleus of FIFA's new centralized operating model, which represents a departure from its long-standing practice of leaning on a separate local organizing committee in the host country. FIFA's presence in the upscale suburb of Coral Gables has grown rapidly since the organization opened its office there in 2023. Chief Business and Strategy Officer Amy Hopfinger, the tournament's first U.S. employee, came aboard a year earlier after nearly two decades at U.S. Soccer. In fall 2022, Hopfinger met with her former U.S. Soccer colleague Dan Flynn (now an adviser to FIFA), along with Canadian and Mexican counterparts Peter Montopoli and Jurgen Mainka, to sketch out a proposed organizational structure for North America. “We sat down and took the org chart for Qatar, the org chart for [the Women's World Cup in] Australia and New Zealand and put together a recommendation,” Hopfinger recalled. “I have absolutely no idea how close we are at this point. On paper, short-term positions requiring five days a week of in-office work might not seem like an attractive proposition for quality talent, but Hopfinger said the extraordinary nature of the project made staffing the office fairly easy. “Honestly, it wasn't a hard sell,” Hopfinger said. “I know it's untraditional in the U.S. to take contract positions, but you also have a lot of people that do this. So, it was a good balance of people that have been in that world and then people who saw a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.” The leadership team that emerged is a hodgepodge of North American executives who left permanent positions at places like the NFL and Coca-Cola, transplants from FIFA headquarters in Zurich and major event veterans who signed on for their latest assignment. One marble-clad lobby is dominated by an oversized Club World Cup 2025 soccer ball sculpture; the other is draped with a large 2026 World Cup banner hanging from a second-floor balcony. Next summer, the wide-open sixth floor will serve as the tournament operations center, just as it did during last summer's Club World Cup. Each of the functional areas will have a desk for a high-level representative on the floor, and key operational groups, like security and transportation, will have full pods. “Everyone will be on one floor, so that if we need to pull people together, we can,” said Hopfinger, noting that top executives who are traveling during the competition can be quickly pulled in virtually. This has led to tension over costs, obligations and commercial opportunities. Host city leaders have expressed gratitude for the Miami office's advocacy efforts on their behalf while acknowledging it doesn't always have the power to effect change. While many local organizers are still scrounging for revenue and even scaling back initial plans, Hopfinger and Walton said they have helped garner some key concessions from Zurich to ease the burden on cities. These include providing flexibility on the format and scope of fan fests; the elimination of requirements for ticketing centers and free public transit; and incremental easing of commercial restrictions for the Host City Supporter program. We don't want this to be a black eye on anyone. Yes, FIFA makes a lot of money off these tournaments that gets invested back in the sport, but we want to leave the cities in a better place than when we got there. FIFA will maintain a presence in Coral Gables beyond 2026, but how significant is an open question. But with the 2027 Women's World Cup set to be played in Brazil and the 2031 edition all but guaranteed to be held in the U.S., along with Mexico, Costa Rica and Jamaica, FIFA may also see the value in maintaining a sizable, cross-functional workforce in Miami. One thing is certain: Following the 2026 World Cup, hundreds of sports professionals will be looking for new jobs. Contract employees from FIFA will represent a decent chunk of that cohort. Employees of host cities, brands and others who have staffed up for the World Cup will all be free agents come August 2026. If Hopfinger has a sense of FIFA's plans for the Miami office after the World Cup, she isn't letting on.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Trying to identify the greatest women's soccer players of all time isn't simple. When artificial intelligence was tasked with ranking the top 15 of all time, the outcome blended nostalgia with modern brilliance. From pioneering legends to today's superstars, this list captures the story of women's soccer through those who shaped it most. Carli Lloyd's name will always be linked to that unforgettable hat-trick in the 2015 World Cup final. It was a performance that captured her determination and sense of occasion. Across 316 caps, Lloyd built a reputation for resilience, precision, and an unmatched work ethic. She led by example, often turning tight matches through pure willpower. Even betting markets have reflected her influence, with bettors tracking her form across competitions and checking odds from states like New Jersey and Michigan. Fans are also finding where to bet in Texas and other states with betting restrictions. Through offshore alternatives, fans have the opportunity to place wagers not only on the U.S. Women's Soccer Team but also on how many goals they think a specific player will score in a specific match event. Lucy Bronze's all-round quality has made her one of England's finest. Comfortable in defense or pushing forward, her athleticism and technical ability transformed how full-backs are viewed. Bronze's contributions to England's European Championship win and their strong World Cup showings made her a national icon. She's also excelled at club level with Manchester City and Barcelona, showcasing her adaptability and hunger to keep improving. Fierce, confident, and commanding, she became the standard by which others were judged. Goalkeepers often go underappreciated, but Solo's presence ensured that would never be the case. Ada Hegerberg has spent her career rewriting records. The Norwegian striker became the first Ballon d'Or Féminin winner in 2018 and remains one of Europe's most consistent scorers. Her time at Lyon has produced goals by the hundreds and trophies to match. Hegerberg's finishing instincts and strength make her a nightmare for defenders, and at only 29, she still has time to add more chapters to her story. Formiga's international career is nothing short of extraordinary. From her debut in 1995 to her final cap in 2021, she represented Brazil across seven World Cups and seven Olympics. While she never lifted a World Cup, her influence on Brazilian soccer cannot be overstated. She is proof that dedication and passion can transcend generations. Sam Kerr's energy and finishing have made her one of the sport's most recognizable figures. Sun Wen was a superstar before global attention turned toward women's soccer. The Chinese forward combined creativity, intelligence, and composure, becoming one of Asia's first world-class players. She inspired a generation of young girls in Asia to believe they could compete at the highest level. Alexia Putellas has become the face of modern Spanish soccer. Her control in midfield, ability to dictate tempo, and eye for goal make her one of the most technically gifted players ever. With more international goals than any other player, male or female, she has been the heartbeat of Canada's national team for two decades. Her leadership helped secure Olympic gold in Tokyo, a crowning moment in a career defined by consistency and humility. She's a forward who leads by example, letting her soccer speak louder than any words could. Her blend of speed, control, and finishing made her a nightmare for defenders and an inspiration for millions. She helped transform how the world viewed women's soccer, showing it could draw crowds and create heroes every bit as memorable as the men's game. Homare Sawa's 2011 World Cup campaign remains one of soccer's most emotional stories. The Ballon d'Or that followed was recognition of her grace under pressure and her ability to unite a nation through sport. Michelle Akers was a powerhouse in every sense. Akers was also one of FIFA's Players of the Century, a testament to her impact on the sport's development. Known for her unmatched heading ability and clutch goals, she was the emotional leader of the USWNT for years. She played every match as though it were her last, leaving everything on the pitch. No list feels complete without Marta at the top. Her flair, pace, and technical genius have thrilled fans for over two decades. With six World Player of the Year awards and more World Cup goals than anyone in history, Marta's record speaks for itself. North Carolina doesn't just produce athletes; it raises competitors who change their sport… North Carolina doesn't just produce athletes; it raises competitors who change their sports. The only thing more frightening, is a glimpse at your empty bank account when it comes to deciding whether or not you can grab Resident Evil Village this month. Capcom's successor to its long-running survival-horror franchise is finally out, and if you've read our review then you know the game is a winner on multiple levels. Critical Hit is built on the idea that we are more than one thing.
