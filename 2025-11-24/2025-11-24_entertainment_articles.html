He explains (via narration) how the emergence of Shanghai's Stock Market ushered in “the greatest explosion of wealth in human history,” an explosion that's launched the former factory worker to stratospheric riches. “But I don't know if this is all a dream, or a reality from which we can't wake.” No sooner does the sleek, besuited businessman allude to living in a nightmare disguised as a fantasy than his feared fate comes to fruition. A car crash sends his suitcase filled with money swirling into the night sky. Onlookers rush to gather whatever loose bills they can grab, while Mr. Bao lies motionless on the street, bloodied but wide awake — for now. Related Stories ‘Industry' Is Back: The Cult-Hit HBO Series Sets Season 4 Premiere Date and Unveils First Teaser Miss the Golden Age of Weird Netflix? A melodrama rooted in commerce and ripped open by compassion, Wong's 30-episode “limited” series sees the legendary director in familiar and foreign territory at once. Mr. Bao is a stoic lead trapped by invisible forces and torn between passions. Fans will take comfort in these familiar models, but they may be shocked when the first few episodes cram in more dialogue than his previous films combined, while much of what happens — internally and externally — is underlined by dense, even repetitive exposition. Mr. Bao is no fool, but that doesn't mean he's immune to their temptations. Value in business is built on demand, and demand is ethereal — it only exists when someone says it does. No matter the material goods he cloaks himself in, his life is still built on intangible worth. Can he manage to preserve the refined reality he's put together, or will it slip through his fingers like sand in an hourglass? Considered from our modern-day lens (aka late-stage capitalism), the answer seems obvious, but therein lies the suspense in Mr. Bao's personal journey. Set in China's Roaring '90s, “Blossoms Shanghai” goes all out in depicting the country's unprecedented financial boom — and its eye-popping attractions. Crowds fill the lavish entryways of trendy clubs and clamor for access to bustling markets. Neon lights pulse and glide in currents, reflecting off the shimmering accessories of flush passersby. Buildings tower and gleam as if burnished by the money flowing through them — none more so than the thrumming heart of Shanghai's nightlife, Huanghe Road, a teeming swathe of high-end restaurants (a stretch of which Wong and his team recreated to scale). Yet disaster is always lurking despite the ample evidence of Shanghai's immense, immediate prosperity. Even in the series' opening hours, which rush to establish the country's frenzied obsession with the new market economy and how Mr. Bao harnessed it through the tutelage of his wise Uncle Ye (You Benchang), there are searing reminders of what happens when similar bets don't pay off. Hearts are broken, friendships are betrayed, and lives are lost, all in the hopes of getting rich quick, and it's in these tertiary stories surrounding Mr. Bao's opulent bubble that “Blossoms Shanghai” finds the friction needed for lasting tension. Within each retelling, the scene expands, and new details emerge. Including these alternate scenes establishes a structure fit for the juicy twists that sustain a grand melodrama — not only making it easier for episodes to end on a key revelation, but to hint at secrets waiting in Mr. Bao's expanded backstory. The director's playful engagement with time also lends “Blossoms Shanghai” a flexible temporality, as if everything that happens is both unknowable and inevitable. It's a fitting description for a 30-hour limited series — not as open-ended as an ongoing series, yet long enough (and extravagant enough) to seem boundless — and seeing how Wong utilizes his broadest canvas to date is motivation enough to stick around for the full mural. The early onslaught of subtitles aside, “Blossoms Shanghai” is easy to fall for. It's sly and funny, charming and fierce, even while the series may lack the subtle grace of the artist's finest films (and feel, at times, like a capitulation to what TV used to be, back when the future César Award winner started out writing soap operas, more than what it's become in the fading era of small-screen auteurism). Still, “Blossoms Shanghai” is active and alive in a way that invites attentive viewing as much as it rewards that investment. Time is not a thing to be wasted, and Wong Kar Wai knows that better than most. Three episodes will be released weekly through the end of January.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>"All I Want for Christmas Is You" sleigh rides to No. 1s, “The Fate of Ophelia” is her third to have ruled for at least seven weeks. It trails only “Anti-Hero” (eight, beginning Nov. 5, 2022) and ties “Blank Space” (seven, Nov. 29, 2014). No song has led the chart longer consecutively from its debut since Olivia Rodrigo's “Drivers License” was No. Elsewhere in the Hot 100's top 10, Mariah Carey's “All I Want for Christmas Is You” returns to the region, making a three-place festive flight to No. The modern classic, from 1994, has led for 18 total weeks dating to its first in 2019. Check out the full rundown of this week's Hot 100 top 10 below. The Hot 100 blends all-genre U.S. streaming (official audio and official video), radio airplay and sales data, the lattermost metric reflecting purchases of physical singles and digital tracks from full-service digital music retailers; digital singles sales from direct-to-consumer (D2C) sites are excluded from chart calculations.

In partnership with Billboard, data deemed suspicious or unverifiable is removed, using established criteria, before final chart calculations are made and published. “The Fate of Ophelia” drew 23.4 million official streams (down 11% week-over-week) and 62.8 million radio airplay audience impressions (up 1%) and sold 19,000 (down 22%) in the United States for the tracking week of Nov. 14-20. The single adds a sixth week at No. 1 on the Streaming Songs chart, rises 4-3 for a new best on Radio Songs, and drops to No. 2 after five weeks atop Digital Song Sales. (Of the song's sales total, 14,000 were from CD singles — its original and “Alone in My Tower Acoustic Version” mixes, each featuring instrumentals as second cuts — that shipped during the tracking week and the remaining 5,000 were downloads.) As previously reported, “The Fate of Ophelia” parent album The Life of a Showgirl glitters with a seventh week atop the Billboard 200 chart (following its modern-era-record debut of 4.002 million equivalent album units). Mariah Carey's “All I Want for Christmas Is You” — the No. 1 at last, for three weeks that holiday season. Only two songs have led longer over the chart's 67-year history: Shaboozey's “A Bar Song (Tipsy),” in 2024, and Lil Nas X's “Old Town Road,” featuring Billy Ray Cyrus, in 2019, each for 19 weeks. 1, extending her mark for the most among soloists and moving to within one of The Beatles' overall record 20. “All I Want for Christmas Is You” concurrently crowns the multimetric Holiday 100 chart, which returns for the season. HUNTR/X's “Golden,” from Netflix's KPop Demon Hunters, keeps at No. 2 on the Hot 100, following eight weeks at No. Alex Warren's “Ordinary,” which ruled the Hot 100 for 10 weeks starting in May, holds at No. 3, while topping Radio Songs for a 23rd week (67.2 million in audience, down 9%). The Hot 100's top five is stationary, rounded out by Olivia Dean's “Man I Need” at its No. 4 high and Swift's “Opalite,” from The Life of a Showgirl, at No. Leon Thomas' “Mutt” rises 7-6 for a new Hot 100 best as it leads the multimetric Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart for a 13th week and Hot R&B Songs for a 30th frame. Justin Bieber's “Daisies” dips 6-7 on the Hot 100, after reaching No. 7 high; and Morgan Wallen's “I Got Better” descends 9-10, also after reaching No. 7, as it tops Hot Country Songs for a seventh week.

Beyoncé is raring to go.

For her second F1 Las Vegas Grand Prix outfit on Saturday night, the singer slipped into a custom bright red Ferrari romper styled with towering Giuseppe Zanotti platform sandals to match.

She threw a matching glossy red coat over her shoulders and completed her look with a black Ferrari cap, a wavy silver-toned choker, dark sunglasses and black leather gloves.

Jay-Z, on her arm, wore head-to-toe black teamed with Timberland boots.

Queen Bey's look was, of course, inspired by the actual jumpsuits F1 racers wear in the car — right down to the Ferrari logo on her chest.

But with its cheeky cut, plunging unzipped neckline and high-fashion accessories, it was decidedly different than the real thing.

Earlier in the day, Beyoncé opted for yet another jumpsuit: a full-length custom Louis Vuitton with black and red accents, including pointed-toe black boots and red fingerless gloves.

She shared a short video to her Instagram account, writing, “Give it to Mama!” as she stepped into a race car.

Both sporty looks are a quick pivot from her menswear-inspired ensemble she wore to support friend and fellow Destiny's Child member Kelly Rowland on November 9, though she posted those images to her feed just this past weekend.

Other celebrities in attendance included Cynthia Erivo, Naomi Campbell, Ben Affleck and more — though no one is quite as deserving of the best-dressed award as the queen herself.

His son Alexander stars in the queer BDSM romance “Pillion,” up for 10 British Independent Film Awards, and his other son Bill stars in Gus Van Sant‘s first feature in seven years, “Dead Man's Wire.” The Venice and Toronto International Film Festival premiere is one of the flagship releases from rookie distributor Row K Entertainment, and it's based on the true story of conspiracist Tony Kiritsis. In 1977, he entered the Indianapolis offices of the Meridian Mortgage Company with a sawed-off shotgun to hold its president (Dacre Montgomery) hostage, alleging the corporate bigwig fucked him over on mortgage payments.

The film receives an awards-qualifying run on December 12, followed by a limited release January 9, and wide release the following week on January 16. Penned by first-time feature screenwriter Austin Kolodney, “Dead Man's Wire” also stars Cary Elwes, Myha'la, Colman Domingo, and even Al Pacino in a brief role appropriate for the fact that this hostage-style thriller recalls Pacino's own “Dog Day Afternoon.” The ripped-from-the-headlines story in “Dead Man's Wire” also brings to mind recent news breaks that have turned assassins fighting for the working class into folk heroes — like Luigi Mangione, accused of killing UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson in December 2024. We're used to seeing Bill Skarsgård in extreme costume and makeup, whether starring in “Nosferatu” or as the killer clown in the “It” films, but “Dead Man's Wire” gives the actor a chance to shine in a more stripped-down dramatic role as a mortal human being. Ultimately, ‘Dead Man's Wire' concedes that Kiritsis' violent actions had more negative effects than positive ones.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Jodie Sweetin's alcohol addiction began when she was just a teen after attending former “Full House” co-star Candace Cameron Bure's wedding. “Well, the first time I ever drank, I was like 14… and it was at Candace's wedding, and I was just a blackout drinker,” Sweetin revealed on last Thursday's episode of the “Skinny Confidential” podcast. Sweetin, 43, recalled grooving on the dance floor to “YMCA” at the reception, but couldn't remember anything after that. Not a good mix,” she joked, describing herself as an “idiot” 14-year-old. The next morning, Sweetin felt “awful” and embarrassed, but also said that something “clicked.” By the time she was 15 or 16 years old, Sweetin became aware that she “drank and partied” in a different way than her friends. “They were like, ‘Bro settle down,'” she said of her friends, noting that she would then go and find new groups of people that could match her partying habits. By clicking above you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy. Sweetin believes that she turned to substances because she struggled with ADHD and wanted to make her “brain work better.” “I always say, I would have struggled with addiction issues regardless of being on TV or not,” she said. “And to be fair, that gave me some of the ability to be able to find treatment and find help in ways that I might not have had I not worked as a child,” Sweetin continued. “But it's very hard [when] you have to make all your mistakes publicly.” Sweetin —  who shares daughters Zoie, 17, and Beatrix, 14, with ex-husband Cody Herpin — found sobriety after having kids. “It's been up and down, but it's been 16 years since I've drank alcohol and 13 years since I relapsed on meds with a car accident that I was in,” she shared.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In the clip, Robert pauses, visibly moved: “As soon as I opened the door and saw that you were going to be my partner, I felt safe and protected. You always have faith in me … you've also made me a better person in so many ways … I just want to thank you for being my best friend.” His words reflect a bond that goes beyond the glitz of sequins and spotlights — this is friendship, trust, and growth. Witney, fighting back tears, replies softly, “I can't even talk … you uplift everyone around you … It has been such a special memorable season for me … just know you will have another older sister to bug you and tell you what to do in life … Team Irwin forever.” Their sincerity shines through, and fans watching across Instagram and TikTok have praised the moment as one of the most genuine in the show's history — not just a dance partnership, but a real human connection. Witney, ever the pro, was quick to reassure fans that she was okay — though she did place a chunk of her hair on the judges' table and later captioned another clip, “Well this happened … And yes that's my real hair ripped out of my scalp,” before noting, “Blood, sweat, and hair went into this freestyle.” Rather than letting the mishap derail them, they leaned into it. The intensity only ramped up — and fans are now buzzing about how wild their finale dance might be, predicting flips, lifts, and all the adrenaline that comes with high-stakes choreography. A positive response — like asking thoughtful follow-up questions — indicates genuine engagement. Rather than brushing it off, Robert leaned in, asking, “What species?” and diving deeper into the description with sincere curiosity. At one point he even offers, “I have a bird book with me, we can go through it.” Viewers praised him for being kind, curious, and genuinely invested — even in a casual TikTok trend. One commenter joked, “Robert wrote the bird theory,” while another marveled at how he whipped out a bird identification book like it was no big deal.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Beatles has just become its own thing now. And the Beatles, I think, exist without us.” Then George breaks into a mischievous grin and quotes a song that his old mate John Lennon once sang, back in 1966. It's been digitally restored and expanded by Peter Jackson's WingNut Films team, using the same technology they used for Get Back, which dazzled fans four Thanksgivings ago in 2021. Giles Martin has remastered the music and produced a new Anthology 4 album. There's also an emotionally intense new Episode Nine, focusing on the three surviving bandmates, who meet up in the early Nineties, to work on this project together. Anthology holds up as the definitive Beatles documentary, told by all four in their own words. Just Paul McCartney, Ringo Starr, Harrison, plus archival interviews from the late John Lennon, looking back at people and things that went before. It captures the frantic madness of their life as a band, young boys transforming the world in just a decade together. As Episode Nine director Oliver Murray tells Rolling Stone, “It blows my mind that George is 24 when he finishes Sgt. “It was brave, in a way,” Giles Martin says now. But it was a cathartic process for all of them. I think they'd forgot what it was like, because there'd been so much mud thrown in different directions since they broke up. I think it's a little bit like finding an old photo album, looking at photographs, and then realizing actually you had an amazing relationship with that person.” When the Anthology doc debuted in 1995, it was a cultural shock. It defined the Beatles as we've known them ever since — not as an event that happened back in the Sixties, but an ongoing phenomenon that keeps growing and evolving. “A bit TOO legendary for our liking, because we're still living it.” For way too long, the Fabs story had been framed with a sickly sense of nostalgia — a fairy tale from the good old days. But by the time Anthology arrived in the Nineties, there was a new generation of Beatles fans too young to relate to that nostalgia, or to think of this music as a thing of the past — because the Beatles were more vibrant and influential and challenging than ever, in every corner of the music world. Upcoming John Lennon and Yoko Ono Doc Will Focus on Couple's Interview Given the ‘Afternoon Before He Was Killed' Expanded 'Anthology Collection' Is a Treasure Trove of Beatles Greatness Hear Paul McCartney Read an Excerpt From His New Book ‘Wings' At the time, people were stunned at how much they loved Anthology — sure, everyone expected to enjoy it, but not this much. It was (and is) a joy to spend time with, whether you drop in anywhere at random or binge the whole ten hours. All three albums — outtakes, demos, live slop, studio chatter — became mega-selling hits, in the days when people paid money for music. Hell, it's no coincidence that 1997 was one of the best years ever for rock albums — every band made their next record under the Anthology spell. Most fans probably haven't watched it in years, since it's only been available via old VHS tapes and DVD, where the archive footage looks shabbier with the years. Martin says, “Anthology was that organic process of doing Get Back, with Peter Jackson and the team saying, ‘Maybe we should look at redoing Anthology 30 years on. '” Martin used that de-mixing technology for the music. The famed Shea Stadium concert, drowned out by 56,000 screaming fans, now sounds startlingly clear. “The first time I ever came to Abbey Road with my dad was for Anthology,” Giles says. I just couldn't believe how good they sounded — I remember ‘A Day in the Life' on four-track tape being played to me in that room. It's probably quite a poignant thing for me, because ever since then, my ambition in everything I've done with the Beatles is to try and get that feeling.” “We were at war then,” Paul says in Episode Nine. George, sitting right beside him, adds, “We weren't talking much.” (Except in songs like “Sue Me Sue You Blues,” “How Do You Sleep?,” “Dear Friend,” “Early 1970,” “God,” and the many other solo songs they aimed at one another.) Their wounds started healing over the years — when John and Yoko separated for a while, Paul was the one she sent out to L.A. to advise him on how to win her back. George, Paul, and Ringo jammed at Eric Clapton's wedding in 1979. But bizarre as it seems now, there was never a single moment after 1969 when all four Beatles set foot in the same room. It was a decade later, in 1991, when British directors Bob Smeaton and Geoff Wonfor began to expand Neil Aspinall's shelved film into something new, with the surviving Beatles finally ready to tell their side of the story. “George and Paul would have dinner with each other occasionally,” Martin says. You can see it's refreshing for them because, as they always said, there's only four people who knew what it was like to be in the Beatles.” The doc became Anthology instead of The Long and Winding Road — George couldn't bear naming it after a Paul song. Yoko eventually screened it with a stopwatch, to measure how much screen time Paul got versus John. Yet the group still shared their unbreakable bond. Seeing as other people had a go at it, we thought it might be good from the inside-out, rather than from the outside-in. “Free As A Bird,” “Real Love,” and “Now And Then” were home demos recorded at the Dakota in the late Seventies, from a cassette that Yoko provided. Because it's quite emotional — hearing our old mate sing this little song.” They cut “Free As a Bird” and “Real Love,” both hit singles, yet gave up on “Now and Then” in one afternoon. Nobody could even tell what Paul heard in it — but with typically bloody-minded Macca tenacity, he refused to let it go. “With anyone else, this would definitely be the end,” he admits. “But with the Beatles, you've got to watch out—they could do it. There's always a surprise somewhere down the line. Decades later, he turned this demo sketch into the Beatles song he always knew it deserved to be — a soulful tribute to his old mate. “Now And Then” became the band's final song, a worldwide hit in 2023. “This has been a really nice day for me, chaps,” Ringo says. The other two reply with witty quips, but Ringo is utterly earnest, not even a smile. “It's been really beautiful and moving for me. I like hanging out with you two guys.” It's more poignant now than ever to see them play guitar in the good-day sunshine, lounging on the lawn at George's Friar Park estate. They had no way of knowing that just a few years later, George would get viciously attacked and nearly killed by an intruder in his home, not far from the spot where they're sitting. “Episode Nine needed to offer a new layer of self-reflection,” Oliver Murray says. I think it's quite melancholic at times.” Their shared history still seems painful onscreen. “It is like a living conversation between them,” Murray says. “This wasn't some fireside chat where they think about the past and this distant thing that they were in. So Episode Nine hopefully gives space to watch them looking inward, rather than just talking outward.” That's why Paul has been getting up there onstage all fall, on his amazing current tour, and singing John's 1965 confession “Help!” for the first time since the Beatles broke up. It's a vulnerable moment: Paul, in his 80s, getting back to a song his best friend sang in their early 20s, still trying to make sense of John's pain, still trying to heal their broken bond. But in his heart, he's still singing for John. Of course, Lennon's death haunts everyone in Anthology. “I feel sorry for John,” George says in the new episode. “Because the Beatles went through a lot of good times, but also went through some turbulent times, and as everybody knows, when we split up, everybody was a bit fed up with each other. But for Ringo, Paul and I, we've had the opportunity to have all that go down the river and under the bridge and to get together again in a new light. I think he would've really enjoyed this opportunity to be with us again.” Shut up!”) But it's also full of heartache, as when Ringo recalls how he quit and told his bandmates, “I feel unloved and out of it, and you three are really close.” Each one replied, “I thought it was you three.” George is a master of bitchy one-liners. It's what I love in life — all that making music.” “Episode Nine may conclude the series, but it's not an ending,” Murray says. “I hope it's a handover and a conversation between one generation and the next, because I wanted to leave with as many questions as answers. When you look at the Beatles, it tells you as much about where WE are culturally as it does about the Beatles themselves. They're a sort of cultural language that's carried from one generation to the next, and now it's in the ground-water. “The live audio was really challenging,” he says. And I always go for the most real it can possibly be. There's certainly not some sort of performance plug-in I can switch on that makes them better. It's the same thing with the Beatles—you clean them up, and you realize they're basically just like a live punk band.” “That way it generates itself, as opposed to market forces or anything like that.” All four volumes are collected in the 191-track Anthology Collection. This had to be the final frontier, right? Paul quipped, “George Martin reckons if we put out anything after this, it'll have to be issued with a government health warning.” Little did they know. Not even Mr. Martin could have imagined how his boys would get far more famous and beloved in the 21st century. Jimmy Cliff, ‘The Harder They Come' Reggae Giant, Dead at 81 Investigators Exploring Possibility Celeste Rivas' Body Was ‘Refrigerated' Before Move to Tesla: Source Oasis' Reunion Tour Was All About the Joy of Positive Masculinity A Company Is Building Communities for Right-Wing Christians. These guys and their songs always belong to tomorrow. And when it comes to their future, tomorrow doesn't know a damn thing. There's only two things you can safely predict about them: (1) it's crazy how much people adore the Beatles, and yet (2) the world's collective craving for them keeps growing anyway. “I couldn't put it any better than George does in the episode,” Murray says. “The Beatles will go on without all four of them, because they belong out with us now.” But Anthology brings the story down to these boys from Liverpool, and the unique four-way chemistry that bonded them together. “They became the closest friends I'd ever had,” said Ringo. We really looked out for each other.” Watching Anthology means not just celebrating that bond, but becoming part of it, as the music brings the Beatles to life.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Subscribe for full access to The Hollywood Reporter Subscribe for full access to The Hollywood Reporter In their first extensive interview about 'The Testament of Ann Lee,' they're game to talk everything past, present and future — including using "zero AI" in their latest film. Brady Corbet and Mona Fastvold have been here before — quite recently, in fact. The partners in life and work are back in Los Angeles for another cycle of hybrid awards-release promotion, merely a year after their film The Brutalist made the same rounds — eventually going home with three Oscars in addition to a nomination for best picture. They wrote that midcentury epic together, with Corbet directing. Their Hollywood encore tour is in honor of another epic co-writing project, The Testament of Ann Lee, this time directed by Fastvold. “This process of campaigning a movie is kind of a full-time job and so you end up neglecting every other aspect of your job and life,” says Corbet from a hotel restaurant patio, sitting between me and Fastvold. Felicity Jones on the Unconscious Echoes Between 'Train Dreams' and 'The Brutalist' Netflix Snags A24 Drama Series 'Trigger Point' Starring Joel Edgerton Fastvold adds that she didn't expect to be here at all this year. Like The Brutalist, The Testament of Ann Lee was written, cast, financed and filmed without a distributor signing on — and then swiftly generated interest for an eleventh-hour awards run once it premiered to great fanfare in Venice. Now Searchlight Pictures has a Christmas Day theatrical release set, gearing up for a range of special 70mm screenings just as A24 mounted last year for The Brutalist. Oh, and did we mention The Testament of Ann Lee is a musical? Indeed, Fastvold and Corbet kept their Oscar-winning Brutalist composer Daniel Blumberg busy with this one. If it's safe to say you've never seen a movie like Ann Lee, there's one basic reason for that: No one is making movies like Corbet and Fastvold right now. These are huge scale productions completed for under $10 million, completely independent and outwardly audacious. They have already written another script, with Corbet set to direct it, and sense things maybe, hopefully getting slightly easier for them, in terms of pooling enough resources together. You're making these incredibly ambitious movies for such low budgets, and it's something you both talk a lot about — the very complicated paths to being able to realize a vision like Ann Lee. How do you think about that on the other side, as you bring it out into the world? BRADY CORBET It's obviously become a hot topic for a variety of reasons, just because of how many films are struggling at the box office. Just for clarity's sake, we would never put a price on something which is priceless culturally. Famously expensive projects like Heaven's Gate or The Lovers on the Bridge are movies that I think are absolutely worth it. We would like these processes, moving forward, to be a little bit less stressful. We would love to have a little bit more wiggle room because we've been operating without a safety net for so many years and it's taken a toll physically and mentally. … Hopefully on the next film we'll have a little bit more to work with. I also just want to make it clear that we're not complaining because having $9 or $10 million to make a movie — it's a lot of money. If you told us a decade ago that we would have that much money to make these films, we would've been frankly gobsmacked. Just like the price of a cup of coffee is now $7, movies are more expensive than they were 10 years ago too. Inflation alone will make my next movie a more expensive movie than The Brutalist, even though in many ways in terms of scale and scope, they're very similar. What was it like putting the financing together for Ann Lee? Were you trying to package it differently than The Brutalist? MONA FASTVOLD It still feels like a miracle to me that this one got made. Any creative partners who read the script in the early stages came on board immediately: “Yeah, great, let's do it.” But in terms of studios and distributors, everyone was just like, “No.” I mean, we tried to sell The Brutalist. If we found a great partner, then maybe that would be right for it. You have a pretty strong sense of how far you can push the ambition and still remain within the boundaries of something that we feel confident we can secure financing for. We don't know what kind of compromises we'll have to make along the way, but all I know is that we will be making a movie next year. They're not going to work for everybody all the time, and that's okay. I'm not interested in playing it safe. There's been a lot of speculation about your next movie already. CORBET Well, all I can say about the new film is that there's been a lot of misinformation. But it was reported that the movie has something to do with The Texas Chain Saw Massacre, which is not true at all. FASTVOLD So they thought you were remaking it or something? CORBET I just keep getting asked about it in interviews. They're like, “I heard it's inspired by Texas Chain Saw Massacre.” I'm like, “It's about Northern California's economy.” (Laughs.) But yeah, as of right now, I am doing camera tests for it all day tomorrow. We are shooting on really, really rarefied formats that have usually shot shots in movies, but not entire movies before. And the movie will be entirely shot on 70mm, which we're really thrilled about. The plan is to work a lot with eight perforation and 15 perforation, which is exciting because it's not an action movie. We're supposed to start next summer, but there's nine months between now and then, so anything could happen, but we start prep next month. It's territory that's totally uncharted for us, which is always nerve-wracking and exciting in equal measure. I feel like this is always the case with you two. You have to be wondering going into Venice with a Brutalist or an Ann Lee, “How is this going to play?” They're enormous swings. I'm trying something where I could really fall on my face if I step to the left or to the right too far.” You have to try and push yourself and push those boundaries. CORBET If we sit down and anyone is able to distill what we've done down to two or three comps — “It's X meets Y” —  then we are really disappointed. It became clear to us in the [Ann Lee] writing process, they were a musical people. Mona, I remember when we spoke right before the premiere, you asked me if I thought it was a musical. FASTVOLD I was like, “What do you think?” It was such an exploratory process throughout the whole period of making the film that I was still sort of like, “Is that really where it's landed?” CORBET When we're writing something, we're writing for each other, meaning that I always knew that this was Mona's film, and I obviously know her very well. She has a background in choreography and performance art. It's not one that I have, so it was an exciting thing to watch her flex that muscle, which is something I've just privately known for years. FASTVOLD I desperately wanted to make this film and it was a sum of all the things I'm excited by in one place — but I also understood that this was not necessarily something that everyone else was going to jump to on paper. I didn't know how it was going to play. I knew some people would find their way to it and would be interested in it, but definitely didn't feel like, well — You didn't expect Disney to buy it. Mona is so empathetic and her empathy for these characters is something that I feel deeply in the movie. I mean, even though the film, of course, has sequences that are brutal, and it's a very unusual musical, in many ways it's also a very classical movie, one of the more classical movies we've done in structure. A lot of the Shaker hymns are just total bangers. So that coupled with Daniel's original score — I mean, the songs didn't start off sounding like that. This one was such an insanely long process. So I was doing a ton of research on the Shakers and Ann, and I then brought that to Brady. We sat down together and then we obsessively wrote day and night for six to eight weeks on our first draft. Then after that we spend however long it takes to make the film until it's actually done and delivered. CORBET Every project is a response to what you just did. There's no way for it not to be. After we made Childhood [of a Leader], I was like, alright, we have been in the realm of good taste for a few years working in the early 20th century, so now let's do 2001. Are you responding to the times we're living in? One day I would genuinely love to make a movie for kids. But I don't know, the next one's not a movie for kids at all. He tried to show Texas Chain Saw Massacre to [our 11-year-old daughter] Ada last year for Halloween, and I was like, what is wrong with you? FASTVOLD I lived in a tree and baked cookies. I think that there's so much stuff now — just the volume of it, it's going to get a lot worse with AI because now they're just going to churn. It's going to explode, churn out the sludge. But the analog processes and artisanal processes are going to be of more and more value now. It's an interesting moment because record stores are booming, and actually for the first time in my life, I don't have to fight as hard as I used to, to shoot on celluloid. I used to only shoot on Fuji stock. FASTVOLD We came to Searchlight with Ann Lee and they're like, “Okay, let's start making the prints!” I thought maybe, “Oh, are you going to make one or two?” But they're making a ton of prints. People want to come and see it in 70mm and 35mm, so they really are making a ton for the whole world. In the spirit of clarifying things, that topic spun a little out of control in headlines and on social media as it pertained to the way it was used in The Brutalist. CORBET No, actually, a lot of them were wrong. The problem is that you can't be in a situation where the lady doth protest too much. I understand why it's sensitive, but the thing is, for example, in all grading softwares that every movie is graded on, there's AI in the software. FASTVOLD And almost all VFX companies also use AI plugins. I just want to learn as much as I possibly can about it and really understand all the tools available to us — and that goes for tools from the past and future. On Ann Lee, we're using hand-painted matte paintings and glass [set] extensions, which is a very old technique that's almost completely died out. Again, we never corrected the actors' accents in English or their performances [on The Brutalist], but we did help them sound Hungarian when they were speaking Hungarian. We wanted to represent the Hungarian people accurately and not offend them by having someone doing a poor imitation of their language. We manually stitched it together with dialogue editing, and then we used AI tools to fix certain consonants and vowels to make it more fluid. That's all we did, and I would've done it again because it was the right tool for the job. I don't care if a tool is from 1950 or 2050, I want the right tool for the job. I was happy to talk about it, but it just kept snowballing and snowballing and at a certain point I realized that nobody knows what they don't know. In order for me to really walk people through this, it required a level of familiarity with these processes that very, very few people have. The last thing, to speak of this summarily, is that what was particularly hilarious about it for us is that we don't know many folks that have a more analog workflow than we do. It's fine that there's a misunderstanding, but we actually spend a lot of time and effort and struggle to refurbish cameras that were basically like paperweights of Panavision until two years ago. FASTVOLD It was not required for this one. This one was the most analog experience you could ever have.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Scott Wolf wished his son Miller a happy birthday via Instagram on Saturday — and he made sure to include his estranged wife, Kelley Wolf, in the tribute. The “Party of Five” actor, 57, paid tribute to his now 13-year-old on social media, sharing several photos through the years. In a few of the photos, Miller smiled at the camera while drinking hot cocoa in bed, holding their cat and playing soccer at the beach. However, in one standout snap, Scott's estranged wife, Kelley, hugged their son from behind as they walked through a field. The “Real World” alum, 49, looked radiant as she beamed at the camera while holding Miller close. In other pictures, Scott wrapped his arms around his son as they skied and spent time together. He also made sure to include several snaps of himself holding Miller when he was just a baby. Fastening our chin straps for this one,” he continued. Start your day with Page Six Daily.

As many of his fans wished Miller a happy birthday, others praised Scott for including Kelley in the tribute despite their messy ongoing custody battle and split. “How so very nice of you to add his mom there regardless of everything's happening. May God bless you and your family,” one person noted. Meanwhile, another said, “Oh My, Scott, these pictures are amazing! Happy birthday to your beautiful son!! So many people root for all the 5 of you!” Last month, Scott showed the same “love and respect” for Kelley when he also celebrated her birthday on social media. In June, Scott told The Post that he and Kelley were going their separate ways after more than two decades together, a statement she later confirmed on social media. However, a few days later, Scott filed a restraining order against Kelley, who had been placed in an involuntary psych hold. The life coach was then arrested for harassment in August before being banned from contacting her estranged husband and their three kids: son Jackson, 16, son Miller, now 13, and daughter Lucy, 11. Following their legal issues, Kelley checked herself into a mental health facility — where she seemingly remains now.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It was around the point that a military commando team was getting murdered by a big clown dressed like Uncle Sam—after following a Native guy with a magical rock down into some sewers in search of 13 other magical rocks, in the hopes that that they could use them to build a Pennywise The Dancing Clown Bomb that the Air Force could drop on the Russians—that I started to worry that IT: Welcome To Derry might just be kind of a dumb television show. The battle between the show's dumber and smarter aspects—the “fuck it, how goofy can we go?” extremism embodied by Bill Skarsgård croaking out “I want you” to some doomed soldiers who are apparently scared of, like, patriotic propaganda and those elements more rooted in the actual human emotions that IT feeds on—has been running since the series began, of course. Outside of a typically good performance from Chris Chalk (who literally gets sucked into a whole different TV show for the back half of this installment), this is Welcome To Derry at its least thoughtful, and, consequently, its least scary. The best you can hope for through most of this is to enjoy the camp, and that's a real waste of what Welcome To Derry can do. Despite the young local being left foaming at the mouth, the recovered information—magic rocks, pillars, the house on Neibolt Street, etc.—all sounds like good news to General Shaw, with James Remar continuing to move heaven and Earth to try to make his endlessly chipper military man seem anything less than completely deranged in his pursuit of a plan that passed “whackadoo” a few convolutions ago and is now headed straight for full-blown “cockamamie.” Meanwhile, we also get a follow-up to Margie's bad day in shop class, as she and Lilly reunite over their now-shared knowledge that something nasty is hunting the children of Derry. Margie's been the most interesting of the show's kid characters by a fair margin ever since the series' first episode, and Matilda Lawler demonstrates here, and elsewhere, that she can handle the show's sometimes clashing instincts for comedy, horror, and drama in a way that her peers periodically struggle with. Her reconciliation with Lilly is a short scene, but since it'll also turn out to be one of the only grounded, not-racing-toward-the-finish-line moments of this whole episode, it feels worthwhile to take a second to praise the fine work both Lawler and Clara Stack do here in capturing the emotions of the reunion. We've got to get to the next big reveal, as the kids meet up at the Derry Standpipe, only to find someone hiding there in wait: Matty Clements, apparently alive and…okay, not well, but doing a lot better than a kid who's supposedly been in IT's custody for four long months should be. Cue the little girl singing about that dang ol' ribbon in her hair. The kids have “Matty,” and his revelation that Phil's still alive down there, as their personal goad, information that eventually sees Lilly decide that there's nothing to be done but to dole out some Valium, give a big inspirational speech, and lead her friends into a subterranean deathtrap. Credit where it's due: Although we in the audience can be fairly sure that's not really Matty Clements dangling salvation in front of the town's heroic children—he's been gone since January, and his statement that IT sleeps during the day is definitely a lie—the episode itself doesn't tip its hand too much until the kids are already deep in the snare. I found myself especially frustrated with the obvious, coincidence-laden swings that Kane's script takes to slam the show's various character groups together. I could almost, nearly buy that IT was deliberately setting Leroy up to shoot his own son, because we get evidence elsewhere that the creature has some sense of long-term planning. I suspect the full arrival of Skarsgård as Pennywise is meant to paper over some of these obvious cracks, but I'll double down on my assertion that this specific version of the character just isn't very scary when he's placed front and center before the camera. If the creature really was actively engineering Leroy's errant gunshot—putting the military man's killer instincts to work to provoke him into a horrible mistake—I'll concede that that carries some actual weight of horror (even if the episode itself only seems loosely interested in cranking up that tension). But once the mask is off, Pennywise mostly just serves as a big, snarly monster—and one who gets scared by, and runs away from, magic rocks, which is mildly amusing at best and just plain dopey at worst. There's something interesting, for instance, about hearing Rose and her people talking clinically about the creature's cycles—including the fact that Derry's general vibe of murderous anger is picking up quickly as the 1962 cycle escalates toward its inevitable, and terminal, gout of violence. (On a similar note, Leroy seems pretty damn jumpy for a guy who's supposed to have gotten his ability to feel fear knocked out of his head, huh?) But there's only so much that marginal moments can do when the main event seems like it can't think of anything more meaningful to achieve with a creature this rich in metaphorical power than slap some clown makeup on a weak copy of Freddy Krueger and call it good. I've bemoaned this before, but a creature that manipulates, draws out, and devours human fear is an incredible opportunity for thematic storytelling, one that the IT movies had to race past in their efforts to condense 1,100 pages of book into two regular-sized movies. A TV series could luxuriate in this material, use those things our heroes are most afraid of to sharpen and define their characters. But beyond having Pennywise toss out a “Duck and cover!” when he's going into chase mode, “Neibolt Street” just isn't interested in using IT to reflect on either Derry's characters or its culture. Instead, it chooses to double down on the magic rocks—which is, I regret to say, exactly the sort of thing a dumb television show might do.
