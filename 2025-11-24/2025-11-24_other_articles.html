                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>James Clapper, in one of the film's pivotal moments, describes a secretive U.S. Air Force program tracking UAP over Area 51, stating it operated outside known channels. "I've seen evidence of non-human craft," Clapper asserts, according to clips shared widely on X and reported by Fox News. This revelation has fueled calls for congressional probes, with Rep. Anna Paulina Luna tagging oversight committees in posts on X. Jay Stratton, former head of the Pentagon's UAP Task Force, delivers some of the most direct claims: "I have personally seen non-human craft and non-human beings." Luis Elizondo, ex-AATIP director, reinforces this, alleging decades of compartmentalized secrecy. Former Sen. Harry Reid and other officials appear, alleging crash retrievals dating back to Roswell. On X, Ross Coulthart praised the film's "key admissions from insiders," urging Trump to honor UAP transparency pledges, while skeptics like Dark Journalist labeled it a "CIA big budget false UFO threat documentary" featuring "disgraced" figures like Clapper. Scientific Skepticism Demands Hard Data Virginia Tech experts, including astrobiologists, have urged caution amid the hype. This stance aligns with April 2025's James Webb Space Telescope detections of dimethyl sulfide—a potential biosignature—on exoplanet K2-18b, reported by NASA and analyzed in The Guardian. Methane and other gases there offer stronger leads for life detection than unverified craft recoveries, scientists argue, calling for UAP data to meet similar standards. Michael Shermer's review in Skeptic Magazine critiques the film as recycling unproven narratives, noting Clapper's past controversies like admitted perjury allegations from his tenure. Congressional Momentum Builds The film's timing coincides with 2025 UAP hearings, where lawmakers reference its claims. Vulture reported Rubio's attendance at the screening, signaling bipartisan curiosity. Posts on X from Joe Murgia highlight Clapper's "sighting" as a potential game-changer, with view counts exceeding 100,000. Yet, critics on X, including Chase Gallagher, warn of counter-intelligence ties among figures like Chris Mellon and Clapper, urging discernment. Farah, in The Independent, suggested a president could confirm aliens soon, tying into Trump's past comments on non-human life. Virginia Tech's involvement in UAP-adjacent studies underscores the need for sensor data over personal accounts, with experts advocating integrated approaches blending military sightings and astronomical surveys. The film's proponents, per Fox News, argue public deception has eroded trust, demanding oversight. Interstellar's viral X thread lists admissions like Stratton's, amassing over 136,000 views, reflecting public fervor. As 2025 closes, "The Age of Disclosure" has elevated UAP from fringe to policy priority, but scientists insist on falsifiable proof. Wikipedia's entry labels it a conspiracy theory proponent, citing mainstream skepticism in archived sources. Trump's potential role looms large; Farah's EW interview posits revelations under his administration. Virginia Tech urges funding for rigorous UAP studies, paralleling K2-18b pursuits, to bridge insider claims and science.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After taking some time off from writing for post-operative healing from knee surgery, I am back at it. Instead of my typical nature-themed spirit-guided story, I thought it would be nice to pair with another intuitive. Today, I share my recent interview with YouTube Path Of Enlightenment Tarot Channel owner and psychic Nicole. I know some readers have shown curiosity as to how I gain my spiritual insights for my weekly article, and I thought that perhaps by introducing someone who, without a doubt, has highly developed spiritual gifts, readers will gain some insight into the workings of the higher consciousness. Personally, I equate my insights to flashes, like a movie screen in my mind, sudden repeating phrases, key words, and heavy-duty ideas that are just too intense to ignore. Sometimes, sensory data, overwhelming smells, feelings, and sounds take over me, and other times, it's dreams that feel too real to be merely dreams. I discovered Nicole and Path Of Enlightenment Tarot a few months ago, while searching for the "Best YouTube Psychics." From the moment I heard her say, "Thank you, Spirit," my curiosity was peeked. Nicole did not disappoint, and I have been a regular viewer since. While I read tarot, it's not always easy for me to read for myself, so, yes, I gave YouTube a go and found someone special. Without further ado, let's head to the interview, compiled from the video transcript, which I will link below for those interested. Here are the questions I asked Nicole during our interview via Discord on November 20. This is a snippet of our 30-minute session. Do you consider yourself an intuitive, psychic, medium, or possibly having a combination of abilities? I've had a lot of people over the years ask me, like What are you? Their response (spirit), and something I've never heard before: You are a spiritual translator. I had what looked like a Civil War veteran come through. I became curious, and like a few nights in a row, he kept coming back, and I started to see other things. It was more so when I got older and started diving into tarot, the more of what I think some would consider demonic. Family-wise, my dad has always been very standoffish. When I opened my first business, I remember him walking in and going, You know, looking around all the crystals, all the things. And he was just like, "Well, I hope it works out." Over the years, especially dealing with the public at large, I had a guy reading his Bible walking past my store during a festival, and he was like, "Hey, you need to read this!" Some people on YouTube will have something negative to say, but I am always like, we're children of God. Do you believe that all people have some kind of spiritual gift? It's like riding a bike for the first time without training. I say to people all the time, How many times in your lifetime have you had that moment where you walked into a room and just got uncomfortable about something? It's intuitive inclination and learning to incorporate all of our senses so that we can connect with Spirit. Meditation is learning how to get out of human capacities. That's the thing with society today, we are thinking 30 steps ahead. We are thinking about what happened 3 days ago and our daily responsibilities. Creative expression is a great way to develop intuitive skill- Coloring books. What's your advice for people seeking readers, whether it's in person, online, or at a fair? 💖 Nicole- For YouTube, watch quite a bit of their content first and foremost because you're going to know who's working on themselves. If they are not working on themselves, can they advise to help you move forward in any capacity? Experimental, you know, do maybe a shorter session with somebody. It should be about the client, what they need, nothing else. Do you have any particular goals or changes for your channel, Path of Enlightenment Tarot? 💖 Nicole- I took a road trip to Virginia for the first time, and I got to meet one of my moderators. He's been pretty much with me from the beginning. I got to meet some other clients who have been with me for years, as well. I had the opportunity to kind of do like a meet and greet, ironically, right around their birthdays. I've had some changes come up here recently that are going to require me to do a little bit of soul-searching and realigning. We have a membership site where there are additional videos daily, which I did for Scorpio season as a Scorpio myself. What advice do you have for people who are trying to maintain a healthy physical and spiritual existence? I am a human like the next. Today's society, and I think a lot of its changing. I think we're going through a time right now, re-deciding how we live day to day. The rat race of life, learning to be still and be present, and disconnect from society. We are set up right now for progress: the next greatest invention, the coolest thing to give us artistic gratification. I think if we could go back to fewer distractions, like in the 40s, for example, that would be huge for our spiritual development. How we find what works for us is different for everybody; find the balance, because when you do, your soul's going to be far more at peace and you're going to be inclined to lean into what feels right, what feels good. While certainly much shorter than the YouTube version, I hope this piece is helpful to anyone delving into spiritual development. Whether one chooses the word "psychic" or prefers "intuition," our higher consciousness speaks to us in many ways. Perhaps a little more self-care and disconnect from the rat race of daily living will open up the line to a direct narrative with the divine.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Jodie Pillarella's connection to the supernatural began long before she ever held a ghost-hunting device. At age 4, following emergency appendicitis surgery, she experienced what she describes as a near-death encounter — a sensation so vivid it still haunts her. "I remember lying on the operating table, the lights above me glaring, and suddenly I was floating above it all, there were no walls," she recalled. "I firmly believe my great-grandmother made me come back. But it wasn't her only encounter with the unexplained. Shadowy figures, night terrors and episodes of sleep paralysis marked that time — experiences that left a lasting impression and sparked her lifelong fascination with the unknown. Pillarella's professional paranormal journey began during the COVID-19 lockdown with a visit to the May-Stringer House in Brooksville, a historic site notorious for hauntings. "We went to their $20 Friday night ghost tour. That first investigation ignited a passion that would grow into a multi-thousand-dollar investment in specialized ghost-hunting tools, from EVP devices to dowsing rods and motion-activated equipment. Unlike conventional professions, paranormal investigation has no formal training. Pillarella emphasizes hands-on experience and learning from others. "Sometimes you don't know what questions to ask," she said. I didn't realize spirits can smell until later." One memorable investigation at a haunted jail in Cochrane, Georgia, involved unusual activity linked to discussions about pizza and desserts — an anomaly she later associated with ghostly presence. Pillarella said these dowsing rods lit up and pointed after she asked the spirits to indicate where they were standing. "I have a portal, dowsing rod, motion-activated music boxes and more," she said. These devices help capture electronic voice phenomena (EVPs), track movement and measure electromagnetic activity. Despite frequent interaction with the supernatural, Pillarella takes protective measures seriously. To skeptics, ghost haunting may seem like folklore or exaggeration. Pillarella counters that mainstream portrayals often misrepresent real investigative experiences. "Some people will never believe until something happens to them," she said. Her encounters have convinced her of the authenticity and individuality of spirits, particularly those she interacts with at home. Beyond thrills and chills, Pillarella's work is deeply emotional. "I'm working on a theory that they have a choice — whether they want to stay or move on." From a near-death experience in childhood to complex investigations at haunted sites, her journey offers insight into a world where history, emotion and spectral presence intertwine. Whether skeptic or believer, her stories leave one lingering question: How much of what we cannot see is truly beyond our understanding?

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>DETROIT – As with most things, Michigan has had its hand in the UFO cookie jar a few times. Feds now refer to them as Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena or UAPs. Marie were reportedly alerted to an unknown object flying in restricted airspace over Lake Superior, near the Soo Locks. An interceptor aircraft took off from the nearby Kincheloe Air Force Base to investigate. It was piloted by Felix Moncla and had Robert L. Wilson as a radar operator. Attempts made to contact the jet were unsuccessful. A search and rescue operation by the United States and Canadian Air Forces failed to find any trace of the aircraft or its occupants. The U.S. Air Force reported that the jet crashed while pursuing a Canadian aircraft that was off course as it was flying to Sudbury, Ontario. The Royal Canadian Air Force has denied this. The Open Skies Project, a nonprofit that is working to restore the Calumet Air Force Station, has a breakdown of theories, as well as an in-depth and well-researched version of what likely happened -- it crashed during a snowstorm pursuing an aircraft that went off course. That being said, Moncla's gravestone states he disappeared “intercepting a UFO over Canadian Border.” Dane Kelly is an Oreo enthusiast and producer who has spent the last seven years covering Michigan news and stories.

While we didn't speculate where Supernatural would stream next, given that many of The CW's titles that Warner Bros. Television ultimately owns haven't found new streaming homes (weird given their natural homes would be HBO Max), that's not the case with Supernatural. Additionally, we've also been alerted to Prime Video's December schedule, which lists all 15 seasons due for release on December 1st, meaning you'll have two places to stream the show in full. ‘My Life with the Walter Boys' Season 3: Netflix Release Date Estimate and Everything We Know So Far ‘Supernatural' Finds New Streaming Homes As Series Set To Be Removed From Netflix ‘Simon Cowell: The Next Act' Docuseries is Coming to Netflix in December 2025 ‘Ripple' Series from Lionsgate Television To Release on Netflix; Sets December Premiere Final ‘Stranger Things' Season 5 Volume 1 Trailer Drops Ahead of Release This Week John Debney on Channeling Childhood Wonder for the Dream Worlds of ‘In Your Dreams' Dennis Berardi on Rebuilding Mr. X and Crafting the VFX Heart of Guillermo del Toro's Frankenstein Lena Dunham Reveals ‘Too Much' Won't Be Back for Season 2 at Netflix ‘Jurassic World: Chaos Theory' S4 Ending Explained: Do the Nublar Six Make It Out Alive? ‘The Witcher' Season 5 Adds 25 New Cast Members for Its Final Chapter The authors of this site also have no affiliation with Netflix.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Nearly 35 high-profile Americans, including the current secretary of state Marco Rubio, astrophysicists, top-notch defence officials and researchers offer their bold statements in this documentary by director Dan Farah, making it an all-out attack against the alleged eight-decades-old controversial “legacy program” run by the US government to retrieve and reverse-engineer non-human technology from crashed alien craft and dead non-humans. He says that he was recruited in 2009 to the Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program (AATIP), a government program set up in 2007 to investigate aerial threats including UFOs. Jay Stratton, another retired defence intel executive and a former war veteran who was also part of AATIP, dwells at length on the evidence collected by American researchers and the military over the past several decades on aliens, which these people say, use vehicles that are of far superior quality compared with anything made on this planet. Harold Edward Puthoff, American electrical engineer and parapsychologist known for his work in laser physics, notes categorically that “the classified data that we had access to when we joined the program was indisputable.” He was referring to AATIP and the proof of extraterrestrial life in the possession of its ‘legacy program'. For his part, Eric W. Davis, an astrophysicist who was a scientific advisor at AATIP, goes on to make an explosive claim that President George Bush Sr had told him in a conversation about American military men confronting aliens at the Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico, US. Former Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Intelligence Chris Mellon is shown as arguing vehemently that the US government as well as the rest – there are claims that other countries such as Russia and others were also retrieving UFO technology for the purposes of re-engineering and other experiments – must work towards developing new technologies from these allegedly obtained advanced technologies for the betterment of the human race. Mark Rubio and others, too, raise the issue of making evidence public. One of the experts is heard saying that there is resistance from “war pigs” in the Pentagon because according to him wars over oil and such natural resources will become a thing of the past if the new technologies acquired from aliens could be re-engineered and put to good use. One is that the spacecraft can produce its own vacuum energy which is also known as zero-point energy.” The other one is that the spacecraft must be drawing energy from a remote source, he states. Rubio talks about strategic surprises that mankind will have to prepare itself for. Chances are that you would watch this movie and dismiss it as outlandish, or, like many others, you may feel this is credible. If you're into the subject, I can't recommend this enough. Dan Farah and his team knocked it out of the park with this.” New Delhi-based journalist, political commentator and author View all posts by Ullekh NP</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Nigel Farage is facing calls to explain why he repeatedly aired tropes and conspiracy theories associated with antisemitism during interviews, after claims the Reform UK leader used racist language in his teens. In appearances on US TV shows and podcasts earlier in his political career, Farage discussed supposed plots by bankers to create a global government, citing Goldman Sachs, the Bilderberg group and the financier George Soros as threats to democracy. These included six guest slots on the web TV show of the disgraced far-right US conspiracy theorist Alex Jones. During one interview with Jones in 2018, Farage argued that “globalists” were trying to engineer a war with Russia “as an argument for us all to surrender our national sovereignty and give it up to a higher global level”. Farage also appeared six times on the web radio show of Rick Wiles, a far-right, antisemitic American pastor. Here, topics included whether central bankers would soon start to appoint leaders of the UK and US – an idea Farage did not challenge. In the wake of testimony from 20 people who claim they either witnessed or were victims of abusive or racist behaviour by Farage at Dulwich college in the late 1970s and early 1980s, MPs and others have called on Farage to explain his subsequent statements, which date from 2009 to 2018. School contemporaries of Farage said he used racist terms of abuse, made comments such as like “Hitler was right”, and “Gas them”, and sang racist songs. Christine Jardine, the Liberal Democrat MP who is vice chair of the all-party parliamentary group against antisemitism, said: “Nigel Farage clearly has aspirations for high office. It is, therefore, simply not good enough that he fails to explain his past choice of words, and allegations that have surfaced this week only serve to underline concerns about his outlook. Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what's happening and why it matters Another Lib Dem MP, Josh Babarinde, called Farage's remarks “profoundly disturbing, but not surprising”. He said: “They paint a picture of a man who has continued to peddle conspiracy theories and tropes, and who has gone on to build a political career by spreading division and hate. “Nigel Farage needs to explain why he said these things and whether he still subscribes to these conspiracy theories.” Zack Polanski, the leader of the Green party in England and Wales, said: “We can judge Farage not just by the words he, allegedly, shouted as a child, but by the words and actions he has chosen to broadcast as an adult. “Throughout his career he has chosen to echo conspiracy theories through the language of the far right and antisemites.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>MONTAUBAN, FRANCE, November 24, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- A chilling photograph taken at dusk in the historic town of Montauban has ignited international discussion after appearing to capture a dark, human-shaped apparition standing near a stone wall. Girardon quickly identified the anomaly as "an intelligent manifestation attempting to materialize." Several analysts describe the silhouette as "one of the clearest apparition attempts documented in France in recent years," noting its defined posture, torso outline, and humanoid proportions. Montauban, a city known for unexplained nighttime occurrences—including sudden temperature drops, phantom footsteps, and shadow-like figures—rarely produces visual evidence of this magnitude. Girardon believes the apparition's interaction with ambient light suggests a strong energetic imprint: Some claim to see a full silhouette with shoulders and head, while others suggest an incomplete materialization.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>"It's the most significant moment a leader could possibly have." Farah spoke to 34 U.S. government insiders, including those from the military and intelligence community officials, about an "80-year global cover-up of non-human intelligent life and a secret war among major nations to reverse-engineer advanced technology of non-human origin,” according to the film's description. Sources, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, New York Democratic Senator Kirsten Gillibrand and former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, discuss the government's work with Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena, or UAPs — the formal term for UFOs. “UAPs are real, they're here, and they're not human,” a former senior CIA official said in the trailer. Since wrapping up the documentary, Farah said he's learned from "people who are in my film and sources outside of my film" that Trump "has become aware of the base facts and has his team all over trying to learn everything that he needs to know so we can decide a course of action,” he told the outlet. "I know the movie's on his radar a hundred percent, and look, President Trump said on the campaign trail that he intended to declassify what the government knows about this topic,” he said. In July 2024, Trump told influencer Logan Paul that he wasn't a “believer.” He added: “Probably I can't say I am. Months later, in September 2024, when podcaster Lex Fridman asked the president whether he would push to release more footage of UAPs, Trump replied: "I'll do that. The following month, Trump discussed the idea of intelligent life beyond Earth with Joe Rogan, saying the subject has “never been my thing.” When Rogan asked what he thought about the existence of alien life, Trump said: “There's no reason not to think that Mars and all these planets don't have life.” Congress has also held multiple meetings on UAPs. “The American people deserve maximum transparency from the federal government on sightings, acquisitions, and examinations of UAPs and whether they pose a potential threat to Americans' safety,” she said. Paulina Luna joins other members of Congress who have called to “pull back the curtain” on the government's UAP research. Farah told Entertainment Weekly that he hopes the film's release will lead the government to make public as much as it can regarding UAPs and non-human intelligent life. "For too long, the public has blatantly been lied to, kept in the dark, and misled with a really sophisticated disinformation campaign,” he said. “And I think we're now at a tipping point where not only does the public deserve to know the truth, but it's really essential because the stakes have never been higher.</p>
