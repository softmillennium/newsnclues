                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Amazon said Monday it will invest as much as $50 billion to expand its capacity to provide artificial intelligence and high-performance computing capabilities for its cloud unit's U.S. government customers. The project is slated to break ground in 2026 and will add nearly 1.3 gigawatts of capacity through new data centers designed for federal agencies, the company said in a blog. As part of the investment, agencies will have access to Amazon Web Services' AI tools, Anthropic's Claude family of models and Nvidia chips as well as Amazon's custom Trainium AI chips. The move follows similar announcements from Anthropic and Meta to expand AI data centers in the U.S. Oracle, OpenAI and SoftBank announced their Stargate joint venture in January, which aims to invest up to $500 billion in AI infrastructure in the U.S. over the next four years. AWS said the project will enable agencies to develop custom AI solutions, optimize datasets and "enhance workforce productivity." AWS serves more than 11,000 government agencies, Amazon said Monday. "This investment removes the technology barriers that have held government back and further positions America to lead in the AI era," AWS CEO Matt Garman said in a statement. Amazon in October boosted its forecast for capital expenditures this year, saying it now expects to spend $125 billion in 2025, up from an earlier estimate of $118 billion.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A federal judge in eastern Virginia on Monday dismissed criminal cases against former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James, ruling that Lindsey Halligan, the interim U.S. attorney who brought both indictments, was invalidly appointed. Senior U.S. District Judge Cameron Currie ruled in both cases that Halligan, President Donald Trump's former personal lawyer, had been installed as interim federal prosecutor in violation of the Appointments Clause of the Constitution. The cases were both dismissed "without prejudice," potentially allowing charges to be filed again at a later date." "I am heartened by today's victory and grateful for the prayers and support I have received from around the country," James said in a statement following the dismissal. "I remain fearless in the face of these baseless charges as I continue fighting for New Yorkers every single day." Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>But amid concerns about the economy, persistent inflation and President Donald Trump's latest wave of tariff hikes, shoppers may not be as eager to splurge this season. Consumers plan to spend an average of $622 between Nov. 27 and Dec. 1, down 4% from last year, according to a new Deloitte survey released Monday. The overall belt-tightening was largely due to a higher cost of living and financial constraints, Deloitte found. The Black Friday-Cyber Monday week is typically the unofficial start of the holiday shopping season, although many shoppers started earlier this year to make the most of sales events like Amazon Prime Day and to get ahead of tariff-induced price increases. Debt issues have been affecting a growing number of consumers across all income levels, several studies show. For many Americans, wage gains have largely not kept pace with stubborn inflation, which makes it harder to make ends meet in a typical month. Still, shoppers tend to rely on Thanksgiving week promotions for their gift buying: About 60% have already put items in their carts to purchase over the holiday shopping weekend, but 38% say they plan to only buy the items that are at least 50% off, Deloitte found. "Value continues to be the centerpiece of the holiday season," Brian McCarthy, principal and retail strategy leader at Deloitte Consulting, said in a statement. Other reports also show a potential pullback this year. One "notable headwind," according to the National Retail Federation, was the longest federal government shutdown in U.S. history, which lasted 43 days. Americans were already facing mounting challenges in an increasingly bifurcated consumer economy. Income disruptions just ahead of the peak shopping season make budgeting particularly difficult, according to NRF's holiday sales forecast. Overall economic growth in the U.S. has been good, but not all Americans have benefited, according to Scott Wren, senior global market strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute. In the so-called "K"-shaped economy, some consumers are in financial distress because their incomes have not kept pace with inflation over the last five years. "That means their buying power has diminished as the overall price level of goods and services has risen noticeably," Wren wrote in a Nov. 12 research note. At the same time, consumers at the higher end of the income scale have strengthened their financial position, largely by benefiting from stock market rallies and appreciating home values. "Their discretionary income continues to be strong and funds the purchases of cars, houses, vacations, and meals at restaurants," Wren wrote. Although, according to Deloitte's survey, even higher-income households plan to cut back during the Black Friday-Cyber Monday week.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Amazon said Monday it will begin allowing businesses to test its recently rebranded internet-from-space service that seeks to compete with SpaceX's Starlink. Select businesses will be able to test Amazon Leo production hardware and software as part of an "enterprise preview" of the service "ahead of a wider rollout," the company said in a blog post. The test program will allow Amazon to collect feedback and "tailor solutions for specific industries" ahead of a broader launch, the company said. Earlier this month, Amazon renamed its satellite internet offering from Project Kuiper to Amazon Leo and rolled out a new website to market the service. The name is a nod to low Earth orbit, a region of space that's within 1,200 miles of Earth's surface and where Amazon's satellite constellation will be concentrated. Six years ago, Amazon unveiled its plans to build a constellation of 3,236 low Earth satellites, designed to provide high-speed, low-latency internet to consumers, corporations and governments, offering connections through square-shaped terminals. The company has sent up more than 150 satellites since April through a series of rocket launches handled by partners, such as United Launch Alliance and Elon Musk's SpaceX. It's aiming to compete with Starlink, owned by SpaceX, which currently dominates the market and has nearly 9,000 satellites in orbit. Amazon has inked deals with JetBlue, L3Harris and Australia's NBN internet network, among others. The company on Monday showed off the final production design of its Ultra model, which will offer download speeds of up to 1 gigabit per second and upload speeds up to 400 megabits per second powered by an in-house custom silicon chip, "making it the fastest commercial phased array antenna in production." The company has yet to disclose pricing and availability for consumers.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Michael Burry, the investor who shot to fame for calling the housing crash before 2008, has launched a Substack newsletter after deregistering his hedge fund, aiming to lay out in detail his increasingly bearish thesis on artificial intelligence. "The Big Short" investor is capitalizing on the massive audience he's built on X, where 1.6 million followers have long parsed his cryptic posts. His new publication, titled "Cassandra Unchained" with a $379 annual subscription fee, arrives with a familiar warning: He believes markets are once again deep in bubble territory. "Feb 21, 2000: SF Chronicle says I'm short Amazon. Greenspan 2005: 'bubble in home prices … does not appear likely.' [Fed Chair Jerome] Powell '25: 'AI companies actually… are profitable… it's a different thing. Please join me," Burry wrote in a post Sunday night on X. He highlighted then-Fed Chair Alan Greenspan's 2005 insistence that U.S. housing prices showed no signs of a bubble, just two years before the subprime implosion validated Burry's famous "Big Short." And now he contends history is rhyming again. The investor noted Powell has waved off bubble fears, saying AI companies are "actually profitable" and "a different thing" from past booms. "This is different in the sense that these companies, the companies that are so highly valued, actually have earnings and stuff like that," Powell said during a news conference in October. Burry took it as an eerie echo of the assurances offered by Greenspan two decades ago. Today, he has been openly bearish on the poster children of the AI boom, Nvidia and Palantir.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Elon Musk's X played a starring role in another weekend internet kerfuffle. It began when Nikita Bier, X's head of product, posted on Saturday that the platform had rolled out a change intended to increase transparency: an "About This Account" page that, among other things, reveals the country or region where a user's account is based. Not everyone was eager to reveal the origin of their accounts. Users in places that limit freedom of speech could face political repercussions. Others said that if a user created an account using a VPN routed through another country, the location information may not be accurate. On Saturday, X removed information about where some accounts were created. Bier said the data "was not 100 percent," especially for older accounts, and that the company plans to "bring it back by Tuesday." Five hours later, he posted again: "I need a drink." X appears to have factored in the VPN point. The location function also comes with an accuracy disclaimer, which states: "The country or region that an account is based can be impacted by recent travel or temporary relocation. This data may not be accurate and can change periodically." Several prominent X accounts that promote MAGA talking points, for instance, appeared to be based in places far from the United States. The account MAGA NATION, which has some 400,000 followers and describes itself as "America First," is, according to the new feature, based in a non-European Union country in Eastern Europe. Another account called America First — which was created in March, has close to 70,000 followers, and posts things like "Thumbs up if you're a Trumper who loves God" — appears to be based in Bangladesh. Here's a fun story, remember all of those “I'm an independent Trump supporting woman” accounts on X that pretended to be real people in the US supporting trump? Due to recent location updates, we now know almost all of them are based in Thailand. It should come as little surprise that many accounts are perhaps not what they seem. In response to a question about doxxing a user's location while they are travelling, Bier said on Saturday that it would update on a "randomized" and delayed schedule to "ensure this is not possible." This is not the first time X has faced location privacy concerns. In 2022, X — then Twitter — banned accounts sharing the movements of private jets, including Musk's, who raised safety concerns about tracking real-time movements Bier also said over the weekend that the "About This Account" feature would not show the location of any official government-associated accounts with a gray check mark "to prevent acts of terrorism against government leaders." Musk's account shows he is located in the US, but states he has been verified since "3000 BCE," a period of history that coincides with the rise of complex civilizations in places like ancient Egypt.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Jimmy Cliff, the charismatic reggae pioneer and actor who preached joy, defiance and resilience in such classics as "Many Rivers to Cross," "You Can Get it If You Really Want" and "Vietnam" and starred in the landmark movie "The Harder They Come," has died at 81. His family posted a message Monday on his social media sites that he died from a "seizure followed by pneumonia." "He really appreciated each and every fan for their love." Cliff was a native Jamaican with a spirited tenor and a gift for catchphrases and topical lyrics who joined Kingston's emerging music scene in his teens and helped lead a movement in the 1960s that included such future stars as Bob Marley, Toots Hibbert and Peter Tosh. By the early 1970s, he had accepted director Perry Henzell's offer to star in a film about an aspiring reggae musician, Ivanhoe "Ivan" Martin, who turns to crime when his career stalls. "Ivanhoe was a real-life character for Jamaicans," Cliff told Variety in 2022, upon the film's 50th anniversary. "When I was a little boy, I used to hear about him as being a bad man. No one in Jamaica, at that time, had guns. However, being a hero was the manner in which Perry wanted to make his name — an anti-hero in the way that Hollywood turns its bad guys into heroes." "The Harder They Come," delayed for some two years because of sporadic funding, was the first major commercial release to come out of Jamaica. It sold few tickets in its initial run, despite praise from Roger Ebert and other critics. But it now stands as a cultural touchstone, with a soundtrack widely cited as among the greatest ever and as a turning point in reggae's worldwide rise. For a brief time, Cliff rivaled Marley as the genre's most prominent artist. "You Can Get it If You Really Want" and the title song were calls for action and vows of final payments: "The harder they come, the harder they fall, one and all." Cliff otherwise lets out a weary cry on "Many Rivers to Cross," a gospel-style testament that he wrote after confronting racism in England in the 1960s. I came to England with very big hopes, and I saw my hopes fading," he told Rolling Stone in 2012. Cliff's career peaked with "The Harder They Come," but, after a break in the late 1970s, he worked steadily for decades, whether session work with the Rolling Stones or collaborations with Wyclef Jean, Sting and Annie Lennox among others. The Sandinistas in Nicaragua used "You Can Get It If You Really Want" as a campaign theme and Bruce Springsteen helped expand Cliff's U.S. audience with his live cover of the reggae star's "Trapped," featured on the million-selling charity album from 1985, "We Are the World." Others performing his songs included John Lennon, Cher and UB40. He also performed on Steve Van Zandt's protest anthem, "Sun City," and acted in the Robin Williams comedy "Club Paradise," for which he contributed a handful of songs to the soundtrack and sang with Elvis Costello on the rocker "Seven Day Weekend." In 2010, Cliff was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. He was born James Chambers in suburban Saint James and, like Ivan Martin in "The Harder They Come," moved to Kingston in his youth to become a musician. In the early 1960s, Jamaica was gaining its independence from Britain and the early sounds of reggae — first called ska and rocksteady — were catching on. Calling himself Jimmy Cliff, he had a handful of local hits, including "King of Kings" and "Miss Jamaica," and, after overcoming the kinds of barriers that upended Martin, was called on to help represent his country at the 1964 World's Fair in New York City. "It came from the need for recognition, identity and respect." He had a hit with a cover of Cat Stevens' "Wild World," and reached the top 10 in the UK with the uplifting "Wonderful World, Beautiful People." Cliff's widely heard protest chant, "Vietnam," was inspired in part by a friend who had served in the war and returned damaged beyond recognition. His success as a recording artist and concert performer led Henzell to seek a meeting with him and flatter him into accepting the part: "You know, I think you're a better actor than singer," Cliff remembered him saying. Aware that "The Harder They Come" could be a breakthrough for Jamaican cinema, he openly wished for stardom, although Cliff remained surprised by how well known he became. "Back in those days there were few of us African descendants who came through the cracks to get any kind of recognition,′ he told The Guardian in 2021. "It was easier in music than movies.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Shares of Novo Nordisk on Monday fell to a four-year low after the Danish pharmaceutical company said a highly anticipated trial for Alzheimer's disease failed to meet its main goal. The trial tested whether semaglutide — the active ingredient in Novo's blockbuster diabetes and weight loss drugs Ozempic and Wegovy — helped slow progression for Alzheimer's disease. The goal had been to slow patients' cognitive decline by at least 20%. Novo stock was down 10% to 274 Danish kroner ($42.33) in afternoon trade, its lowest level since mid-2021. Analysts had prior to the results called the trial a long shot, whereas Novo itself had referred to it as a "lottery ticket." "Based on the significant unmet need in Alzheimer's disease as well as a number of indicative data points, we felt we had a responsibility to explore semaglutide's potential, despite a low likelihood of success," said Novo's chief scientific officer, Martin Holst Lange. Even before the Monday readout, Novo stock had halved year to date amid a series of guidance cuts and heighted competition, especially in the key U.S. market. "While hopes were not high for a positive readout, potential success had perhaps kept some in the name, with this result removing a near-term upside scenario," wrote Jefferies analysts on Monday. Alzheimer's disease, the most common form of dementia, is notoriously difficult to treat. It is also expected to affect an increasing proportion of people worldwide as populations grow older. Shares of Eli Lilly traded nearly 0.8% higher Monday at the closing bell in London, while Biogen stock rose 2.6%. Novo's decision to test Rybelsus, an oral form of semaglutide, had been largely based on real-world evidence suggesting a correlation between Alzheimer's and taking semaglutide. The drug works in a similar way to Lilly's rival medicines Mounjaro and Zepbound by mimicking the gut hormone GLP-1 that naturally occurs in the body, to regulate blood sugar levels and enhance feelings of fullness. It's not yet clear how GLP-1s might benefit Alzheimer's patients, but the theory is that it targets the neuroinflammation thought to impact them. Top-line results will be presented at the Clinical Trials on Alzheimer's Disease conference on Dec. 3, with full results at the 2026 Alzheimer's and Parkinson's Diseases Conference in March, Novo said. While shares of Novo Nordisk have plunged over the past 18 months, rival Eli Lilly only last week became the first pharmaceutical company with a market capitalization of $1 trillion. Even as Ozempic hit the market four years before Mounjaro, Novo's head start hasn't prevented Lilly from quickly grabbing a bigger market share in the U.S. This year, Novo has cut its guidance several times, blaming so-called compounders which sell copycat versions of semaglutide for a cheaper price. Novo recently replaced its chairman and half its board members over a disagreement between the former board and Novo's controlling shareholder, the Novo Nordisk Foundation, about the scope and pace of change needed.

This summer, Amazon's cloud business struggled to keep pace with surging AI demand and missed out on real revenue for its flagship AI product. It lets developers tap into powerful models, including Anthropic's Claude and Meta's Llama. But over the summer, Bedrock hit "critical capacity constraints" that drove some customers to rival services, such as Google's cloud service, according to an internal July document obtained by Business Insider. (Quota limits control how much intelligence customers can access via AI cloud services). Oil trader Vitol weighed moving some projects away from AWS, a decision that risked a $3.5 million revenue hit amid "prolonged quota approvals," the document also warned. Other customers, including Atlassian and GovTech Singapore, were waiting on quota increases this summer, delaying at least $52.6 million in projected sales, the document also disclosed. Bedrock was "experiencing critical capacity constraints that are threatening customer adoption and potentially causing substantial revenue loss across multiple industries," the July document stated. Indeed, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy has repeatedly stressed the need to ramp up cloud infrastructure, particularly AI chips and data center power. It's unclear whether the company has fully resolved these issues. Three current and former employees said the capacity crunch remained one of AWS's top concerns through September. "At Amazon, we're vocally self-critical because that's how we drive continuous improvement and deliver better results for customers," the spokesperson said in a statement. We're grateful for all customer feedback—including challenges they encounter—because it helps us make Bedrock even better, and that's exactly how you build a scalable, sustainable business that serves customers well over the long term." Expanding data center capacity, as with other cloud providers, is one of AWS's top priorities. During an October earnings call, Jassy said AWS had been "focused on accelerating capacity the last several months," adding more than 3.8 gigawatts of power over the past year, more than any other cloud provider. AWS has doubled its power capacity since 2022 and plans to double it again by 2027, he noted. Jassy added that Amazon will remain "very aggressive" in scaling up capacity to meet booming demand, noting that AWS can monetize new infrastructure almost immediately. Bedrock, he said, is already showing potential to grow as large as EC2, one of AWS's most successful cloud products and a key profit engine. Part of Bedrock's shortages may stem from prioritizing large clients. In October, Jassy said most of Bedrock's workloads run on AWS's in-house AI chip, Trainium, but that usage so far has come mainly from "a small number of very large customers." Amazon is expected to reveal more details about Bedrock and its broader cloud strategy during its annual re:Invent conference in early December. Companies such as HelloFresh, Zalando, and Ryanair were among those affected. At the same time, "slow capacity approval and denial of spiky workload requests" prevented firms like Stripe, Robinhood, and Vanguard from moving AI workloads from Anthropic to Bedrock, the document noted. "These constraints are forcing customers to explore alternative providers like GCP, OpenAI, and Anthropic, signaling an urgent need for AWS to address its Bedrock service quota and performance challenges to maintain competitive positioning in the rapidly evolving GenAI market," the document stated. (Tokens are how AI models break queries down into digestible data chunks. Industry pricing is based on how many tokens are processed. APIs are application programming interfaces, a common way applications share data). In recent weeks, investors have grown uneasy over the tech industry's massive AI spending, with fears of a potential bubble weighing on markets. On one hand, these challenges suggest customer demand is still very strong. Amazon has said it plans to pour $125 billion into capital expenditures this year, and even more in 2026. It wasn't just capacity woes driving customer workloads away from Bedrock. Companies such as Figma, Intercom, and Wealthsimple were among those migrating their workloads "due to one or several of these challenges." Thomson Reuters also chose Google Cloud over Bedrock for its CoCounsel AI product after finding AWS's service was 15% to 30% slower and lacked key government compliance certifications, the document showed. In May, executives raised these concerns with AWS leadership, including CEO Matt Garman and compute VP Dave Brown, leading both companies to agree to monthly review meetings. Joel Hron, CTO of Thomson Reuters, told Business Insider that the company recently moved "one component of an AI workload to Google Cloud to prioritize latency." He added that Thomson Reuters still runs substantial workloads on AWS and Anthropic as part of its multi-model, multi-cloud strategy. The July AWS document also noted that Bedrock was losing ground to Google's Gemini models, which boast five to six times larger quota limits and, in many cases, better performance. (And this was before Google's Gemini 3 launch, which improved AI performance further for the internet giant). Rivals such as Databricks, FireworksAI, and Nvidia's Dynamo were quickly pulling ahead, it noted. Without a clear strategy or compelling long-term vision, AWS risked missing out on one of the most lucrative opportunities in the AI market, it warned. "We are still missing an inspiring long-term vision and a holistic strategy," the document said.</p>
