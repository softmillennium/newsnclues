                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>That's especially true for carcinomas, which don't behave like other malignancies. Some of these tumors act as shapeshifters and start to resemble cells from other organs of the human body, such as skin. "The tumors are notoriously plastic in their cellular identity," says Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (CSHL) Professor Christopher Vakoc. Recent studies from the Vakoc lab shine a new light on two hard-to-treat carcinomas, revealing vulnerabilities that could "tee up targets for therapy," he says. In a study published in Nature Communications, CSHL researchers identify a protein that determines whether pancreatic cancer cells maintain their classical form or begin to look and act more like skin cells. Meanwhile, in Cell Reports, they uncover the crystal structure of another group of proteins that plays a key role in tuft cell lung cancer. This latest finding represents a full-circle moment for the lab, Vakoc explains. When he and his colleagues discovered tuft cell lung cancer in 2018, they were searching for epigenetic factors that drive tumor growth. Now, in collaboration with CSHL Director of Research Leemor Joshua-Tor, they've found what could someday become an epigenetic therapy designed to stop the cancer's growth. "We aim to identify the master regulators of cellular identity," he says. The hope is that these "master regulators" could someday become the targets of new medicines, much like hormone therapies now used against breast and prostate cancers that were once difficult to treat. That ethos is apparent in both of his lab's latest studies. Whether going after mouse models of pancreatic cancer or lung cancer, they see no evidence of toxicity or damage to vital organs. We're setting a higher bar for specificity when it comes to new cancer targets and treatments." They're coming to a deeper understanding of cellular identity, and in so doing, they're helping establish a new and better standard of care.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Rutgers neuroscientist Peng Jiang was visiting his hometown of Qianshan, a city in China's Anhui province, when a neighbor came to his parents' house with a story that would stay with him. The man's mother had been diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease in her early 60s. After nearly a decade of decline, she no longer recognized her own son. One morning, she looked at him and asked gently, "How is your mother doing? He told Jiang that Alzheimer's runs in his family and that he fears his own children may one day watch him fade the way he watched his mother's memory vanish. That conversation, which took place several years ago, became a turning point for Jiang, an associate professor in the Department of Cell Biology and Neuroscience at the School of Arts and Sciences. Already deep into Alzheimer's research, Jiang returned to his lab with renewed urgency. "The fact that there is still no effective treatment fuels my determination to pursue new therapeutic ideas," said Jiang, also a faculty member of the Rutgers Brain Health Institute. Now, Jiang and his neuroscience colleague Mengmeng Jin, the first author of the study, have made a discovery they said could reshape how scientists think about Alzheimer's treatment. We believe it's a major advance in the field. The work reflects a shift in Alzheimer's disease research, Jiang said. Instead of focusing only on removing toxic proteins, scientists may be able to strengthen the brain's own defense system to keep it resilient and healthy longer. Individuals with Down syndrome, who carry three copies of chromosome 21, almost universally develop early-onset Alzheimer's disease due to the accelerated accumulation of toxic proteins in the brain. Yet a small subset of people with Down syndrome shows remarkable resilience – they never develop dementia despite having the same pathological buildup. This observation motivated the Rutgers team to investigate the biological effects of a rare mutation, CSF2RB A455D, identified in the immune cells of a small number of individuals with Down syndrome. Their research reveals previously unknown functions of this mutation and provides new insights into mechanisms that may influence the risk of neurodegeneration. They focused on microglia, the brain's immune cells that act as housekeepers, clearing away waste and protecting neurons. Using stem cell technology, the researchers created human microglia with the mutation and placed them into the brains of mice to develop a chimeric mouse brain model, allowing them to observe how these human cells function in a living brain environment. These mice were then exposed to Alzheimer's-related proteins. The cells were better at cleaning up harmful proteins and protecting nearby neurons. When researchers placed both mutated and unmutated microglia together in brain environments containing Alzheimer's-related proteins, the mutated microglia slowly took over. This effect showed up not only in cells from people with Down syndrome but in cells from the general population. "We transplant the cells, then inject pathological proteins," said Jin, a postdoctoral research fellow. One approach involves transplanting microglia engineered with the protective mutation into patients' brains. Another could involve using gene therapy to introduce the mutation directly into existing microglia, potentially restoring their ability to defend against Alzheimer's damage. A myeloid trisomy 21-associated gene variant is protective from Alzheimer's disease.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>New research reveals that certain social determinants of health-such as socioeconomic status, household characteristics, and racial/ethnic minority status-have significant effects on rural–urban disparities in colorectal cancer mortality rates. The findings are published by Wiley online in CANCER, a peer-reviewed journal of the American Cancer Society. Using 1999–2020 colorectal cancer mortality data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention pertaining to all US counties, investigators assessed how different components of the Social Vulnerability Index might affect differences in colorectal cancer deaths in rural versus urban areas. Among all counties, poverty, unemployment, lacking a high school diploma, household crowding, and lacking a vehicle had the strongest impact on colorectal cancer mortality. Our findings show that while socioeconomic vulnerability drives much of the disparity in colorectal cancer mortality, the rural–urban gap is shaped by a broader set of contextual factors. Composite indices like the Social Vulnerability Index offer important insight into population-level risk, but actionable progress will depend on domain-specific measures that identify concrete barriers and facilitators, guiding resource allocation and policy tailored to local needs."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A US study of more than a million Medicaid enrollees, newly diagnosed with opioid use disorder (OUD), finds most – nearly seven in 10 – are not receiving access to potentially life-saving drugs within six months. The major gap in access to these medications – vital for those receiving free or low-cost healthcare and needing treatment for a dependency on heroin, painkillers and other opioids – is revealed ahead of looming Medicaid funding cuts, which threaten to further limit access to many various medications. The research, published today in the peer-reviewed publication The American Journal of Drug and Alcohol Abuse, demonstrates that Black patients are substantially more likely than White patients to struggle in accessing treatment. With OUD continuing to claim tens of thousands of lives a year, the study authors from Boston University School of Social Work, and the Institute for Health, Health Care Policy and Aging Research at Rutgers University, say the current access issues are particularly concerning as their findings also highlight just how vital a medication-based approach is to cut the odds of overdose. In particular, their results indicate that methadone reduces overdose risk by 86% (the greatest reduction achieved by a prescription) when compared to receiving no medication at all. The study authors suggest policymakers should continue supporting Medicaid to cut overdose deaths nationwide. To reduce barriers to access, the authors are calling for reforms such as expansion of 'take-home' doses of methadone, which drug users self-administer while unsupervised. "Results highlight the critical need for policies to ensure everyone can access treatment – regardless of where they live, their ability to pay, or other personal characteristics," states lead author Professor Peter Treitler from Boston University School of Social Work, who focuses on research aimed to improve wellbeing for people with substance use disorders and inform more-effective solutions to the nation's critical substance use challenges. "Increasing access to methadone may be particularly important, given its large protective effect against overdose and the substantial policy and service delivery barriers to access." The US opioid crisis remains a major public health issue with overdose deaths still at historically high levels. The study findings will fuel debates about Medicaid funding and coverage, including concerns over Medicaid that could limit access to addiction treatment. Previous research shows medication treatment is highly effective in reducing the risk of opioid overdose. This new study is among the first to analyze access to and effectiveness of all three of these medications in people newly diagnosed with OUD in the national Medicaid population. Many of those included in the study also suffered from chronic pain, psychiatric disorders, and addictions to drugs other than opioids. Results showed what the authors describe as a 'modest' improvement (27% to 34%) in the number of participants who received treatment within 180 days after diagnosis. This increase was observed over the four-year study period. However, seven in ten (69%) did not receive medication within 180 days. Black participants were a third less likely than White drugs users to get methadone and other treatment within this timeframe, as were Hispanic participants although the difference was not as acute. A small number of the 361,034 (31%) people who received medication to treat their addiction experienced an overdose within 180 days. However, most patients are still required to attend the clinic frequently, deterring many from initiating or continuing treatment. This issue needs to be addressed, the authors add.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This snake's venom destroys muscle tissue, often leaving victims with permanent disabilities even after receiving standard treatment. The research team wrapped specific mRNA molecules in tiny fat particles that, when injected into muscle, teach cells to produce protective antibodies, preventing venom damage. The treatment could significantly limit the injury and impacts caused by snakebites, which kill around 140,000 people worldwide and cause 400,000 permanent disabilities each year. For the first time, we've shown that mRNA technology can protect muscle tissue from snake venom-induced damage. This opens a completely new door for treating snakebites, particularly the local injuries that current antivenoms struggle to prevent." Professor Andreas Laustsen, who co-led this study from the Technical University of Denmark said: "We tested this treatment on snake venom, but this technology could be even more useful for other conditions where toxins cause harm gradually. For example, it might help block harmful toxins produced by bacteria during infections." Current antivenoms work well against toxins in the bloodstream but struggle to reach damaged muscle tissue around the bite site. In laboratory tests using human muscle cells, the new treatment reduced damage from both a single toxin and whole venom. The protective antibodies appeared within 12-24 hours of mRNA injection. In mice, a single injection of mRNA protected muscle tissue from toxin-induced injury when given 48 hours before exposure to the venom. Mice that received the mRNA treatment before being exposed to the toxin showed lower levels of enzymes such as creatine kinase and lactate dehydrogenase, which are released when muscle is injured. The researchers say their approach could work alongside traditional antivenoms. Future versions would need to protect against multiple venom components. Storage in remote areas without refrigeration also presents difficulties. Professor Vaiyapuri said: "We now need to expand this approach to target multiple venom toxins and solve storage challenges for rural areas, as well as ensure faster production of antibodies in tissues. The potential to reduce disabilities among snakebite victims is significant." The team plans to develop treatments targeting additional toxins and test whether the approach works when given after a bite occurs.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>An analysis covering 1.6 million pregnancies shows that both low and high weight gain can drive major complications, from preterm birth to C-sections. This raises urgent questions about how global guidelines should evolve for today's diverse populations. A systematic review and meta-analysis of observational data from 1.6 million women provide evidence on the association between weight gain during pregnancy (gestational weight gain) and risks of adverse outcomes in both mothers and newborns across diverse world regions and income settings. Gestational weight gain is known to be associated with acute and long-term health risks in both mothers and newborns. The Institute of Medicine (IOM) in the USA generated gestational weight gain guidelines in 1990 to optimize these outcomes, particularly low birth weight. These guidelines were developed based on a moderate-sized population of mostly White US women with a mean body mass index (BMI) of 24 and an age of 26 years. In 2009, the guidelines were updated to incorporate World Health Organization (WHO) BMI categories and broader health outcomes. Since then, these guidelines have provided an important international reference point. The populations that formed the basis of these guidelines were characterized by lower maternal age and BMI, with limited ethnic and socioeconomic diversity. Substantial variations in global population characteristics highlight the need for developing region-specific guidelines on gestational weight gain. Global population trends over the past two decades have indicated an increase in maternal age, BMI, and gestational weight gain, further highlighting the urgent need for updated guidelines based on contemporary populations across diverse world regions and income settings. The current systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to inform the WHO's initiative to develop global standards for gestational weight gain. A total of 40 observational studies with 1.6 million female participants aged over 18 years were analyzed to report maternal and infant outcomes stratified by participants' BMI and gestational weight gain. The study also evaluated additional outcomes such as gestational diabetes and neonatal jaundice, although these were less consistently reported across included studies. This systematic review and meta-analysis included contemporary evidence (2009-2024) from 1.6 million women across five WHO world regions. Only 32 % of the entire population had gestational weight gain within the recommended ranges, with 23 % gaining less and 45 % gaining more than recommended. The meta-analysis of selected studies that used WHO BMI categories revealed that gestational weight gain below the recommended range is associated with a lower risk of caesarean delivery, a large-for-gestational-age infant (an infant with body weight significantly higher than the average for their gestational age), and macrosomia (birth weight significantly higher than the average), but a higher risk of preterm birth, a small-for-gestational-age infant, low birth weight, and respiratory distress. Gestational weight gain above the recommended range, on the other hand, was associated with a higher risk of caesarean delivery, increased birth weight, hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, a large-for-gestational-age infant, macrosomia, and neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admission, and a lower risk of preterm birth and a small-for-gestational-age infant. Notably, the findings revealed that gestational weight gain below the recommended range is associated with a higher risk of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy in Asian women. However, substantial heterogeneity across Asian studies, driven partly by different BMI classification systems, limits the certainty of these estimates. This evidence will help inform the WHO's initiation process to develop globally relevant guidelines for gestational weight gain, aiming to improve post-pregnancy outcomes across world regions. The meta-analysis included five Asian studies that used WHO BMI categories, and several other studies from China that used regional BMI categories, which limit the generalizability of the findings across Asia. Overall, the findings from Asia indicate high levels of uncertainty, making it challenging to distinguish population-specific risks from BMI classification differences in this world region. Given that 60% of the global population resides in Asia, it is essential to understand how BMI category differences across regions influence variations in pregnancy outcomes due to gestational weight gain. These Asian findings support the ongoing effort to incorporate diverse populations from different world regions and settings in developing globally relevant standards for gestational weight gain. According to the meta-analysis findings, women belonging to the lowest obesity category (lowest BMI in the obese range) have a higher risk of having large-for-gestational-age infants compared to those belonging to other obesity categories. Although subgroup analyses by obesity class were performed, patterns across classes should be interpreted cautiously, as the study did not draw definitive comparative conclusions on this aspect. Overall, the safety and implications of weight loss in women with a BMI in the obese range during pregnancy remain uncertain. Further research is needed across a broader range of outcomes, and with a standardized method for reporting BMI and gestational weight gain categories to reduce cross-study variability. In conclusion, this review complements existing individual patient data by including a broad range of studies and outcomes, identifying key gaps to inform future individual patient data priorities within the WHO's ongoing global gestational weight gain standards initiative.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Two new Cochrane reviews show strong and consistent evidence that HPV vaccines are effective in preventing cervical cancer and pre-cancerous changes, especially when given to young people before they are exposed to the virus. The reviews also confirm that HPV vaccines are only likely to cause minor, transient side effects such as a sore arm. Whilst many types of HPV are harmless, other 'high-risk' types can cause cancers of the cervix, anus, penis, vulva, vagina, and throat, and others cause anogenital warts. Cervical cancer is the fourth most common cancer in women worldwide and causes more than 300,000 deaths each year, mostly in low- and middle-income countries. The new reviews confirm that vaccination against HPV can prevent most of these cancers from developing. The first review focused on randomized controlled trials and included 60 studies with 157,414 participants. They found that all HPV vaccines were effective in preventing infections that can lead to cancer and other HPV-related conditions, with no evidence of serious safety concerns. Because cancers caused by HPV can take many years to develop, most studies did not follow participants long enough to measure direct effects on cancer itself. Short-term side effects like mild pain or swelling at the injection site were common, but serious side effects were rare and occurred at similar rates in both vaccine and control groups. Clinical trials cannot yet give us the whole picture on cervical cancer, as HPV-related cancers can take many years to develop. The second review analyzed evidence from 225 studies involving more than 132 million people across multiple countries. It looked at observational study designs, including population-level studies comparing outcomes before and after introduction of the vaccine. The results came from studies of various designs across different follow-up periods. The review also found substantial reductions in pre-cancerous changes (known as CIN2+ and CIN3+), and in anogenital warts, which are also caused by HPV infection. By cross-referencing alleged adverse events with real-world follow-up data, the review team found no relationship between reported serious side effects and HPV vaccination. "We now have clear and consistent evidence from around the world that HPV vaccination prevents cervical cancer," says Nicholas Henschke, co-lead author. "An important finding was that the commonly reported side effects of the vaccine, often discussed on social media, were found to hold no evidence of a real link to vaccination." Together, the two Cochrane reviews provide the most comprehensive and up-to-date evidence on HPV vaccination to date, drawing from both large-scale real-world studies and rigorous clinical trials. Protection is strongest when vaccination occurs before sexual debut and exposure to the virus. "These reviews make it clear that HPV vaccination in early adolescence can prevent cancer and save lives," says Dr Jo Morrison, senior author, gynecological oncology consultant at Somerset NHS Foundation Trust and Honorary Associate Professor at the University of Exeter. Over time we'll see the impact of vaccination on other cancers too, including ones that affect men." Most research has been conducted in high-income countries, meaning more studies are needed in low- and middle-income settings, where cervical cancer is more common and screening programs are lacking; it is in these countries that HPV vaccination will have an even more positive impact. However, to achieve the World Health Organisation's ambition to eradicate cervical cancer, high rates of HPV vaccination, cervical screening and treatment of pre-cancers detected by screening remain crucial. "Longer-term data will continue to strengthen our understanding of how HPV vaccination protects against cancer over a lifetime. Whilst we now have sufficient data to see a beneficial effect of HPV vaccination on cervical cancers, which tend to develop in younger women, it will take decades to fully understand the impact of vaccination on vulval, peri-anal, penile and head and neck cancers which often develop later in life," says Dr. Morrison.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>But the kids' excitement for their new rides is tempered by a recurring question from worried parents: Are they safe? The federal government's e-bike regulations are sparse, and efforts to expand them have stalled, leaving states and even counties to fill the void with patchwork rules of their own. Meanwhile, the seemingly endless variety of e-bikes for sale vary in design, speed, and quality. In that environment, retailers like Fletcher aim to educate consumers so they can make informed decisions. "We're super careful about what comes in the shop because there are hazards," he said. Federal rules requiring safety standards for batteries in e-bikes and other devices such as e-scooters are in limbo after the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the independent federal regulatory agency meant to protect people against death and injury from bicycles and other consumer products, withdrew proposed regulations in August. In May, Trump fired three members of the commission who had been appointed by his predecessor, former President Joe Biden. Meanwhile, separate proposed rules by the commission to address injuries from mechanical failings have languished. That leaves e-bikes subject to existing standards written for traditional bicycles and which the commission has said, based on a preliminary assessment, aren't adequate to reduce the risk of e-bike injuries. Colorado, Minnesota, and Utah recently passed laws regulating e-bikes to fill the gap. The laws address issues such as battery fire risks and rider safety and seek to distinguish lower-speed e-bikes from faster e-motos, or electric motorcycles, which can reach top speeds of 35 miles an hour or faster. No federal law dictates the age at which someone may operate an e-bike, but more than half of states have age restrictions for who can operate Class 3 bikes, which reach a top speed of 28 miles an hour, while two California counties recently set a minimum age to operate Class 2 bikes, with their 20 mph top speed. "The biggest issue is e-bikes that switch from a power-assisted bike to essentially a motorized scooter," said Democratic state Rep. Lesley Smith, who co-sponsored Colorado's bill. Colorado's e-bike law requires safety certification of lithium-ion batteries, which can explode when manufactured or used improperly. Most dealers, importers, and distributors have agreed to use batteries that meet safety standards, but there will always be manufacturers who cut corners on safety to save money, said Ed Benjamin, chairman of the Light Electric Vehicle Association, whose hundreds of members supply light electric vehicles such as e-bikes, or their parts. They just want to make the cheapest bike possible," Benjamin said. She said she's seen some alarming behavior, such as students' riding three to a bike, riding without helmets, or attempting power wheelies popularized by social media. Thompson said kids are disabling the speed limiter on e-bikes to operate at higher speeds. "It's super easy for kids to go on YouTube and find a video that will coach you how to override or disable the governor on a bicycle," she said. Those blurred lines bedevil an e-bike classification system adopted, in part or full, by nearly all states, in which e-bike motors generally must operate at 750 watts or lower. Some e-bikes easily switch between Class 2 and 3, sometimes unbeknownst to parents, said Smith, the Colorado lawmaker. The dangers of Class 2 e-bikes prompted California's Marin County to ban children under 16 from operating them and require that anyone riding one wear a helmet. Youths ages 10 to 15 who crash their e-bikes require an ambulance at five times the rate of other age groups involved in e-bike crashes, according to county health officials. A growing number of serious injuries on e-bikes, particularly among adolescents, is an emerging public safety problem, the American College of Surgeons said in June. After hearing from a dozen other counties experiencing similar problems, though, she said state legislators should move to a statewide law from piecemeal, county-by-county ordinances. San Diego County bans riders under 12 from operating Class 1 or 2 bikes. Vehicles claiming to be both e-bikes and e-motos fall into the cracks between two regulatory agencies, the CPSC and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, said Matt Moore, general and policy counsel for PeopleForBikes, a trade association for bicycles, including e-bikes. PeopleForBikes wants the traffic safety administration to stop shipments of or take other legal action against e-motos that are labeled as e-bikes and do not comply with federal standards, Moore said. If the federal government won't act, states should clarify their laws to define e-motos as off-road dirt bikes or motor vehicles that require licenses, he said. In October, California defined e-motos, which it requires to display an identification plate issued by the Department of Motor Vehicles for use off-highway. In Boulder, Thompson said, the school district considers communication and education cornerstones of safety. So how can we make them safer and more viable for families?"

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Salpingectomy for permanent contraception yields an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $143,769 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained compared with vasectomy. “Salpingectomy is not cost-effective compared with vasectomy at a WTP [willingness to pay] threshold of $100,000, despite lower unintended pregnancy rates and societal ovarian cancer burden. Shared decision-making, including a discussion of the long-term health benefits of salpingectomy, is important for couples deciding on permanent contraception procedures,” the authors of the study wrote. The study was led by Amy Pearson and Jill Brown, MD, MPH, from the School of Medicine and Department of Gynecologic Surgery and Obstetrics, Uniformed Services University, Bethesda, Maryland. According to the authors, the model does not account for variations in ovarian cancer care costs and survival based on factors such as disease stage, age, race, and geographic region. The use of QALYs to characterize reproductive health outcomes requires methodologic refinement. Additionally, the analysis applies only to heterosexual couples seeking permanent contraception and would not apply to individuals with other circumstances. The authors reported having no potential conflicts of interest. This article was created using several editorial tools, including AI, as part of the process.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>IntroductionWhat is the gut virome?Viral transplant studiesTherapeutic promiseChallengesConclusionsReferencesFurther reading Fecal virome transplantation uses viruses rather than bacteria to reshape the gut ecosystem and restore microbial balance. Early studies show it may help treat gut dysbiosis, metabolic disorders, and inflammatory conditions by transferring beneficial phage communities. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) involves transferring bacterial microorganisms from healthy donors to patients with a disrupted gut ecosystem, such as those with recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection. More recently, the fecal virome transplant (FVT) has emerged as an alternative approach to FMT that only transfers viruses from the stool of healthy donors to control microbial communities, with early animal studies suggesting potential benefits for treating antibiotic-associated, metabolic, and inflammatory disorders that contribute to gut dysbiosis, particularly in models where phages persistently engraft and reshape the bacterial community.4,9 From infancy, the gut is rich in phages, which diversify as diet, immunity, and environmental exposure evolve. Through their lytic and lysogenic life cycles, phages modify bacterial populations by eliminating harmful species through lysis while integrating into bacterial genomes to promote beneficial coexistence and genetic diversity.1,3 Phages exhibit immunomodulatory behavior by maintaining tolerance toward commensal bacteria while preventing infections, and evidence from mouse and human studies indicates that donor phages can engraft long-term and correlate with microbiome reshaping.4,8 Eukaryotic viruses also contribute to immune balance by regulating pathways involved in toll-like receptor (TLR) and retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) signaling, although these effects appear more context-dependent than those of bacteriophages.3 When this equilibrium is disrupted by antibiotics, infection, or diet, phage–bacteria interactions can shift, thereby leading to dysbiosis, inflammation, and altered immunity. Emerging research suggests that the gut virome plays a crucial role in both intestinal and systemic immune regulation, with potential implications for treating inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and obesity; however, its influence on outcomes such as cancer immunotherapy remains preliminary and requires further validation.3 In mice, transferring viral particles from healthy donors reconstructed the gut microbiome after antibiotic treatment, thereby reshaping microbial diversity and preventing dysbiosis.4 FVT enriched with Akkermansia muciniphila has also been shown to promote the growth of this beneficial bacterium in recipients and improve fertility outcomes.5 In preterm piglets, FVT from healthy donors prevented necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), a life-threatening intestinal disease, by increasing viral diversity and reducing pathogenic Proteobacteria. Several studies also demonstrate that phage engraftment is highly host-specific, with transferred phages proliferating only when compatible bacterial hosts are present, emphasizing the importance of donor–recipient matching at the microbial level.4,11 This treatment also normalized bacterial diversity, suggesting that phages can reprogram host metabolism by reconstituting bacterial communities and regulating key pathways involved in glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and leptin signaling.9,10 Modified FVT approaches, such as chemostat-propagated viromes that exclude eukaryotic viruses, have similarly improved blood glucose levels.10 In one recent study, FVT from donors consuming different diets altered recipient microbiota and reliably shifted body-weight phenotypes in mice across independent experiments, thus exemplifying the reproducibility of virome-driven phenotypic editing and diet–virome interactions.11 In IBD, virome imbalance, particularly the expansion of Caudovirales phages and a concurrent reduction in Microviridae abundance, contributes to dysregulated immune activation through TLR-9 and interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) pathways. Recent studies further show that these effects may depend on the stability and persistence of donor phages in the gut, with some phages demonstrating long-term colonization while others remain transient.8,11 To mitigate these risks, several modified FVT techniques have been developed, including solvent–detergent treatment (FVT-SDT) to inactivate enveloped viruses, pyronin-Y treatment (FVT-PyT) to suppress RNA virus activity, and chemostat-propagated viromes (FVT-ChP) that dilute or remove eukaryotic viral contaminants while preserving bacteriophages.2 The lack of standardized methods for virome isolation, sequencing, and delivery is an additional challenge associated with FVT. Donor material variability, unclear classification as a biological product or therapeutic agent, and limited patient acceptance further complicate the adoption of FVT. Recent discussions emphasize the need for explicit regulatory frameworks distinguishing between whole-microbiota and phage-enriched products, as well as harmonized screening standards and ethical oversight to address long-term risks.15 The conceptual graphs of preparation methodology for fecal transplants.
