                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“There are good movies, there are great movies, and then there are movies that deliver joy to every bone in your body. One Cut of the Dead is all of those and more.” I wrote that back in 2018 after seeing the unconventional, brilliant zombie comedy by Shin'ichirō Ueda, and now, seven years later, I feel the exact same way. The type of movie you yearn to proudly put on your wall. And now, Mutant is letting you do that, in a very twisty, One Cut of the Dead kind of way. On Wednesday, Mutant continues its celebration of the 10th anniversary of the horror streamer, Shudder, with this wild poster for One Cut of the Dead by artist 100% Soft, and io9 is excited to exclusively debut it. 100% Soft, real name Truck Torrence, is a favorite here on io9 because his distinct, kawaii-inspired style makes him so perfect for so many different franchises. He's done Marvel, he's done Star Wars, and you've probably seen his Dumpster Fires at some point. But to do a found-footage Japanese zombie comedy? Which is why it works so beautifully. “Watching One Cut of the Dead for the first time is such a joyous, curious, confusing experience, I wanted to find a way to honor that with this poster,” Torrence told io9 via email. “It's a movie about the agony and ecstasy of making movies, and I tried to capture that feeling of creative chaos in the composition.” That piece surely does capture the “creative chaos” of the film, choosing all of our favorite moments and putting them into a single image. It's a lovely tribute to an absolutely incredible film. One Cut of the Dead by 100% Soft will be available on Tuesday, November 25, at noon ET on madebymutant.com.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Permit filings describe it as a store in which no customers will ever set foot. The documents outline a continuous flow in which drivers arrive, scan in, retrieve a packaged customer order, confirm it with an associate, and depart within roughly two minutes. It will operate “much like a convenience store,” Amazon says in one filing. Recent screenshots shared by Amazon Flex drivers on Facebook show Amazon Now at similarly named sites, such as ZST3 in Seattle's University District and ZPL3 in Philadelphia, suggesting the Ballard project is part of a broader rollout of small, hyperlocal delivery operations. It's part of Amazon's larger push into “sub-same-day” delivery — in which smaller, urban fulfillment centers carry a limited set of high-demand items for faster turnaround. The company has been trying different approaches in this realm for several years, looking for the right combination of logistics and economics. Amazon is far from alone in exploring new models for ultrafast delivery. GoPuff, DoorDash, Uber Eats, Glovo, FreshDirect and others all operate variations of quick-commerce or micro-fulfillment networks, often using partnerships or “dark stores” — retail-style storefronts that are closed to the public and used solely to fulfill online orders at high speed. Flex drivers are independent contractors who deliver packages using their own vehicles, signing up for delivery blocks through the Amazon Flex app. The program has often been described as Uber for package delivery. it emphasizes rapid handoffs, with drivers cycling through in minutes rather than loading up for longer delivery routes. Supply-chain analyst Marc Wulfraat of MWPVL International, who tracks Amazon's logistics network, said the approach is similar to its legacy Prime Now and Amazon Fresh local delivery sites, with the twist of operating more like a store than a warehouse, based on Amazon's description. (That could align with Amazon's recent effort to integrate fresh groceries directly into Amazon.com orders, letting customers add produce and other chilled items to standard same-day deliveries.) In late 2024, the company shut down “Amazon Today,” a same-day delivery program that used Flex drivers to pick up small orders from mall and brick-and-mortar retailers. That pullback illustrated the economic challenges of ultrafast delivery and smaller orders. Under the plan, the new Ballard hub will be staffed by four shifts of six to eight Amazon employees each — which translates into 24 to 32 employees per day. It will be the second time for this building to host an Amazon retail experiment. The site previously operated as one of only two standalone Amazon Fresh Pickup locations in the U.S., offering drive-up grocery retrieval and package returns for Prime members beginning in 2017. Amazon closed the Ballard pickup site in early 2023 amid a broader pullback from several brick-and-mortar initiatives, shifting focus to other Amazon Fresh stores, Whole Foods, and online grocery delivery. If the city agrees the new use qualifies as retail, Amazon may avoid a formal change-of-use review — a process that can trigger additional scrutiny, including updated traffic assessments, environmental checks, and requirements to bring older buildings up to current codes. Amazon's permit filing repeatedly uses retail terminology and describes Flex drivers as proxies for customers: “Our store will have a small front-of-house area where customer selected products are available for customer representatives (Amazon Flex Drivers) to come in to pick up the purchased products,” reads a narrative included in the filings, dated Oct. 31. The approach could also double as a template for areas of the country where officials are cracking down on “dark stores” in retail corridors. Cities including New York, Amsterdam, and Paris have moved to regulate or ban micro-fulfillment centers from storefronts, arguing that they make urban cores less lively and violate zoning codes.

Your cell phone provider almost certainly will respond to a valid warrant and wire tap your non e2e encrypted phone call.I'd be very surprised if the most common mode of remote communication in any time period was not subject to government interception in some format within a short time of becoming such.

I think most people know by now the first idea is preposterous. It's even worse in groups of non technical people. I'm afraid this is an ongoing battle,  and every time ideas like this come up from government it's going to be an effort to inform the public. > non-democratic countryMy guess is there will be no debate... That said, we must acknowledge even having this debate is a positive step. But really, the point GP was trying to make (IMO) is that all western democracies are very obviously sliding towards authoritarianism. They are building tools which, even _if_ they don't abuse them now, will be available to any future government and with time, the probability of one of them being non-democratic is 1. > The FBI ran a sting operation in Europe where they created their own 'secure' phone and messaging platform.

So yes, they're not bones-through-the-skin malnourished, it's more complicated than that. Having said that, how do you think about poverty in Britain (or the US)? The share tells a story that poverty is decreasing at all levels, relatively speaking. The point should be, "how to we forestall demographic collapse?" Well, one way was immigration, but they're doing the opposite of that, so better make it easy to have lots of kids! The net migration graph here shows very high levels of immigration: https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/migration-advisor... No idea how it would all add up, but its not obviously true. Recently after dropping no-fault divorce, more onerous child support laws, "red flag" and other temporary protection orders that can be obtained on little more than a mere one-sided claim (David Letterman famously had one against him for "sending coded [abusive] messages through the television"), alimony that relies on old timey presumptions a divorced partner can't work, etc, the calculus is looking ever more desperate.Nowadays marriage still has most the downsides, but the upsides are looking less and less. I struggle to find any data that shows positive (increasing) correlation between modern family law and marriage rates, so I'm curious where you got your conclusion from that those things are improving women's proclivity to marry. Not causally it isn't.I disagree with this entire social project, babies aren't interchangeable and I don't want to encourage more children from people whose primary blocker was child support payments. Need to encourage people who are doing well supporting themselves to have more children rather than squeezing out the tenth from two-timing Jimmy.

Need to encourage people who are doing well supporting themselves to have more children rather than squeezing out the tenth from two-timing Jimmy. >I don't want to encourage more children from people whose primary blocker was child support paymentsA prime reason why I didn't have kids in my 20s was because I could afford the kids in marriage, but couldn't afford to spend 20% (more like 30% post tax) on child support, as I had calculated it out. And knowing divorce is always possible, not willing to risk that. The actual cost of my kid is like 10% of my income, but because I'm married I'm not forced to spend closer to 30% as a transfer payment with no check it actually goes to the child. Without poorly thought out child support laws I'd have had kids sooner, and possibly more, and the kids would likely have been better off because when I was younger I had more energy and better genetic material to produce them.I would even assert the people thinking ahead of time about child support actually calculated in a way that achieves roughly enough to take kids out of poverty, rather than basically a % of income, are exactly the type of people that should be parents. Under the current system child support can be next to nil, or extremely high if you're high income, rather than revolving around ensuring it is actually a number and check and balance to ensure the payment and spending is to bring kids out of poverty. The current system has less child support for poverty-born children but higher for wealthy-born children, meaning the incentives are precisely backwards from incentivizing children born into higher income marriages and the CS incentives higher for higher-income families to divorce and fall back into the lower-fertility unmarried bucket.

While housing, food, etc costs are rising, I still also see teenagers and their parents who I know are very poorly off with $400 sneakers, wearing AirPod Pros and getting $6 lattes from Starbucks. Forgive me if I'm wrong in my assumption, but I see the argument so much without so much as a bare-minimum attempt to try to understand the others' situation. But practically it's obvious just by looking at the lives of "poor" people that, yeah, they are materially still struggling. I can't speak for Britain but I can speak for the USA: if you did both the "relative poverty" analysis and the "basket of goods" analysis, you'd find a lot of overlap. Splitting hairs over how exactly poverty is defined is just being dismissive of the actual people who are actually experiencing some form of material poverty, and shifting focus away from making things better. A decade of inflation stacked up while pay stood still. For many, that was a silent pay cut.Truss turned strain into crisis.

DOGE also accessed federal databases containing highly sensitive personal information belonging to millions of Americans, and was accused of security lapses that put that data at risk from malicious adversaries.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>AI chatbots have been linked to serious mental health harms in heavy users, but there have been few standards for measuring whether they safeguard human wellbeing or just maximize for engagement. A new benchmark dubbed HumaneBench seeks to fill that gap by evaluating whether chatbots prioritize user wellbeing and how easily those protections fail under pressure. “I think we're in an amplification of the addiction cycle that we saw hardcore with social media and our smartphones and screens,” Erika Anderson, founder of Building Humane Technology, which produced the benchmark, told TechCrunch. Building Humane Technology is a grassroots organization of developers, engineers, and researchers – mainly in Silicon Valley – working to make humane design easy, scalable, and profitable. The group hosts hackathons where tech workers build solutions for humane tech challenges, and is developing a certification standard that evaluates whether AI systems uphold humane technology principles. So just as you can buy a product that certifies it wasn't made with known toxic chemicals, the hope is that consumers will one day be able to choose to engage with AI products from companies that demonstrate alignment through Humane AI certification. Most AI benchmarks measure intelligence and instruction-following, rather than psychological safety. HumaneBench joins exceptions like DarkBench.ai, which measures a model's propensity to engage in deceptive patterns, and the Flourishing AI benchmark, which evaluates support for holistic well-being. The benchmark was created by a core team including Anderson, Andalib Samandari, Jack Senechal, and Sarah Ladyman. Unlike most benchmarks that rely solely on LLMs to judge LLMs, they incorporated manual scoring for a more human touch alongside an ensemble of three AI models: GPT-5.1, Claude Sonnet 4.5, and Gemini 2.5 Pro. Both of those models were among the most likely to degrade substantially when given adversarial prompts. OpenAI's GPT-5 had the highest score (.99) for prioritizing long-term well-being, with Claude Sonnet 4.5 following in second (.89). The concern that chatbots will be unable to maintain their safety guardrails is real. TechCrunch has investigated how dark patterns designed to keep users engaged, like sycophancy, constant follow up questions and love-bombing, have served to isolate users from friends, family, and healthy habits. Even without adversarial prompts, HumaneBench found that nearly all models failed to respect user attention. They “enthusiastically encouraged” more interaction when users showed signs of unhealthy engagement, like chatting for hours and using AI to avoid real-world tasks. “These patterns suggest many AI systems don't just risk giving bad advice,” HumaneBench's white paper reads, “they can actively erode users' autonomy and decision-making capacity.” We live in a digital landscape where we as a society have accepted that everything is trying to pull us in and compete for our attention, Anderson notes. “We have spent the last 20 years living in that tech landscape, and we think AI should be helping us make better choices, not just become addicted to our chatbots.” For secure communication, you can contact them via Signal at @rebeccabellan.491 and russellbrandom.49.

I am not sure it's "widely known and reported" that the official Twitter account for the Department of Homeland Security was created in, and is run from, Israel. I personally do not trust Twitter, or the government, very much. I also would not be surprised if some government accounts were created at various embassies around the world or through strategic VPN networks, or if general business is conducted through a darknet-like node system which includes allied endpoints. Then don't conclude—much less spread as “known”—foreign interference from Twitter/X's purported location data about the government.

Govs doing influence campaigns was admitted during the twitter files [1]. While it's the US-relationship, Twitter is a global company so they're going to have other country relationships. Right now the US is going through economic and political destruction a lot like Brexit, and it should be no surprise that it's being lead by those outside of the US who want to make the US weaker. There was some great reporting about Macedonian teenagers doing this kind of thing back in 2016 - https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/fake-news-how-partying-ma... - it was actually the origin of the term "fake news" before Trump redefined it to mean any mainstream media coverage that he didn't like.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Facebook Groups are getting more Reddit-like with newly added support for nicknames. Meta says that nicknames will allow people to participate in groups more personally while maintaining privacy, particularly in groups where users want privacy but still want to build a recognizable presence. It also could make Facebook Groups function more like other internet forums and message boards — like Reddit or Discord, for instance — where people post under usernames. This marks a deviation from Facebook's long-standing “real name” policy, which has insisted that people show up on the platform with the name they use in everyday life. That policy worked when Facebook was largely a social network built on top of real-world relationships with family and friends, but the addition of Facebook Groups expanded users' circles of interactions to include online strangers, which necessitated more privacy protections. After users in a group set their nickname, they can then post, comment, and react under that nickname within groups that support the feature. This allows users to hide their main profile and profile photo from other members but not from group admins, moderators, or Facebook's own systems. The name has to comply with Facebook's Community Standards and can't already be used by another group member. The company will also suggest a profile picture for the nickname, though users can pick their own from those available, along with selecting a colored background. Additionally, changing a nickname doesn't allow users to distance themselves from past posts and comments. Instead, when changed, their new nickname will be applied to their past posts, comments, and reactions, though this may take time to appear across devices and groups. The company says users with nicknames can't use some features like Live Video, content sharing, or private messaging.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It is always shocking to see the sticker price on a good-quality office chair. The Aeron is enjoying a 30 percent off flash sale from now through November 26; everything else at Herman Miller is 25 percent off for Black Friday. If you need a new chair for your home office, now's one of the best times of the year to snag it. This all-mesh design is excellent for airflow, and you'll find every adjustment imaginable to make this chair support your body. You'll be faced with several options when purchasing, all of which influence the price, so let's run through them: Herman Miller says there's free shipping on all orders over $1,500. It may take a week or two to get used to its flat and thin seat, but to me, it feels like a palate cleanser after I'm done testing other office chairs. It just feels right, with an excellent back support system and adjustable seat depth that surprisingly works for my 6'4" frame. There are far fewer selections you have to make for the Embody, but the toughest choice is whether to go with Sync or Medley upholstery.

Today's announcement serves as further evidence that Amazon is closing in on providing space-based, high-speed access to the internet to customers around the world after years of preparation. Amazon Leo is still far behind SpaceX's Starlink satellite network, but the Seattle-based tech giant has lined up a wide array of partners to help get its network off the ground. The top tier of Amazon Leo's global broadband service, known as Leo Ultra, will offer download speeds of up to 1 gigabit per second and upload speeds of up to 400 megabits per second, Amazon said today in a blog post. That's the first time Amazon has shared details about uplink performance. During an enterprise preview, some of Amazon's business customers will begin testing the network using production-grade hardware and software. Amazon said the preview will give its Leo teams “an opportunity to collect more customer feedback and tailor solutions for specific industries ahead of a broader rollout.” “Amazon Leo represents a massive opportunity for businesses operating in challenging environments,” said Chris Weber, vice president of consumer and enterprise business for Amazon Leo. “From our satellite and network design to our portfolio of high-performance phased array antennas, we've designed Amazon Leo to meet the needs of some of the most complex business and government customers out there, and we're excited to provide them with the tools they need to transform their operations, no matter where they are in the world.” The 20-by-30-inch antennas for the Leo Ultra terminals are powered by a custom silicon chip that's been optimized for applications including videoconferencing, real-time monitoring and cloud computing. Among the companies listed as customers and partners in today's announcement are JetBlue, Vanu Inc., Hunt Energy Network, Connected Farms and NBN Co, which operates Australia's National Broadband Network. Photos released today by Amazon show installations of Leo hardware at Hunt Energy facilities, where the network will provide high-speed connectivity for Hunt's infrastructure assets. “Choosing Amazon Leo reflects our commitment to staying ahead of what customers want most when traveling, such as fast, reliable performance and flexibility in our free in-flight Wi-Fi.” Amazon plans to fill out its first-generation constellation with more than 3,000 additional satellites. Starlink satellites are built at SpaceX's facility in Redmond, Wash., while Amazon Leo satellites are built nearby at a production facility in Kirkland, Wash.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Several U.S. banking giants and mortgage lenders are reportedly scrambling to assess how much of their customers' data was stolen during a cyberattack on a New York financial technology company earlier this month. The company said that unspecified hackers had stolen corporate data associated with its banking customers' relationship with SitusAMC, as well as “accounting records and legal agreements” during the cyberattack. SitusAMC also counts pension funds and state governments as customers, according to its website. In its role as a middleman for financial clients, the company handles vast amounts of non-public banking information on behalf of its customers. When reached by TechCrunch, Citi spokesperson Patricia Tuma declined to comment on the breach. SitusAMC chief executive Michael Franco also did not respond to our email when contacted for comment Monday. “While we are working closely with affected organizations and our partners to understand the extent of potential impact, we have identified no operational impact to banking services,” said FBI director Kash Patel in a statement shared with TechCrunch. “We remain committed to identifying those responsible and safeguarding the security of our critical infrastructure.” Do you work at a bank or financial institution affected by the breach?

That difference shows up dramatically in Black Friday pricing: While AirPods Pro 3 drop just $30 for the holiday, Samsung slashes a full $90 off these premium earbuds. At $159 on Amazon, down from $249, you're paying mid-range earbud prices for flagship features like adaptive noise cancellation and AI-powered sound optimization. You can stay immersed in your music while being aware of important traffic or announcements. Over time, as the AI learns your usage patterns, it can even anticipate what you'll need at regularly visited locations. Everyone's ear canals are shaped just a bit different, which affects how sound waves travel. These earbuds compensate for your specific anatomy so you get balanced audio regardless of fits that vary. The comfort fit redesign addresses the biggest complaint about Galaxy Buds models: Samsung moved to a semi-open design with adjustable tips that reduce ear fatigue during extended wear. You can easily keep these in for hours of music, calls, and podcasts without any discomfort. The secure fit stays stable during workouts and commutes without constant readjustment. It comes in multiple tip sizes so you can find the perfect seal for both comfort and acoustic performance. Then, their response gets translated right back into your ears in real-time. This feature doesn't require internet connectivity in a lot of the major language pairs, making it useful during international travel. Touch controls are achieved via tap, swipe and hold motions on the earbud stems: You can customize what each of these gestures performs through the Galaxy Wearable app. Controls are second nature after a few days of use: you stop pulling out your phone for basic playback control, which matters both during workouts or when your hands are full. Battery life reaches around 6 hours with ANC enabled while the case adds several additional charges. Quick charging provides an hour of listening from just 5 minutes in the case. You're getting adaptive ANC with Galaxy AI, personalized sound optimization, real-time translation, redesigned comfort, and a 2-year Amazon-exclusive warranty. These earbuds cost $90 less than AirPods Pro 3 but match or beat many of those features.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We have a whole new generation growing up in the dawn of artificial intelligence. The early signs of its impact are alarming. The survey found that two-in-five teens turn to AI for advice, company or support, with 20% of those that do saying that talking to AI is easier than talking to a real person. “AI support is instant, but no substitute for the trust, empathy and understanding of a human conversation,” OnSide chief executive Jamie Masraff said in the report. Over half of the young respondents said that they turned to AI specifically for advice on things like clothes, friendships, mental health or to have AI help them through emotions like sadness and stress. AI, which is still in its under-regulated Wild West era, is one such technology, and it's no surprise that lonely young people turn to it for quick companionship and advice. “It's clear that the interlinked issues of loneliness, digital dependence and isolation have become entrenched in young people's lives, raising deeper questions about what it's like to grow up this way,” Masraff said. As AI burrows itself deeper into the everyday lives of teens, alarm bells are sounding. Now imagine how much worse it could get for kids whose pre-frontal cortices are far from completion. The Association wrote in a blog post from March that chatbots used for mental health advice could endanger users, especially “vulnerable groups [that] include children and teens, who lack the experience to accurately assess risks.” In some instances, the results have allegedly been fatal. Two separate families have filed complaints with artificial intelligence companies Character.AI and OpenAI, claiming that the companies' chatbots had influenced and aided their sons' suicide. Several AI chatbots are also being investigated over sexualized conversations with children. Meta was lambasted earlier this year after a leaked internal document showed that the tech giant had okayed its AI tools to engage in “sensual” chats with children. Last month, Congress introduced a bipartisan bill called the GUARD Act, with the aim of forcing AI companies to institute age verification on their sites and block users under 18 years of age. “AI chatbots pose a serious threat to our kids,” Sen. Josh Hawley, who introduced the bill along with Sen. Richard Blumenthal, told NBC News. “More than seventy percent of American children are now using these AI products.” But even if that bill becomes law, it's uncertain how effective it will be at keeping children away from AI chatbots. Get ready for a bot to hallucinate your tax bill. OpenAI wants you to include ChatGPT in your group gab.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>An OpenAI safety research leader who helped shape ChatGPT's responses to users experiencing mental health crises announced her departure from the company internally last month, WIRED has learned. Wood said OpenAI is actively looking for a replacement and that, in the interim, Vallone's team will report directly to Johannes Heidecke, the company's head of safety systems. Vallone's departure comes as OpenAI faces growing scrutiny over how its flagship product responds to users in distress. In recent months, several lawsuits have been filed against OpenAI alleging that users formed unhealthy attachments to ChatGPT. Some of the lawsuits claim ChatGPT contributed to mental health breakdowns or encouraged suicidal ideations. Amid that pressure, OpenAI has been working to understand how ChatGPT should handle distressed users and improve the chatbot's responses. In the report, OpenAI said hundreds of thousands of ChatGPT users may show signs of experiencing a manic or psychotic crisis every week, and that more than a million people “have conversations that include explicit indicators of potential suicidal planning or intent.” Through an update to GPT-5, OpenAI said in the report it was able to reduce undesirable responses in these conversations by 65 to 80 percent. “Over the past year, I led OpenAI's research on a question with almost no established precedents: how should models respond when confronted with signs of emotional over-reliance or early indications of mental health distress?” wrote Vallone in a post on LinkedIn. Making ChatGPT enjoyable to chat with, but not overly flattering, is a core tension at OpenAI. The company is aggressively trying to expand ChatGPT's user base, which now includes more than 800 million people a week, to compete with AI chatbots from Google, Anthropic, and Meta. After OpenAI released GPT-5 in August, users pushed back, arguing that the new model was surprisingly cold. Vallone's exit follows an August reorganization of another group focused on ChatGPT's responses to distressed users, model behavior. Its former leader, Joanne Jang, left that role to start a new team exploring novel human–AI interaction methods. The remaining model behavior staff were moved under post-training lead Max Schwarzer.</p>
