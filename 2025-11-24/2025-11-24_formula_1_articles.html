2025 Las Vegas Grand Prix: Best race start onboards

Radio Rewind: 2025 Las Vegas Grand Prix

After a tricky weekend for McLaren in Las Vegas back in 2024, Lando Norris believes that the squad "have a better feeling in the car" this time around, having topped the timesheets in FP2.

Lando Norris has set out his expectation of fighting for pole position in Las Vegas after topping the timesheets during a disrupted Free Practice 2, with the Briton noting that McLaren “have a better feeling in the car” following their struggles at the venue last year.

After ending Thursday's first practice hour in sixth place, Norris went on to set the pace via a lap of 1m 33.602s in the day's second session, despite limited running amid two red flags owing to track maintenance.

Given that the Las Vegas Strip Circuit proved to be one of McLaren's most difficult tracks in 2024, Norris was pleased by how the MCL39 performed this time around on the opening day of action.

“[It's] always tricky here,” the Drivers' Championship leader said. “I think we have a better feeling in the car than what we had last year, so that's a positive, and that was felt I would say already from Lap 1 today.

“Some good feeling, of course not a lot of running in the end, not really any high-fuel running, but the pace clearly is there.”

However, Norris also acknowledged the fine margins at play between the team and their rivals in Las Vegas, adding: “I think it's pretty tight between a lot of people, and many people didn't even get their laps in.

“Apart from that, yeah, I think we made some steps forward from FP1 to FP2, and hopefully we can just do some more from FP2 to FP3.”

Pushed on what his expectations are for the rest of the weekend, the 26-year-old stated: “I mean, we're fighting for pole.”

Norris heads into the remainder of the event with a 24-point lead over McLaren team mate Oscar Piastri, while Red Bull's Max Verstappen is still in contention but further adrift by 49 points from Norris.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>2025 Las Vegas Grand Prix: Best race start onboards Max Verstappen kept himself in title contention with victory in the Las Vegas Grand Prix, while the McLaren pair of Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri were later disqualified from the results. Max Verstappen claimed an impressive victory in the Las Vegas Grand Prix, with the Dutchman denying Lando Norris in a race that later saw both Norris and McLaren team mate Oscar Piastri disqualified from the results. Norris also slipped behind George Russell and only re-passed the Mercedes driver in the latter stages but was unable to mount a challenge on Verstappen, eventually limping home nearly 21 seconds adrift after nursing a late problem. However, following the race it was confirmed that Norris – along with Piastri, who had originally taken fourth place – had been disqualified due to the rearmost skid wear on both cars being found to be below the minimum thickness required in the technical regulations. This promoted Russell – who had held on for the podium despite complaining of his own issues with his Mercedes' steering – up into P2 ahead of team mate Kimi Antonelli, the Italian having put in a fighting drive to finish fourth on-the-road after starting P17. The rookie had held off a charging Piastri and Charles Leclerc in the closing stages, but a five-second penalty for a false start dropped Antonelli behind Piastri in the classification, just one-tenth ahead of Leclerc who fell back in the final laps. While Piastri originally claimed P4 – having slipped as low as seventh at one stage in the early running after being hit by Liam Lawson's Racing Bulls in the opening turn – the Australian's DSQ, alongside that of his team mate, boosted Charles Leclerc to P4, the Monegasque having made an early charge from P9, with Carlos Sainz completing the top-five having put in a measured drive aboard his Williams from Isack Hadjar's Racing Bulls. Lawson was P14 after picking up damage on the second lap which required a pit stop, as Franco Colapinto's Alpine completed the classification of finishers. Alex Albon (Williams) retired having at one stage collided with the back of Hamilton which required a new front wing, while Gabriel Bortoleto (Sauber) and Lance Stroll (Aston Martin) both retired with damage after contact at Turn 1 on the opening lap. There was more significant contact further down in the pack, Bortoleto having sent it up the inside of several cars and eventually into the side of Stroll as both retired due to damage, with the incident earning the Brazilian a five-place grid penalty next time out, while Gasly was also sent into a spin before rejoining. Piastri's fightback was helped on the second lap as Lawson picked up damage and was forced to crawl back to the pits under a VSC, and once full racing speed resumed, Leclerc was on the move, passing Bearman for P7 into Turn 14. Out front, Russell began to challenge Verstappen for the lead of the race and the Mercedes driver found himself in the DRS zone for several laps before Verstappen eked out a margin of just over one second on Lap 8, extending that margin to 1.6s by Lap 11. Norris remained over 2s in arrears but well clear of Sainz, who was starting to be caught by Hadjar, Piastri and Leclerc, with Bearman, Alonso and Hulkenberg, on the hard tyre compared with the medium runners ahead, completing the top-10. Pushing to attack Hadjar ahead, a small lock-up into Turn 12 from Piastri allowed Leclerc a run down the back straight before completing the move into Turn 14 for P6 on Lap 12. It damaged the Williams' front wing and forced Albon to pit for repairs as well as being handed a five-second penalty for the incident. Russell, meanwhile, reported over the radio "steering again" as he dropped to 2s adrift of Verstappen by the start of Lap 15, with Mercedes team mate Antonelli handed a five-second penalty for a false start. The Italian had started outside the points in P17 but had already pitted to replace his soft tyres for hards as a VSC was briefly called to retrieve debris from Albon's front wing on the back straight on Lap 16. Russell pitted on the next tour from P2 for the same compound and rejoined in P7, several seconds behind Hadjar, while Norris, who had closed to within one second of Russell, was told to pick up the pace in free air and now found himself three seconds behind Verstappen. Out front, Verstappen had established a lead of three seconds by Lap 32 from Russell as Norris was quickly closing in behind, with Antonelli adrift in P4 from Piastri, Leclerc, Sainz, Hadjar, Hulkenberg and Hamilton. Norris was soon in DRS zone of Russell and told by his engineer to overtake in order to chase Verstappen for the lead, overtaking down the back straight before the brazing zone into Turn 14. The main focus turned to Piastri behind, who was challenging Antonelli for P4 but in turn was also coming under immense pressure from Leclerc. Antonelli's pace had been strong over the final stint, however, and meant he was classified ahead of Leclerc in the order by just one-tenth. Sainz capitalised on his strong Qualifying by finishing fifth, just 4s behind Leclerc and more than 10s clear of Hadjar. They were followed by Hulkenberg and Hamilton, both of whom had optimised their hard-medium strategy. Alonso, whose early pit stop put him down the pecking order, claimed 11th and put him just ahead of Tsunoda, who had started from the pits. Gasly recovered from his Turn 1 spin for P13 from Lawson and Alpine team mate Colapinto, as Albon, Bortoleto and Stroll were classified as retirements. "In the race I think everyone was just trying to find a rhythm and see how much you could push, especially in the first stint because being on the more fragile tyre," said Verstappen. "It worked really well, normally the race is always a tough one for us – we are normally not that great on tyres, but today it seemed like we had that a little bit more under control and I could push a little bit more and that unlocked a bit more pace. "I could stay out a bit longer and split basically the race in half. It definitely helped a lot and the car was working pretty well, much more to my liking and it was at the end quite a decent gap. It was just every lap feeling comfortable and not taking too much out of the tyre." For the next stop in a season-closing triple header of races, F1 will travel straight to Lusail for the Qatar Grand Prix from November 28-30.</p>
