                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In the latest in a string of violent crypto robberies, a four-person gang held a Canadian family hostage overnight and stole about $2 million CAD ($1.6 million USD) in Bitcoin. The crime occurred in April 2024, but the details of the scene were revealed last week in a sentencing report by a British Columbia judge, first reported by CBC. Tsz Wing Boaz Chan, a 35-year-old resident of Hong Kong, pleaded guilty to breaking and entering, unlawful confinement, and sexual assault. “After restraining the family, the men took their cell phones and laptop computers and demanded their PIN numbers and passwords,” wrote the judge. “They threatened to cut the family or kill them if their passwords and PIN numbers were not provided.” The incident follows a trend of physical attacks on people who own Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency. Earlier this year, David Balland, the cofounder of Paris-based crypto wallet firm Ledger, had his finger severed by kidnappers who demanded a ransom. In 2024, there were 24 physical attacks against crypto owners. That number has jumped to more than 60 so far in 2025. That is according to a list compiled by Jameson Lopp, a Bitcoin owner whose home was raided in 2017. Crypto transactions do not require the intervention of a bank for withdrawal, making investors a target for criminals seeking large sums of money. The four intruders asked for 200 Bitcoins, equivalent to about $26 million. They then lowered their demand to 100 Bitcoins. The father told the men that he had exaggerated the amount of his crypto earnings, and that he had lost money in a scam in 2018. They waterboarded, blindfolded, bounded, and gagged the mother. All three members of the family were taken to the hospital to be examined for injuries. Chan was arrested upon returning to Canada three months later and was sentenced to seven years in jail.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Client data at major U.S. banks including JPMorgan, Citi, and Morgan Stanley may have been exposed in a cyberattack on mortgage technology vendor SitusAMC, prompting Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin to comment on privacy as a practice of “hygiene.” The breach stemmed from unauthorized access to systems at SitusAMC, which confirmed Saturday that a threat actor had exfiltrated data tied to several large financial institutions. The breach prompted Buterin to argue that privacy should be treated as basic digital “hygiene” instead of being something optional. Buterin's response points back to a broader argument he has been making this year, where he frames privacy as a baseline requirement for digital systems instead of as an add-on. In an April essay, he outlined a path for Ethereum to support stealth addresses, selective disclosure, and application-level zero-knowledge tooling, aiming to reduce the kind of structural data exposure seen in both traditional finance and public blockchains. Shankar added that privacy "should be in the same category as patching servers or rotating keys: routine, non-negotiable, and built into the infrastructure, it should not be a premium feature added on later.” In October, the Ethereum Foundation launched a new privacy-focused cluster and released initial details about Kohaku, a privacy-centric browser wallet and software development kit developed by Nicolas Consigny and Buterin, who debuted it at EFDevcon in Argentina last week. “Privacy by default ensures that everyone benefits from strong cryptographic protections automatically, without needing to understand complex tooling or make conscious privacy decisions for each transaction,”  Quinten van Welzen, head of strategy and communications at Zano, a privacy-focused L1 blockchain, told Decrypt. Attention has also tracked for Zcash, a privacy-focused cryptocurrency designed to let users choose between transparent transactions and fully shielded transactions that hide the sender, receiver, and amount using zero-knowledge proofs. Last week, a Nasdaq-listed treasury firm bought more ZEC, pushing its stock 469% over the past month. Still, privacy as a principle has been embedded in crypto since its earliest days, especially in the context of its relationship with the traditional financial system.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>BlackRock might not be slowing down on its aggressive crypto deposits anytime soon, as data from on-chain monitoring firm Lookonchain shows that the firm has offloaded another massive amount of Bitcoin and Ethereum today. According to the data source, the leading asset management firm made another major deposit of 2,822 BTC and 36,283 ETH into Coinbase Prime on Monday, November 24. The move, which appears to be another of its repeated sell attempts, has sparked discussions across the crypto community. While the latest sell-off attempt has come at a time when the market is showing signs of a potential rebound as the rapid price correction slows down, it appears that BlackRock is not willing to pause its selling streak despite the market's green light. Just last week, BlackRock dumped over $2 billion in Bitcoin and Ethereum amid the market downturn. While the multiple series of offloads in Bitcoin and Ethereum lately suggest that BlackRock has embarked on a journey to steadily deflate its holdings, it is not certain if the firm will be taking a break soon. While the market appears to be experiencing a slow but gradual shift in market sentiment, Bitcoin has only seen a mild price dip of 0.57% over the last day, trading at $86,237 as of writing time. Ethereum, on the other hand, has slightly shifted to the green zone, showing a decent price surge of 0.34%, while its price is sitting at $2,828 as of writing time.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The move places one of Wall Street's oldest institutions into the growing field of XRP fund issuers, which already includes Bitwise, Grayscale and Canary Capital. It now manages ETFs tied to bitcoin (EZBC), ether (EZET), XRP (XRPZ), and its diversified digital asset fund (EZPZ), offering traditional investors exposure to a broader range of crypto assets without requiring self-custody. David Mann, Head of ETF Product and Capital Markets at Franklin Templeton, said in a statement Monday that XRP plays a "foundational role in global settlement infrastructure.” The rollout marks a significant turn in XRP's fortunes. Just five years ago, the token faced mass delistings from major exchanges after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued Ripple in late 2020. The agency alleged Ripple had sold XRP as an unregistered security since 2013. That lawsuit finally settled in August 2025, when Ripple agreed to pay the SEC a $125 million settlement without admitting wrongdoing. Since then, interest in XRP has rebounded, particularly as regulators have begun to outline clearer rules for digital assets. “Blockchain innovation is driving fast-growing businesses, and digital asset tokens like XRP serve as powerful incentive mechanisms that help bootstrap decentralized networks and align stakeholder interests,” said Roger Bayston, head of digital assets at Franklin Templeton. A surge in institutional and retail demand has pushed CME's crypto average daily volume up 132% year-over-year, with open interest climbing 82%.

Both ETFs, which are conversions from previous funds, began trading on NYSE Arca under tickers GDOG and GXRP, respectively. “With GDOG's uplisting on NYSE Arca, we're expanding investor exposure to a network that's fast, low-cost, and leveraged by thousands of users every day,” said Grayscale Senior Vice President of ETF Capital Markets Krista Lynch in a statement. Both funds will carry a  0% expense ratio for the first 3 months or until $1 billion is traded. Issuers frequently waive or set low fees to entice investors. Bloomberg ETF analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart estimate more than 100 crypto ETFs for various assets listing  over the next six months. Traditional market investors have not been shy in trading these new ETFs. Earlier this month, Canary Capital's XRP ETF generated more than $58 million in day-one trading volume, making it this year's strongest ETF debut.. Bitwise also offers a fund tracking the performance of the fourth largest crypto asset with a more than $125 billion market capitalization. There's also a growing list of products for those seeking more risk, with the debuts of leveraged ETFs for assets like Dogecoin, Bitcoin, and Ethereum hitting the markets in recent days. XRP is up around 1% in the last 24 hours, now changing hands at $2.07. The token is down around 43% from its July all-time high of $3.65. DOGE is down around 0.4% in the last 24 hours, trading at $0.14. The latest news, articles, and resources, sent to your inbox weekly.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tom Lee is buying the dip on Ethereum as its price keeps falling. On Monday, BitMine Immersion, the Bitcoin miner turned treasury company, announced it had scooped up another $200 million worth of Ethereum, bringing its total Ethereum holdings back to over $10 billion. “A few weeks ago, we noted the likely downside for ETH prices would be around $2,500 and current ETH prices are basically there,” BitMine chair Tom Lee, who in recent months has become one of Ethereum's most vocal backers, said in a release announcing the firm's latest purchase. In a November 3 interview on CNBC, he predicted Bitcoin could hit $200,000 and Ethereum $7,000 by the end of the year. “Bitcoin could still trade lower in the short term until a clear bullish catalyst emerges,” André Dragosch, Bitwise's European head of research, previously told DL News. My bias is toward $50,000,” Mike McGlone, a senior commodity strategist at Bloomberg Intelligence, said in a Sunday post on LinkedIn, the social media site. “Particularly if the S&P 500 has a third down year since 2008.” McGlone argues that the skyrocketing price of gold alongside falling oil prices and volatility in the stock market will turn investors away from riskier assets like cryptocurrencies. Elsewhere, BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes forecasts an extended period of lower prices for the top crypto, which could extend into the new year. The firm's Market to Net Asset Value, or mNAV, hovers at around 0.72, meaning that the value of its crypto holdings and cash is higher than its publicly traded market value. Such discounts often signal market pessimism, underperformance, or a lack of investor confidence in the company's strategy or management. After BitMine's latest purchase, its average price paid per Ethereum sits at $2,840, just under the asset's current price of $2,813. Tim Craig is DL News' Edinburgh-based DeFi Correspondent.</p>

The $1 trillion cryptocurrency wipeout has dealt a big blow to the president's wealth and that of his family in a year that was supposed to see crypto riding high on bullish support from the White House. According to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, the Trump family's wealth has dropped by $1 billion since September, from $7.7 billion to $6.7 billion, with losses fueled by the crash in crypto prices since bitcoin hit a record high on October 6. The token is now firmly in a bear market, down more than 30% from its high of around $126,000. Meanwhile, any trader who piled into the predient's meme coin in its early days has been burned badly if they're still holding on. Trump coin, launched shortly before the inauguration, has lost more than 90% of its value since peaking at $75.35 on January 19. American Bitcoin, a cryptocurrency mining firm backed by Trump's sons, began trading on the Nasdaq on September 3 and has seen its shares plunge 30% since then. Shares of the president's media company, which announced that it would implement a crypto treasury strategy earlier this year, have droppd 30% in the last month. It's been a brutal six weeks for the crypto market. Bitcoin's plunge may have leaked into stocks last week and fueled a wild roller coaster toward on Thursday as investors sold stocks to meet margin calls on leveraged bitcoin bets.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>holds above $85K as overall crypto sentiment improves, though volumes remain thin. Altcoins show mixed performance while traders watch today's Monad launch for potential rotation and fresh market catalysts. Many investors now ask if Monad will become the next 1000x crypto. The team has raised $225M since 2022 and attracted more than 75 development teams ready to deploy on day one. At launch, only 10.8% is unlocked: 7.5% from the Coinbase sale and 3.3% airdropped to roughly 225,000 early users. The Coinbase sale was available in over 80 countries with purchase limits ranging from $100 to $100,000. The most optimistic cases point above $0.060 if adoption, staking demand, and new exchange listings arrive quickly. Supporters praise the broad distribution and locked insider tokens as fair mechanics. Critics point to potential sell pressure from airdrop recipients and question the $2.5–$3Bn starting valuation. Early trading volume and real network usage in the coming weeks will reveal which view was closer to reality.

Meanwhile, another project is gaining attention in a very different corner of the market: Bitcoin's expanding Layer-2 ecosystem. ETF outflows and technical selling briefly pushed prices lower, but current conditions suggest Bitcoin could retest $90,000 if momentum continues.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Canadian country manager of crypto exchange Coinbase wants the federal minister of artificial intelligence (AI) and digital innovation, Evan Solomon, to add blockchain technology to his portfolio. The federal government has already moved quickly on legislation governing stablecoins, a digital asset, in response to industry demands. However, Lucas Matheson, CEO of Coinbase Canada, believes that Solomon's portfolio should include the technology underlying cryptocurrencies. AI and blockchain are related not just through their potential to transform existing industries, but by Canada's opportunity to assert its digital sovereignty, advocates like Matheson say. “We've asked that Evan Solomon expand his scope and mandate beyond artificial intelligence,” Matheson said in an interview with BetaKit. “If you think of AI as a decision-making tool, blockchain will form a trust layer underneath AI to move valuable data on the internet. Solomon is responsible for AI, digital innovation, and economic development in Southern Ontario. In an email to BetaKit, Sofia Ouslis, a spokesperson for Solomon's office, acknowledged that it had engaged with Coinbase and other companies in the digital economy. “In those conversations, they have shared perspectives on blockchain and stablecoins as part of their broader advocacy,” Ouslis wrote. “We routinely hear views from innovators across different sectors, but that doesn't mean those issues fall within our mandate.” Records show the US-based Coinbase Group has lobbied the direct deputy support to Solomon at Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada, as well as Finance Canada and the Bank of Canada, to promote blockchain tech and stablecoins. The movement on stablecoins and discussions around the role blockchain should play in finance and government come as Canada is increasingly focused on how it can assert its digital sovereignty. Advocates like John Ruffolo, founder of CCI and managing partner at Maverix Private Equity, have argued that Canada will be left at the mercy of a US-dominated payment system without sovereign payment rails for stablecoins. In an interview with BetaKit, Ruffolo said that allowing Canadian money to flow into a US-controlled stablecoin market is a threat to economic sovereignty. “Canada needs to build its own sovereign rails so that we do not lose control of stablecoins from a monetary policy perspective,” Ruffolo said. While Matheson has argued the technology already exists in Canada to move forward on stablecoins, he also framed the tech as an opportunity for sovereignty. “This is also a significant opportunity for our federal government to position Canada as a leader in the digital economy and increase the global demand for our dollar,” Matheson told BetaKit. The proposed Stablecoin Act, released earlier this week, requires issuers to maintain and manage adequate 1:1 or more asset reserves, establish redemption policies, implement risk management frameworks, and protect consumers' sensitive data, as well as national security safeguards. The act only regulates private company issuers of stablecoins, and it excludes banks. The legislation won't necessarily establish all stablecoins as payment instruments, as industry groups had demanded, and will only regulate the issuance of stablecoins. How the digital assets are used will determine whether they are considered payment instruments or securities, with more details to come from provincial securities regulators. The framework was developed to regulate fiat-backed stablecoins that function like cash, not investment vehicles.” The publication of record for Canadian tech and startup news since 2012.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Investors are paying closer attention to projects with real-world applications, and this sector is drawing significant interest. Low-cap altcoins within the Neobank narrative may be undervalued. It integrates DeFi features, including self-custody, yield-bearing accounts, and Visa/MasterCard crypto spending cards. According to a report from Precedence Research, the global neobanking market reached $148.93 billion in 2024. It is projected to grow at a CAGR of 40.29% and hit $4,396.58 billion in 2034. The second is a shift in investor mindset toward crypto projects with real-world utility rather than hype-driven valuations. “If stablecoin is to power Neobanks on-chain, then the current Web2 identity infra won't be able to keep up,” investor Mike S predicted. Coingecko indicates that the current Neobank category has a total market capitalization of $4.19 billion, comprising 13 major projects. Mantle leads with a market cap of $3.31 billion, followed by Ether.fi at $412 million. Additionally, Dune data indicate that physical card transaction volume from Web3 neobank projects reached a record high last month, surpassing $379 million. Although the transaction volume remains small, analysts believe its growth potential is huge. Meanwhile, the link between Web3 projects and traditional payment companies is becoming stronger. Crypto investors believe Neobanks will surge thanks to AI agents and blockchain privacy. Some experts go further and predict that Neobanks will become one of the key narratives shaping crypto trends in 2026. Despite optimistic predictions, Coingecko's top three Neobank projects — Mantle (MNT), ether.fi (ETHFI) and Plasma (XPL) — all experienced prolonged price declines in November. However, several low-cap altcoins with market caps below $100 million have recently attracted fresh capital and delivered strong performances. The project announced that Avici Card reached 100,000 transactions in November. It described the card as becoming a daily habit and part of users' everyday routines. Users can receive CYPR tokens as rewards for card-based transactions. Cypher aims to create an open economic model that drives growth among brands, service providers, online influencers, AI agents, and crypto card users. Alea Research recently highlighted several reasons for this view. Cypher processes payment value roughly twice its market cap. It also ranks second after EtherFi in card transaction volume. Low liquidity and limited listings on major CEXs have prevented significant price growth. Analysts believe the project could attract capital inflows similar to those of AVICI, potentially achieving a 10-fold increase. The development team includes talent with experience from MetaMask, Trust Wallet, DARPA, Flipside Crypto, Paxful, and Polygon. An advisor from AVICI also participates in the project. Machines-cash allows anonymous and secure Visa card payments. Users can transact using alias accounts that hide wallet addresses, transaction histories, and personal identities. This feature is especially attractive as interest in privacy continues to rise. Market sentiment remains gloomy, which will significantly affect the potential of low-cap projects. Moreover, as more crypto neobanks emerge, selecting truly high-quality projects becomes increasingly challenging. Jay Yu, a researcher at Pantera Capital, believes that retention, card transaction volume, and user count will determine the winners in this emerging market.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Trump family made their way into meme coins and cryptocurrency earlier this year and it appears to have backfired. Further from that, the volatility of cryptocurrency seems to be tied with Trump's approval rating, as Krugman notes a clear link between the administration's failures and the decline of digital currencies like Bitcoin. He explained in his Substack post, "Bitcoin's price surged after Donald Trump won last year, and its recent plunge coincides with a series of Trump political setbacks. So how should we understand Bitcoin's recent crash? But Trump's power is visibly diminishing, so the price of Bitcoin, which has in effect become a bet on Trumpism, has plunged." But when Trump looks weaker, as recent polling cited by Krugman suggests, the knock-on effect to cryptocurrencies heavily backed by the Trump administration and his family is clear. As Josh Marshall often emphasizes, power is unitary. A weakened Trump is less able to work his will on all fronts, including his efforts to promote crypto." Analysis from Bloomberg News suggests Trump and his family has dragged their estimated collective wealth from $7.7 billion in early September to $6.7 billion in November. Trump's power base appears to be weakening as the president faces resilience from a split GOP on issues of healthcare and economics.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Just as Mark Twain quipped that the report of his death “was an exaggeration,” it appears that reports about the demise of the U.S. dollar have also been exaggerated. However, amid the noise, antics, trade wars, and endless contradictions, Washington is quietly making moves to reinforce its dominance. In short, a push to “Make the Dollar Great Again” is underway. The administration is aggressively developing the stablecoin market — a type of cryptocurrency with a stable value that serves as an alternative payment system to traditional currency — almost all of which are pegged to the U.S. dollar. This boom, which has already reached astronomical figures, represents a new form of indirect dollarization. Meanwhile, as the Financial Times reported earlier this month, senior government officials have explored the possibility of encouraging other countries to adopt the dollar, as Ecuador and El Salvador did 25 years ago, and have held meetings to that effect with various experts, including Steve Hanke, a veteran inflation and currency specialist at Johns Hopkins, known in some circles as the “Money Doctor.” Hanke confirmed the meeting to EL PAÍS, which took place precisely amid turbulence in Argentina, while emphasizing — as the government did when the information first emerged — that no decisions have been made yet. “While the Trump administration has a well-articulated policy on dollar-based stablecoins, it still needs to establish a more comprehensive strategy to promote the use of the dollar,” he said. Stablecoins are virtual currencies, like all cryptocurrencies, but designed to maintain a less volatile value and are pegged to a specific asset. By 2028, some reports suggest that this market could reach $3 trillion. Washington has been very explicit about its expectations for the new currency. This refers to the lower cost at which the United States can finance its massive debt, which exceeds 120% of its gross domestic product (GDP). The country already pays more in debt interest than it does on Defense. And stablecoins are backed by Treasury bonds. How strong is the dollar's dominance today? That nearly 60% is indeed a notable dominance, but it pales in comparison to the 1970s, when it exceeded 80%, and it also represents the lowest level in the past two decades. Its preeminence has eroded, and while Trump has played with fire on trade, this does not mean that any currency could realistically dethrone the dollar in the foreseeable future. People are afraid to trust their money to the Chinese, whose authorities maintain strict controls on moving capital in and out of the country. Europe is too fragmented to challenge the dollar; it needs more unified banking, financial, and tax systems, with a large central budget and a single Treasury, like in the United States […] When this happens, the dollar will face real competition.” If you also don't get on the stablecoin wave, you're going to be left far behind in the global payments system market.” Beyond virtual currencies, there are other ways to promote the use of dollars, explains Steve Hanke. One is what is known as a “currency board,” in which the national currency is issued and exchanged at a fixed rate with the dollar and fully backed by it. Drawing on his experience with projects such as the dollarization programs in Montenegro (1999) and Ecuador (2000), among others, Hanke advocates for a policy that addresses all three possibilities. In his view, this would not only provide an advantage for the United States, but also for the countries that adopt it. For Gagnon, dollarization represents “an act of desperation” by some economies, one that is “difficult to reverse,” and he doubts that any country will pursue it. In some countries, it has served as a form of discipline and helped control inflation, but it also means adopting the Federal Reserve's monetary policy and restricts countries' ability to handle crises. The president of the European Central Bank (ECB), Christine Lagarde, has warned against the rise of these cryptocurrencies, which are particularly attractive for enabling faster and cheaper international transactions. “These assets are not always able to maintain their fixed value,” she said last June in a hearing before the European Parliament. She also cautioned that a potential shift from banks to stablecoins in deposits used for savings and payments “could adversely affect the transmission of monetary policy through banks,” meaning that central bank measures could have a diminished effect on the real economy. “The changing landscape [referring to Trump's protectionist turn] could open the door for the euro to play a greater international role,” she said just a month earlier in Berlin. While tariff policies and the push for dollar-backed stablecoins may seem inconsistent with each other, they serve a common purpose: both help finance the fiscal deficit. Moreover, crypto could make the Trump family, which has heavily invested in it, immensely wealthy.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Campaigners including Good Law Project describe ICO ‘collapse in enforcement activity' after Afghan data breach Dozens of civil liberties campaigners and legal professionals are calling for an inquiry into the UK's data protection watchdog, after what they describe as “a collapse in enforcement activity” after the scandal of the Afghan data breach. A total of 73 academics, senior lawyers, data protection experts and organisations including Statewatch and the Good Law Project, have written a letter to Chi Onwurah, the chair of the cross-party Commons science, innovation and technology committee, coordinated by Open Rights Group, calling for an inquiry to be held into the office of the information commissioner, John Edwards. They warn of “deeper structural failures” beyond that data breach. “However, in a recent public hearing hosted by your committee, Commissioner John Edwards has shown unwillingness to reconsider his approach to data protection enforcement, even in face of the most serious data breach that has ever occurred in the UK.” But they say the ICO has applied its “public sector approach” in these cases and either issued reprimands – written notices that lack the force of law – or significantly lowered the monetary penalties it awarded. “The ICO decision not to pursue any formal action against the MoD despite their repeated failures was extraordinary, as was its failure to record its decision making. “Parliament has given the ICO considerable powers not to politely hope for the best, but to enforce compliance with legally binding orders. The letter concludes: “Change appears to be unlikely unless the Science, Innovation and Technology Committee uses their oversight powers and steps in.” We also welcome our opportunities to account for our work when speaking to and appearing before the DSIT select committee.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>An armed thief posing as a delivery worker invaded a San Francisco home, tied up the homeowner, and stole the victim's cellphone, laptop, and $11 million worth of cryptocurrency over the weekend, according to a report. The brazen heist occurred around 6:45 a.m. on Saturday at a home in San Francisco's Mission Dolores neighborhood, according to a police report obtained by the San Francisco Chronicle. It's unclear if the victim was injured or if any arrests have been made following the incident. Additional details about the suspect and the heist were not released by cops.The San Francisco Police Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment from The Post. The robbery comes amid a rise in violent kidnappings and attempted robberies of crypto investors. In March, a group of burglars attempted to steal cryptocurrency from the home of influencer Amouranth, whose real name is Kaitlyn Siragusa. In May, crypto bros John Woeltz, 37, and William Duplessie, 33, were accused of kidnapping and torturing an Italian millionaire, Michael Valentino Teofrasto Carturan, inside a New York City townhouse for his Bitcoin password. The digital currency is much harder to trace than dollars, and considerably easier for thieves to launder. “Kidnappings of crypto investors are definitely on the rise,” Steve Krystek, CEO of PFC Safeguards, a personal security company, previously told The Post. “A lot of the people who come into this money are flashy, and they're signaling that they have wealth.”</p>
