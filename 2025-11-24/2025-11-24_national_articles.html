                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>• Talks continue: US President Donald Trump says “something good just may be happening” following talks in Geneva yesterday on a plan to end Russia's war in Ukraine. Meanwhile, EU leaders promised a united, coordinated position in support of Ukraine. • “Fluid” deadline: Washington said the Ukrainians believe the current draft amendment of Trump's 28-point proposal “reflects their national security interests.” US Secretary of State Marco Rubio indicated the Thursday deadline set by Trump for Ukraine to accept it is fluid. “There are elements of this the Russians certainly won't agree to. But the Russians have every incentive to play this along,” Jeffrey Edmonds, former director for Russia at the National Security Council, told CNN on Monday. Asked what could push Russia toward some form of peace agreement, Edmonds said, “you have to change the Kremlin's calculus on whether or not they can achieve their goals in Ukraine … That is the only thing that's ultimately going to bring them to the table.” President Donald Trump said Monday that he discussed Ukraine and Russia in a “very good telephone call” with Chinese leader Xi Jinping on Monday. “I just had a very good telephone call with President Xi, of China. We discussed many topics including Ukraine/Russia, Fentanyl, Soybeans and other Farm Products, etc,” the president wrote on Truth Social. “Our relationship with China is extremely strong!” the president posted, adding, “We agreed that it is important that we communicate often, which I look forward to doing.” The pair met late last month in South Korea, where Trump said they came to an agreement on “almost everything.” Following that meeting, Trump said he would visit China in April and that Xi would visit the US. We're seeing more reactions from around Europe as discussions about US President Donald Trump's 28-point-plan for peace in Ukraine continue. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz promised Germany's unrelenting support to Ukraine in a statement which also backed Ukraine's right to defend itself moving forward. This means that Ukraine must not be forced to make unilateral territorial concessions,” he said. Speaking to reporters, UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer signaled talks are moving in the right direction, but was clear more work must be done. Estonian Prime Minister Kristen Michal said on X that while Ukraine is committed to “just and lasting” peace, Russian President Vladimir Putin's “imperial goals” remain unchanged. He said allies “must increase pressure” on Moscow, before suggesting the immediate use of frozen Russian assets, a stronger sanctions package and EU tariffs were needed. Latvian Foreign Minister Baiba Braže said on social media that Putin is the only person standing between Trump and peace in Ukraine, and Russia is “buying time for further atrocities and has no interest in lasting peace at all.” Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson echoed the Latvian foreign minister, highlighting that while many nations work “tirelessly” towards a sustainable peace in Ukraine, Russia's overnight attack on Kharkiv suggested Putin is not taking peace talks seriously. Ukraine has managed to step back from the brink of another Trump-fuelled crisis. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio emerged from talks on Sunday calling it “probably the most productive day we have had on this issue, maybe in the entirety of our engagement.” And yet, cut through the diplo-PR and Ukraine, while perhaps in a slightly stronger position than it was when it received the 28-point “peace plan” on Friday, is arguably weaker than it was before we knew of the document's existence. Just last week Kyiv openly announced it had fired US-made long-range ATACMS missiles at Russia. New US sanctions on Russia's biggest oil giants took effect. And the US agreed to sell Ukraine an upgrade package for its patriot missile-defence system. Now, instead of discussing Ukraine's battlefield needs with allies, or shoring up his domestic position, after a massive corruption scandal, Zelensky is reduced, once again, to playing along with Washington's spin (he called the talks “substantive”), while re-explaining what exactly he is fighting for. “Putin wants legal recognition to what he has stolen, to break the principle of territorial integrity and sovereignty,” Zelensky told the Swedish parliament in a virtual address Monday morning. And Europe, seemingly also blindsided by this peace plan, has failed to coalesce around an alternative. Several versions of a European counterproposal were floating around on Sunday, all of which removed (among other things) specific clauses on Ukrainian territorial concessions. “I don't think anyone cares about Europe,” said Russian MP and journalist Evgeny Popov in written comments to CNN Monday. US President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping discussed the war in Ukraine in a phone call on Monday, according to Chinese state news agency Xinhua. A senior White House official told CNN earlier that Trump and Xi also spoke about trade. The European counter-proposal to the United States' 28-point peace plan to end the war in Ukraine “at first glance, is completely unconstructive and doesn't suit us,” Kremlin foreign policy aide Yury Ushakov said Monday, according to Russian state media. The initial 28-point plan has faced criticism for appearing to favor Russia. When President Donald Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff and son-in-law Jared Kushner went to Tel Aviv in October, they received a heroes' welcome from Israelis. While Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and members of his government were quite happy, indeed keen, to keep fighting in Gaza, most in Israel were not. Ukraine may be losing ground on the battlefield, but its army is not about to collapse. Power supplies across the country may be interrupted, but Ukrainians are used to it, and energy rationing is predictable. Zelensky may be damaged by a corruption scandal lapping worryingly close to his door, but he has not been personally implicated, and his approval ratings – while lower than those he enjoyed in the war's early stages – remain pretty good. “The public appetite is not there for these huge concessions as they are presented in the (American) plan,” says Orysia Lutsevych of London's Chatham House think-tank. “I cannot describe enough how skeptical generally Ukrainian people are about the plan,” Andriy Zagorodnyuk, who now acts as an adviser to the Ukrainian government, told CNN's Kim Brunhuber on CNN Newsroom Monday, “Nobody is taking it as something which can help.” You will lose US intelligence…You wouldn't do that with a good plan, right? “The biggest fear is that it will be pushed on Ukraine…imposed on Ukraine with some sort of enormous diplomatic, and perhaps economic, pressure,” Zagorodnyuk added. EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Kaja Kallas welcomed discussions around US President Donald Trump's 28-point peace proposal but warned that pressure must not be taken off Russia in the pursuit for lasting peace. “We should be discussing how Russia will not invade again and how Russia can stop this war, and not what Ukraine should give up because there is one victim and one aggressor in this war.” While Zelensky had hitherto been skeptical about ceasefire proposals, seeing them primarily as short-term games played by Russia, henceforth he became an avowed advocate. With Russia making gains on the battlefield, a ceasefire along current lines could have obvious appeal to Kyiv. For Moscow, though, it is “root causes” that need to come first, which is shorthand for Ukraine's subordination to effective Russian control. The Trump administration's 28-point proposal to end the war in Ukraine – which officials say is still being worked on as talks continue – has been criticized as highly favorable to Russia. Meanwhile, the European counterproposal, obtained by Reuters and confirmed to CNN to be accurate by European sources, is much more in line with Ukraine's wishes. On territorial concessions: The US plan says that Luhansk, Donetsk and occupied Crimea will all be recognized as de facto Russian, including by the United States. It also says that Kherson and Zaporizhzhia will be frozen along the line of contact. The text reads: “Ukraine commits not to recover its occupied sovereign territory through military means. Negotiations on territorial swaps will start from the Line of Contact.” The European plan suggests that the Ukrainian military is “capped at 800,000 in peacetime.” On both drafts, Russia's far larger army is not asked to make cuts. On future elections: The US draft also calls for Ukraine to hold elections within 100 days of a sealed agreement – something that analysts say would be an impractically short window to allow for campaigning. Some context: It's worth noting that there are several other versions of the European text that have been reported in American and British news outlets, which differ from the copy Reuters obtained. The US 28-point plan may also have evolved since its original version following top leaders' discussions in Geneva. Kira Rudik, a member of Ukraine's Parliament, said that ceding land to Russia is a red line for Ukraine, but she said she's cautiously optimistic about President Donald Trump's peace plan to end the war because it mentions security guarantees. Asked by CNN's John Berman if she could ever vote on to a peace plan that included ceding land, such as the Donbas region to Russia, and a cap on military, Rudik said it would be “incredibly hard because some of the points that you mentioned go against Ukraine's constitution. However, we need to learn more about what do these security guarantees mean, and are they actually executable?” Rudik said. This could mean that Kremlin was referencing the US' original 28-point proposal, which puts forward demands Ukraine views as a red line, including asking Kyiv to cede territory, limit its military's size, and promise not to join NATO in exchange for an end to the war. In a separate statement, the Turkish Presidency said that Erdogan told Putin that his country is “ready to contribute today, as we have in the past, to all diplomatic initiatives and plans that will facilitate direct contacts between the parties and pave the way for lasting peace in our region as well.” Some context: Russian and Ukrainian delegates have previously met in Istanbul for various rounds of direct peace talks, though these ended with little progress regarding an end to the war. We've also been hearing from NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, who's said there are “many good elements” in the US plan to end Russia's war in Ukraine — but cautioned that some other elements still needed to be worked out. “I don't want to go through the plan line-by-line, particularly because it is now under debate,” Rutte said on Fox News today. “It always takes two to tango,” Rutte said of Russia's absence from the discussions. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has just posted to X, confirming that his country's delegation is now returning home from talks with US representatives in Geneva, Switzerland, adding that he is expecting a “full report” on the progress of peace negotiations by this evening. We will continue coordinating with Europe and other partners around the world. We count on achieving the necessary results, and I thank everyone who stands with Ukraine,” he said. “I am grateful for the advice and support – Norway, as always, is helping,” he said. • US President Donald Trump has said this morning that “something good just may be happening” regarding a plan to end the war in Ukraine, hinting at “big progress” in a post on Truth Social. • Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Ukraine will continue to work closely with US and European leaders on the proposed plan, after a day of intense talks in Geneva yesterday. • European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the Geneva talks between US and Ukrainian officials established a “solid basis for moving forward” in peace negotiations. • Meanwhile, more than 60,000 households in the Ukrainian regions of Dnipropetrovsk and Kharkiv were left without power after Russian attacks overnight. The US-drafted proposal to end the war in Ukraine includes many ideas that have previously been put forward and rejected in earlier peace negotiations. The 28-point plan put forward by Trump puts pressure on Kyiv to cede territory, limit the size of its military and promise not to join NATO in exchange for an end to the war, all long-standing Kremlin demands as Putin presses forward with his maximalist war aims. The US proposal calls for Ukraine to surrender key territories in the Donbas region of Eastern Ukraine that Russia has illegally annexed but not captured – a longstanding red line for Kyiv. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has previously rejected Russia's calls for Ukraine to surrender the eastern Donbas region in exchange for some Russian-held parts of the southern Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions. The European Union also laid out three of its red lines on Sunday. First, Ukraine's “borders cannot be changed by force,” European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said in a statement on Sunday, as top US and European officials held talks in Geneva, Switzerland. “Second, as a sovereign nation, there cannot be limitations on Ukraine's armed forces that would leave the country vulnerable to future attack and thereby also undermining European security,” von der Leyen added. Ukraine must have the freedom and sovereign right to choose its own destiny. They have chosen a European destiny,” the EU chief concluded, adding that starts with Ukraine's reconstruction and integration into Europe's single market and defense industrial base. CNN's Svitlana Vlasova, Catherine Nicholls and Kara Fox contributed to this report. “We want the war to end more than anybody, that's for sure. However, we have not heard any details of what was agreed upon,” Sovsun told Rosemary Church on CNN Newsroom today, adding that uncertainty around whether the Russians will accept Ukraine's conditions is also contentious. “If we look at the initial 28-point-plan, it starts with a point of there is respect for Ukraine's sovereignty. “Like deciding on its own foreign policy, because it does set up limitation of Ukraine not joining NATO. Sovsun said she'd like to see Ukraine's allies transform their “supportive words” into tangible actions, including using their leverage when it comes to the discussions happening around Russian assets and reparation loans. “Right now, America doesn't seem to be leading the way. And that is what we need to be talking to Donald Trump about,” Sovsun said before adding, “At this point I wouldn't, bet my life or anything on the fact that that there will be a peace deal made by the end of this week.” European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has just been speaking to reporters on the sidelines of an informal EU meeting. Coordination between European countries and a “strong European presence” at the talks “has allowed us to make good progress in the negotiations for just and lasting peace in Ukraine,” von der Leyen said. There is now a solid basis for moving forward,” she added, urging countries to “remain united” and “keep placing Ukraine's best interests at the center of our efforts.” These are our core European principles moving forward,” she added, stressing that Ukraine's “territory and sovereignty must be respected.” More than 60,000 households in the Dnipropetrovsk region were affected by the lack of power, Ukrenergo, Ukraine's state-owned grid operator, said in a statement. Another 10,000 homes in the Kharkiv region were also without energy, it said. For context: Read our analysis here on how Russian forces are exploiting their manpower advantage to edge forward in multiple parts of Ukraine. Russian attacks on Ukraine's energy grid are a regular occurrence. Since late September, strikes on key power infrastructure have taken place almost daily, depriving Ukrainians of energy and heat ahead of the bitter winter months. Emergency repair work is continuing “wherever security conditions allow,” Ukrenergo said in its statement today.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Colombian authorities say 17 minors linked to an extremist ultra-orthodox Jewish sect were rescued late Saturday in Antioquia in northern Colombia. BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) — Immigration authorities in Colombia have taken 17 children into protective custody after they were rescued from an ultra-Orthodox Jewish sect whose members have been accused of sexually abusing and kidnapping minors in several countries. Gloria Esperanza Arriero, the director of Colombia's national immigration service, told The Associated Press on Monday that her agency questioned nine members of the Lev Tahor sector during a hotel inspection Sunday. She said that the group of 17 children and nine adults arrived in Colombia during the last week of October, and were staying in a hotel in the small northwestern city of Yarumal while they searched for a rural property they could use to start up a new site in the South American country. Arriero said that there were Interpol yellow notices for five children in the group, who have American and Guatemalan passports. The notices are global alerts issued for people who have been reported as missing or those considered victims of parental or criminal abduction. “The positive thing in all of this is that we got to the children before they had a compound,” Arriero said. “Because in that case, we would have required a search warrant.” In Colombia, immigration officials can conduct searches in hotels and check whether foreigners staying there have entered the country legally, or are wanted by law enforcement agencies. Last year police in Guatemala raided a Lev Tahor compound in the Central American country, following reports of sexual abuse, taking at least 160 minors and 40 women into protective custody. In 2022, Mexican authorities arrested a leader of the sect near the Guatemalan border and removed a number of women and children from their compound. Lev Tahor is known to have members in Canada, the United States, Mexico, Guatemala and Israel. Follow AP's coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america</p>

If ever there were a time for a Kumbaya moment between the two biggest college fan bases in the state of Utah, it would be now. But wouldn't it be neat if both sides could step back, show a little Beehive State pride and appreciate what the other side is doing on the football field this year? (Apologies to BYU and Utah fans who spit out their coffee while reading that sentence.) Utah's other loss was to, well, you know who. Still, this could turn out to be the best collective season for the schools in their more than 100 years of gridiron pursuits. The standard, to date, is 2008 when Utah beat Alabama in the Sugar Bowl to finish 13-0 and No. This year, if Utah wins one more game, both schools would have double-digit victories in the same season for the first time since 2021 and fifth time ever. BYU will lock up a spot next week in the Big 12 championship game if it beats UCF at home Saturday. The Cougars could still get in even if they lose. Their first College Football Playoff bid is at stake if they can get to Arlington, Texas, and win, probably in a rematch with Texas Tech. Think you know who belongs in the Top 25? Now it's your turn to vote with the AP Top 25 fan poll. Utah, which finishes the regular season at Kansas, was No. 12 in the CFP rankings last week and could get docked for needing a Houdini act to get past a Kansas State team that rushed for 472 yards. The Utes are all but out of the Big 12 race and their CFP hopes are teetering, but an attractive bowl is there for the taking. Lifelong Utahan Dick Harmon knows as well as anyone that the fan bases' mutual disdain will never evolve into mutual respect. Harmon graduated from BYU and has covered Cougars sports for four decades for the Deseret News of Salt Lake City. He said there are good fans on both sides but they are drowned out by those who spew hatred. “Utah fans lost to BYU but they certainly feel because they're scoring a million points a game that they should be right there, if not even ahead, of BYU. Their loss to BYU was close and maybe a fluke and should have gone the other way the last two years. It's just back and forth all the time.” Harmon, channeling BYU fans' take on Utah, said, “Geez, look, you gave up a school-record (472) yards rushing to a bad Kansas State team. And we beat you and it should have been 24-14 or 17, not 24-21, if only this, if only that. For their part, Utah State fans are quietly enjoying what potentially will be their best season since the Aggies went 11-3 in 2021. And in case you were wondering if the Aggies, Cougars and Utes have ever been ranked at the same time, it happened once. Oregon coach Dan Lanning took a not-so-veiled shot at the SEC in his remarks following the Ducks' 42-27 win over Southern California. While Oregon and the rest of the Big Ten were in the throes of conference games, three SEC teams played FCS opponents and three played Group of Five opponents. The SEC will begin playing nine conference games rather than eight next year. “We didn't play Chattanooga State today, right? “That being said, it's tough playing nine conference games. And we got to take advantage of playing a good team today and attacking that.” Last year, Tennessee went to Nashville needing a win over Vanderbilt to secure a CFP at-large bid. This week, the Commodores go to Knoxville needing a win over Tennessee to keep alive its CFP at-large hopes. Vandy also would secure its first 10-win season with a victory. Coach Clark Lea said he wants his team thinking only about the Volunteers, not what it will take to get a playoff spot. Lea did offer a tell about what he's thinking when he was asked about quarterback Diego Pavia asking to stay in the game against Kentucky after it turned into a blowout Saturday. “I said, ‘No, we're aiming for a championship. I want you healthy for the playoffs.' 1 Ohio State's 15-game win streak is longest in the Bowl Subdivision. The Buckeyes have held seven of their 11 opponents this season under 10 points. 2 Texas A&M, with its 48-0 win over Samford, finished 7-0 at home for the first time. It was the first time A&M, excluding the 2020 pandemic season, was unbeaten at home since going 6-0 in 1999. ... Notre Dame RB Jeremiyah Love is just the third player since 1996 to run for 170 or more yards and three touchdowns on just eight carries. Love, who had 178 yards and three TDs against Syracuse, is the first to do it since Cincinnati's Desmond Ridder against SMU in 2020. AP Sports Writer Teresa M.

President Donald Trump issued a Truth Social post in which he characterized his phone call with Chinese President Xi Jinping on Monday as "very good." "I just had a very good telephone call with President Xi, of China. We discussed many topics including Ukraine/Russia, Fentanyl, Soybeans and other Farm Products, etc. We have done a good, and very important, deal for our Great Farmers — and it will only get better. Our relationship with China is extremely strong! This call was a follow up to our highly successful meeting in South Korea, three weeks ago. Since then, there has been significant progress on both sides in keeping our agreements current and accurate. "To that end, President Xi invited me to visit Beijing in April, which I accepted, and I reciprocated where he will be my guest for a State Visit in the U.S. later in the year. We agreed that it is important that we communicate often, which I look forward to doing. Thank you for your attention to this matter!" U.S. President Donald Trump greets Chinese President Xi Jinping ahead of a bilateral meeting at Gimhae Air Base on Oct. 30, 2025 in Busan, South Korea. "President Xi outlined China's principled position on the Taiwan question. He underscored that Taiwan's return to China is an integral part of the post-war international order," the ministry noted. Chinese President Xi Jinping speaks during an international business meeting at The Great Hall Of The People on March 28, 2025 in Beijing, China. Many in the U.S. take a hawkish view toward China, which has been a growing military and economic power on the global stage.

At the edge of California's Mojave Desert, the Mountain Pass mine looks like any other stretch of dust and rock. But for decades, this lonely pit supplied the world with the rare-earth elements that make modern technology — and modern warfare — possible. The ore pulled from its depths yielded neodymium, lanthanum and cerium — metals that powered radar systems, early computer chips and the guidance of precision munitions. At its peak, the mine met nearly two-thirds of global demand. As environmental rules tightened and global prices collapsed under China's state-subsidized production, the U.S. abandoned what had once been its mineral lifeline. And the world's most powerful economy became dependent on a rival for the elements essential to its defense. At the edge of California's Mojave Desert, the Mountain Pass mine looks like any other stretch of dust and rock. But for decades, this lonely pit supplied the world with the rare-earth elements that make modern technology — and modern warfare — possible. Just as Arab nations turned oil wealth into global power, Beijing recognized the leverage it could gain by dominating the materials modern industry would only grow more dependent on. Four decades later, that foresight has paid off. China now controls roughly 70 percent of global rare-earth mining and nearly 90 percent of refining — the most strategic and profitable step in the chain. In the early 1990s, a General Motors subsidiary called Magnaquench was producing 85 percent of the magnets used in precision-guided missiles and other defense systems. When GM sold the company in 1995 to a consortium that included two Chinese entities, the consequences were immediate. Within a year, the entire product line had been replicated in China, and the U.S. had lost its magnet-making process almost overnight. Abigail Hunter, executive director of the Ambassador Alfred Hoffman Jr. Center for Critical Mineral Strategy at SAFE, said the sale represented more than a bad deal — it was a strategic surrender. "We were focused on the internet and globalization, not on where our materials were coming from," she said. While Washington debated environmental rules and trade policy, China moved aggressively. "The United States had Mountain Pass and a few other capabilities tied to companies like GM," said Wade Senti, president of Advanced Magnet Lab. "But our total capacity was under 2,000 metric tons a year. Meanwhile, China poured money into innovation, refining and manufacturing at a scale that far exceeded what we ever had." The ore pulled from its depths, pictured above, yielded neodymium, lanthanum and cerium — metals that powered radar systems, early computer chips and the guidance of precision munitions. "Between market forces and environmental restrictions … it's certainly led to a constraint with extracting resources," Senti said. Rare-earth elements now underpin nearly every modern weapons system. Washington's complacency cracked this spring when Beijing briefly restricted exports of rare-earth products — a warning shot that rippled through supply chains from Detroit to the Pentagon. "When China required export licenses, some U.S. factory lines literally stopped," Hunter said. "The administration scrambled to negotiate with Beijing and simultaneously rolled out emergency support for MP Materials, the operator of Mountain Pass." That deal marked a turning point: for the first time, the federal government backed an entire supply chain — from mine to magnet — using every tool at its disposal. Grants, loans, price supports and guaranteed purchases were deployed to jump-start domestic production. MP Materials, which resumed mining at Mountain Pass in 2018 and ramped up refining to record levels before the Pentagon deal, is now expanding its magnet manufacturing facility in Texas. Another U.S. manufacturer in South Carolina has also begun producing magnets. The Trump administration has put the U.S. on a wartime footing for decoupling with China, taking a 15 percent stake in MP Materials in an unprecedented arrangement and pushing a wave of international critical-minerals agreements meant to cut Beijing out of key supply chains. Over the past year, Washington has signed multi-billion dollar partnerships across five continents — including a $10 billion package of new projects announced this fall. A landmark framework with Australia commits both nations to co-invest roughly $1 billion each in rare-earth and battery-metal ventures, while parallel agreements with Japan and South Korea focus on securing non-Chinese refining and magnet production. China now controls roughly 70 percent of global rare-earth mining and nearly 90 percent of refining — the most strategic and profitable step in the chain. The administration has also turned to Africa, signing deals with Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo to trace and develop mineral supply routes, and to Ukraine, where a 2025 reconstruction fund gives U.S. companies preferred access to future mining projects. Yet even as the U.S. forges alliances abroad, officials warn that true security will hinge on what happens at home. Under a 2027 mandate, the Pentagon must build a fully domestic rare-earth supply chain for defense production — from mine to magnet — that avoids Chinese inputs entirely. Meeting that goal will require more than foreign partnerships: it means breaking through America's own permitting gridlock, financing new refineries and rebuilding a skilled workforce that vanished when the industry collapsed two decades ago. Both Hunter and Senti see the next few years as decisive. The same materials that once powered America's Cold War innovation now underpin China's economic and military strength. "We can't keep pretending it's someone else's problem while importing everything." "There's a lot of work to do," he said. In the Mojave Desert, the trucks at Mountain Pass are running again — small symbols of a nation trying to reclaim what it lost.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Jimmy Cliff, the reggae pioneer and actor who preached joy, defiance and resilience in such classics as “Many Rivers to Cross,” “You Can Get it If You Really Want” and starred in the landmark movie “The Harder They Come,” has died. Jamaican musician, singer and actor Jimmy Cliff performs during the Timbre Rock and Roots concert on Friday March 22, 2013 in Singapore. Singer Jimmy Cliff performs at The Climate Rally, an Earth Day concert, on the National Mall in Washington, on Sunday, April 25, 2010. NEW YORK (AP) — Jimmy Cliff, the charismatic reggae pioneer and actor who preached joy, defiance and resilience in such classics as “Many Rivers to Cross,” “You Can Get it If You Really Want” and “Vietnam” and starred in the landmark movie “The Harder They Come,” has died at 81. His family posted a message Monday on his social media sites that he died from a “seizure followed by pneumonia.” Additional information was not immediately available. “He really appreciated each and every fan for their love.” Cliff was a native Jamaican with a spirited tenor and a gift for catchphrases and topical lyrics who joined Kingston's emerging music scene in his teens and helped lead a movement in the 1960s that included such future stars as Bob Marley, Toots Hibbert and Peter Tosh. By the early 1970s, he had accepted director Perry Henzell's offer to star in a film about an aspiring reggae musician, Ivanhoe “Ivan” Martin, who turns to crime when his career stalls. “Ivanhoe was a real-life character for Jamaicans,” Cliff told Variety in 2022, upon the film's 50th anniversary. “When I was a little boy, I used to hear about him as being a bad man. No one in Jamaica, at that time, had guns. However, being a hero was the manner in which Perry wanted to make his name — an anti-hero in the way that Hollywood turns its bad guys into heroes.” “The Harder They Come,” delayed for some two years because of sporadic funding, was the first major commercial release to come out of Jamaica. It sold few tickets in its initial run, despite praise from Roger Ebert and other critics. For a brief time, Cliff rivaled Marley as the genre's most prominent artist. “You Can Get it If You Really Want” and the title song were calls for action and vows of final payments: “The harder they come, the harder they fall, one and all.” Cliff otherwise lets out a weary cry on “Many Rivers to Cross,” a gospel-style testament that he wrote after confronting racism in England in the 1960s. I came to England with very big hopes, and I saw my hopes fading,” he told Rolling Stone in 2012. Cliff's career peaked with “The Harder They Come,” but, after a break in the late 1970s, he worked steadily for decades, whether session work with the Rolling Stones or collaborations with Wyclef Jean, Sting and Annie Lennox among others. The Sandinistas in Nicaragua used “You Can Get it If You Really Want” as a campaign theme and Bruce Springsteen helped expand Cliff's U.S. audience with his live cover of the reggae star's “Trapped,” featured on the million-selling charity album from 1985, “We Are the World.” Others performing his songs included John Lennon, Cher and UB40. In 2010, Cliff was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. He was born James Chambers in suburban Saint James and, like Ivan Martin in “The Harder They Come,” moved to Kingston in his youth to become a musician. In the early 1960s, Jamaica was gaining its independence from Britain and the early sounds of reggae — first called ska and rocksteady — were catching on. Calling himself Jimmy Cliff, he had a handful of local hits, including “King of Kings” and “Miss Jamaica,” and, after overcoming the kinds of barriers that upended Martin, was called on to help represent his country at the 1964 World's Fair in New York City. “It came from the need for recognition, identity and respect.” He had a hit with a cover of Cat Stevens' “Wild World,” and reached the top 10 in the UK with the uplifting “Wonderful World, Beautiful People.” Cliff's widely heard protest chant, “Vietnam,” was inspired in part by a friend who had served in the war and returned damaged beyond recognition. His success as a recording artist and concert performer led Henzell to seek a meeting with him and flatter him into accepting the part: “You know, I think you're a better actor than singer,” Cliff remembered him saying. Aware that “The Harder They Come” could be a breakthrough for Jamaican cinema, he openly wished for stardom, although Cliff remained surprised by how well known he became. “Back in those days there were few of us African descendants who came through the cracks to get any kind of recognition,′ he told The Guardian in 2021. But when you start to see your face and name on the side of the buses in London that was like: ‘Wow, what's going on?</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Speaking to British newspaper The Times in an interview published Sunday, Cameron, 59, revealed that his wife Samantha had encouraged him to get a test for prostate cancer. “You always hope for the best,” said Cameron, who initially went for a prostate specific antigen (PSA) test, which evaluates levels of proteins linked to prostate cancer. His result was concerningly high, but Cameron said he remained optimistic. “You have a high PSA score – that's probably nothing,” he said. ‘Grey's Anatomy' star James Pickens Jr. opens up about his prostate cancer diagnosis, touts early detection “You have an MRI scan with a few black marks on it. You think, ‘Ah, that's probably OK.' But when the biopsy comes back, and it says you have got prostate cancer?” he added. And then literally as they're coming out of the doctor's mouth you're thinking, ‘Oh, no, he's going to say it. After receiving focal therapy, which involves using needles to transmit electric pulses that break down the cancer, Cameron decided to join calls for more screening. Prostate cancer is the second most common cancer in men in the United States, behind non-melanoma skin cancers. About 11% of American men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer in their lifetime, while around 2.5% will die from it, according to the National Cancer Institute. What are your questions about prostate cancer? Most prostate cancers grow very slowly, and it typically takes at least 10 years for cancer that hasn't spread beyond the prostate to cause significant symptoms. Most prostate cancers picked up by blood tests that measure levels of PSA will not harm men during their lifetimes and don't require treatment, according to the results of a long-running UK study published in 2023. But Cameron agrees with the charity Prostate Cancer Research that a program targeting high-risk men, which makes use of advances in medical science such as the focal therapy that he received, would be beneficial to public health. “The arguments are changing, and so it's a really good moment to have another look at this.” This is something we've really got to think about, talk about, and if necessary, act on,” he said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When Karen Evans arrived at the Federal Emergency Management Agency as a senior adviser this spring, her mandate was clear: help the Department of Homeland Security tighten its control over the agency and rein in spending. She quickly became known as the “final gatekeeper” for all funding requests. “Her nickname was the terminator,” a former senior official told CNN. Oftentimes, that meant no money went to communities across the country that were either preparing for or recovering from a calamity. “Her intent was just to put out the least amount of money possible and not put any money into places or activities that didn't align, or even suggested may not align with their priorities,” said another former senior official who worked with Evans. More than a dozen current and former FEMA insiders, who spoke to CNN anonymously for fear of retribution, described Evans as a DHS loyalist who brooks no opposition, often clashing with staff and instilling fear. In recent months, multiple senior sources said Evans helped orchestrate the removal of dozens of FEMA staffers and seasoned emergency management experts, allowing DHS to consolidate control. She's also been at the center of several controversial moves at FEMA — from allegedly pushing to strip grant funding from Muslim organizations, to enforcing Noem's new policy requiring her sign-off on all spending over $100,000, which was blamed for slowing the response to deadly floods in Texas over the summer. “She's the enforcer for DHS,” one former senior FEMA official told CNN. There's fierce debate over whether FEMA should stay part of the Department of Homeland Security, how much responsibility it should have during disasters, and who gets to call the shots — and control the money. During Trump's first term, Evans — a government employee of nearly three decades who has primarily worked in information technology and cybersecurity — served as a senior official with the Department of Energy before moving to DHS. She left government during the Biden administration, returning to DHS last winter. In March, Trump nominated her for DHS undersecretary of management, and she quickly became a key player, advising top brass — including those reshaping FEMA's future, multiple sources said. A DHS spokesperson said it would let her focus on FEMA, calling her leadership “critical” amid the overhaul of the agency. Evans was shifted into FEMA full time, tasked with helping Noem and Corey Lewandowski — Trump's longtime ally turned DHS special government employee — drive their mission to shrink the agency. She would work alongside the then-newly appointed acting FEMA administrator, David Richardson, another DHS loyalist with little experience managing natural disasters. Noem and Lewandowski tapped Richardson for the top job after firing his predecessor, Cameron Hamilton, for feuding with leadership and opposing the administration's plan to eliminate FEMA. She tightened the funding funnel, cutting a litany of spending deemed wasteful. “We had to write proposals to say things like, ‘We respectfully request your approval for …' and couldn't say things like, ‘Without this there will be a significant problem' — as that was deemed ‘threatening. DHS has repeatedly defended its delivery of FEMA assistance, saying the agency is operating far more efficiently under Trump and Noem, though some agency insiders dispute those claims. Along the way, Evans has clashed with FEMA staff, including high-ranking officials, multiple sources said. “I've been in meetings where she just completely dressed down senior executives in front of everybody,” a longtime FEMA official said. Evans also drove some of the agency's most high-profile disruptions. This summer, she helped orchestrate the abrupt firing of two dozen IT staffers, including two top executives, following a cybersecurity breach, three sources told CNN. Evans also oversaw the removal of the grants branch director and then her replacement, leaving staff in limbo and fearful that any action could lead to termination, multiple sources said. Several senior officials say DHS never offered an explanation for the moves. Some considered her the agency's de-facto leader, as Noem and DHS became increasingly frustrated by Richardson's public gaffes and what they believed was his inability to champion the department's overhaul of FEMA to Congress and the public. Even before joining FEMA full time, Evans sparked concern among agency leaders for her part in efforts to strip security funding from Muslim nonprofits, as first reported by CNN. “There was a real effort by Karen to put Muslim organizations in the light of being terrorists so they would be removed from FEMA grants,” one official said. It began with a call this spring, when DHS raised concerns that Muslim organizations with anti-Israel views were receiving federal funding. “She proposed that, to show impartiality, maybe all Muslim organizations should be banned,” a former senior FEMA official told CNN. On multiple occasions, she sent back lists of Muslim organizations that had cleared background checks to DHS' intelligence office, two sources said. There are still Muslim organizations here,'” one official told CNN. Ultimately, dozens of Muslim groups were disqualified from receiving grants, multiple sources said. A DHS spokesperson said FEMA used “resources including the Office of Intelligence and Analysis and law enforcement” to determine that “multiple grant subrecipients had supported or were affiliated with organizations or individuals associated with terrorism or terrorist activities.” DHS denied that the department ever considered imposing a blanket ban on Muslim organizations receiving these security grants. Evans' lack of significant emergency management experience has raised concerns, given the agency's primary role of helping states and communities respond to and recover from the worst natural disasters and national emergencies. “The emergency manager is who you call when systems fail — and that culture is one built upon extensive lessons learned from the past,” a senior FEMA official told CNN. But that notion of a “central tenant” is in flux as the agency nears an inflection point. Evan's appointment comes just weeks before the new FEMA Review Council, a committee formed by Trump and co-chaired by Noem to decide the agency's future, is expected to deliver recommendations to reshape the agency. Meanwhile, dozens of lawmakers have signed on to a bipartisan bill known as the “FEMA Act” that would remove the agency from DHS and make it independent — a change Noem strongly opposes, multiple sources told CNN. States across the country have complained for months about critical funding delays and a lack of guidance on what support will be available going forward. Amid all this, some see Evans as a placeholder. Sources say she has proved herself a loyal soldier, ready to carry out the vision of Noem and Lewandowski. “Karen doesn't have any real power,” a former senior official said.</p>

Mutual Fund and ETF data provided by Refinitiv Lipper. Police released deer cam footage showing three masked individuals walking through the woods near targeted homes. A wave of high-end residential burglaries across southeastern Wisconsin has prompted a coordinated law enforcement response and drawn political attention at both the local and national levels. The suspects, dressed head to toe in black, with faces covered and gloves on, have entered homes through wooded backyards, often targeting cul-de-sacs or properties near golf courses. Stolen items include jewelry, designer handbags, watches and cash, all consistent with organized theft groups that target affluent neighborhoods nationwide. Police say professional burglars targeting affluent Mequon neighborhoods share similarities with South American theft groups that previously robbed professional athletes' homes. MPD hosted a regional intelligence-sharing meeting on Nov. 12, bringing together police agencies from across southeastern Wisconsin to share data and identify trends. Investigators are working with the Wisconsin Department of Justice and the state crime lab to process evidence and cross-reference incidents across jurisdictions. Officials said the burglaries show hallmarks of South American theft groups (SATGs) known to operate across the U.S., though no suspects have yet been identified. Mequon Police Operations Commander John Hoell told Fox News Digital that investigators have observed consistent methods of entry and targeting across multiple cases. The Mequon Police Department leads regional intelligence-sharing efforts to combat a wave of high-end residential burglaries linked to organized crime groups. He noted that the recent Mequon-area burglaries share similarities with the 2023 break-in at Milwaukee Bucks player Bobby Portis' home in River Hills. In that case, about $1,500 in items were stolen while the Bucks were playing, and the burglary was linked to a Chilean theft group later charged in connection with over $2 million in stolen property from high-profile athletes, including Portis, Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce, Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes and Cincinnati Bengals quarterback Joe Burrow. Police say the suspects often enter through backyards during evening hours Thursday through Sunday, focusing on homes unoccupied at the time. Authorities believe the burglars may be using trail cameras or other monitoring devices to watch when residents leave. Members of a Chilean crime gang are pictured breaking into an upscale Oakland County home in Michigan. Audible alarms and surveillance systems have successfully deterred several attempts, police said. The crimes have also sparked a political response amid Wisconsin's gubernatorial race. U.S. Rep. Tom Tiffany, R-Wis., who recently announced his campaign for governor, directly attributed the burglaries to federal immigration policy and a lack of enforcement under the Biden administration. "This is what Democrats invited into our country under the last four years of Joe Biden, and not one Democrat running for governor will condemn it or demand these criminals be removed," Tiffany said in a statement to Fox News Digital. "I have spent years on the House Judiciary Committee fighting for stronger border security, including ending catch-and-release, stopping parole abuse, and dismantling foreign criminal networks, and I'm grateful we finally have a president taking this crisis seriously and federal agencies working overtime to get criminals off our streets," he said. Tiffany added that if elected governor, he would ban sanctuary jurisdictions and increase resources for local law enforcement. "I'm confident that local and federal law enforcement will move quickly to shut down this South American crime ring," Tiffany said. Law enforcement officials have not confirmed any link between the burglaries and immigration status, but note that South American theft groups often involve individuals who enter legally on short-term visas before committing coordinated crimes and leaving the country. Police say the Mequon-area burglaries remain an active and evolving investigation. "But it's going to take time and help from everyone watching." Authorities emphasize that community awareness and quick reporting remain the most effective tools for preventing further incidents.

James Beard Award-winning chef Andrew Zimmern, who lives in Minnesota, tells Fox News Digital that customers need to hold restaurants more accountable when it comes to what's on the menu. Celebrity chef Andrew Zimmern of Minnesota believes Americans are being priced out of good food as restaurant prices climb and portion sizes stay massive — a combination he warns could spell disaster for diners and the independent restaurant industry as well. In an interview with Fox News Digital, Zimmern called for a reset in how America eats, meaning smaller portions of meat, more seafood and menus that let everyday diners return to neighborhood restaurants instead of defaulting to fast-food chains. "Restaurants are the lifeblood of America's main street," Zimmern said. Zimmern said the food that chain restaurants are serving, in "not all, but in many cases," is just "not good for you." "It includes a lot of processed foods," he added. Zimmern is also concerned about independent restaurants in major American cities that are struggling to make ends meet under the weight of rising costs, labor shortages and changing consumer habits, according to data from the Independent Restaurant Coalition. Many chain restaurants are serving processed foods that are "not good for you," says a celebrity chef. About nine in 10 independent restaurant owners surveyed by the Independent Restaurant Coalition report having to raise menu prices to cope with the increased cost of doing business. Fox News Digital reached out to the Washington, D.C.-based National Restaurant Association for comment. The Independent Restaurant Coalition reports that many small restaurants are struggling to stay open amid rising costs and changing consumer habits. Zimmern believes the solution starts with both restaurants and diners changing their expectations. Instead of super-sized entrées, Zimmern said, restaurants should offer "more affordable menus with smaller portions of meat or animal protein as the centerpiece of the plate, so that more people can engage in restaurant culture." The celebrity chef wants more people to "engage in restaurant culture." Zimmern also wants consumers to ask more questions about where their food comes from and how restaurants source it. "I think we need to, as consumers, ask more questions in restaurants and hold their feet to the fire, at the same time, about where they're doing their purchasing," he said. For Zimmern, it's about reviving a national love affair with food and a return to restaurant culture — "which means going to them, celebrating there" – that includes everyone, not just those who can pay premium prices. "I think we need to be serving all people and inviting them into restaurants." Peter Burke is a lifestyle editor with Fox News Digital.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Hall of Fame broadcaster Marty Brennaman, right, speaks with Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine, left, during “Marty Brennaman Day” prior to a baseball game between the New York Mets and the Cincinnati Reds, Saturday, Sept. 6, 2025, in Cincinnati. Mike DeWine, right, waits to hand out reading certificates to children before a Cleveland Guardians baseball game against the Minnesota Twins in Cleveland, Sunday, Sept. 18, 2022. Mike DeWine could turn back time, he would not have signed the law that legalized sports betting in his state. With two Cleveland Guardians pitchers and an Ohio-born guard for the Miami Heat snared in separate betting-related criminal probes, the second-term Republican says he now “absolutely” regrets unleashing this unbridled new industry on Ohioans with his 2021 signature. “Look, we've always had gambling, we're always going to have gambling,” DeWine told The Associated Press last week. “But just the power of these companies and the deep, deep, deep pockets they have to advertise and do everything they can to get someone to place that bet is really different once you have legalization of them.” His comments reflect a reckoning that's unfolding across sports and politics as sports betting becomes more ingrained across much of the U.S. It's a dynamic that DeWine says he doesn't think lawmakers fully anticipated. “Ohio shouldn't have done it,” he said. DeWine recently emerged as a key player in the negotiations between Major League Baseball and its authorized gaming operators that resulted in the capping of prop bets on individual pitches at $200 and excluding them from parlays. The deal was announced earlier this month, a day after Guardians pitchers Luis Ortiz and Emmanuel Clase were indicted and accused of rigging pitches at the behest of gamblers. DeWine really did a huge service, I think — to us, certainly, I can't speak for any of the other sports — in terms of kind of bringing forward the need to do something in this area,” MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred told reporters last week. And DeWine doesn't plan to stop there. Shortly after Ortiz and Clase were first placed on paid leave this summer, he announced he'd be asking the commissioners and players' unions of all the major U.S. sports leagues to ban prop bets — sometimes called micro-betting — like those implicated in the Guardians scandal. DeWine's recent sentiments mark a notable position shift after he pledged to — and then did — sign a legalization law that was sweeping in scope. An AP investigation that year found that casino operators, slot machine makers, gaming technology companies, sports interests or their lobbyists donated nearly $1 million in 2021 and 2022 to the nonprofit Republican Governors Association, which supported pro-DeWine committees through its campaign arm. A review of more recent campaign filings finds that industry largesse has continued to flow to Ohio politicians with sway over gaming's future. Lobbyists and a PAC with ties to Jack Casino, DraftKings, FanDuel, MGM, Gamewise, Hard Rock, Underdog, Rush Street or Caesars have donated about $130,000 to Ohio state legislators in the past three years, records show — about a third of that directed to top House and Senate leaders. Jon Husted, who was positioning as DeWine's likely gubernatorial successor, had received about $9,000 from industry-connected entities and individuals before being appointed to the U.S. Senate. At least one powerful state lawmaker, Republican House Finance Chairman Brian Stewart, had vowed to introduce legislation protecting prop bets prior to professional baseball's crackdown. “I think that prop bets are a significant part of sports betting in the state of Ohio,” Stewart told cleveland.com in August. “It's something that clearly a lot of Ohioans have taken part in and enjoy, and I don't think there's something that we should eliminate entirely.” Amid such pushback, DeWine and others now view voluntary buy-in from leagues, players' unions and sportsbooks as a superior approach to pursuing gambling restrictions on a state-by-state basis, where the authority lies. Matt Schuler, executive director of the Ohio Casino Control Commission, said the baseball deal DeWine helped broker has shown it can be done. “He's using the bully pulpit and he's able to connect with the right people in that way,” Schuler said of DeWine. “No one thought that everyone could get on the same page, but now they did because everyone realizes the risk. The bets are small, but the risk is big, and so, having observed gaming and regulated it for about 14 years, this is impressive.” They hadn't both been governors, but DeWine did have one cache going in: his family's long-time ownership of North Carolina's Asheville Tourists. “I would have preferred to have completely done away with the micro-prop bets, but this is the area that he was able to settle on with them, and I was pleased with that,” DeWine said. DeWine, who faces term limits next year, said he would be happy to sign a repeal of Ohio's sports betting law at this point, but he's certain there's not enough support for that at the Ohio Statehouse. Instead, he'll continue to make his case in other ways. DeWine, an avid baseball fan, particularly of his hometown Cincinnati Reds, said he believes “these sports are playing with dynamite here and the integrity of the sports is at stake.” “So, you try to do what you can do, and you try and warn people, and try to take action like we did with collegiate, and you try take action like what we're doing with baseball,” he said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Trump administration could have expanded authority to take action against Venezuela starting Monday, as the US designates Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and his government allies as members of a foreign terrorist organization. The designation of “Cartel de los Soles,” a phrase that experts say is more a description of allegedly corrupt government officials than an organized crime group, as a foreign terrorist organization will authorize President Donald Trump to impose fresh sanctions targeting Maduro's assets and infrastructure. It doesn't, however, explicitly authorize the use of lethal force, according to legal experts. Cartel de los Soles is used to describe a decentralized network of Venezuelan groups within the armed forces linked to drug trafficking, experts say. The Venezuelan president has always denied any personal involvement in drug trafficking, and his government has repeatedly denied the existence of the alleged cartel, which some experts suggest technically doesn't exist in a conventional sense. Trump has been briefed by top officials on a range of options for action inside Venezuela, including strikes on military or government facilities and special operations raids. The option of doing nothing also still exists. Meanwhile, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Dan Caine, and his senior enlisted adviser, David Isom, will visit Puerto Rico on Monday to thank service members supporting missions in the Caribbean Sea. There is some public opposition to US involvement in the region. According to a CBS News/YouGov poll released Sunday, 70% of Americans oppose the US taking military action in Venezuela, compared with 30% who favor action. Officially, the Trump administration says it is working to cut down on illegal flows of migrants and drugs — but regime change is a possible side effect of those efforts. “This new maneuver will follow the same fate as previous and recurring aggressions against our country: failure,” the statement continued. Trump has expressed some openness to a diplomatic resolution, saying last week that Maduro “would like to talk” and later suggesting that he would be open to speaking with him “at a certain time.” The White House did not immediately respond to CNN's request for comment on the status of a potential Trump-Maduro conversation. In a sign of the escalating tensions, the US on Thursday conducted its largest military display near Venezuela, as at least six US aircraft appeared off the nation's coast over the course of several hours, including a supersonic F/A-18E fighter jet, a B-52 strategic bomber and reconnaissance aircraft, according to a CNN review of open-source flight data. And over the weekend, three international airlines canceled their flights departing from Venezuela after the US Federal Aviation Administration warned major airlines of a “potentially hazardous situation” when flying over the country, according to Reuters.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>BEIRUT (AP) — Lebanon is a country where crosses rise from mountaintops, rooftops and street corners, and Christian symbols are woven into everyday life. From Mount Lebanon's peaks to the coastal plain, ancient sites sit beside modern life, reflecting a landscape shaped by centuries of Christian presence. Lebanon's mosaic of 18 sects — including 12 Christian ones — makes it one of the region's most diverse societies, with a Maronite Christian traditionally serving as president.

Pilgrims pray at the feet of a shrine to the Virgin Mary in Harissa east Beirut, Lebanon, Sunday, Nov. 9, 2025. Christianity reached Lebanon in the first century, with the New Testament recounting Jesus' visits to Sidon and Tyre. Pilgrims today continue to visit major sites such as the shrine of St. Charbel in Annaya and the hilltop shrine of Our Lady of Lebanon in Harissa, which draws both Christians and Muslims seeking blessing and comfort.

Lebanese Christians, like the rest of the population, have endured years of economic collapse, political paralysis and conflict — most recently last year's war between Israel and Hezbollah. While many see the pope's visit as a rare moment of hope, Christians in the south are disappointed he won't visit their region.

Southern Lebanon is home to important Christian sites, including Qana, where tradition holds that Jesus performed his first miracle, and the sanctuary of Our Lady of Waiting in Maghdousheh, believed to be where Mary waited while Jesus traveled nearby. For many Lebanese Christians, these places reflect a long struggle to preserve identity through crisis and war. As Lebanon prepares to welcome the pope, many hope his visit brings a sense of unity, recognition and solace to a weary nation.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump presented the 28-point draft proposal for a peace plan to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and Ukrainian officials last week, according to the Associated Press. The plan included security guarantees for Ukraine, an agreement not to join NATO in the future, Ukraine's eligibility for membership into the European Union, and territory concessions by Ukraine and Russia, among other details. While speaking at a press conference during the G20 summit in Johannesburg, South Africa, Meloni rejected the idea of needing a counterproposal to the U.S. deal, emphasizing the plan had “many points that were acceptable.” She suggested using the plan as a foundation for a peace agreement, rather than scrapping it and drafting a counterproposal. “I don't think the issue is working on a complete counterproposal. However, the Italian prime minister stopped short of a complete endorsement of the U.S. plan, stating that while it was a good start, there were some aspects of the proposal that required further discussion. “There are also many points that I consider particularly positive, especially regarding security guarantees.” Meloni also stressed that the plan would need more input from European countries and that such contributions were necessary for the proposal “to be implemented.” She also said categorized discussions about the peace plan as at a “very delicate stage” and a “test of maturity for Europe.” Meloni spoke to Trump about the peace proposal. She revealed that she sought clarification “to understand if we can obtain at least a temporary ceasefire on the strategic infrastructure” while working on the details of the proposal. “The Russians also need to give some concrete signal that they actually want to achieve peace,” Meloni said.</p>

Los Angeles Rams HC Sean McVay joins Colin Cowherd to discuss the Rams' 21-19 win over the Seattle Seahawks, being on top of the NFC West, and Matthew Stafford's impressive performances. The Los Angeles Rams and MVP frontrunner Matthew Stafford just keep winning, taking down the Tampa Bay Buccaneers 34-7 on "Sunday Night Football." This game was as lopsided as it gets for a primetime matchup between playoff hopefuls, and much of that had to do with how confident and poised Stafford has been in his 17th NFL season. Los Angeles Rams wide receiver Davante Adams celebrates a touchdown against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers at Sofi Stadium on Sunday, Nov. 23, 2025, in Inglewood, California. Stafford added three more touchdown passes to his league-leading total, giving him 30 on the year with only two interceptions. And the man who has enjoyed a resurgence in his own right, Davante Adams, continued to be his go-to target in the red zone. Adams secured two touchdowns for the Rams, including the game's opening score that capped a 10-play, 80-yard drive with a beautifully thrown fade from Stafford. Needing a touchdown, Mayfield found Tez Johnson for a 14-yard score on the ensuing drive to cut into the Rams' lead. But Stafford needed only four plays to go 65 yards and connect with Adams again, this time on a perfect 24-yard touchdown pass. Adams finished the game with 62 yards on five catches, while Puka Nacua led Los Angeles with 97 yards on seven receptions. During the Buccaneers' touchdown drive, Mayfield scrambled for seven yards on third-and-6, lowering his shoulder into two Rams defenders to move the chains. It proved costly for the aggressive signal-caller, as he suffered a left shoulder injury that eventually forced him out of the game. Davante Adams of the Los Angeles Rams catches a touchdown pass against Zyon McCollum of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers at SoFi Stadium on Nov. 23, 2025, in Inglewood, California. He went down on one knee with his left arm motionless before eventually heading to the locker room. When Tampa Bay came out for the second half, backup Teddy Bridgewater took over for the injured Mayfield, who was ruled out and stood on the sideline in street clothes. It's unclear what exactly Mayfield is dealing with, but given his history of playing through injuries, this is clearly something he couldn't power through — and it could be cause for concern moving forward. Bridgewater went 8-for-15 for 62 yards and took two sacks, while Mayfield was 9-of-19 for 41 yards with a touchdown and two interceptions, one coming on that Hail Mary attempt.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Did you know that a Democratic member of the House is under federal criminal indictment? It didn't receive a lot of news coverage, but the Justice Department announced last Wednesday that Rep. Sheila Cherfilus-McCormick of Florida and three co-defendants have been charged with stealing federal COVID funds and using the money to enrich themselves, to finance a political campaign, and to buy, among other items, a 3.14-carat diamond ring. It's a bizarre story that can be summed up in a simple question: What would you do if you discovered that someone accidentally deposited $5 million into your bank account? Would you point out the mistake and give it back? In 2021, Cherfilus-McCormick and her brother, Edwin Cherfilus, ran a Miramar, Florida, company called Trinity Healthcare Services, which was wholly owned by two of their family members who are not named in the indictment. Starting in March 2021, the company became involved in a program through which the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or FEMA, gave grants to state agencies, in this case the Florida Division of Emergency Management, or FDEM, to hire companies to provide COVID-related services. On July 1, 2021, FDEM paid the bill, but instead of depositing $50,578.50 into Trinity's bank account, which the indictment refers to as Bank Account 1, it deposited $5,057,850.00. That is when, of course, Cherfilus-McCormick and her brother should have gone to FDEM and said, sorry, it looks like you've made a big mistake here. But the indictment says they did no such thing. On the day the $5 million showed up, Sheila Cherfilus-McCormick took a screenshot of Bank Account 1's activity and texted it to Edwin Cherfilus. Then, it appears the two did nothing for a month. And then, according to the indictment, they did a lot. (The bank for both accounts was located in Maryland.) On the same day, Aug. 11, the two moved $190,894.91 from Bank Account 1 into Bank Account 5, which was also in Maryland and was controlled by Edwin Cherfilus. The next day, Aug. 12, the two moved $1,249,333.68 from Bank Account 1 to Bank Account 9, which was in Florida and was controlled by two family members. On Aug. 16, they moved $830,708.93 from Bank Account 1 to Bank Account 7, which was also at a bank in Florida and which the indictment says was controlled by a friend of Cherfilus's in Orlando. On Aug. 18, they moved $334,757.78 from Bank Account 1 to Bank Account 8, which was also in Florida and was controlled by a woman named Nadege Leblanc, who worked on the campaign and became Sheila Cherfilus-McCormick's chief of staff for the district office. After that, there was still more moving money around. On Aug. 31, 2021, according to the indictment, Cherfilus-McCormick and her brother moved approximately $1 million from Bank Account 2, which they had allegedly used to originally store the money, into Bank Account 6, which was a money market account that the two had opened in Florida. On Sept. 1, they used a cashier's check for $109,000 to purchase an “approximately 3.14 carat ‘Fancy Vivid Yellow Diamond' ring” from a jeweler in New York, according to the indictment. On Sept. 3, 2021, the two transferred approximately $800,000 from Bank Account 2 in Maryland to Bank Account 6 in Maryland, which they controlled. Leblanc then wrote two checks for $2,900, the maximum allowable under law, each to Cherfilus-McCormick's campaign committee, SCM for Congress. Just to keep the candidate up on things, Leblanc texted Cherfilus-McCormick a picture of two personal checks from Straw Donor 5 for $2,900 each, made out to SCM for Congress. Would the government, either in Washington or Florida, ever have noticed that it had mistakenly sent $5,057,850.00 when it meant to send $50,578.50? And who knows how much of the COVID billions was stolen or wasted in ways the government never knew. In her defense, Cherfilus-McCormick would certainly point out that she did not bill the government for $5 million. She did not ask for the big check. But the law is quite clear: It wasn't her money.</p>
