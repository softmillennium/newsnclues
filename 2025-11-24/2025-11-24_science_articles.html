                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When archaeologists poured the liquid out of two European-manufactured bottles found under a brick floor at George Washington's Mount Vernon mansion, they enjoyed the scent of cherry blossoms. As part of a privately funded revitalization project at the Virginia mansion, a brick floor originally laid in the 1770s was torn up, revealing a small pit and the two side-by-side dark green glass bottles, both upright and sealed. “Not only did we recover intact, sealed bottles, but they contained organic material that can provide us with valuable insight and perspective into 18th-century lives at Mount Vernon,” Jason Boroughs, Mount Vernon principal archaeologist, says in a statement. Full cherries, including stems and pits, were part of the liquid content, giving off the signature scent of the region, a “blockbuster find of two fully intact glass bottles containing liquid that have not been seen since before the war for American independence,” Doug Bradburn, Mount Vernon president and CEO, says in a statement. That makes the cherries likely pre-Revolutionary War fruit. “There are 18th century accounts that talk about proper ways of preserving fruits and vegetables,” Boroughs tells the newspaper. That advice may still hold true today, as the cherries held their shape and scent 250 years later. Tim Newcomb is a journalist based in the Pacific Northwest.

And over the years, scientists have tried to get a clearer picture of that prehistoric story by excavating ancient human sites around the world. H. juluensis—the name for which means “big head”—thrived in eastern Asia from 300,000 years ago to around 50,000 years ago, when the species died out. According to the researchers, this group likely hunted wild horses, fashioned stoned tools, and even processed animal hides to survive frigid winters. University of Hawai'i's Christopher J. Bae said the breakthrough for discovering this possibly new species came when he and his team were devising a new system for organizing fossil evidence. “Although we started this project several years ago, we did not expect being able to propose a new hominin (human ancestor) species and then to be able to organize the hominin fossils from Asia into different groups,” Bae said in a press statement. One possible member of the new species H. juluensis isn't a newcomer to science by any stretch. Denisovans—first identified in 2010 via DNA extracted from a young girl's fingerbone found in Siberia—have never been given a species classification, but Bae believes that they could belong to this new species. H. juluensis also potentially solves another mystery of the Xujiayao hominin fossils, which have long perplexed researchers, as the remains display a mix of H. erectus and H. sapiens  features. According to a study by the scientists in the journal PaleoAnthropology, these remains have been confused for a variety of taxonomic representations, but note that differences in the cranium (spoiler: it's big), the teeth and jaws, and a few other features denote a new species represented in fossil remains including Penghu 1 (jawbone), Xiahe (mandible), Xuchang (partial crania), and a variety of Denisova fossils. Although this is a convincing argument that these particular specimens belong to a previously unknown human species, more research will be needed before anthropologists bust out the “Welcome to the Family” banners. But because these fossils still defy species classification, it's likely only a matter of time before the hominin tribe increases by one (or more).

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After the discovery of gold on his property—a property he'd only owned for about a year—the man (who has remained anonymous) turned the treasure over to the local Neuville-sur-Saone town authorities, who in turn contacted the Regional Directorate of Cultural Affairs. The civil code of France—which dates to the 19th century—defines a treasure as “any hidden or buried thing over which no one can prove their ownership, and which is discovered purely by chance.” Ownership of such a discovery is granted to the individual finding the treasure, if it was on their own property. In the last few months alone, several reports of individuals happening upon buried treasure have surfaced. A fisherman went digging for worms near his home in Sweden and found roughly 20,000 silver coins and pieces of jewelry dating to the early Middle Ages. And in England, a couple renovating their kitchen discovered a 17th-century haul of roughly 100 coins from the first English Civil War. In other words, there's apparently never been a better time to start that home renovation project you've been thinking about. You might just wind up with more than a new deck to your name.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The craftsmanship on the spears shows some were likely used in battle, while one may have just been a status symbol. Western Poland's Lake Lednica has proven an absolute treasure-trove of medieval weaponry, but the four most recent finds—spears from the beginning of the 11th century C.E.—come both remarkably well preserved and with plenty of mystery. The four spears pulled from the lake's waters in Poland's Ostrow Lednikci by underwater archaeologists from Nicolaus Copernicus University each tell a different story, from that of a warrior to that of a potential prince. “This is rare, as only two spears from Lake Lednica have such a well-preserved shaft,” Andrzeg Pydyn, director of the university's Centre of Underwater Archaeology, said in a translated statement. Combing both soft and hard steel into one spear made for a stronger weapon and represented the most technologically advanced spear craftsmanship of the time, showing this level of sophistication was available to Piast warriors. It's a richly decorated spear adorned with wings. Craftsmen placed a steel head on an intricately decorated socket, plated with gold, silver, bronze, zinc, and lead. “It is possible that the decorations served an identifying function, allowing the weapon's owner to be distinguished during ceremonies or battles, and demonstrated prestige and high social status. The presence of such a high-quality object at Ostrow Lednicki further underscores the special significance of this center, both politically and symbolically.” On a practical side, the well-preserved finds allow the team to analyze spears with a range of lengths and styles, which Pydyn said confirms what was previously believed only through legend and images: Warriors used both short and long spears. The lake has long been a hotbed of weaponry discoveries, with an early medieval arsenal of 145 axes, 64 spearheads, and eight swords previously located underwater. Now the experts have four more spears dating between 1016 and 1030 C.E. Tim Newcomb is a journalist based in the Pacific Northwest.

People protest Facebook's handling of user data during an investigation by UK lawmakers. This Is for Everyone reads like a family newsletter: it tells you what happened, recounting the Internet's origin and evolution in great detail, but rarely explaining why the ideal of a decentralized Internet was not realized. Berners-Lee's central argument is that the web has strayed from its founding principles and been corrupted by profit-driven companies that seek to monetize our attention. But it's still possible to “fix the internet”, he argues, outlining a utopian vision for how that might be done. Both ideas are optimistic — some might say naive — but coming from someone so integral to the web's creation, they carry particular weight. In this personal history of the Internet, penned with co-writer Stephen Witt, Berners-Lee recounts decades of his career at various institutions, most notably CERN — the European centre for particle physics in Geneva, Switzerland. Much of this is a well-known tale, both because the web is so prevalent in our lives and because Berners-Lee has given plenty of interviews about how it came to be. As an author, Berners-Lee is most powerful and persuasive when he looks beyond his own life to examine the web's exploitative corners. For instance, he notes that some US Democrats — such as senator Ed Markey and former vice-president Al Gore, who both advocated for well-thought-out technology regulations — were more willing than Republicans to engage with the web's inner workings. He suggests that they ought to be brought into check. He criticizes Google for attempting to dominate the World Wide Web Consortium — the non-profit organization in Cambridge, Massachusetts, that sets web standards — by embedding its preferred coding language into its Chrome browser, effectively making this language the default choice. He made changes to how browsers render images, “as was his right, I suppose”, Berners-Lee writes. Another firm Berners-Lee condemns is Apple — for steering users towards its tightly controlled app store and making it virtually impossible to download apps that are outside Apple's ecosystem. Social-media algorithms also draw his ire; he warns that they act like “an undercover megaphone”, distorting and polluting public discourse. Alongside his colleagues at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, he has created a data protocol called Solid. This data-management framework gives users control over their personal information through secure ‘pods' — individual data stores that let them decide which apps or services can access their data.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Massive amounts of sargassum washing onto Florida's coastline are not only affecting beachgoers, they are also creating a serious new barrier for young sea turtles. Scientists have long known that anything blocking a hatchling's route can slow it down and increase danger, but very little research has focused directly on the effects of sargassum. A recent study has started to provide that missing insight. A team from Florida Atlantic University's Charles E. Schmidt College of Science investigated whether thick sargassum deposits make the trip to the water more physically demanding -- and whether that added strain could influence a hatchling's chance of survival. Hatchlings were collected from Juno Beach, Jupiter and Boca Raton. This setup allowed the team to measure how much extra effort it took to cross sargassum while observing the turtles without disturbing their behavior. Once each hatchling finished the crawl, researchers checked blood glucose levels to estimate energy use. They also measured how quickly the turtles could right themselves when flipped upside down in water, which served as a simple indicator of physical condition. Sand temperature readings were taken at the start, middle and end of every crawl to document environmental conditions. The findings, published in the Journal of Coastal Research, showed that hatchlings from all three species took much longer to complete their paths when sargassum was present. Most of this extra time came from having to climb up and over the seaweed piles. All species moved noticeably slower through sargassum sections, with loggerheads showing the greatest reduction in speed. "When sargassum piles are higher -- some can be over a meter high on South Florida beaches in the summer and extend for hundreds of meters down the beach -- we can expect more failed attempts, particularly when hatchlings have to cross multiple bands of seaweed just to reach the ocean." One hatchling overturned more than 20 times during a single attempt. Glucose levels remained within normal ranges for all three species. "For sea turtle hatchlings, reaching the ocean is already a race against time -- and survival. Now, increasingly large mats of sargassum are adding new challenges to this critical journey," said Milton. "As these seaweed accumulations grow taller and more widespread, they risk blocking hatchlings entirely, draining their limited energy or leaving them stranded. Beyond impeding movement, sargassum may also reduce nesting space and alter incubation conditions." Without thoughtful intervention, these dense seaweed mats could gradually undermine hatchling survival and long-term conservation efforts. Note: Content may be edited for style and length.

(2025)Cite this article Breaking spatial-inversion or time-reversal symmetry in solids leads to transverse electromagnetic effects such as the anomalous Hall effect, Faraday rotation, non-reciprocal directional dichroism and off-diagonal linear magnetoelectricity. These are all tied to the framework of magnetic toroidal invariance. Here we introduce a distinct class of transverse electromagnetic responses that arise from electric toroidal invariance in ferro-rotational systems that preserve both inversion and time-reversal symmetries. It is different from that governed by magnetic toroidal invariance. We demonstrate a high-order off-diagonal magnetic susceptibility of ferro-rotational domains and a reduced linear diagonal magnetic susceptibility at these domain walls in doped ilmenite FeTiO3. Our results reveal the presence of anomalous transverse susceptibilities in ferro-rotational materials with spontaneous electric toroidal moments. Therefore, our findings illustrate emergent functionalities of ferro-rotational materials.

(a) The orthogonal configuration among the electric dipole (P, or electric field E), magnetic dipole (M, or magnetic field H), and velocity vector k (or magnetic toroidal moment To) is invariant under time-reversal and spatial-inversion operations, which can be restored by simple two-fold rotations (C2z or C2y). The invariance of this configuration is termed “magnetic toroidal invariance”. (b) The orthogonal configuration among the magnetic field H, magnetic dipole M, and electric toroidal moment A is invariant under time-reversal and spatial-inversion operations, which can be restored by the simple two-fold rotation (C2x). (c) The orthogonal configuration among the electric field E, electric dipole P, and electric toroidal moment A is invariant under time-reversal and spatial-inversion operations, which can be restored by the simple two-fold rotation (C2x). (d) The orthogonal configuration among the applied velocity vector k (thicker curved arrow), induced transverse velocity vector k (thinner curved arrow), and electric toroidal moment A is invariant under time-reversal and spatial-inversion operations, which can be always restored by the simple two-fold rotation (C2x). The invariance of configurations in (b-d) is termed “electric toroidal invariance”, which corresponds to a new type of transverse electromagnetic responses. (a) Odd-order anomalous transverse magnetic susceptibility of ferro-rotational order, where the off-diagonal response changes its sign upon switching the ferro-rotational order or the magnetic field. (b) To have odd-order off-diagonal χxy, one needs to preserve the symmetry operations for the identity and route path 1 and break the symmetry operations for the route path 2 and route path 3. That is unbroken {1, C2z, mz, I, T} and broken {C2x, C2y, mx, my}, which means broken {1, C2z, mz, I, T}⊗{C2x, C2y, mx, my}=broken {C2x, C2y, mx, my, C2x⊗T, C2y⊗T, mx⊗T, my⊗T}, where m is the mirror reflection perpendicular to a certain axis, C2 is the two-fold rotation along a certain axis, I is the inversion, T is the time reversal, and ⊗ stands for the symmetry operation on the left plus the one on the right. (a) MFM images of the same batch of crystal after annealings with different cooling rates through its FR transition (near 1120°C). The different domain wall density consistent with TEM observations suggests the FR domain wall nature of these MFM contrasts. The (b) topography, (c) MFM image, and (d) corresponding second harmonic generation (SHG) intensity image of the same spot, showing one-to-one correspondence of FR domains. The slight scale difference between MFM and SHG patterns is due to nonperfect calibrations of the scanners used in two different measurements. All MFM images have the same span of 0.8°. (a-b) MFM images taken by non-switchable high-coercivity tip under 1 kOe opposite out-of-plane fields and (c-d) their corresponding schematic signals showing domain wall signal reversals. (e-f) MFM images taken by switchable normal MFM tip under 1 kOe opposite out-of-plane fields and (g-h) their corresponding schematic signals showing the same domain wall signal. All MFM images have the same span of 0.8°. (a) Topography of a regularly-polished Fe1.2Ti0.8O3 sample with a flat surface; and its corresponding MFM image with (b) zero, (c) 1 kOe, and (d) 2 kOe out-of-plane fields. No spontaneous domain wall contrasts are observed in zero magnetic field. There is no obvious contrast change between 1 kOe and 2 kOe out-of-plane fields, suggesting the reach of contrast saturation already under 1 kOe. All MFM images have the same span of 0.8°. (a) cDIC optical image of FR domains in Fe1.2Ti0.8O3 after selective circular polishing (b) TEM image of the same batch of Fe1.2Ti0.8O3 crystals with FR domains (c) Magnetization curves of both Fe1.23Ti0.77O3 and Fe1.2Ti0.8O3 as a function of temperature, showing a lower ferrimagnetic transition temperature in Fe1.2Ti0.8O3. Blue dashed line shows where MFM images were taken for Fe1.2Ti0.8O3. (d) MFM images of Fe1.2Ti0.8O3 taken at 225 K under a 1 kOe out-of-plane field. All MFM images have the same span of 0.8°.Curved FR domain contrasts are successfully reproduced in Fe1.2Ti0.8O3 at a lower temperature. Source data (a) High-angle annular dark-field STEM image taken along [100], accompanied by the extracted intensity profile along the single cation column denoted by a blue arrowhead. The arrangement of “bright-dark-dark-bright” layers stacked alternately along the crystallographic c-axis illustrates the ordered ilmenite structure. The positions showing higher and lower intensity correspond to Fe and Fe-Ti columns, respectively. The upper region, exhibiting a systematic variation of “bright-dark-dark-bright” is attributed to an A+ domain, while the lower region, displaying “dark-bright-bright-dark” signifies the A− domain. The red rectangle highlights the intensity profile at the domain wall where a reversal of the periodicity in intensity patterns occurs. The domain wall is about one-unit cell in width. (b) The FFT diffractograms obtained from the selected areas of top (A + ), domain wall (DW), and bottom (A−) regions show the persistence of (003) peaks (red arrows). Though the intensity of (003) peaks is significantly reduced, we confirm the ilmenite structure at the DW instead of the formation of corundum structure with completely random distribution of cations. However, a smaller intensity variation at the DW and a relatively darker DWs in comparison to domains imply a slight Fe deficiency at DWs in our Fe1.23Ti0.77O3 single crystals. (a-b) MFM images of two different areas on the ab plane with isotropic FR domains and (c-d) MFM images of two different areas on the side surface with laterally elongated FR domains. One can convert MFM images into black and white domain images and automatically calculate the ratio (R) between the averaged lateral domain size and the averaged vertical domain size following the previously reported method19. The ratio R close to 1 on the ab plane indicates an isotropic FR domain shape and the ratio R larger than 1 on the side surface reflects a laterally elongated FR domain shape. All MFM images have the same span of 0.8°. (a) MFM images of the same spot on a side surface of Fe1.23Ti0.77O3 at several temperatures. Abrupt terminations of ferrimagnetic domains at FR domain are observed at low temperatures, which demonstrates a strong coupling between the FR and ferrimagnetic order and possible exotic domain wall magnetism in magnetic FR materials. Red arrows label the position of the same defective scratch mark on the sample surface. Slight position drifts and image distortions are due to common scanner distortions when scanning at large scales and elevated temperatures. (b) Enlarged MFM images with marked FR domain wall positions (red dashed curves). Source data Illustrations of longitudinal and transverse susceptibilities and their corresponding MFM contrast for the case of (a) H = 0 Oe, (b) an in-plane field Hx = -1 kOe, (c) a vertical field Hz = +1 kOe parallel to Az, (d) an in-plane field Hx = +1 kOe, and (e) an in-plane field Hx with a slight tilting, showing the contrast polarity is insensitive to any misalignments of the field.

Alzheimer's disease causes progressive cognitive decline, yet some individuals remain resilient despite developing hallmark pathology. A subset of people with Down syndrome (DS), the most common genetic cause of Alzheimer's disease, demonstrates such resilience. Given the elevated risk of hematopoietic mutations in DS, we hypothesize that certain variants may confer microglial resilience. Here, we introduce a myeloid DS-linked CSF2RB A455D mutation into human pluripotent stem cell-derived microglia from both donors with DS and healthy donors and study their function in 4–10-month-old chimeric mice. We find that this mutation suppresses type I interferon signaling in response to tau pathology, reducing inflammation while enhancing phagocytosis, thereby ameliorating microglial senescence. CSF2RB A455D-expressing microglia form a unique protective subpopulation and preserve neuronal functions. Importantly, they replace diseased wild-type microglia after tau exposure. These findings provide proof of concept that engineered human microglia can enhance resilience against tauopathy, opening avenues for microglial replacement therapies.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Save up to 43% on the best laptops from major brands. We may earn commission if you buy from a link. Black Friday 2025 is coming up quick, so we're cutting straight to the good stuff. To find the best laptop deals this year, I went brand by brand and pulled out the standout discounts from Acer, Asus, Dell, HP, and more. Before we dig in, there are a couple things you should know: I generally found more and better deals on gaming laptops. Either way, in a year defined by prices going up, now really is the best time to get a cost-efficient PC gaming upgrade. And beginner-friendly gaming laptops like the Asus TUF F16 have cuts around $250. That said, I also found some solid deals on productivity laptops. There are a few smart buys that I'd say are worth serious consideration, including price cuts on the latest Microsoft Surface Laptop and the MacBook Air. I compared their prices and price cuts against historical pricing to make sure they're real once-a-year opportunities. If you want the best Black Friday laptop deals without digging through thousands of listings, then you've come to the right place. The Lenovo Legion 5i is holding steady at its lowest price to date this Black Friday at $450 off its usual price. Beyond the steep discount and solid specs, I singled out this model because of its excellent cooling capability, which uses AI to optimize fan speeds for efficient performance. The current MacBook Air, which launched earlier this year, with Apple's M4 chip, maintaining the ultraslim notebook's place as a powerful, multi-functional computer that's great for productivity and creative projects alike. The Asus ROG Strix G16 is a stellar gaming laptop. After all, it's been our top gaming laptop recommendation for quite some time now. It has an Nvidia GeForce RTX 5060 GPU, strong cooling, and Intel Core Ultra 9 processor that can keep up with demanding tasks. But you don't just have to take my word for it. Tech Editor Stefan Vazharov tested this laptop and still swears by it. "The Asus ROG Strix G16 offers everything I look for in a gaming laptop," Stefan says, "including advanced hardware, stellar gaming performance, and a cool design, all at an agreeable price." The Nvidia RTX 4050 GPU isn't a top performer, but it can still handle 1080p at 144 Hz at high settings for plenty of games. It has an Intel Core i3 processor and a 15.5-inch screen display. Ahead of Black Friday, this is the deal that stood out most to me. The Microsoft Surface Laptop is an excellent choice for work and the daily grind, with a 15--inch, 2496 x 1664 resolution display, a Snapdragon X Elite processor, and enough RAM and SSD to keep your workflow running smoothly. It's also integrated with Microsoft's AI assistant, Copilot+, to provide support and streamline workflow when needed. It also feature's HP Omen AI support for personalized settings. The MSI Katana HX is an effective gaming laptop that's capable for web browsing, work, and play. A powerful pair of processors — an Intel Core i7 14650HX CPU and Nvidia RTX 5070 GPU — gives you strong gaming performance that will pop on its 15.6-inch 1440p, 165Hz display. It's not exactly built for gaming or video editing, but has an impressive 14-inch 2560 x 1600p display, a comfortable keyboard and keypad, and impressive battery life.

Humans accumulate extensive repertoires of culturally transmitted information, reaching breadths exceeding any individual's innovation capacity (culturally dependent repertoires). It is unclear whether other animals require social learning to acquire adult-like breadths of information in the wild, including by key developmental milestones, or whether animals are capable of constructing their knowledge repertoires primarily through independent exploration. We investigated whether social learning mediates orangutans' diet-repertoire development, by translating an extensive dataset describing wild orangutans' behaviour into an empirically validated agent-based model. In this model, diets reliably developed to adult-like breadths only when simulated immatures benefited from multiple forms of social learning. Moreover, social learning was required for diets to reach adult-like breadths by the age immatures become independent from their mothers. This implies that orangutan diets constitute culturally dependent repertoires, with social learning enhancing the rate and outcomes of diet development past individual potentials. We discuss prospective avenues for researching the building of cultural repertoires in hominids and other species. Social learning pervades the lives of humans and generates shared cultural repertoires that are indispensable for our species' survival1. Learning from others circumvents the costs of asocial exploration and innovation—which can be time-consuming and risky—therefore accelerating the rate at which learners can acquire fitness-maximizing knowledge and skills2,3,4. In human culture, cumulative cultural evolution habitually produces culturally dependent traits6,8, where the efficiency and/or complexity of socially learned behaviours, or their artefacts, exceed any one individual's innovation capacity6,9. Additionally, human cultures accumulate breadths of knowledge that are more expansive than any individual could generate independently7, hereafter named culturally dependent repertoires. Recent research has revealed widespread evidence for social learning and culture across mammals, birds and fish10. However, the shared knowledge and skills of animals typically lack many features of cultural dependence, provoking ongoing debate over whether these aspects of culture are especially pronounced in humans, particularly in comparison with other great apes (henceforth, apes)11,12,13,14. Compared with culturally dependent traits, little research has investigated whether animals possess culturally dependent repertoires, in part because the breadth of animals' cultural knowledge is challenging to estimate15. Yet, possessing broad repertoires of ecologically relevant information—including simple information surrounding the nature, location and timing of available resources—is probably fundamental for survival in wild animals. For species who have opportunities to acquire information from conspecifics, social learning theoretically may permit repertoires to expand past thresholds achievable by lone individuals16. Many animals require knowledge of a sufficiently broad number of foods—the diet repertoire—to meet their baseline energetic and nutrient requirements for survival and reproduction; this includes during periodic turnover of available food species and phases of food scarcity17. However, the majority of this evidence comes from experimental paradigms2,21 or indirect inferences from analyses of specific foraging behaviours in the wild22,23,24. For wild animals, it has not yet been possible to empirically quantify the relative importance (if any) of different forms of social learning for developing diet repertoires with adult-like breadths, nor whether social learning is required to acquire these diets by key developmental milestones. Given their phylogenetic proximity to humans, studies of apes can identify cultural capacities that are probably ancestral to hominins19,25,26. Apes' diets are vast (regularly reaching several hundred different types of food19,27) and potentially encompass culturally dependent breadths. Apes also exhibit extended developmental periods, affording immatures many years to learn sufficient survival-relevant information before adulthood, including knowledge and skills for foraging26,28,29,30. These developmental periods extend well beyond weaning, after which immatures must know how to source sufficient food to support the remainder of their development into adulthood. This includes the need to possess sufficiently large diet repertoires to meet the high energetic and nutrient requirements of their developing bodies and brains29,31,32,33. Observational studies on wild apes suggest that immature individuals may potentially draw on several forms of social learning during diet-repertoire development, with the primary source of these interactions being their mothers. The most prominent of these include: Following conspecifics through the home range to different areas where food is available34,35 (broad-scale local enhancement, here named ‘exposure'36,37). Being close to conspecifics, hence being more likely to pay attention to their precise locations in feeding patches (fine-scale local enhancement26) or the items conspecifics interact with (fine-scale stimulus enhancement26), or being more likely to experience proximity-dependent facilitation of exploration (social facilitation). We group these three proximity-dependent processes under the umbrella term ‘enhancement'. Close-range observation of conspecifics' foraging behaviours (‘peering'; Fig. Observational data suggest that these forms of social learning increase the frequency of immature apes' exploratory behaviours and target explorations towards feeding locations, food items and foraging tools19,26,38,39,41 (Fig. However, whether these processes are required to sufficiently accelerate broad-scale diet-repertoire acquisition over apes' extended developmental periods has defied empirical testing. As apes encounter many thousands of food items during development, it has not been possible to rule out whether adult-like diets could emerge without social learning's influence on exploration, as less frequent exploration may be sufficient given the immense number of learning opportunities afforded to immatures. Quantitatively evaluating the effects of social learning on long-term diet-repertoire development, in relation to animals' key developmental milestones, will reveal the extent to which wild animals are dependent on cultural processes to acquire fundamental information for survival. Peering is frequently followed by exploration of similar objects and thus can enhance learning. b, The same immature, Cinnamon, exploring a large stick. Unlike African apes, orangutans are largely solitary after becoming independent from their mothers (aside from mothers' own close association with younger, dependent offspring). Immature Sumatran orangutans (Pongo abelii) are weaned at around 7.5 years30 but often continue ranging with their mothers until the age of 8–9 years, regularly feeding in close proximity before starting to range independently35. Additional individuals form transient associations with mother–infant dyads, providing further sources of information over shorter timescales27,39. Overall, opportunities for social learning are disproportionately skewed towards earlier years of orangutans' lives, which immatures make use of following initial motor and cognitive development but before the onset of independence, after which further opportunities are relatively rare. Observational data show that by the onset of independence, orangutans have accumulated adult-like diet repertoires27, and the breadth of these knowledge repertoires is probably crucial to support immatures' transition to energetic independence. This developmental milestone therefore presents a so-far-unexploited opportunity to assess whether orangutans are dependent on different forms of social learning to acquire adequately large diet repertoires sufficiently quickly to become independent foragers. However, this question cannot be answered from observational data alone, as documenting all social-learning opportunities afforded to different immatures, over periods of years, is logistically unfeasible. We formulated an empirically-informed agent-based model (ABM) of orangutan diet-repertoire development that was entirely calibrated using over 12 years of behavioural data collected from wild Sumatran orangutans. We directly translated data from wild individuals into model variables that predict the likelihood that simulated immatures (that is, agents) would encounter different foods, enter social states that reflect association and social behaviours (for example, close association proximity or peering), and consequently explore food items to facilitate broad-scale diet learning (thus, simulating the emergent process of orangutans' long-term diet learning through localized interactions, up to the end of an orangutan's immature period at 15 years; Fig. We then validated whether, through exclusively using data-driven inputs, our ABM successfully captured the dynamics of orangutan diet development using observational data from wild immatures. We simulated the developmental trajectory of one immature per ABM iteration. Simulated immatures had no initial knowledge of any available food items. Each day, the ABM generated a series of feeding patches (sampled from a Poisson distribution calibrated to the feeding opportunities of mothers, with a mean of 27 patches), and simulated immatures visited these feeding patches sequentially. Each patch contained one type of food item. If the food item was known to the simulated immature, they were marked as ‘feeding'. To calculate the likelihood of exploration, we assigned a social state to the immature that related to the available forms of social learning. We first calculated the probability that an immature would be alone or associated with a conspecific. If associated with a conspecific, immatures were assigned to either distant association (thus only subject to exposure) or close association (therefore subject to enhancement). Immatures in close association could also then engage in peering at a conspecific (therefore potentially supplementing learning through observation of social partners). The probability of being in each social state was dependent on a simulated immature's age. The likelihood of exploring an unknown food was dependent on an immature's age and social state (and for all combinations of age and social state, there was still a non-zero probability that immatures chose not to explore food items). If a simulated immature had explored a food item enough times to learn how to process it correctly for consumption, the food item was added to their diet repertoire. All model parameters were calibrated using data from Suaq (Methods). Following ABM validation, we experimentally withheld different forms of social learning from cohorts of simulated immatures to assess their potential impact on long-term diet development, first via removing observational social learning through peering, and then more generalized processes of enhancement. We then quantified whether (1) adult-like diets could still emerge by key developmental milestones without these forms of social learning, including solely through exposure to thousands of learning opportunities with different food items during immaturity, and if not (2) the relative importance of different forms of social learning for diet development, estimated via reductions in diet breadth when forms of social learning were withheld from the simulation. A summary of the ABM structure is provided in Fig. 2 (see Methods for a step-by-step description of the ABM process). All data used to calibrate the ABM variables were collected from wild Sumatran orangutans living in the Suaq Balimbing research area (2007–2019), including 2,676 focal follows on 132 individuals, totalling 22,547 observation hours. We identified 262 distinct food items (from 116 identifiable plant species and nine higher-level taxonomic food groups, such as termites). To estimate adult diet-repertoire size, we used the Michaelis–Menten equation to estimate the plateau for cumulative diet-repertoire size with increasing sampling effort for each adult: 248 food items (NAdults = 95; NFollows = 1620; NScans = 402,082; Supplementary Table 2). Wild orangutans' diet repertoires vary between individuals27,42, and orangutans learn a small number of foraging behaviours after becoming independent43. We thus compared simulated immatures' diet repertoires to a reduced threshold (adult-like repertoire), which is 90% of the adult repertoire size (223 food items). To estimate the number of food items that wild immatures are exposed to per day, we calculated the number of feeding patches mothers (and therefore their dependent immatures) visited during daily focal follows (follows at least 10 hours long to capture all feeding behaviours per day). On average, mothers visit 27 feeding patches per day (NMothers = 13; NFollows = 252; Supplementary Table 2). For our ABM, the number of feeding patches encountered per day was generated using a Poisson distribution with a mean of 27 patches. The content of each feeding patch was determined by the relative rates at which different food items are encountered at Suaq (N = 262 possible food types; see the associated data for the probability of encountering different foods). We calibrated the probability that simulated immatures would be in each social state across development using behavioural and association data from wild individuals. These social states were (1) alone; (2) distant association; (3) close association, therefore benefiting from enhancement; and (4) peering, therefore supplementing learning through observation of social partners. To calibrate the probability that simulated immatures were either alone or associated with a conspecific in a given feeding patch, we modelled the age-dependent association rates of wild immatures (NImmatures = 30; NFollows = 362; NScans = 99,264). Age was significantly negatively correlated with association rate (quasibinomial generalized linear mixed model (GLMM): t331 = −6.7; P < 0.001; age = −0.4; 95% confidence interval (CI), (−0.51, −0.28)). Wild immatures were in near-constant association with at least one conspecific (including their mothers) up to the age of 7 to 9 years (in >99% of scans from one to 3 years and in >97% of scans from 4 to 7 years), after which they spent progressively more time ranging alone (Fig. This time period (up to 7 to 9 years) matches the dependency phase, when immatures spend all of their time ranging with their mothers, with additional individuals sometimes associating with the mother–infant dyad for limited time periods. We directly translated the model's prediction of association rates across development into the probability of simulated immatures being associated with a conspecific in a given feeding patch (Supplementary Table 1). Simulated immatures who were not associated with conspecifics in a given feeding patch were marked as alone. a–f, The probability of being associated with a conspecific (a); the probability of being in close association if associated with a conspecific (b); the probability of peering if in close association (c); the probability of exploring when in distant association (d); the probability of exploring when in close association (e); and the probability of exploring following peering (f). For d and e, the smoothed trend lines describe GAMM predictions for all data points. The mean values for each coefficient, at each developmental age, can be found in Supplementary Table 1. Outputs of statistical tests confirming the significance of the regression variables can be found in Supplementary Tables 2–4 as well as in Results. For simulated immatures who were associated with at least one conspecific at a given feeding patch, we modelled the likelihood that they would be in a state of close association (within 10 m) or distant association (10–50 m) with another individual. When they were associated with a conspecific, the likelihood that wild immatures were in close association reduced significantly with age (NImmatures = 28; NFollows = 323; NScans = 78,478; quasibinomial GLMM: t294 = −11.2; P < 0.001; age = −0.339; 95% CI, (−0.4, −0.28)). The probability of being in close association steadily decreased with age between birth and 6 years (97.5% at birth; 83.8% at 6 years), before decreasing more rapidly over subsequent years (Fig. By the final year of immaturity (14 years), wild individuals spent 25.5% of their time in close association with at least one conspecific. We used these values to calibrate the probability of a simulated immature being in close association across development, when associated with at least one conspecific at a feeding patch. All simulated immatures who were associated with at least one conspecific in a feeding patch, but not in close association, were marked as being in distant association. Immature orangutans regularly peer at conspecifics, and given that peering is frequently directed at older individuals (usually mothers44) as well as rare and skill-intense behaviours38, peering occurs in contexts where learning can be expected. We modelled wild immatures' peering rates when in close association across development (NImmatures = 28; NFollows = 311; NScans = 66,501). We found a significant negative relationship between the probability of peering at a conspecific and age when in close association (quasibinomial GLMM: t282 = −4.52; P < 0.001; age = −0.12; 95% CI, (−0.17, −0.07); Fig. We directly translated this relationship into the age-dependent probability that simulated immatures would be in the peering state when in close association in a given feeding patch. Immature orangutans have a generalized drive to explore, which is dependent on their age and can be further enhanced by environmental factors and their social state27,35,38,39,44,45,46. We therefore calibrated exploration rates to both age and social state using behavioural data from wild immatures. Exploration rates were significantly higher when wild immatures were in close association than in distant association (NImmatures = 30; NFollows = 364; NScans = 81,153; binomial generalized additive mixed model (GAMM) with close and distant association as categorical factors; χ2(effective degrees of freedom = 9.84) = 1,754.25, P < 0.001; Fig. In both conditions, exploration rates peaked during the first few years of life (between 1 and 3 years of age), before decreasing over subsequent ages (Fig. Across development, we set the mean exploration rates of simulated immatures in close and distant association to be equal to the probability of wild immatures exploring in either association condition. As wild immatures spend virtually all of their time in association up to 7 to 9 years (see above), we could not estimate an exploration rate for immatures who are alone at these ages. We therefore set the exploration rate when simulated immatures were alone to be the same as when in distant association. To determine whether peering influences exploration, we compared the probability that wild immatures explored food items in the hour before and the hour after peering. We found a significant difference in the rate of exploration in the hour after peering (probability of exploration, 67.7%; 95% CI, (59.8%, 74.7%); NImmatures = 13; NFollows = 86; NPeeringEvents = 238; data refined to peering events where food items had not been explored before peering), compared with the hour before peering events (33.5%; 95% CI, (26%, 42%); NImmatures = 14; NFollows = 101; NPeeringEvents = 367), indicating that peering is associated with significantly higher exploration rates. The exact relationship between peering and exploration was age-dependent, with peering being more likely to be followed by exploration at older ages (NImmatures = 14; NFollows = 101; NPeeringEvents = 367; binomial GLMM: Z = 2.57; P = 0.0102; age = 0.12; 95% CI, (0.03, 0.22); Fig. To ensure that this result was not an artefact of small sample sizes at ages above 6 years old, we replicated our analysis using data between the ages of birth and 6 years, which found a similar effect (NImmatures = 8; NFollows = 90; NPeeringEvents = 348; binomial GLMM: Z = 2.39; P = 0.017; age = 0.14; 95% CI, (0.03, 0.25)). These results confirm that, while peering behaviours are performed less frequently at older ages (especially once orangutans establish independence), instances of peering at older ages are more likely to be followed by exploration of food items. We used the predicted probability of exploring after peering at each age to calibrate the likelihood that simulated immatures would explore food items when in the peering state. To assess whether social learning influences the size of emerging diet repertoires by key developmental milestones, we ran three sets of simulations where simulated immatures had access to different combinations of social learning (250 iterations per treatment): Exposure, Enhancement and Peering: in a given feeding patch, simulated immatures could be allocated to any of the four social states, including alone or distant association (thus benefiting from exposure), close association (thus also benefiting from enhancement) or peering (thus benefiting from upregulated exploration following social observation). Exposure and Enhancement: an identical protocol, but simulated immatures could not engage in peering. Exposure Only: an identical protocol, but simulated immatures could not engage in peering or enter close association with a conspecific at a feeding patch. Across simulations, we compared the mean repertoire sizes at two key milestones: (1) the onset of independence from the mother (that is, the maximum age of independence, 9 years, after which immatures are responsible for their own energy intake through independent foraging) and (2) the end of immaturity (that is, the age of females' first reproduction, 15 years). By the end of immaturity, simulated immatures (N = 750) had visited an average of 147,807 feeding patches (s.d. = 382). Of the simulated immatures who could enter close association with conspecifics and engage in peering (Exposure, Enhancement and Peering), 78.4% of individuals developed adult-like diet repertoires by the end of immaturity (196/250 individuals; Fig. The mean age at which these simulated immatures developed adult-like diet repertoires was 7.5 years (95% CI, (7.25, 7.84 years)). We found no significant difference between the mean age at which adult-like repertoires emerged in these simulated immatures and the age at which adult-like repertoires develop in wild individuals (that is, mean age of independence at Suaq, 8.2 years; 95% CI, (7.7, 8.6 years); NWild = 8; Linear Model: t202 = 0.85; P = 0.398; wild = 0.63; 95% CI, (−0.84, 2.11)). Across all simulated immatures in this treatment, the mean repertoire size at the onset of independence reached the adult-like threshold (224 food items; 95% CI, (221, 226); adult-like threshold, 223 food items; total foods available in the environment, 262). These results confirm that our model captures both the learning trajectory and outcomes observed in wild immatures, thus validating our ABM's real-world relevance. a, Diet-repertoire development over simulated time. The minimum and maximum ages for the onset of independence are indicated by vertical dashed purple lines. The Zone of No Exposure (contained between grey dashed lines) indicates all possible outcomes if we also modified the rate at which simulated immature orangutans were exposed to different food items (thus, a theoretical baseline control for the removal of peering, enhancement and exposure; see Extended Data Fig. 1 for simulations of development within this zone). For each treatment, a weighted curve indicates the mean repertoire size across development, and the shaded region around each curve indicates ±1 standard deviation of the mean. b, Diet-repertoire size of simulated immatures at the maximum age for the onset of independence (nine years). c, Diet-repertoire size at the end of immaturity (15 years). For b and c, N = 250 simulations per treatment. Experimental treatments are indicated in different colours. Three asterisks (***) indicate a significant difference between treatments of P < 0.001, with significance determined by a Poisson GLM (two-sided tests; all means compared in the same model; see ‘Simulated diet-repertoire development'). When simulated immatures were prevented from peering (Exposure and Enhancement), the rate of diet development was initially similar to before; however, diet development began to slow across the dependency period, leading to the development of smaller diets (Fig. When peering and close association states were removed (Exposure Only), diet learning was initially slow, followed by rapid expansion and then a subsequent plateau in development (this mirrored the exploration rates in distant association over development; Fig. Slower diet development without social learning was reflected in significantly smaller diets at the onset of independence (compared with Exposure, Enhancement and Peering: Exposure and Enhancement: Z = −8.3; P < 0.001; −11 food items; 95% CI on diet reduction, (−13, −9 foods); Exposure Only: Z = −58.3; P < 0.001; −72 food items; 95% CI on diet reduction, (−74, −69 foods)) and at the end of immaturity (Exposure, Enhancement and Peering, 226 food items; in comparison, Exposure and Enhancement: Z = −9.25; P < 0.001; −12 food items; 95% CI on diet reduction, (−15, −9 foods); Enhancement Only: Z = −58.2; P < 0.001; −72 food items; 95% CI on diet reduction, (−70, −75 foods)). Overall, only 1.6% of simulated immatures (4/250 individuals) developed adult-like repertoires by the end of immaturity when they were prevented from peering (Exposure and Enhancement). When simulated immatures were prevented from both peering and entering close association (Exposure Only), no immatures developed adult-like diet repertoires by the end of immaturity. Given that immatures are virtually always accompanied by their mothers in the wild, we could not remove the effects of exposure on diet development in a data-driven manner. Instead, we provide a general ‘Zone of No Exposure' to visualize the range of possible developmental trajectories if exposure was limited (Fig. We provide tentative internal resolution for developmental trajectories within this zone using step-wise reductions in the mean number of foods simulated immatures encountered each day (Discussion and Extended Data Fig. Humans habitually accelerate their information acquisition through social learning and accumulate extensive, culturally dependent repertoires of socially transmitted information. We demonstrate that these effects exist within the culture of a non-human species: the Sumatran orangutan. Our simulation of orangutan diet-repertoire development was entirely calibrated using long-term data from the wild. When this model included multiple forms of social learning that previous studies have suggested are important for orangutan diet development38,39,44, it simulated diet-repertoire development that accurately matched the outcomes and timing observed in wild individuals. This validation ensured that, using exclusively data-driven inputs, our model produced a trajectory of diet development comparable to that of wild orangutans47. We then evaluated the long-term effects of removing forms of social learning on this developmental trajectory. The removal of even one form of social learning from our ABM—peering—significantly decelerated diet-repertoire development and prevented the reliable emergence of adult-like diet repertoires during immaturity. This effect was further exacerbated when both peering and enhancement were removed, where no simulated immatures developed adult-like diet repertoires (Fig. Despite simulated immatures visiting approximately 148,000 feeding patches during their immature period, these highly recurrent opportunities to encounter different food items were not sufficient for broad-scale diet development without the additional effects of peering and enhancement on immatures' exploration. Moreover, diets reliably developed to adult-like breadths by the onset of independence (a key milestone for wild individuals) only when both peering and enhancement were included within the ABM. Our findings therefore support the hypotheses that social learning accelerates orangutan diet-repertoire development and ultimately produces adult diets that are broader than any one individual could construct independently (or even when orangutans could still benefit from broad-scale exposure). The removal of enhancement effects on immatures' exploration (once peering had also been removed) had a much greater impact on repertoire development than the removal of peering alone. As many of the food items in orangutan diets involve relatively simple preingestive processing behaviours44, enhancement is probably sufficient to acquire this (largest) proportion of orangutans' diet repertoires. The removal of peering behaviours had a smaller but significant effect on repertoire size in our simulation. Observational social learning through peering potentially plays an important role in enabling orangutans to acquire more complex food-processing behaviours (for example, those with a greater number of processing steps). This hypothesis is supported by wild immatures peering more frequently at food items that are rare and require multi-step processing behaviours38. We did not program simulated immatures to peer more frequently at complex foods, as we lacked sufficient data to reliably estimate exploration after peering if foods were categorized by complexity level. We also confined the effect of peering to its effect on exploration rates (as observed in the wild), without consideration of additional information that individuals may acquire about food-processing behaviours during social observation (not quantifiable using the available data). Consequently, our model offers conservative estimates for the importance of peering for incorporating complex foods into an individual's diet. Prior studies of cultural dependence in animals have traditionally focused on whether particular cultural traits are too complex for naive individuals to innovate from scratch11,12,13,14, or whether, through cumulative cultural evolution, traits reach a level of efficiency that individuals cannot reach through iterative practice alone48,49,50. Whether individual animals possess a breadth of cultural knowledge that exceeds individual innovation—and thus, culturally dependent repertoires—has by contrast been a neglected question. However, the breadth of cultural knowledge possessed by an individual probably has important effects on their fitness, particularly in the foraging context, where foraging-related information can modulate the total number of calories and nutrients acquired during daily activity17. While the acquisition of highly technical skills may also help overcome such issues—as in the case of sophisticated tool-use behaviours used for foraging—the fitness consequences of not learning specific technical skills may prove smaller than the fitness costs of missing out on large proportions of available food species in an individual's environment. Even for orangutans, highly complex foraging behaviours—including those requiring tools—occupy a fraction of their diet and feeding time51. Diet breadth in wild apes, including to the extent of cultural dependence, probably has the potential to modulate considerable aspects of an individual's fitness. Future research should aim to quantify these fitness effects in more detail, such as through estimating the possible costs of individual learning used to compensate for reduced diet breadths, or through evaluating the consequences of reduced diet size for individuals' daily calorie intake, especially following the onset of independence. During this time, immatures are at specific risk, as they face considerable energetic demands to support their own development while still lacking adult-level proficiency in foraging-related skills32,33. Building on our results, further understanding the fitness consequences of reduced diet breadth for calorie and nutrient gain—and its consequences for survival and reproduction—will be informative for planning effective reintroduction strategies used for orphaned wild orangutans. Currently, such reintroduction programmes teach immatures survival-relevant knowledge and skills before reintroduction to the wild through ‘forest schools'52,53. These programmes should continue to consider the importance of social learning for orangutan diet development, including the necessary sizes and compositions of taught repertoires that maximize survival likelihood post-reintroduction. The existence of culturally dependent diet repertoires in orangutans raises the question of whether orangutan diets represent heritable and stable sets of cultural knowledge54, produced by the exploration and learning of many individuals across generations. The diet repertoires of immature orangutans closely reflect those of their mothers, suggesting that repertoires are inherited across generations27,44. However, immatures also make use of social interactions with non-maternal adults to enhance learning38,39, and upon reaching adulthood, males ranging into new areas employ peering behaviours to acquire information about previously unencountered foods43. These findings suggest that diet repertoires can be additionally shaped by oblique and horizontal information transmission. Further research into the stability and heritability of orangutan diets will hold the key for understanding the fidelity with which they are culturally transmitted across generations. Moreover, along with our findings, this research may further clarify whether variation in diets observed between orangutan populations55—and between populations of other apes—is the product of intergenerational cultural inheritance. Like all ABMs, our model is a careful simplification of reality that permits characterization of how localized behaviours influence a complex system47,56. In calibrating and validating our ABM using long-term real-world data, we faced some limitations, which required us to construct our model in a way that probably led to conservative estimates of the effects of social learning on diet development (also see Supplementary Information section 1): First, we did not experimentally remove exposure as a form of social learning, despite its likely importance for diet learning37. Wild dependent immatures cannot survive without mothers, as they rely on energetic supplements through nursing while they learn vital information and skills for survival30,35,57. Dependent immatures also benefit from locomotor support when being carried through sections of the canopy57,58 and the provision of suitable sleeping environments through nest sharing35. As dependent immatures are never without their mother, we could not estimate how frequently dependent immatures would be able to find, explore and consume food items in the environment without being guided to feeding patches. We argue that without exposure, diets are likely to be significantly smaller than those we have estimated (see ‘Zone of No Exposure' in Fig. 4a), and we outline some tentative results for how variable exposure rates could influence diet development in Extended Data Fig. However, we predict that without the crucial maternal effects that accompany exposure, dependent immatures are unlikely to survive even for short periods. Future research should aim to further quantify the importance of exposure for diet learning (using ethically informed approaches, such as testing how social environments influence novel food acceptance in captivity37). Second, we focused on the importance of two forms of social learning: enhancement and observational social learning through peering. These forms of social learning are observed frequently in the wild; however, we acknowledge that additional forms of social learning are available to orangutans, such as food solicitations59,60. Food sharing is performed at low rates by mother–offspring dyads up to the onset of independence60, usually for difficult-to-process food items. Given that these behaviours are comparatively rare, we could not realistically estimate whether they influence long-term diet-repertoire development. It is possible that such episodes facilitate fully matured diet-repertoire development, and their relative contribution should be assessed where possible. Third, smaller diet repertoires may increase hunger and hence produce a greater motivation to find new food items through independent exploration. We did not program simulated immatures to upregulate their exploration behaviours if diet repertoires were too small, as the dynamics of this could not be estimated from wild data. Mature rehabilitant orangutans (who have smaller diets) can sometimes upregulate exploration following release to the wild61; however, this frequent exploration also comes with detectable risks of consuming one of the numerous toxic species that occur in orangutans' natural habitats52,61,62. Fatal feeding errors have been reported during the reintroduction of some primate species to novel habitats52,61,63; therefore, upregulation of unguided, independent exploration may be risky for diet expansion, with possibly devastating fitness consequences. We conclude that orangutans' diets are culturally dependent knowledge repertoires possessed by a non-human species, and that orangutans' diets develop sufficiently quickly only through social learning. The ability to construct culturally dependent breadths of knowledge may have been shared by the most recent common ancestor of humans and the other great apes around 13–15 million years ago64. Our findings also provide evidence that the cultural knowledge possessed by the common ancestors of hominids—and species across the hominin lineage—may have included basic subsistence knowledge used for day-to-day decision-making and was potentially broader than surviving artefacts suggest. Further research is required to understand whether wild individuals of other ape and non-ape species possess culturally dependent knowledge repertoires, with species whose diet repertoires vary in size and breadth between populations offering suitable candidates for validation. Characterizing broad-scale development of other types of socially acquired, fitness-relevant knowledge may unveil additional examples of culturally dependent repertoires, such as for sociocommunicative behaviours65,66,67, navigation68 or construction behaviours such as nest building69. This research may reveal that cultural processes modulate the extended breadth of knowledge possessed by many wild animals, which could consequently shape their evolution. Approval for data collection protocols at Suaq was provided by the Indonesian State Ministry for Research and Technology (RISTEKDIKTI) and the National Research and Innovation Agency (BRIN). The reporting of this study meets ARRIVE guidelines. We simulated the developmental trajectory of orangutan diet repertoires day by day for the duration of their immature period, up to the approximate age of first reproduction (15 years). Simulated immatures initially had no known food items in their diet repertoire. Each day, we generated the number of feeding patches a simulated immature would visit by sampling from a Poisson distribution, with a mean equal to the mean number of patches orangutan mothers at Suaq visit per day (27 feeding patches). For each feeding patch, we generated a single type of food item on the basis of the rates at which different foods were encountered at Suaq. Additionally, for each feeding patch, a simulated immature was assigned one of four social states: (1) alone, (2) distant association, (3) close association and (4) peering. These four states were chosen because wild immatures exhibit more frequent exploratory behaviours when closely associated with conspecifics44 and after peering38. In the wild, the probabilities of being in close association with a conspecific and engaging in peering, and the resultant likelihood of exploring food items in both of these contexts, all change over the course of development27,44,58. We therefore calibrated the probability that simulated immatures explored the food item in a feeding patch by both their age and their social state, using estimates from long-term data on wild orangutans. If a simulated immature performed an exploration behaviour, this exploration was logged in a list of explorations performed by the immature across their lifetime. At the point when a particular food item had been explored enough times to meet a minimum threshold for learning, this food item was added to the simulated immature's diet repertoire (with the number of required explorations being scaled to the complexity of the food item's associated processing behaviour). If a simulated immature encountered a food item that was already present in their diet repertoire (and therefore known), their behaviour was marked as ‘feeding'. Our simulated immatures did not move around a simulated space (that is, our ABM is spatially implicit) but instead were presented with food items and social environments that reflect the opportunities presented to wild orangutans (akin to individuals being positioned in front of a ‘conveyor belt' of food patches, which they are exposed to in turn, alongside a generated social state for each patch). This allowed us to calibrate our model precisely to reflect the opportunities afforded to immatures in the wild and circumvent unnecessary error introduced through estimations of movement rates across simulated environments. All steps to verify that our model operates following programmed protocols can be found in this Article's associated code. All ABM coefficients were calibrated using data from wild individuals. Further information about the statistical models we used to analyse data from wild individuals—including the rationale behind the choices of our models and their structure—can be found in Supplementary Information section 2 (alongside all model summaries and all resulting coefficients for the ABM; Supplementary Tables 2–5). The experimental treatments we applied to our ABM are outlined in Results, and for each experimental treatment, we ran 250 iterations (a compromise between large sample size and available computational power). When analysing data from wild individuals, we used all available data where possible (unless otherwise specified for a particular analysis), and these sample sizes are comparable to or larger than those of similar studies27,29,30,38,39,42,43,44,45,57,58,59,60,69. We calibrated our model using data on wild orangutan behaviours collected at Suaq Balimbing (South Aceh, Indonesia). Since 1994, data have been collected at Suaq through daily focal follows, where observers collect behavioural and association data using instantaneous scan sampling at 2-minute intervals. All-occurrence sampling of key behaviours is also performed during this time frame—for example, on peering behaviours (the full protocol for data collection can be found at https://www.ab.mpg.de/571325/standarddatacollectionrules_suaq_detailed_jan204.pdf). We sampled data collected between 2007 and 2019, including 2,676 follows on 132 individuals. All individuals included in this study are well known and form part of long-term data collection at Suaq. The ages of immature individuals were estimated on the basis of known births or physical characteristics at their first encounter. Immature individuals are classed as ‘dependent immatures' up until the age they are observed ranging independently from their mothers for at least two consecutive follows. After this age, immatures are classed as ‘independent'. Following the onset of independence, associations with mothers and other individuals become progressively less frequent35. Opportunities to benefit from other individuals' diet knowledge thus become rarer, and immatures must increasingly rely on their own foraging knowledge for survival. Individuals are classified as adults once they reach the average age at which females first reproduce (15 years30; females who reproduced before this age are classed as adults from the age they give birth to their first offspring). Whenever the focal individual was feeding or exploring a food item at a 2-minute scan, the food item was noted. Food items are recorded at Suaq as a combination of the consumed species and, where relevant, the part of the species being consumed. For plants, food items are differentiated according to the organ(s) being consumed (for example, ‘Leaf', ‘Fruit', ‘Pith', ‘Bark', ‘Flower', ‘Seeds' or the general vegetative material of the plant, ‘Veg'). Food items were classified according to the complexity of the behaviour required to process the item before ingestion29 (on a ranked scale from 0 to 5; see below), including all steps to acquire edible material and dispose of waste. Items eaten whole (for example, many types of leaves) are marked at complexity level 0. Each additional processing step (for example, peeling or spitting out inedible material) increases the complexity score by one. Using the Michaelis–Menten equation permitted us to estimate the asymptote in repertoire size as a function of sample effort (Vmax). This asymptote was taken to be representative of the total adult repertoire size. To estimate the mean number of feeding patches that wild dependent immatures visit in a day, we used the number of feeding patches visited by their mothers. Dependent immatures consistently follow mothers through their home range57,58 and are therefore exposed to a similar number of feeding patches—and array of different food items—per day. The number of feeding patches visited per day can be reliably estimated for mothers, as immatures may not feed if a food is not yet within their diet repertoire (that is, if it is unknown). We inferred the number of feeding patches that mothers visited via counting the continuous periods in which mothers consumed specific food items, as recorded in the focal follow data. We did not pay attention to breaks from feeding introduced by other behaviours that took place at feeding patches (for example, nursing or resting). Our estimates include the possibility that mothers visit multiple feeding patches across a given day that contain the same food. To model the average number of feeding patches visited by mothers, we constructed a Poisson GLMM to model the mean number of feeding patches encountered per follow, with focal ID as a random intercept. To model the content of feeding patches, we estimated the probability of different food items being encountered across all follows for all adult orangutans. Including data from all adults ensured that our sample size was sufficiently large to yield reliable estimates of the probability of encountering all food items at Suaq, including foods that are rarely eaten. For each food item, we counted the number of follows (and therefore days) this food item was available for consumption (its food item frequency). By dividing each food item frequency by the sum total of all frequencies, we generated a discrete probability distribution for the probability of encountering different food items, which is proportional to how frequently each food is observed being consumed in the focal follow data (see the associated data for the full list of food items and their probabilities of being encountered). Each feeding patch contained a single type of food item; while different foods can occur in close physical proximity in the wild (for example, leaves and fruits from the same tree may be considered both in the same patch), restricting each patch to one food item closely resembled how we estimated the number of different feeding patches mothers encountered per day (where swapping between foods in close proximity would have been considered feeding in different patches). If the simulated immature encountered a food item that was not in its diet repertoire, our ABM assigned that immature as being in one of four social states: alone, distant association, close association or peering. The social states of close association and peering relate to possible forms of social learning available to wild immatures (including processes of enhancement and observational social learning, respectively). The probability of a simulated immature being in each social state was determined by a hierarchy of decisions. First, is the simulated immature associated with a conspecific? If not, they are assigned the state alone for that specific feeding patch. Second, if associated with a conspecific, is the simulated immature in close association? If so, for that feeding patch, they are assigned the state close association; otherwise, they are assigned the state distant association. Third, if in close association, is the simulated immature peering? If so, they are assigned the state peering for that feeding patch. We estimated the probabilities of simulated immatures being in each social state using focal follow data for wild individuals within their first 15 years of life. We also estimated their probability of exploring food items when in each social state across this developmental period (see ‘Exploration rates across development'). To estimate the probability of a simulated immature being associated with a social partner, we counted the number of scans where a focal individual was within 50 m of at least one conspecific (and therefore in association) per follow, versus those in which they were outside this range and classified as alone. We calculated the probability of an immature being associated with a conspecific at different ages using a quasibinomial GLMM (with data points weighted by the total number of scans per follow and with focal ID included as a random intercept). At each age, the probability of being alone was 1 − pAge(associated). For all scans where an individual was in association, we determined the probability of being in close or distant association. An analysis of our data showed that orangutan exploration rates when within 0–10 m of a conspecific were very similar across ages; however, at greater distances (10–50 m) exploration rates across ages were much lower. We therefore defined close association as being within 10 m of at least one conspecific. For each follow, we divided the number of scans where an individual was associated with a conspecific into those where they were in close and distant association. We then modelled the probability of being in close association when associated with a conspecific at different ages, using a quasibinomial GLMM (with data points weighted by the total number of scans for each follow and with focal ID as a random intercept). At each age, we set the probability of simulated immatures being in close association (if associated with another individual) to be equal to that for wild individuals, and pAge(distant association) was 1 − pAge(close association). When in close association, orangutans may perform close-range observation of the behaviour and/or objects manipulated by conspecifics (peering). To estimate how peering rates change with age, we used a quasibinomial GLMM comparing the number of close association scans where an individual was peering with the number of scans where an individual was not peering (weighted by the total number of scans in close association and with focal ID as a random intercept). We used this rate as the probability of simulated immatures peering when in close association in a feeding patch at a given age. The majority of great ape learning is facilitated through exploration, which can be mediated and enhanced through social interactions27,38,39,40. Exploration is defined as repetitive, often destructive manipulation (including failed feeding attempts) of objects (including food items), while the visual and tactile foci of the individual are on the object27,72. To quantify the effects of these different social factors on the probability of exploration, we modelled the probability of wild immatures exploring when in distant and close association, as well as after peering. It was not possible to accurately estimate the exploration rates of wild orangutans when alone at all ages, as dependent individuals spend virtually all of their time in association with their mothers. We therefore set simulated immatures' exploration rates when alone to be equal to the exploration rate at distant association for each age. We estimated how the exploration rates of wild immatures change over development, including when in both distant and close association. For each follow, we sampled all behaviour scans where an immature was in association, and we counted the number of scans where the focal immature was performing an exploration behaviour versus scans describing any other behaviour. We partitioned these counts into those where an individual was in close and distant association. To control for the effect of peering (which can increase exploration rates; see below), we excluded exploration scans where an orangutan had peered at a food item of the same species within the previous hour. We controlled for peering at the level of the species of the food item, because if an immature is drawn to a species of food following peering, they may choose to explore multiple parts (for example, leaves or bark). We modelled the probability of exploration over age for both association categories (close and distant) using a binomial GAMM (with follow number and focal ID as random intercepts and with our model weighted by the total number of scans sampled in each association proximity condition per follow). We translated the model's mean exploration probability at each age into the exploration rates of simulated immatures when in distant and close association. To estimate exploration rates following peering, we used a subset of the follow data where observers recorded peering events on an all-occurrence basis. For each follow, we recorded each instance (or the last instance in case of peering events in close succession) when an immature peered at a specific species of food item, and whether the immature explored this food item within the following hour (coded as a binary Y/N). We determined whether peering had a significant effect on the exploration rate by comparing the probability of exploring a food item after peering (if the food item had not already been explored in the hour before) with the probability of exploring food items in the hour prior to peering events (a baseline for exploration in contexts that may elicit peering, such as around novel foods). For both of these scenarios, we used binomial GLMMs with focal ID as a random factor. We also estimated whether the effect of peering on exploration probability changed over the course of development. We modelled the proportion of peering events that were followed by exploration behaviours in the subsequent hour, compared with those that were not followed by exploration during the same time frame, for wild immatures across the first 15 years of development (binomial GLMM with focal ID as a random factor and weighted by the number of data points at each age). Model estimates were then translated into the probability of simulated immatures exploring in the peering state at each age. The total amount of exposure wild immatures require to learn how to process a food item depends on the number of processing steps that must be performed before it can be ingested29 (herein considered a food item's complexity). We therefore scaled the number of explorations that simulated immatures require to learn how to consume food items by their complexity. To estimate the number of times wild immatures explored food items of each complexity category prior to learning how to eat them, we first sampled the five most common food items of each complexity category and determined the earliest age at which wild orangutans were observed consuming each food item using focal follow data (the earliest estimated learning age). We restricted this analysis to immatures who had been followed since at least the age of 1 year, ensuring that the first age that food items were observed being consumed was probably close to the age of learning. To estimate the number of times a species of food item was encountered before an individual learned how to process and eat it, we calculated the rate at which food items occurred in adult focal follows (their probability of being encountered each day). We multiplied this number by the number of days preceding the individual's estimated age of learning (that is, the total number of days spent foraging prior to learning). We then estimated the number of times an immature explored a food item prior to learning how successfully eat it, by multiplying the number of encounters by the mean exploration rate across the dependency phase. Across the five most frequent food items of each complexity category, we averaged the estimated number of explorations required for learning. As more complex food items are rarely encountered, this analysis permitted us to estimate the required number of explorations for complexity categories 0–2 (foods of category 0 required one exploration, category 1 required two explorations and category 2 required two explorations). We extrapolated this trend to higher complexity categories by incremental increases of one exploration for every two increasing steps in complexity (three explorations for category 3, three explorations for category 4 and four explorations for category 5).

This figure is a recreation of Fig. 4 in the main manuscript, but includes additional scenarios where the number of feeding patches visited by simulated immatures in the ‘Exposure Only' treatment was systematically varied (N = 250 simulations for each scenario). The numbers for each simulation depict the mean number of feeding patches simulated immatures visited per day. This graph provides some internal resolution to the ‘Zone of No Exposure' (see Fig. 4), by highlighting how reduced opportunities for exposure can also limit diet development; however, it is important to reiterate that these model does not account for individuals' survivability in each scenario. We predict that without maternal influences (thus, reducing exposure), it becomes increasingly unlikely that dependent immatures would survive for long enough to accumulate information about available foods in the wild. Thus, these precise trajectories presented within the ‘Zone of No Exposure' should be interpreted with caution.

Fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma (FLC) is a rare form of liver cancer affecting children and young adults that is driven by a chimeric protein, DNAJ-PKAc. The development of molecular inhibitors of DNAJ-PKAc has been hampered by unacceptable on-target toxicity, but the chimera results in a tumor-specific antigen (neoantigen) that may be targeted immunologically. Here we conducted a phase 1 clinical trial of a therapeutic peptide vaccine targeting DNAJ-PKAc (FLC-Vac), in combination with nivolumab and ipilimumab, in children and adults with advanced FLC, who had not previously received immune checkpoint therapy. The primary objectives were safety and T cell responses after week 10 (priming phase). Of the 16 patients enrolled, 12 completed the vaccine priming phase and were evaluable for both immunological and clinical endpoints. Grade 3 treatment-related adverse events were reported by six patients (37.5%). DNAJ-PKAc-specific T cell responses were detected in 9 of 12 patients after treatment. All patients with clinical responses also had DNAJ-PKAc-specific T cell responses, from which we identified multiple class-II-restricted T cell receptors with specificity for DNAJ-PKAc. Correlates of response included both functional neoantigen reactivity and changes in T cell receptor repertoire features over time. Immune escape in two patients corresponded with immune exhaustion rather than neoantigen escape or human leukocyte antigen loss. Our findings demonstrate the potential for therapeutic vaccines targeting ‘undruggable' oncogenic drivers and suggest a rubric for evaluating effective anti-neoantigen immunity. Fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma (FLC) is a type of liver cancer that typically affects children and young adults. There is no standard systemic therapy for FLC1,2, and the median survival for patients with unresectable FLC is approximately 12 months3. The FLC transcriptome is characterized by an in-frame fusion (DNAJB1::PRKACA), yielding a chimeric protein, DNAJ-PKAc4. Molecularly targeted therapies have revolutionized the management of some fusion-driven cancers (for example, ALK, ROS1 and NTRK)5; but efforts to develop specific inhibitors for FLC have been limited by unacceptable on-target toxicity1. Alternative strategies to target DNAJ-PKAc in FLC are urgently needed. Neoantigens derived from oncogenic fusions can induce antitumor immunity6. Recent data indicate that DNAJ-PKAc is immunogenic7,8. A patient with FLC who participated in a personalized vaccine program developed immunity against DNAJ-PKAc after vaccination that was associated with prolonged disease-free survival after undergoing resection of FLC tumors. This allows a single vaccine to be broadly applicable for patients with FLC. Here, we prospectively evaluated the safety and immunogenicity of a vaccine targeting DNAJ-PKAc (containing a synthetic long peptide spanning the chimera, with a poly-ICLC adjuvant), combined with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) therapy, in children and adults with FLC. From April 2020 to September 2022, 16 patients with unresectable FLC were enrolled (Fig. The pilcrow (¶) signifies the evaluable population and included all patients who received at least one dose of vaccine and had baseline and post-treatment T cell measures at 10 weeks. Four patients were not evaluable as patients came off the study before obtaining post-treatment T cell measures at 10 weeks. c, The change from baseline in the target lesion diameter according to RECIST, version 1.1. d, A spider plot of radiographic responses to treatment.

ITT, intention to treat; ORR, overall response rate; PD, progressive disease; PR, partial response; SD, stable disease; SLD, sum of longest diameters of the target lesions. The first three patients (age ≥18 years) received one cycle of vaccine monotherapy before starting combination therapy with nivolumab and ipilimumab (Fig. As no unacceptable toxicities occurred during the vaccine lead-in, the trial progressed to full enrollment. Among the four early discontinuations, three were due to clinical progression, one due to elevated liver function tests (this patient subsequently achieved a response in combination with gemcitabine and oxaliplatin chemotherapy). Because vaccine-induced immunity typically takes several weeks to manifest, we focused our analysis on the 12 patients who completed the priming phase. The median progression-free survival (PFS) was 8.5 months (95% confidence interval (CI) 4.1– not reached (n.r. )), and the median overall survival was not reached (n.r.) All three responding FLC cancers were mismatch repair proficient, had low tumor mutational burden (<10 mutations per megabase) and absent PDL1 expression (PDL1 <1%). Two responders discontinued therapy to undergo resection of residual disease, subsequently achieving no evidence of disease. The third, a 13-year-old, completed 2 years of therapy with an ongoing response. Toxicity was evaluated in all patients who received at least one dose of study drug(s) (n = 16, Table 2). The most common vaccine-related adverse events were injection site reactions (16/16, 100%), headaches (8/16, 50%) and fatigue (7/16, 45%), all grade ≤2. Grade 3 treatment-related adverse effects were reported by six patients (6/16, 37.5%) and were broadly consistent with ipilimumab plus nivolumab in other tumor types. No grade 4 or 5 events were observed. To investigate the mechanisms underlying the observed clinical activity, we used ex vivo IFNγ ELISpot assays to measure T cell responses against DNAJ-PKAc in the peripheral blood at multiple time points. Positive responses were defined as a ≥2.5-fold increase in IFN-γ-producing DNAJ-PKAc-specific T cells compared with an unstimulated control. Responses against the full-length vaccinated peptide were observed in 8.3% of patients (1/12) at baseline and 75% (9/12) at post-vaccination time points (Fig. 2), including all patients with clinical objective responses. Of the nine post-treatment responses against the full-length peptide, five out of nine also recognized at least one nine-amino-acid minimal epitope (Fig. The intensity and timing of peak ELISpot responses varied by clinical outcome (Fig. We did not observe any correlation between the number of DNAJ-PKAc fusion neoepitopes predicted for patients' human leukocyte antigen (HLA) type and their ELISpot response or clinical outcome (Supplementary Tables 1–3), indicating that predicted neoepitope presentation (or lack thereof) is not sufficient to explain functional or clinical responses. a, Pie charts illustrating the distribution of clinical responses among ELISpot nonresponders and ELISpot responders. of three replicate wells per condition) against the full 24-amino-acid peptide (peptide 9), eight overlapping 9-amino-acid peptides (peptides 1–8) spanning the chimera, negative controls (medium-only and unstimulated) and positive control (CEF peptide pool, consists of epitopes from cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus and influenza (flu)).

To further characterize peptide-specific T cell subsets, we performed in vitro stimulations using the FLC peptide or an irrelevant peptide corresponding to a neoantigen that is not known to be expressed by FLC tumors (KRAS G12D). CyTOF analysis revealed notable post-treatment increases in effector (CD3+CD8+), effector memory (CD62L−CD44+) and central memory (CD62L+CD44+) T cell populations, potentially enabling durable responses in some patients (Fig. Although therapeutic cancer vaccines can induce exhaustion in some contexts, we did not observe an increase in PD1+TIM3+ T cells from baseline to early on treatment or any appreciable change over time (Extended Data Fig. These data suggest that the vaccine expands polyfunctional, antigen-experienced and memory T cell responses, predominantly driven by CD4+ T helper cells. We also profiled changes in patients' peripheral blood T cell receptor (TCR) repertoires at multiple time points using TIRTL-seq9, a high-throughput paired TCR sequencing technology, to identify response-associated features (Extended Data Fig. Dynamic repertoire changes were observed in all 12 patients (Extended Data Fig. Patients receiving vaccine monotherapy for the first cycle (patient (P)6, P14 and P16) showed fewer expanded TCR clones at C2D1 compared with those receiving concurrent vaccine and ICIs, suggesting that the addition of ICIs to vaccine therapy may augment clonal expansions beyond those elicited by vaccine alone. After two or more cycles of treatment, both groups had similar numbers of expanded clones (Fig. To assess if expanding clones in peripheral blood also infiltrated tumors, paired pre- and post-treatment biopsies were analyzed. Although biopsies from distinct lesions showed little overlap, all six patients with paired samples exhibited increased tumor infiltration of peripherally expanding clones post-treatment (Supplementary Fig. 2), indicating that peripheral changes reflect intratumoral TCR repertoire shifts. We then examined whether characteristics of expanding TCR clones differed between responders and nonresponders. It is well established that effective immune responses against immunodominant epitopes frequently involve groups of TCRs with shared sequence features10, so we first quantified TCR sequence similarity of longitudinally expanded clones within and across patient repertoires using TCRdist11, then constructed similarity networks visualizing clusters of TCRs with closely related amino acid sequences (Fig. While a previous study8 observed little TCR clustering in endogenous antitumor responses in FLC, we observed numerous clusters of related TCRs among those that expanded over the course of combination immunotherapy therapy in our patients. Some clusters could be attributed to TCRs recognizing nontumor epitopes, such as clusters corresponding to the influenza epitope A*02:01-GILGFVFTL (M158) identified in a patient who developed a viral respiratory infection during treatment (Fig. 2g, dashed outline), while others probably reflect antitumor responses. Clustering was more pronounced at later time points, especially in responders. Connectivity within TCR networks (edges per patient) remained stable in progressive disease (except P16) but increased over time in partial responders and some patients with stable disease (Fig. Finally, we developed a hierarchical decision tree to stratify responders using ELISpot response and changes in TCRdist network connectivity measured as the number of edges in each network (Fig. Responders were characterized by: (1) increase in edges ≥110 and (2) positive ELISpot response. Whereas ELISpot response alone was a poor classifier (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.667, Fisher's exact test P value = 0.509), change in TCRdist edges performed reasonably well as a single metric (AUROC of 0.889, Fisher's exact test P value = 0.045). Classifier performance was further improved by combining both components (AUROC of 0.944, Fisher's exact test P value = 0.018). These findings suggest productive responses to combination immunotherapy involve both increased TCR clustering and functional vaccine reactivity. To understand mechanisms of response, we conducted an in-depth analysis of DNAJ-PKAc-specific T cell responses in responding P12 (Fig. At baseline, no DNAJ-PKAc-specific response was detected via IFNγ ELISpot, whereas after treatment, ELISpot showed reactivity to the vaccinated peptide (Extended Data Fig. CyTOF analysis implicated activated CD4+ T helper and CD8+ cytotoxic T cells as the predominant responders (Extended Data Fig. Single-cell RNAseq and paired TCR sequencing of P12 T cells expanded and restimulated with the vaccinated peptide identified activation-induced marker (AIM)-positive clones expressing genes such as CD40LG, IFNG and TNF. P12-TCR2 and P12-TCR3 localized to a cluster enriched in these activation markers, along with three additional TCRs (P12-TCR6, P12-TCR8 and P12-TCR13) (Fig. 3e,f), which were also reactive to the 24mer peptide presented by autologous lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) (Fig. a, Patient P12 achieved a partial response (−51% decrease), with reductions in all target lung lesions and abdominal nodes, but later developed oligoprogression of a cardiophrenic node (lesion 4), resulting in discontinuation of study therapy. b, Change in target lesions from baseline by RECIST 1.1. c, Vitamin B12 binding capacity, a FLC serum tumor marker, declined on study therapy. d, A scatterplot showing relative peripheral blood frequencies of unique TCR clones detected by TIRTL-seq for P12 at baseline (C1D1, x axis) and after two cycles of treatment (C3D1, y axis).

The results shown for duplicate experiments, normalized to unstimulated negative and PMA-ionomycin positive controls (see Supplementary Methods for formula). HLA restriction analysis showed that all five TCRs recognized DNAJ-PKAc via HLA-DR alleles. P12-TCR2, P12-TCR3 and P12-TCR8 recognized the peptide presented by donors with DRB3*01:01, while P12-TCR6 and P12-TCR13 were restricted to DRB1*13:01 (Extended Data Fig. These TCRs recognized distinct overlapping 15mers derived from the fusion, highlighting responses to multiple class-II-restricted neoepitopes (Extended Data Fig. To determine whether the combined criteria of longitudinal expansion and AIM reactivity would accurately identify fusion-specific clones, we screened an additional TCR selected in this manner, P12-TCR14, and confirmed that it was also fusion-specific and restricted to HLA-DRB3*01:01 (Extended Data Fig. Notably, P12-TCR2 clustered with two longitudinally expanded TCRs from P8, who also expressed DRB3*01:01 (Extended Data Fig. When we performed TCRdist clustering of all TCR clones from TIRTL-seq (rather than just expanded clones), we then identified a TCR from P12 (P12-TCR21) that differed from the fusion-specific P8-TCR2 by a single amino acid in the TCRβ chain, effectively a public DNAJ-PKAc-specific clone (Extended Data Fig. We also observed further clustering with other DRB3-restricted fusion-specific TCRs, including P12-TCR3, P12-TCR2/P8-TCR2 and P12-TCR8/P12-TCR14 clusters (Extended Data Figs. The vast majority of TCRs in these clusters arose in patients who express a DRB3 allele (Supplementary Table 2 and Extended Data Fig. Further, each of these clusters exhibited strong similarities in V/J gene segment usage and CDR3 sequences (Extended Data Fig. 7e,f), suggesting similar neoepitope responses in patients with shared HLA types. Together, these findings demonstrate that FLC-Vac combined with ICIs elicited polyclonal T cell responses targeting diverse fusion neoepitopes with features that spanned multiple patients. Acquired resistance to immunotherapy often involves loss of antigen presentation, but DNAJ-PKAc persisted in all six patients with post-treatment tissue and one on-treatment sample (Fig. IHC confirmed retained HLA class I and II expression on tumor cells post- or on-treatment (Fig. 4b), supported by whole transcriptome sequencing showing no allele-specific HLA or TAP1 loss (Fig. No new oncogenic mutations or immune bypass mechanisms were detected (Extended Data Fig. Imaging mass cytometry and IHC of P12's resistant lesion revealed a distinct tumor immune microenvironment with increased granulocytes, loss of B cell infiltration and an increase in CD16+ CD86− and CD206− macrophages, as compared with pretreatment and regressing lesions (Fig. T cells were confined to the tumor periphery and expressed higher levels of exhaustion markers (TIM3 and LAG3) (Fig. These findings suggest impaired T cell trafficking and exclusion, along with enhanced T cell exhaustion and myeloid reprogramming, may have contributed to oligoprogression. Further supporting these resistance mechanisms, responder P14 experienced lung recurrence 2 years post study. Although the patient had progression on nivolumab, CyTOF analysis revealed a primarily CD4-driven response against DNAJ-PKAc, and a decision to rechallenge with nivolumab and ipilimumab (which robustly invigorates CD4 T cells)12,13 subsequently led to a complete response (Fig. a, Tumor samples (n = 7) from the latest available time point with viable tissue were stained using RNAscope and probes for DapB (negative control) or DNAJ-PKAc fusion of interest and show retention of the target antigen post treatment. c, A heat map depicting log2 fold change in RNA expression of genes associated with antigen presentation machinery in patients with paired pre- and on-treatment tissue-based RNA sequencing (n = 6).

The third responding patient's sole residual measurable lesion is no longer enhancing, consistent with tumor scar rather than active malignancy. These findings underscore the potential to overcome vaccine therapy resistance by targeting T cell exhaustion and restoring immune function. ICIs have limited efficacy in most pediatric tumor types, which are often characterized by a dominant genomic alteration and a low tumor mutational burden14. Therapeutic cancer vaccines are one promising strategy for stimulating antitumor immunity in tumor types for which such immunity does not endogenously occur15. Here, we show the potential for off-the-shelf therapeutic vaccines targeting shared neoantigens derived from currently ‘undruggable' oncogenic drivers. Our clinical results are encouraging in the context of highly refractory cancer. In the largest prospective clinical trial of FLC so far evaluating multiple potential therapies, there were no responses, and all patients experienced progression by 6 months16. By contrast, in the present study, 6 of 12 patients who completed the 10-week priming period achieved disease control lasting ≥6 months. Although it is not possible to definitively attribute the observed clinical responses to a complementary immune effect of the FLC vaccine and ICIs, ICIs have shown limited activity as monotherapy in FLC17,18,19. Similarly, therapeutic cancer vaccines have generally failed to elicit meaningful clinical responses as monotherapies in advanced cancers, probably due to immune exhaustion of vaccine-expanded T cells20. Single-cell RNA sequencing of tumor-infiltrating T cells revealed upregulation of exhaustion markers, underscoring the rationale for combining neoantigen vaccines with ICIs to generate robust and durable antitumor immunity21,22. In our study, we observed that ICIs were required to induce large T cell expansions detected in peripheral blood, which may be involved in antitumor activity. However, given that several patients with vaccine-induced T cell responses failed to achieve clinical benefit, additional therapies may be required to overcome the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. In particular, myeloid-targeted agents could be considered, based on our observation that changes in myeloid populations correlated with the development of acquired resistance in one patient. An important limitation of the study is that four patients discontinued treatment before completing the 10-week priming phase and were therefore not assessable for immunologic response. These patients came off study early for a variety of different reasons including early disease progression or ICI-related toxicities, before vaccine-induced antitumor T cell immunity could be generated. This is not unexpected in the context of an aggressive disease such as FLC, particularly in patients who had received prior therapy. The early discontinuation of these patients impacted our ability to fully assess immune responses across the entire cohort. Notably, at least one of these patients went on to respond robustly to subsequent therapy, suggesting that while they did not complete the priming phase, their immune systems may still have been modulated in ways that could influence later treatment outcomes. Overall, the observation that half of the evaluable patients experienced prolonged disease control supports the feasibility of vaccine-primed immune engagement, also raising the possibility that immunologic priming may have delayed or downstream effects that warrant further exploration. A randomized study to determine the additive contribution and toxicity of each component of this therapeutic combination may be needed in the future. A current challenge for immunotherapy is defining predictive biomarkers for responders and nonresponders to vaccines and checkpoint blockades. A report following ICI treatment of melanoma suggested that responders had more diverse TCR epitope-specific repertoires than nonresponders23. Here, we suggest a combined heuristic for stratifying response potential based on a TCR repertoire similarity measure (utilizing the entire expanding repertoire) combined with epitope-specific responses measured in functional assays. The repertoire similarity metric appeared to be particularly important in this heuristic, correctly stratifying 10 out of 12 patients even without the addition of functional response data. Increased TCR similarity among expanding TCR clones may correlate with enhanced antigen specificity, which could explain the importance of this feature in conjunction with functional reactivity to the vaccine antigen. Finally, our study identified specific TCRs targeting DNAJ-PKAc, which opens a potential future avenue for adoptive T cell therapy. Notably, we identified large TCR clusters containing both validated fusion-specific TCRs and other closely related TCRs arising in patients who shared expression of HLA-DRB3 (9 out of 12 patients in our study). This response was striking for its public motifs shared across a majority of our cohort, a feature common to antiviral epitopes but rarely described thus far for tumor antigens. Many of these clustered TCRs were only detected at low levels in peripheral blood, potentially explaining why they were not sufficient to induce clinical responses in all DRB3-positive patients. Nevertheless, their presence highlights how cell therapy employing fusion-specific TCRs could provide meaningfult therapeutic benefit to a large portion of the patient population. Notably, the only epitope-specific T cell responses we confirmed targeting the fusion were from CD4+ T cells. The mechanisms by which CD4+ T cells might control epithelial-derived tumors are not fully resolved but could include direct cytolytic killing in cases where the tumor is class II positive, or through activating and inducing other antitumor responses including NK cells24,25. Bespoke therapeutic vaccines tailored against the neoepitopes present in an individual cancer have recently demonstrated promise in multiple tumor types26,27,28,29. In this study, we show the potential for off-the-shelf therapeutic vaccines targeting shared neoantigens derived from a currently ‘undruggable' oncogenic fusion event. Our findings contribute to the growing body of evidence supporting the feasibility of immunologically targeting shared (‘public') neoantigens derived from oncogenic driver events—particularly in cancers such as FLC, which exhibit low tumor mutational burden and a correspondingly restricted repertoire of targetable neoantigens. Unlike many immunogenic passenger mutations, neoantigens arising from driver oncogenes are more likely to be persistently expressed through the continuum of disease progression, owing to the essential fitness advantage they confer to the cancer30. This sustained expression, combined with their immunogenic potential, renders driver-derived neoantigens potentially attractive targets for immunotherapy. Recent studies have demonstrated the clinical efficacy of both adoptive cell therapies and vaccines targeting driver-derived neoantigens, including a trial in renal cell carcinoma in which vaccinated patients exhibited prolonged relapse-free survival26,31,32,33,34. A key theoretical advantage of targeting oncogenic drivers immunologically is the potential to circumvent resistance mechanisms that often arise quickly with the use of targeted therapies, such as bypass signaling. Moreover, as compared with adoptive cell therapies targeting a neoepitope in the context of a single HLA molecule, immune escape should be less likely to occur with a vaccine-induced polyclonal CD4 response24. Our findings are consistent with these hypotheses, though based on a limited number of observations. In our study, we did not detect loss of DNAJ-PKAc or HLA in any patient post treatment. Among two patients who experienced eventual progression after an initial clinical response, we observed features suggestive of T cell exhaustion, and in one case, a potential restoration of efficacy with ICI rechallenge. Although preliminary, these results highlight a potential approach to address tumors with currently ‘undruggable' oncogenic drivers. We enrolled patients ≥12 years of age with unresectable FLC without prior exposure to an ICI. Patients received the FLC vaccine (consisting of a 24-amino-acid peptide and poly-ICLC adjuvant) on weeks 1, 2, 3, 4, 7 and 10 and nivolumab, 3 mg kg−1, followed by ipilimumab, 1 mg kg−1, every 3 weeks for four doses during the priming phase. Afterward, patients received nivolumab at a fixed dose of 480 mg every 4 weeks for up to 2 years and booster vaccinations approximately every three cycles for up to 1 year from the initial vaccination until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or withdrawal. Ipilimumab plus nivolumab was selected as a backbone given its clinical availability for liver cancers (for example, hepatocellular carcinoma) and effects on CD4+ T cell populations, which have historically been the target of peptide vaccines12,13. Ipilimumab plus nivolumab was provided by Bristol Myers Squibb. The disease assessment, management of toxic effects and study design are detailed in the Supplementary Information (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04248569). All the patients provided written informed consent. All patients provided written informed consent before enrollment. Validation data for the ELISpot assay used for the coprimary endpoint are provided (see ELISPOT Validation Report in Supplementary Information). Secondary endpoints include ORR, duration of response, DCR, PFS and overall survival. Disease assessments (by computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging were performed every 8 weeks (±7 days) for the first 6 months and then every 12 weeks thereafter until disease progression, according to the definitions of RECIST, version 1.1. Adverse events, vital signs and laboratory tests were assessed at each visit and graded based on the NCI CTCAE Version 5.0. Survival, subsequent treatment and disease status were assessed every 12 weeks (window, ±2 weeks) after discontinuing treatment or disease progression (whichever occurred first) until the end of the trial, death, loss to follow-up or withdrawal of consent. The primary endpoint for safety was the percent of adverse events by grade and for immunogenicity was the fold change in IFN-γ-producing DNAJ-PKAc-specific CD8+ and CD4+ T cells at week 10 after vaccination compared with unstimulated. The evaluable population of the endpoint of T cell response consisted of all patients who received at least one dose of vaccine and had baseline and post-treatment T cell measures at 10 weeks. We anticipated that our regimen would result in at least a 2.5-fold increase of IFN-γ-producing DNAJ-PKAc-specific T cells with treatment. We assumed, conservatively, that the coefficient of variation of IFN-γ-producing DNAJ-PKAc -specific T cell density was 100%, and the correlation of the pre-and post-treatment measure is weak at 0.2.

Biomechanical alterations contribute to the decreased regenerative capacity of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) upon aging. RhoA is a key regulator of mechanosignaling, but its role in mechanotransduction in stem cell aging remains unclear. Here we show that murine HSCs respond to increased nuclear envelope (NE) tension by inducing NE translocation of P-cPLA2, which cell-intrinsically activates RhoA. Aged HSCs experience physiologically higher intrinsic NE tension, but reducing RhoA activity lowers NE tension in aged HSCs. Feature image analysis of HSC nuclei reveals that chromatin remodeling is associated with RhoA inhibition, including restoration of youthful levels of the heterochromatin marker H3K9me2 and a decrease in chromatin accessibility and transcription at retrotransposons. Finally, we demonstrate that RhoA inhibition upregulates Klf4 expression and transcriptional activity, improving aged HSC regenerative capacity and lympho/myeloid skewing in vivo. Together, our data outline an intrinsic RhoA-dependent mechanosignaling axis, which can be pharmacologically targeted to restore aged stem cell function. Aging is characterized by the decline in tissue function and is the primary risk factor for major diseases. In particular, aged hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) functional decline, critically, not only impacts on their ability to regenerate the hematopoietic system and to support lymphoid cell production over time1,2 but also directly contributes to major aging-related diseases3,4. Aging is accompanied by biomechanical changes including alterations in NE tension and in the nucleus mechanical integrity and mechanotransduction5,6. However, how to possibly target changes in nuclear mechanosignaling to explain and prevent aging of somatic stem cells is still largely underinvestigated. In addition, epigenetic alterations are considered one of the primary hallmarks of aging7, and, despite the large amount of data demonstrating the occurrence of an epigenetic drift upon stem cell aging and disease, there is a lack of knowledge on molecular mechanisms to explain this epigenetic drift and whether it possibly associates with mechanical alterations of the nuclear and chromatin architecture. Mechanical forces trigger multiple signaling pathways that converge in the activation of RhoA8, which is a small RhoGTPase that can cycle between an active (RhoA-GTP) and an inactive (RhoA-GDP) status. RhoA is a key regulator of mechanotransduction8 regardless of whether the activating mechanical stimulus is cell extrinsic, as occurs in cells responding to alterations of substrate stiffness9, or cell intrinsic, such as, for example, when the cell nucleus acts as a mechanosensor of genomic changes10,11,12. Thus far, in HSCs, RhoA has been shown to be important for cytokinesis13. In vivo, knocking out RhoA in bone marrow (BM) cells induces a dramatic phenotype, characterized by a multilineage hematopoietic failure due to programmed necrosis of hematopoietic progenitors, whereas HSCs retain long-term engraftment potential but fail to produce hematopoietic progenitors and lineage-defined blood cells13. In the present study, we investigated the role of RhoA in nuclear mechanotransduction in HSCs and its involvement in preserving nuclear architecture and stem cell function upon aging. Our data reveal that RhoA activity increases upon increased NE tension in HSCs, which is intrinsically altered upon aging and can be targeted to improve in vivo function of aged blood stem cells. The nuclear membrane is able to stretch under various pathophysiological conditions involving nuclear lamina weakening, and stretching of the nucleus is thought to be a fundamental mechanism engaging nuclear mechanotransduction14,15. Therefore, we wondered if nuclear stretching might be engaging RhoA mechanosignaling pathways in HSCs. HSCs are notoriously small-sized non-adherent cells with an average cell diameter of 10 µm and a high nuclear/cytosol ratio. To induce nuclear stretching in HSCs, we took advantage of a previously established cell confinement device11,16 (Extended Data Fig. We isolated HSCs (sorted as Cd11b−, Ter119−, Cd8−, Cd5−, B220−, Gr1−, c-kit+, Sca1+, Flt3−, CD34−) from the BM of young adult (8−20 weeks old) C57Bl6 mice, and we seeded them on fibronectin-coated coverslips followed by confinement with non-adhesive coverslips functionalized with pillars of 8-µm, 5-µm and 3-µm height for 2 hours (Fig. Upon confinement, HSCs were fixed and stained with DAPI and with an anti-RhoA-GTP antibody. By three-dimensional (3D) single-cell confocal microscopy, we observed that cell confinement produced a reduction of the nuclear height proportional to the applied level of confinement (Fig. The maximum nuclear diameter increased significantly already under 8-µm confinement, and it reached its maximum at almost 10 µm when HSCs were confined at 5 µm, showing a significant inverse correlation with nuclear height (Fig. We observed the formation of nucleoplasm-containing blebs, which was progressive with confinement and particularly prominent when HSCs were confined at 5 µm (Fig. This can be quantified by looking at the excess of perimeter (EOP) of the largest two-dimensional (2D) slide17 and at the major axis length, which significantly increased in HSCs under the 5-µm confinement conditions (Extended Data Fig. Interestingly, nuclear stretching was paralleled by a progressive alteration of the DAPI intensity profile of the nucleus and by a sharp increase in the activation levels of RhoA, which was mildly but directly correlated with the increase in nuclear diameter (Fig. When the nuclear height was reduced to 3 µm, RhoA-GTP levels decreased dramatically. In this condition of tight confinement, HSCs displayed severe nuclear rupture, which suggests cell distress and the inability to react against such a reduction of nuclear height, as evidenced by the dramatic reduction of the nuclear volume and DAPI intensity profile, the appearance of nuclear blebs and the extreme standard deviation variability of the EOP (Fig. These data are consistent with a threshold of up to 70% compression of the nuclear height for HSC survival and consequent RhoA activation before irreversible nuclear lamina rupture, in agreement with what was described for other cells17. a, Representative HSC gating strategy and experimental setup for the confinement experiments. b, Two representative nuclei are depicted to illustrate the strategy to measure the NHA and diameter. NHA is calculated as the sum of n measurements of the nucleus height in the y−z axis, divided by the n number of measurements. NHA and diameter are represented against the different confinement conditions used in the experiments, and a correlation plot between both is shown from three independent experiments (total: unconfined n = 25, 8 µm n = 30, 5 µm n = 16, 3 µm n = 26).

To investigate whether RhoA is necessary for the response to nuclear deformation in HSCs, we isolated HSCs from Cre-ERT2×Rhoaflox/flox mice, in which the activity of the Cre recombinase to knock out Rhoa can be induced in vitro by overnight treatment with 4-hydroxy tamoxifen (Extended Data Fig. 1f; hereafter referred to as Rhoa knockout (KO) HSCs). To note, after 12−16 hours from induction of the Cre-recombinase, levels of RhoA-GTP were clearly reduced (Extended Data Fig. Next, we confined the cells at 5 µm, according to the protocol described above, to image nuclei and quantify the impact of RhoaKO. Surprisingly, in RhoaKO HSCs, the nuclei were completely broken, and HSCs were unable to resist the 5-µm confinement (Fig. Because our experiments were performed in vitro on sorted non-adherent HSCs, we reasoned that RhoA activation might be intrinsically induced by the mechanical tension at the NE. To investigate this hypothesis, we decided to quantify the phosphorylated form of the nuclear protein cPLA2 (P-cPLA2), which translocates to the NE due to a physical process mediated by tension at the NE11,14,15,16. We stained P-cPLA2 and quantified its NE localization, which increased when HSCs are under confinement, consistent with the increased RhoA activation (Extended Data Fig. NE P-cPLA2 catalyzes the hydrolysis of phospholipids releasing arachidonic acid11,15,16,18,19, which is a well-established activator of RhoA20,21. In agreement, we measured a clear increase in RhoA-GTP levels after treatment of young HSCs with arachidonic acid, confirming the transduction pathway (Extended Data Fig. To further investigate whether intrinsic RhoA activation is induced by NE tension, we treated freshly sorted HSCs with sodium butyrate (NaB), a histone deacetylase inhibitor known to increase levels of histone acetylation and induce chromatin decompaction (intrinsically increasing NE tension) in different cells and also in HSCs22,23,24. RhoA activity levels were sharply upregulated in HSCs treated with 5 mM NaB, in parallel with the increase in NE tension, as shown by the increase in the nuclear diameter and P-cPLA2 translocation to the NE (Fig. To further support that P-cPLA2 translocation to the NE can be triggered by changes in NE tension16, we used hypotonic shock, which was previously used to increase nuclear volume11,15,25 and NE tension, and we quantified NE P-cPLA2 and RhoA activation. Consistently, the data show an increase in NE P-cPLA2 and RhoA-GTP levels in HSCs after hypotonic osmotic shock (Extended Data Fig. Overall, the data demonstrate that intrinsic changes in the NE tension activate RhoA in HSCs. However, RhoA activity might also be triggered by the extracellular matrix (niche or extrinsic activation). To explore this possibility, we focused on tissue stiffness, a well-described mechanical stimulus inducing RhoA activity in different cells and tissues26,27. Because, in adult mammals, HSCs reside in the BM, we first measured the stiffness of this compartment, which is a semi-solid tissue with viscoelastic properties and a quite heterogeneous mechanical behavior28. To this end, we used a nanoindenter device equipped with a small and sensitive cantilever tip. We designed a matrix of several points to cover the whole area of the femoral BM tissue and obtain a map of the stiffness of the murine BM cavity (Extended Data Fig. In agreement with previous observations29, within the BM we detected areas with different levels of stiffness, ranging from 0.5 kPa to 10 kPa (on average, 4 kPa) in the inner marrow to a range of 5−50 kPa (on average, 12 kPa) at the endosteum (Extended Data Fig. Based on these results, we prepared polyacrylamide hydrogels functionalized with fibronectin to mimic in vitro the lowest (at the inner marrow; approximately 1 kPa) and the highest (endosteum; approximately 40 kPa) stiffness values that we detected in our murine BM samples. We then isolated HSCs and cultured them overnight on the functionalized hydrogels with different stiffness values. HSCs were then recovered and stained for RhoA-GTP and DAPI and used for a colony-forming unit (CFU) assay (Extended Data Fig. Interestingly, RhoA-GTP levels did not change in HSCs cultured on the stiff (40-kPa) hydrogels compared to those cultured on the 1-kPa hydrogels, contrary to what would be expected for RhoA being activated by an increased stiffness of the substrate30 (Fig. As for the CFU assay, we did not detect differences in colony number, but the number of c-Kit+ cells (hematopoietic progenitors) and the total cell number were reduced in the 40-kPa stiff hydrogels with no differences in the number of myeloid cells (Gr1+ and Mac1+ cells) (Fig. Intriguingly, RhoaKO HSCs behaved as their wild-type control for all the measured parameters (Fig. Therefore, our data reveal that, in HSCs, RhoA is dispensable in the response to changes in extracellular stiffness, whereas RhoA is necessary to survive intrinsic changes in NE tension. In HSCs, RhoA activity sharply increases after NE tension raise induced by confinement, osmotic shock and chromatin decompaction after NaB treatment (Fig. Aging alters the biomechanical properties of tissues and cells6. Because increased tissue stiffening upon aging has been reported to induce an increase in RhoA activity levels, for example, in the hair follicle31, we wondered if RhoA activity was altered in aged hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) and whether it was correlated with increased stiffness of the aged BM32. We profiled the stiffness of the aged BM by performing indentation experiments using the same nanoindenter device as reported above (Extended Data Fig. We collected several measurements alongside a matrix to cover the overall BM cavity of femurs and tibiae comparing, in parallel, young (8−20 weeks old) and aged C57Bl6 (>80 weeks old) mice. Notably, the indentation measurements showed an overall decreased BM stiffness in aged samples compared to young, resulting in a homogenously low stiffness along the transversal section of the BM (Extended Data Fig. To investigate whether the decreased BM stiffness was associated with changes in RhoA activity, we performed western blot and pulldown assays on HSPCs isolated from young and aged mice. We detected a significant upregulation of RhoA activity levels in aged BM cells that could be targeted and significantly reduced by treatment with a selective RhoA inhibitor (Rhosin, here referred to as Ri)33 (Extended Data Fig. Ri affects the activity of RhoA and of the two small RhoGTPases most closely related, RhoB/RhoC, by targeting the interaction with guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) at the interface33. Furthermore, we measured RhoA-GTP levels in sorted HSCs by immunofluorescence. To this end, HSCs were harvested from aged mice and incubated with or without Ri. Young HSCs were sorted alongside as control (Fig. Aged HSCs showed a dramatic upregulation of RhoA activity, and treatment with 100 µM Ri significantly decreased levels of RhoA-GTP in aged HSCs (Fig. 2b), consistent with the western blot/pulldown results on HSPCs (Extended Data Fig. Therefore, in agreement with our conclusions based on the hydrogel experiments (Fig. 1i–k), RhoA activity appears not to be associated with the extracellular stiffness, and, whereas the aged BM stiffness decreases, RhoA activity increases in HSCs upon aging, supporting an intrinsic activation of RhoA in HSCs upon aging. a, Representative HSC gating strategy and experimental setup for in vitro culturing experiments with and without treatment. b, Representative images of 3D confocal reconstruction of young, aged and aged+Ri HSCs stained with anti-RhoA-GTP antibody (red) and DAPI (gray).

Panel a and g created with BioRender. Therefore, we hypothesized that RhoA-GTP levels are higher in aged HSCs because their nucleus might be experiencing higher nuclear tension. Consistent with this hypothesis, we detected a significant increase of NE P-cPLA2 in aged stem cells, which is reduced by treatment with the cPLA2 inhibitor AACOCF3 (Fig. Notably, also levels of RhoA-GTP in aged cells were sharply reduced after treatment with AACOCF3, supporting that changes in NE tension are necessary to activate RhoA in aged HSCs (Fig. To further investigate the increased NE tension in aged stem cells, we performed additional experiments to measure the wrinkling of the NE, a structural feature of nuclear architecture that has previously been used as a measure of NE tension11,15,16,34,35. LaminB staining clearly shows increased NE circularity and reduced NE excess folding in aged HSCs compared to young (Fig. 2e,f), supporting higher NE tension in aged HSCs compared to young. Notably, RhoA inhibition sharply decreases NE circularity and restores NE excess folding in aged HSCs (Fig. To corroborate further these observations, we also quantified the nuclear import of the mechanosensitive transcription factor TAZ, which is known to accumulate in the nucleus with increasing NE tension36,37. In agreement, we measured increased nuclear translocation of TAZ after 8-µm and 5-µm HSC confinement (Extended Data Fig. As also reported previously38, we quantified higher level of nuclear TAZ in aged HSCs compared to young, which is dependent on RhoA activity (Extended Data Fig. Altogether, the results support the functional connection between changes in NE tension and RhoA activity as a mechanosensitive regulator of HSC aging (Fig. To explore if changes in NE tension impact on chromatin of aged HSCs, we developed a computational approach leveraging image analysis algorithms to extract morphometric and fluorescence intensity features from 3D confocal images of HSC nuclei stained with DAPI, which is a photostable fluorescent DNA dye used in several applications to quantify DNA amount and chromatin condensation in intact nuclei39,40. First, consistent with increased NE tension, the results show that aged HSCs display a significant increase in nuclear volume, nuclear diameter, surface area, perimeter of the largest z slide and DAPI-intense region (DIR) volume, among other related features, compared to young HSCs (Fig. To note, HSC confinement (8 µm) induced a similar larger increase in the same morphometric features, supporting that these alterations of nuclear volume, size and shape in aged HSCs are compatible with increased NE tension (Fig. a, Box plot displaying differences in selected feature distributions among HSCs young (n = 177 nuclei), aged (n = 164 nuclei) and young confined to 8 μm (n = 17 nuclei).

Line plots depict mean values ± s.e. Panel a created with BioRender. Next, because RhoA inhibition sharply decreases NE circularity and increases NE excess folding in aged HSCs (Fig. 2e,f), we asked whether decreasing RhoA activity might feed back to the nucleus, inducing any change in morphometric and fluorescence intensity features of aged HSC nuclei. The data revealed differences mainly in the pattern of DAPI intensity that we extracted by quantifying fluorescence intensities along 3D iso-distant intervals from the nuclear border (Extended Data Fig. 3a,b), with lower values near the nuclear border and DIRs localizing relatively far from the nuclear border toward the central part of the nucleus for aged HSCs compared to young (Fig. Most aged+Ri HSC nuclei displayed a large proportion of DIRs near the NE, like young HSCs (Fig. In addition, also DIR height, DIR major axis length, DIR distance to the border and number of DIRs were restored to a youthful level after RhoA inhibition (Extended Data Fig. Next, we computed dimensionality reduction analyses on our feature set to explore similarity patterns within our HSC nucleus images (Extended Data Fig. First, we performed feature engineering and clustering analysis on all available nucleus images to uncover potential mechanisms underlying nuclear remodeling in young, aged and aged Ri-treated HSCs. The extracted imaging features are categorized into three groups: (1) whole-nucleus-level features, (2) DIR-level features and (3) features computed from the largest 2D z slide in the x–y plane. A comprehensive summary of these features is provided in Supplementary Table 2. To address the high dimensionality and notable correlation of our feature space, we used uniform manifold approximation and projection42 (UMAP). Feature selection involved identifying statistically significant features (Mann−Whitney U-test, P < 0.05) among young and aged HSCs and among aged and aged Ri-treated HSCs (Extended Data Fig. These significant features were then combined and filtered to remove those exhibiting high Pearsonʼs correlation coefficient (absolute value of correlation >80%), resulting in a final set of 20 features (Extended Data Fig. The UMAP revealed that young, aged and aged+Ri HSCs exhibit overlapping yet distinct distributions, indicating underlying differences in their chromatin properties (Fig. By grouping the nucleus data points using the k-means clustering algorithm on the original feature space, we identified four distinct clusters that differ in morphometrics and intensity characteristics (Fig. Analysis of individual features' impact over the UMAP representation revealed that morphometric-related features polarize the embedding vertically, whereas intensity and DIR-related features polarize the embedding horizontally (Fig. Subsequently, by assessing the most representative features and biological populations, we annotated the clusters as low size (LS), high size (HS), border intensity (BI) and central intensity (CI) (Fig. Feature importance for each cluster was evaluated by measuring feature statistical significance and fold change per cluster (Extended Data Fig. Cluster BI includes mostly young and aged + Ri HSCs exhibiting high intensity near the NE and lower intensity in the nuclear center, along with an increased number of small DIRs closer to the border, which tend to be less spherical compared to nuclei in other clusters (Fig. Cluster CI predominantly consists of aged nuclei, with a reduced number of aged Ri-treated nuclei. These nuclei present with larger DIRs located farther from the NE and are notably spherical, with decreased intensity near the nuclear border (Fig. Cluster LS mainly contains young nuclei characterized by smaller size and lower mean intensity of DIRs, with surprisingly not much accentuated intensity values near the border (Fig. Cluster HS contains a mix of biological conditions, with nuclei characterized by larger size, DIRs positioned away from the nuclear border and a decreased aspect ratio indicating that these nuclei are wider than they are tall (Fig. By plotting feature trajectories across clusters, morphometric features progressively decrease or increase with decreasing frequencies of young HSCs within the clusters spanning from LS to HS clusters (Fig. Interestingly, intensity features and DIR-related features progressively decrease or increase with increasing frequencies of aged+Ri HSCs from CI to BI clusters (Fig. Therefore, aged Ri-treated nuclei appear to share some morphometric similarities with aged nuclei yet exhibit intensity and DIR-related characteristics similar to those of young HSCs. Overall, our computational approach suggests that DAPI imaging features elucidate chromatin differences in stem cells revealing a Ri-associated nuclear remodeling, which is mainly linked to changes in DAPI intensity and DIR volume, number and localization. Alterations in the mechanobiology of the cell have been associated with aging-dependent changes in chromatin architecture6,43, and several epigenetic alterations characterize intrinsic HSC aging44,45, among which it was previously reported a general loss of heterochromatin2,46,47. Intrigued by the observation that in aged HSCs treated with Ri some nuclear DAPI intensity and DIR-related features were significantly reverted to the level found in young HSCs (Fig. 3b) and are associated with the nuclear remodeling induced by Ri (Fig. 3g), we focused on heterochromatin because especially DIRs are related to the most condensed portion of chromatin. Therefore, we analyzed the levels and distribution of H3K9me2, a known heterochromatin histone mark that is altered in aged HSCs2,24,48. By 3D immunofluorescence analyses, we measured a significant increase of H3K9me2 levels in aged + Ri HSCs compared to aged controls, together with a partial relocalization at the nuclear border like in young HSCs (Fig. Interestingly, treatment with UNC0646, a selective inhibitor of the histone methyltransferase G9a specific to H3K9me2 (refs. 49,50), blunts completely the effect of Ri on H3K9me2 in aged HSCs (Fig. These data suggest the requirement of G9a to increase levels of H3K9me2 in aged+Ri HSCs. Moreover, they reveal that aged HSCs are not affected by UNC0646 treatment alone, most likely because of the very low expression of G9a in these cells in basal conditions, which is partially rescued by Ri treatment (Extended Data Fig. To causally explain the role of decreased H3K9me2 in HSCs, we transduced young HSPCs (LSKs, gated as Lin−Sca-1+c-Kit+) with a retroviral vector, codifying for a histone variant in which the lysine of H3K9 is replaced by an arginine (H3R9) (Fig. The arginine in position 9 on H3 cannot be methylated, enforcing H3K9me reduction in HSCs. We functionally validated the strategy and the H3R9 incorporation by transplanting transduced LSKs into lethally irradiated recipient mice. We measured a significant reduction of H3K9me in H3R9 myeloid progenitors compared to control vector transduced H3K9 myeloid progenitors (Fig. Young H3R9 HSCs isolated from transplanted mice present with higher RhoA-GTP levels and increased nuclear stretching compared to controls (Fig. Moreover, H3R9 HSCs show a clear premature aging phenotype upon transplantations in vivo, characterized by expansion of LSKs and granulocyte-monocyte progenitors (GMPs), reduced BM and peripheral blood regeneration, reduced B-lymphopoiesis and myeloid skewing (Fig. Altogether, these data demonstrate that reduced methylation of H3K9 causes nuclear stretching, increasing RhoA activation and driving aging of HSCs. Notably, RhoA inhibition restores H3K9 methylation levels in aged HSCs. a, Left: representative images of 3D confocal reconstruction of young, aged and aged + Ri-treated HSCs stained with anti-H3K9me2 antibody (green) and DAPI (gray).

Previously, it was proposed that the cell nucleus can directly respond to mechanical stress by inducing chromatin remodeling, altering polymerase and transcription factor accessibility and activity51,52,53, and increased chromatin accessibility, as measured by assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (ATAC−seq), has already been characterized as an epigenetic alteration intrinsic to HSC aging54,55. Intrigued by the possibility that RhoA inhibition might underscore a link between increased NE tension and increased chromatin accessibility in aged HSCs, we investigated further the chromatin remodeling associated with Ri treatment by performing ATAC−seq profiling of sorted young, aged and aged + Ri HSCs (Fig. Peak calling identified a total of 57,289 accessible regions consistent between samples, most of them located in introns, intergenic regions and gene promoters (Extended Data Fig. In agreement with previously published data54,55, we detected an increase in open differentially accessible regions (DARs) with aging (2,713 DARs open and 1,103 DARs closed in aged compared to young HSCs; approximately 8% false-positive rate (FPR); Fig. After applying the Ri treatment to aged HSCs, 743 chromatin regions opened and 355 closed (approximately 8% FPR; Fig. Overall, 144 DARs were detected in both comparisons (aged versus young and aged+Ri versus aged), with 85.42% of them showing accessibility levels after the Ri treatment changing in the direction of the young levels (Fig. Among the regions opening in aged HSCs treated with Ri, Gene Ontology enrichment analysis revealed pathways related to cell migration, morphogenesis, adhesion and chemotaxis (Extended Data Fig. Interestingly, no Gene Ontologies were significantly enriched among the DARs closing in aged HSCs+Ri, and a high percentage of these closing DARs were located at retrotransposons (Fig. 5d, lower right panel), especially long terminal repeats (LTRs) and long interspersed elements (LINEs), such as ERVL-MaLR, ERVK, ERV1 and L1 families (2-fold/approximately 1 log2 fold change (log2FC) higher percentage compared to the percentage in consensus peaks; false discovery rate (FDR) = 0.0018 for LTRs and FDR = 0.014 for LINEs in a one-proportion z-test; Fig. Notably, in aged HSCs, we observed an opening of chromatin at retrotransposons, with a 1.65-fold (0.72 log2FC) and a 1.25-fold (0.33 log2FC) increase in the percentage of open DARs localizing in LTRs and LINEs, respectively (FDR = 3.2 × 10−13 for LTRs and FDR = 0.04998 for LINEs in a one-proportion z-test; Fig. Some of these DARs at LTRs and LINEs were overlapping with enhancers described previously57, whereas others were located in intronic and intergenic regions (Fig. Interestingly, retrotransposons and, in particular, LINE-1 have been suggested to directly contribute to aging of somatic cells and aging-related diseases56,58,59,60. To explore if the increase in chromatin accessibility at retrotransposons upon HSC aging is linked to increased NE tension, we performed ATAC−seq of young HSCs under 5-μm confinement and compared their chromatin accessibility profiles to those of unconfined HSCs sorted in parallel from the same mice (Fig. As a reference for DAR identification, we used the 42,632 consensus peaks identified between young and aged HSC samples (Supplementary Table 3). Data show 443 DARs opening and only 25 DARs closing in young HSCs under confinement (approximately 6.6% FPR; Fig. Notably, whereas the DARs that are closing in confined HSCs are located at promoter transcription start site (TSS) and 5′ untranslated region (UTR) (1.67 log2FC over consensus peaks; FDR = 4.1 × 10−6 in a one-proportion z-test; Fig. 5I, lower panel), the DARs that are opening are mainly at LTRs and LINEs (0.75 and 1.18 log2FC over consensus peaks, respectively; FDR = 0.008 for LTRs and FDR = 0.003 for LINEs in a one-proportion z-test; Fig. Overall, the results show a correlation between the increased accessibility at regulatory elements observed in aged HSCs and reverted (closed) by Ri treatment and the type of genomic regions (LTRs and LINEs) that are opened by increasing NE tension by mechanical confinement. a, Representative HSC gating strategy and experimental strategy for ATAC−seq and RNA-seq of Ri-treated aged HSCs. b, Volcano plot of DARs in aged versus young and aged + Ri versus aged (moderated t-statistic, two-sided, unadjusted P < 0.005).

Permutation test used for GSEA. Panel a and f created with BioRender. Next, we investigated transcriptional changes by bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis of young, aged and aged+Ri HSCs. We identified 38 genes upregulated and 27 downregulated in aged HSCs after treatment with Ri (approximately 5% FPR; Extended Data Fig. Consistently with the ATAC−seq data, after Ri treatment we detected a downregulation in the transcription of several retrotransposon subfamilies that are upregulated in aged HSCs, mainly LTRs but also some LINEs and DNA transposon subfamilies, such as L1 (L1ME1 and L1ME3A), ERV1 (MER110-int) and hAT-Blackjack (MER63C) (approximately 8% FPR; Fig. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) revealed enrichment for several Gene Ontologies related to inflammation, innate immune response activation and interferon response among the genes downregulated after Ri treatment, again consistent with a downregulation of retrotransposons56,59,61 (FDR < 0.05; Fig. Using GSEA, we also detected a decrease in the interferome.org gene signature62 and of interferon-stimulated genes63 in aged+Ri HSCs (Fig. 5m,n and Extended Data Fig. Moreover, we measured a significantly negative enrichment score in aged+Ri versus aged samples for the HSC aging signature defined by Svendsen et al.64, whereas the same signature was clearly positively enriched in the aged samples compared to the young ones (Fig. In summary, by ATAC−seq profiling, we detected changes in chromatin accessibility in aged Ri-treated HSCs that revealed reduction of open regions at LTRs and LINE, belonging mainly to ERVL-MaLR, ERVK, ERV1 and L1 families. ATAC−seq profiling of young 5-µm-confined HSCs supports that the increased accessibility at retrotransposons observed in the aged HSCs and reverted by Ri treatment could be a consequence of increased nuclear stretching. Consistently, by bulk RNA-seq profiling of aged+Ri HSCs, we detected a reduction in the transcription of LTRs and LINEs and a downregulation of the immune response, inflammatory response, interferon response and aging gene signatures compared to aged control HSCs. Next, to further characterize the transcriptional changes in aged HSCs after Ri treatment, we focused on the few upregulated genes (Extended Data Fig. 5g,h and Supplementary Table 4), and, interestingly, we noticed three transcription factors belonging to the same family: Klf4, Klf6 and Klf2 (Fig. Noteworthy, the upregulation of Klfs is consistent with the opening of KLF4 motifs detected by ATAC−seq transcription factor binding motif analysis, which revealed enrichment in motifs for AP-1 and KLF4 (Fig. In hematopoietic cells, AP-1 can interact with chromatin remodelers to assist in the binding of other transcription factors65, and KLF4 was previously shown to be important in cell reprogramming, blood formation and mechanosensing66,67,68,69,70,71. 6c), and we measured a clear increase in KLF4 protein in the nucleus of aged stem cells after Ri treatment (Extended Data Fig. Next, we analyzed the expression level of the genes targeted by a higher accessibility of KLF4 binding motifs, and most of them increased their expression after Ri (Extended Data Fig. Gene Ontology enrichment analysis of these genes revealed enrichment for morphogenesis, differentiation and actin polymerization (FDR < 0.05; Fig. Notably, actin polymerization (filamentous actin (F-actin)) has been reported to restrict nuclear stretching14,15. Consistently, whereas, in aged HSCs, F-actin is decreased compared to young, F-actin levels increase upon Ri treatment similarly to young HSCs (Fig. a, Genome tracks for the normalized RNA-seq read distribution in Klf genes. b, Top two transcription factor binding motifs found among the DARs opening with Ri. c, Genome tracks for the normalized ATAC−seq read distribution in Klf4 gene and its enhancer in –119 kb (orange shadow).

Color legend as in h. k, Enrichment plot for the hemogenic precursor signature77 in aged + Ri versus aged. To gain further insights into the transcriptional rewiring of aged HSCs treated with Ri, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) of young, aged and aged Ri-treated LSK cells. We obtained a total of 60,648 cells expressing 15,049 genes. Clustering of the integrated UMAP identified 11 clusters (Fig. 6f) that were annotated as based on known marker gene expression and enrichment for several previously identified HSC and LSK signatures73,74,75 (Extended Data Fig. Compositional analysis of cell clusters showed the expected increase in the percentage of HSCs in all aged samples compared to the young ones (Extended Data Fig. It also revealed an increase in the percentage of MPP3 with aging and its decrease with the Ri treatment (Extended Data Fig. 6g and Supplementary Table 5), whereas there were no differences in HSC cell cycle profile after Ri treatment (Extended Data Fig. Interestingly, the scRNA-seq dataset showed that the increase of Klf4 expression in aged+Ri LSKs is more prominent in the HSC and MPP1 clusters (Fig. In detail, 43.58% of aged+Ri HSCs are expressing Klf4, whereas only 2.46% and 2.80% of young and aged HSCs, respectively, express this transcription factor. Differential gene expression analysis between the three conditions in the HSC cluster confirms the upregulation of several genes of the Klf family after Ri treatment (|log2FC| > 1 and FDR < 0.05; Extended Data Fig. To further analyze the activity of the different transcription factors and identify the network of regulated genes, we calculated transcription factor activity scores in each single HSC using SCENIC76 and generated a UMAP based on transcription factor activity scores (Fig. Interestingly, the percentage of aged+Ri HSCs with active KLF4 is 89.52%, whereas it is negligible in young and aged HSCs (1.89% and 0.69%, respectively) (Fig. Differential analysis of the activity scores in between conditions confirms the increased activity of several KLF transcription factors as well as other transcription factors (|log2FC| > 0.5 and FDR < 0.05; Fig. Because KLF4 is known for its role in cell reprogramming and dedifferentiation, we wondered if aged+Ri HSCs show a more dedifferentiated transcriptional state. Interestingly, GSEA reveals an enrichment of the hemogenic precursor signature defined by Pereira et al.77 in the aged+Ri HSCs compared to the aged controls (Fig. 6k), supporting that Ri treatment might induce a partial transcriptional reprogramming of aged HSCs. Because the scRNA-seq analysis indicates a partial reprogramming suggestive at the transcriptomic level of a possible functional improvement, we decided to assess the regenerative capacity of aged HSCs after Ri treatment in vivo. Previously, we correlated changes in cell epigenetic polarity of H4K16ac to function of HSCs24,78,79,80. Three-dimensional immunofluorescence staining of young, aged and aged+Ri HSCs clearly showed that Ri treatment restores H4K16ac polarity in aged stem cells (Extended Data Fig. Next, we tested in a non-competitive transplantation assay into young immunocompromised and KitW-41J mutant mice (NBSGW) the regenerative capacity of aged Ri-treated HSCs compared to young and aged control stem cells. We transplanted 200 aged HSCs treated overnight ex vivo with 100 µM Ri, alongside control recipient mice transplanted with solvent-treated young or aged HSCs (Fig. Donor mice were genetically tagged by constitutive expression in Rosa26 locus of a bright and stable red fluorescent protein (tdRFP)81, and we measured donor-derived contribution in peripheral blood by detecting RFP+ cells at several timepoints after transplantation. Notably, aged Ri-treated HSCs engrafted at the endpoint similarly to young HSCs, showing a significant increase in their peripheral blood regenerative capacity compared to aged control HSCs (Fig. Remarkably, Ri treatment also significantly increased the B cell lymphoid differentiation potential of aged HSCs and decreased the contribution to the myeloid lineage 18 weeks after transplantation (Fig. Ri treatment did not change the differentiation to the T cell compartment (Fig. Engraftment in BM and HSC compartments was not significantly different in Ri-treated recipients compared to either young or aged control recipients, showing a trend for both parameters to resemble young donor HSCs (Extended Data Fig. Overall, we conclude that inactivation of RhoA in aged HSCs functionally improves the regenerative capacity of old stem cells and their myeloid/B lymphoid skewing in vivo. a, Experimental strategy for transplantation of young, aged and aged + Ri RFP+ HSCs into NBSGW mice. b, Percentage of engraftment in peripheral blood along the course of the transplantation at 6, 12 and 18 weeks.

Panel a and e created with BioRender. The regenerative potential of HSCs declines upon aging, contributing to immunosenescence, inflammaging, clonal hematopoiesis and the increased incidence of hematopoietic disorders in older adults1,2,4. Previously, intrinsic epigenetic alterations have been associated with HSC aging, such as, for example, increased chromatin accessibility2,24,44,45,82. We also described that some of these epigenetic alterations depend on a reduction of LaminA/C expression in aged HSCs24,54, which is suggestive of a possible impairment of the mechanical properties of the nucleus. Supporting an emerging perspective that focuses on nuclear mechanoregulation9,11,37,83,84, in the present study we investigated the involvement of RhoA in nuclear mechanotrasnduction in HSCs, showing that RhoA is activated by increasing NE tension under cell confinement, by chromatin decompaction after NaB treatment, by nuclear swelling after hypotonic osmotic shock and after reduction of H3K9 methylation levels. We identify the loss of methylation of H3K9 as a likely cause not only of RhoA overactivation and increased NE tension in aged HSCs but also of many phenotypes associated with functional aging of HSCs. Interestingly, G9a activity is required for Ri restoration of H3K9me2 levels in aged HSCs. Further work is necessary to clarify mechanistically how RhoA activity downregulation affects the activity of this histone methyltransferase. Differently from other cell types30,31, we show that, in HSCs, RhoA is not involved in transducing changes in extracellular stiffness, because RhoA is dispensable in the response to changes induced by culturing HSCs on hydrogel with high stiffness. However, because of the complexity of the mechanical BM microenvironment, we cannot exclude that RhoA might be activated by other extracellular signaling when HSCs are within their niche in vivo. Furthermore, our results reveal that NE tension is physiologically increased upon HSC aging and that NE tension is necessary to activate RhoA in aged HSCs. RhoA activity in aged HSCs can be targeted by a specific small-molecule inhibitor33,85, which restores H3K9me2 levels and recovers the phenotypes of young HSC nuclei, such as DAPI intensity, DIR volume, number and localization. This is further supported by our machine learning approach, which demonstrates that DAPI imaging of morphometric and intensity features can be used to explain differences between HSCs and to inform on the age and fitness of the stem cells. To note, DAPI intensity and nuclear morphology features may vary with cell cycle state, whereas, in our experimental setting, HSCs were mainly in G0/early G1 with no differences across samples. Notably, by ATAC−seq and RNA-seq, we detected a downregulation in chromatin accessibility and transcription at LTRs and LINE and a decrease in inflammation, immune response, interferon-responsive genes and aging signatures in aged Ri-treated HSCs (Extended Data Table 1). Moreover, after treatment of aged HSCs with Ri, we measured an increased transcription of Klf4, an opening of KLF4 binding motifs and an increased activity of KLF4 transcription factor (Extended Data Table 1). Genes targeted by KLF4 are enriched for pathways related to actin polymerization, and the increased levels of F-actin are likely acting to restrict nuclear stretching in aged Ri-treated HSCs (Extended Data Table 1). Moreover, scRNA-seq profiling revealed that KLF4 also targets genes enriched for a signature of hemogenic precursors, compatible with a partial reprogramming of aged HSCs, supporting the functional improvement in the regenerative capacity and myeloid/lymphoid skewing of aged+Ri stem cells in transplantation assays (Fig. Thus far, several reports associated the aging process of different cell types with an epigenetic drift involving loss of heterochromatin and H3K9me and a disregulation of normally silenced and closed retrotransposons56,58,59,86,87. Here we report that an intrinsic nuclear mechanosignaling pathway dependent on RhoA can be pharmacologically targeted to revert these drifted epigenetic features, improving function of aged somatic stem cells (Fig. In the present study, the function of young, aged and aged+Ri HSCs was tested in a non-competitive transplantation assay, isolating sorted stem cells to be transplanted after in vitro treatment in young immunocompromised and KitW-41J mutant (NBSGW) recipient mice. Therefore, recipient mice were not challenged by preconditioning regimens that would disrupt the BM architecture and the cellular composition of the niche, likely exposing donor HSCs to a profoundly distinct mechanical environment88. However, in these settings, we did not perform secondary transplants with donor-derived HSCs, and further work will be required to evaluate the effect of RhoA inhibition on HSC function longer term. To note, whereas dominant negative RhoA was previously reported to increase HSC engraftment in mice89, overactivation of RhoA has been associated with functional impairment of human HSCs, further supporting possible translations of our findings90. Altogether, our data shed light on how intrinsic nuclear mechanotransduction controls aging-related epigenetic drift of somatic stem cells and uncover a potential target for improving tissue homeostasis over time. All mouse experiments were performed in compliance with ethical regulations according to the Spanish Law for Animal Protection and Welfare Code and were previously approved in project AR18008/10399 by the Biomedical Research Institute of Bellvitge Ethical Committee for Animal Experimentation (CEEA-IDIBELL) as well as by the Generalitat of Catalunya. A list of reagents, chemicals, commercial kits and antibodies is provided as Supplementary Table 6. Young and aged C57BL/6 mice were obtained from the internal divisional stock (derived from mice obtained from The Jackson Laboratory (JAX)). Young and aged acRFP C57BL/6 mice were obtained from the internal divisional stock (originally kindly donated by Hans Jörg Fehling, Ulm University, and previously described81). The NBSGW mice were obtained from the internal divisional stock (derived from mice obtained from JAX, 026622) and were maintained as homozygotes. All mice were housed in the animal barrier facility under pathogen-free conditions at IDIBELL. Young mice discussed in this Article are 10−20 weeks old, and aged mice are at least 80 weeks old. Young mice were randomized for sex, and an equal number of male and female mice were used across samples. Aged mice were all females. Mice were not randomized for age, and operators were not blinded because aged mice require special care and attention. For the transplantation study, NBSGW mice were randomized for sex, and an equal number of male and female mice were used across samples. Mice that failed to recover from blood sampling and mice that died due to laboratory errors were excluded. Mice that needed to be euthanized because they were scored as ‘weak and about to die' according to our approved animal license protocol for evaluating mouse health status remained part of the dataset. Allocation to control or treated group was done randomly (4−5 mice in each experimental group in four different experimental batches). All animals were maintained according to the recommendations of the European Convention for the Protection of Vertebrate Animals used for Experimental and other Scientific Purposes (ETS 123). Animals were housed in groups of up to four animals per cage in Makrolon Type II (long) cages with bedding and paper nesting material. The animals had access to food (ssniff, V1124-3) and water ad libitum. Animals were kept at a day/night rhythm of 12 hours/12 hours throughout the entire experiment. Freshly sorted HSCs were seeded on fibronectin-coated glass coverslips. For polarity staining, HSCs were incubated for 12–16 hours in HBSS + 10% FBS + 1% penicillin−streptomycin and, when indicated, treated with 100 µM Ri33, 5 mM NaB, 20 µM cPLA2 inhibitor (AACOCF316), hypotonic medium, UNC0646 and arachidonic acid or left untreated. After incubation at 37 °C, 5% CO2, 3% O2 in growth factor-free medium, cells were fixed with BD Cytofix fixation buffer (BD Biosciences). After fixation, cells were gently washed with PBS, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich) in PBS for 20 minutes and blocked with 10% donkey serum (Sigma-Aldrich) for 30 minutes. Primary and secondary antibody incubations were performed for 1 hour at room temperature. Cells were stained with a DAPI dilution 1:500 in PBS of DAPI 1 µg µl−1 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 10 minutes at room temperature and washed twice with PBS. Coverslips were mounted with ProLong Gold Antifade reagent without DAPI (Invitrogen, Molecular Probes). Samples were imaged with an Axio Observer Z1 microscope (Zeiss) equipped with a ×63 PH3 objective and an LSM 880 confocal microscope (Zeiss) equipped with a ×63 objective. z-stacks were obtained by automatically scanning along the z axis of the cell with a confocal microscope and acquiring a picture of the in-focus plane every 0.2−0.4 μm. Samples for immunofluorescence quantification analysis were rigorously sorted, stained and imaged in parallel within the same experiment to minimize any possible technical variability. Image acquisition at the confocal was carried out consistently in between experiments regarding laser power, z-stack size and gain master. Antibody specificities were validated using a knockout model in the case of RhoA-GTP or using a control sample only with the secondary antibody in the staining protocol for the rest of the stainings. Quantification of protein signals was done using Volocity software 7.0 (Quorum Technologies) using the ‘volume by intensity' tool, which sets a threshold for the positive signal against the negative. Positive signal threshold was set for each experiment by using RhoAKO for RhoA-GTP and with the secondary antibody for the rest of the stainings. Morphometric measurements were done using Volocity software 6.5 or by our computational vision approach. Quantifications of DAPI volume were done with the ‘volume' tool and nuclear height average (NHA), and diameter was done using the tool ‘line'. Immunofluorescence image 3D reconstruction and rendering were performed using Imaris 9.5.0 (Oxford Instruments) using the ‘surface' tool, keeping the threshold constant for the signal in between experiments and conditions. As for polarity scoring, the localization of each single stained protein was considered polarized when a clear asymmetric distribution was visible by drawing a line across the middle of the cell. A total of 50−100 HSCs were singularly analyzed per sample. Data are plotted as percentage of the total number of cells scored per sample. HSC nucleus microscopy images were exported as Carl Zeiss CZI files for downstream analysis and processed using the Python programming language. Images acquired with a different microscope than the ones specified above, and images belonging to experiments in which more than 30 days passed between nucleus staining and image data acquisition were excluded from these analyses. As a first quality control, images displaying total pixel intensities higher than 4 × 108 were labeled as overexposed to DAPI and discarded. >8) were labeled as noisy and also excluded from further analyses. The remaining images were then corrected using Chambolle's total variation denoising method91. Because image acquisition measurements were dynamically adjusted to the size of the nucleus, each 3D image was resized to achieve a uniform resolution of 10 pixels per micrometer in all dimensions through isotropic interpolation that accounted for variations in the number of z-stacks obtained. For each image, a nucleus binary mask was extracted using the Otsu segmentation method92 after smoothing with a Gaussian filter and allowing for hysteresis to preserve the nuclear border with higher confidence. Potential holes in the binary mask due to low-intensity areas within the nucleus were filled and marked as part of the segmentation. Marginal intensities outside the nucleus mask were removed. DAPI intake within the nucleus is affected by both biological and technical factors. To mitigate batch effects related to technical variation in fluorescence signal, we standardized the pixel intensity distribution within each nucleus mask to yield 0 mean and 1 s.d. This approach removes technical artifacts and ensures that downstream analyses reflect biological rather than acquisition-related variability. We validated our nuclear segmentation pipeline by manually annotating 426 slices from nine nuclei (three per condition) using Napari, excluding the top and bottom 20% of z-slices. Automated Otsu-based segmentations showed high agreement with manual masks (Dice: 0.96 ± 0.02; Precision: 0.99 ± 0.01; Recall: 0.93 ± 0.03). Full details and representative overlays are provided in the supplementary methods. Intensity by distance analyses were performed at iso-distance intervals of 0.1 µm from the boundary of the nucleus segmentation, using a distance-transformed mask. A distance-transformed mask is a mask in which each pixel value represents the shortest geodesic distance to the nearest mask boundary. The average intensity value of all pixels within a 3D band with a thickness of 0.15 µm was reported at each measurement interval. Young, aged and aged+Ri conditions were measured up to a distance of 1.6 µm from the nuclear border. Box plots of DAPI intensity by discrete distance ranges were computed, taking into account the average intensity of all pixels within the specified distance boundaries for each interval. Most morphometric and intensity features were measured with the scikit-image Python library93 regionprops_table() function at the nuclear mask level, at the DIR level and on the largest 2D slide in the x−y plane from each 3D image, comprising a total of 39 features (Supplementary Table 2). The width, length and height of each nucleus were obtained from its bounding box. Height deviation was calculated as the average standard deviation of height in the x dimension for each y−z slide. The aspect ratio was defined as the ratio of height to length. The surface area was calculated using the Marching Cubes algorithm after smoothing the nucleus mask with a Gaussian filter. Detailed information about each of these features is shown in Supplementary Table 2. DIRs were defined based on intensity, not spatial pattern. Specifically, DIRs correspond to the top 20% of standardized DAPI intensity values across all 3D young nuclei, yielding a fixed threshold of 0.6 after z-score normalization. This approach identifies DIRs as high-intensity subregions within each nucleus. More information about the definition of DIRs, including visualizations for various nuclei and conditions, is included in the supplementary methods. DIRs were segmented using the watershed method on the thresholder images. The intensity standardization of the images allowed for the choice of an absolute thresholding value for all nuclei. We set this parameter to the quantile 80% of the intensity distribution for all young nuclei. Individual DIRs were labeled and segmented with watershed by identifying the intensity peaks as the local maxima in the Euclidean distance transform of the thresholder images. From the total of segmented DIRs, we filtered out those displaying a voxel volume smaller than 0.2 µm. Morphometric and intensity features were measured on the resulting DIR segmentation mask in the same manner as with the nuclear mask. DIR distance to border was computed as the average of the distances for each voxel within each DIR to the nuclear mask border. After the calculation of these measurements, a second quality control was conducted to eliminate images that produced artifacts in the nuclear and DIR segmentation. The images were filtered out if they produced nuclear masks with a voxel volume smaller than 40 µm3, an EOP larger than 0.25 or a DIR volume larger than 5 µm3, which mostly belonged to confined nuclei that were damaged during the experimental setup and failed nuclear mask segmentations. Feature selection was conducted to reduce dimensionality while preserving biological interpretability. We started from an initial set of 39 features derived from 3D nuclear masks, DIRs and 2D projections (Supplementary Table 1). These included 17 whole-nucleus features, 15 DIR-level features and seven from the largest 2D z-slice. Feature selection was conducted in two steps. First, we identified features that significantly differed between biological conditions (young versus aged and aged versus aged+Ri) using a two-sided Mann−Whitney U-test (P < 0.05). This yielded 23 features distinguishing young from aged and 18 distinguishing aged from aged+Ri. The union of these (n = 29) was retained. To remove redundancy, we applied pairwise Pearsonʼs correlation filtering, discarding features with |r| > 0.8. In cases of redundancy, the retained feature was selected based on domain relevance. The resulting non-redundant feature set (n = 20) included nine whole-nucleus features, eight DIR features and 3D from 2D projections. These were used as input for UMAP embedding and clustering (Extended Data Fig. The final set shows low overall inter-feature correlation (mean |r| = 0.22) and captures the morphometric and intensity-based variation across conditions. These features were standardized and used to train the UMAP42 model on young, aged and aged+Ri-treated nuclei. Clustering was conducted in the original multidimensional parameter space using the k-means algorithm94 with k = 4 and depicted in the UMAP embedding. This value of k yielded the best silhouette scores for all clusters (Extended Data Fig. The resulting clusters revealed biologically relevant groups combining images from the young, aged and aged+Ri conditions. Clustering quality and stability were evaluated using multiple validation metrics and subsampling analysis, as described in detail in the supplementary methods. The confinement device used in this protocol was adapted to a single-well plate from a previously described method11,95. In brief, the confinement device was made by a magnetic container, two metallic rings, a polymeric ring and a closing ring (Extended Data Fig. The compression is mediated by a pillar coverslip, a polymeric piston and the magnetic lid of the device that exerts the confinement pressure. In total, 3,000 HSCs were seeded in a volume of 40 µl of HBSS + 10% FBS + 1% penicillin−streptomycin onto a 35-mm glass coverslip. The coverslip was previously functionalized with fibronectin: 40 µl of fibronectin (50 µg ml−1) was applied upon the surface of the coverslip for 2 hours at room temperature, blocked with the same volume of BSA 2% for 1 hour at 37 °C and washed with PBS Ca2+/Mg2+. The coverslip with cells was mounted in the confinement device and compressed with pillars of 3 µm, 5 µm and 8 µm for 2 hours at 37 °C in a hypoxic incubator (5% CO2, 3% O2). Cells were then fixed directly in the confinement device with 1 ml of paraformaldehyde 4.21% (BD Cytofix, Thermo Fisher Scientific, 15817828) at 4 °C for 15 minutes. The sample on the coverslip was then removed from the confiner and stocked at 4 °C in PBS for a maximum of 2 weeks before staining. To analyze nuclear wrinkling in LaminB-stained HSCs, we developed an automatic image analysis pipeline in MATLAB (MathWorks, R2024b). Fluorescence images of LaminB were acquired in an LSM 880 confocal microscope (Zeiss), as mentioned above in ‘Immunofluorescence staining and confocal images acquisition'. For each dataset, the equatorial maximum cross-section section was identified from z-slices, and three slices were selected above and below, covering approximately 50% of the nucleus surface with optimal resolution of surface wrinkles in the lateral x−y dimension. Selected image slices were then subjected to binning (factor n = 3) using a bilinear interpolation to reduce noise and facilitate subsequent processing steps, effectively preserving key structural information. A threshold intensity of 25 counts was applied to create a binary mask and to segment the regions of interest representing the nuclear envelope. A Gaussian blur with a sigma of 3 pixels was applied to the binary mask to smooth the segmented regions and facilitate the subsequent skeletonization of NE features based on a morphological thinning algorithm. To remove structural artifacts outside the nuclear region of interest, the skeletonized image was filled to generate an inner region (representing the inside of the nuclear wrinkles) and an outer region (around the nucleus periphery) by applying an inverted mask to the filled skeleton. This allowed us to separate the NE from the surrounding structures and detect the points representing nuclear invaginations. The coordinates of the nuclear surface and inner invaginations represent the total nuclear periphery and were extracted for further quantitative metrics of nuclear wrinkles. We derived the nuclear circularity (C = 4πA / P2) from the total perimeter P and area A of nuclear cross-sections from multiple z-slices for each cell. The circularity provides a quantitative measure of NE deformations, with values close to 1 indicating a more circular shape and values <1 indicating a highly deformed and wrinkled nuclear surface. In addition, we derived the excess folding parameter (E = 1 − p / P) as the ratio of the boundary outline of the nucleus p to the total perimeter P of nuclear cross-sections, with values close to 0 resembling a circular shape and values closer to 1 indicating increased nuclear wrinkling. Statistical data analysis was performed in GraphPad Prism (version 10.2.3.) using a Kruskal−Wallis test for multiple comparisons. Statistical data analysis derived from protein quantification from both image data and western blot and transplantation analysis were performed using GraphPad Prism version 10.2.3. The statistical test applied is indicated in the corresponding figure legend. An exception was done in the case of H3K9me2 immunofluorescence signal quantification in Fig. 4a, in which we did not remove outliers to preserve the high biological variability for this marker in HSCs, in agreement with previous reports24,48. As for experiments involving mice, sample size was determined according to the standard deviation of the measured parameter. We used StatMate and the statistical guide of Prism to help with sample size calculation. No method of randomization was used to assign mice to experimental groups, but groups were balanced by sex, except for aged mice that were all females. For in vitro experiments, no statistical methods were used to predetermine sample size, but our sample sizes are similar to those reported in previous publications11,24,53,96. Outliers were excluded as based on the ROUT method, aggressiveness Q = 1% (recommended by Prism). 7c,d, data were excluded when engraftment did not reach 0.1% of peripheral blood, when the mouse died before the endpoint and in case the value was marked as an outlier by Prism.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Researchers from Mass General Brigham conducted a new study examining whether five widely followed diets could help prevent chronic constipation in middle- and older-age adults. The team monitored more than 96,000 participants for several years to see how long-term eating habits influenced the likelihood of developing this persistent gastrointestinal issue. Previous research has demonstrated that healthy diets can ease constipation symptoms, but this study is the first to show that some diets may actually prevent chronic constipation from developing. Using information from the Nurses' Health Study, Nurses' Health Study II and the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study, the investigators evaluated long-term dietary patterns in middle- and older-age adults and identified who later experienced chronic constipation, which was defined as symptoms lasting at least 12 weeks within a year. "Our findings suggest a diet rich in vegetables, nuts and healthy fats may help prevent chronic constipation in middle- and older-age adults," said Staller.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Experts from around the world are raising alarms about the rapid global rise of ultra-processed foods, warning that UPFs are reshaping diets and driving a surge in chronic health problems. A new three paper Series in The Lancet, written by 43 international experts, warns that the rapid spread of ultra-processed foods (UPFs) across global diets is creating a serious public health challenge. The Series offers a plan for stronger government action, greater community involvement, and broader access to affordable, nutritious foods. Professor Carlos Monteiro, University of Sao Paulo, Brazil, explains, "The growing consumption of ultra-processed foods is reshaping diets worldwide, displacing fresh and minimally processed foods and meals. UPFs, based on the Nova classification, are industrially produced branded foods created from low cost ingredients such as hydrogenated oils, protein isolates or glucose/fructose syrup, along with cosmetic additives (e.g. dyes, artificial sweeteners, emulsifiers). These products are intentionally formulated and promoted to replace fresh foods and traditional meals, while maximizing profits for manufacturers (for a detailed definition see paper 1, panel 1). The findings consistently show that UPFs are crowding out traditional dietary patterns, lowering overall diet quality, and contributing to higher risks of many chronic diseases. National surveys also reveal substantial increases in UPF consumption (paper 1, figure 1). A systematic review of 104 long-term studies found that 92 showed higher risks for at least one chronic disease, with meta-analyses identifying significant associations with 12 health conditions including obesity, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, depression, and premature death (paper 1, figure 4, appendix p23-24). While the authors acknowledge scientific debates about Nova and UPF definitions -- including the need for more long-term trials, clearer mechanisms, and recognition of product subgroups with differing nutritional qualities -- they emphasize that further research should not delay immediate public health action. Professor Mathilde Touvier, French National Institute for Health and Medical Research (Inserm), France, states, "While healthy debate about UPFs within the scientific community is welcomed, this should be distinguished from attempts by vested interests to undermine the current evidence. The second paper in the Series outlines policy options to curb UPF production, marketing, and consumption, holding major companies accountable for promoting unhealthy diets (paper 2, table 1). These recommendations are intended to strengthen existing legislation targeting high fat, salt and sugar (HFSS) foods. Professor Barry Popkin, University of North Carolina, US, says "We call for including ingredients that are markers of UPFs (eg, colors, flavors, and sweeteners) in front-of-package labels, alongside excessive saturated fat, sugar, and salt, to prevent unhealthy ingredient substitutions, and enable more effective regulation." One example of successful reform is Brazil's national school feeding program, which has removed most UPFs and will require 90% of school food to be fresh or minimally processed by 2026 (paper 2, panel 4). Professor Marion Nestle, New York University, US, notes, "Improving diets worldwide requires policies tailored to each country's unique situation and how entrenched UPFs have become in people's daily eating habits. Associate Professor Gyorgy Scrinis, University of Melbourne, Australia, adds, "Importantly, policies must ensure that fresh and minimally processed foods are accessible and affordable -- not just for those with time to cook, but for busy families and individuals who rely on convenient options. Only by combining stricter regulation on poor quality food products with realistic support for more nutritious choices can we truly promote better diets for all." These companies use low cost ingredients, large-scale production methods, and highly persuasive marketing to encourage widespread consumption. The profits help fuel expansion, marketing power, and political influence, reinforcing corporate dominance over modern food systems. The Series explains that UPF companies rely on sophisticated political strategies to protect their interests -- blocking regulations, influencing scientific debates, shaping public opinion, supporting hundreds of interest groups, lobbying, donating to political campaigns, and engaging in litigation to delay policy action (paper 3, table 1 and figure 2). Through interest groups, these corporations often position themselves as part of the solution, but their actions tell a different story -- one focused on protecting profits and resisting effective regulation." The authors call for a global public health movement to protect policy-making from industry interference, end ties between industry and health organizations, and strengthen networks advocating for reduced UPF consumption. Professor Karen Hoffman, University of the Witwatersrand, South Africa, says, "Just as we confronted the tobacco industry decades ago, we need a bold, coordinated global response now to curb the overproportionate power of UPF corporations and build food systems that prioritize people's health and well-being." Dr. Phillip Baker concludes, "We are currently living in a world where our food options are increasingly dominated by UPFs, contributing to rising global levels of obesity, diabetes and mental ill-health. Our Series highlights that a different path is possible -- one where governments regulate effectively, communities mobilize, and healthier diets are accessible and affordable for all."
