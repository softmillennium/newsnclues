New CBS/YouGov polling conducted late last week shows that 70 percent of Americans say that they would oppose the U.S. taking military action in Venezuela, with only 30 percent saying they support such an action. Over three-quarters of Americans, 76 percent, say that the administration has not “clearly explained the U.S. position on military action in Venezuela.” The vast majority also say that President Donald Trump needs to provide an explanation, including 97 percent of Democrats, 86 percent of independents, and 64 percent of Republicans, the poll found. Most Americans say that Venezuela is either not a threat to the U.S., or only a minor threat, at 39 percent and 48 percent, respectively. But the administration has been steadily escalating its campaign in Latin America, blowing past warnings they're committing war crimes, concerns from members of Congress that officials are encroaching on their war powers, and even alarm from within the administration that the operation is illegal. But his opinions were overruled by more senior officials, despite concerns that troops could be held liable for carrying out the boat strikes. CBS and YouGov's polling further found that three-quarters of Americans said that Trump needs congressional approval to carry out strikes within Venezuela. A top Department of Justice lawyer has claimed that Trump has the authority to carry out the boat strikes regardless of Congress, saying that they do not qualify as “hostilities” that would trigger requirements under the War Powers Resolution. He followed with a long list of complaints and unverified claims about the country, like that Venezuela “emptied their prisons” into the U.S. — a lie that the Trump administration has repeated numerous times in part to justify their immigration raids. The poll additionally found that most Americans disapprove of Trump's handling of immigration, at 55 percent, and believe that ICE is stopping more people than necessary, at 54 percent.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Quality journalism takes work — and a community that cares. Editor's note: The story was updated with additional details. The two sides said they had drafted an "updated and refined peace framework" after the initial 28-point peace plan pushed by the Trump administration was met with backlash over conditions that heavily favored Russia. "The talks were constructive, focused, and respectful, underscoring the shared commitment to achieving a just and lasting peace," the statement read, adding that any future ceasefire proposal would need to "fully uphold Ukraine's sovereignty." Undisclosed sources told the Financial Times that the new plan was cut down from 28 points to 19, but did not specify which points were removed. Roughly two-thirds of the $300 billion in frozen Russian assets are held in the EU, which is developing plans on using them for long-term support for Kyiv. "Very few things are left from the original version," Kyslytsia said. "Today — and we've talked to (Trump) since — I think he's quite pleased at the reports we've given him about the amount of progress that's been made," Rubio told reporters in Switzerland. "I think we all recognize that part of getting a final end to this war will require for Ukraine to feel that it is safe and it is never going to be invaded or attacked again," he added. Andriy Yermak, head of Ukraine's Presidential Office and the leader of the Ukrainian delegation, confirmed the two sides "made very good progress and are moving forward to a just and lasting peace." Rubio noted the peace plan is a "living, breathing document" and is still subject to change as peace talks continue. "Just because it's printed on a piece of paper doesn't indicate finality, so you get input, and based on that input, you make adjustments, and then you get more input," he said. Trump, on Nov. 22, said the initial peace proposal was not Washington's final offer to Ukraine amid widespread concern that Ukraine was being rushed into an unfavorable agreement. The initially imposed deadline of Nov. 27 could also be extended by several days, Rubio said, adding that he feels "optimistic" that a consensus will be reached "in a very reasonable period of time, very soon." Trump has previously said that Ukraine must make a decision by Thanksgiving Day in the U.S., which falls on Nov. 27. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Moscow was closely monitoring the Geneva negotiations but had not received the updated peace proposal, noting that there are currently no plans for subsequent talks between Russia and the U.S. this week. Amid talks in Geneva, Europe has reportedly issued a counterproposal to the initial 28-point peace plan. Reuters reported that the counterproposal would see Ukraine's military capped at 800,000 troops in peacetime rather than 600,000 in the initial peace plan. Ukraine joining NATO falls on consensus among the alliance's members, which does not exist, the reported proposal stipulates, while also prohibiting NATO from permanently stationing troops on the territory of Ukraine under its command in peacetime. "All civilian detainees and hostages will be returned, including children," the proposed peace plan stipulates, as reported by Reuters. The counterproposal also calls for U.S.—backed security guarantees that mirror NATO's Article 5, which, when invoked, considers an attack on one member an attack on all members. NATO's Article 5 is a defining feature of the alliance. Europe's counterproposal, as reported by Reuters, also sees the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant fall under international control, with produced electricity divided between Ukraine and Russia. Ukraine remains ready for peace talks with Russia but will never legally recognize the Russian occupation or accept restrictions on its army size or alliances, Parliament Speaker Ruslan Stefanchuk said. "I think we all recognize that part of getting a final end to this war will require for Ukraine to feel that it is safe and it is never going to be invaded or attacked again," U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said. Kyiv's European partners reportedly pitched the plan as a counter-proposal to a 28-point document backed by the Trump administration, which was criticized for heavily favoring Russia. Volodymyr B. was charged with assisting what Warsaw called an "unprecedented act of sabotage," allegedly orchestrated by Russian intelligence. The Brom plant is a major manufacturer of bromine and related salts, the only one of its kind in Eastern Europe. Russian forces launched a massive drone attack on Kharkiv on the evening of Nov. 23, killing at least four people and injuring at least 13, regional officials said.

MOSCOW, November 24. /TASS/. The European Union has become the main instrument of the "global war party," which relies on appointed, not elected, officials, Federation Council Speaker Valentina Matviyenko has said.

"The European Union has today become the main instrument in the hands of the global war party," she said in an interview with a Moscow daily.

Any peace plan in the EU is turned into a plan to continue the war, she noted.

"I would like to draw attention to the individuals on whom this global war party relies. The policy of opposing US President Donald Trump - the legitimate president who won the election with a clear advantage and received the support of voters - is being determined in the EU by unelected, appointed European officials who are not accountable to the people for anything," Matviyenko emphasized. The European Commission is the main executive body of the EU, it consists of EU commissioners, they are appointed by the EU member-states, each of which puts forward its own candidate.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ukraine has been cornered into weighing terms it cannot accept and faces threat of losing its most important ally The Kremlin has barely lifted a finger in recent days. The 28-point US-Russia peace proposal, leaked to the media last week, has thrown Washington, Kyiv and European capitals into disarray, creating precisely the conditions Vladimir Putin has long sought: a negotiating table sharply tilted in the Russian president's favour, with Ukraine cornered into weighing terms it cannot accept and the threat of losing its most important ally hanging over its head. Since Donald Trump's return to power, both Putin and Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Ukraine's president, have worked relentlessly to convince the US they are not the side resisting peace. For his part, the US president has oscillated wildly – blasting one side or the other with angry posts and threats. After the Trump-Putin summit in Alaska, which by most accounts left the US president dissatisfied, he briefly appeared to side more openly with Kyiv, accusing Russia of blocking peace. But last week's peace plan – largely drafted in Florida by the US property developer Steve Witkoff and Kirill Dmitriev, the head of Russia's sovereign wealth fund – has upended that dynamic. The US president wrote on his Truth Social platform complaining that Kyiv's leadership had “EXPRESSED ZERO GRATITUDE FOR OUR EFFORTS”. For days, the foreign ministry feigned ignorance, insisting it knew nothing of any peace initiative, before Putin himself said late on Friday that the proposals “could form the basis of a final peace settlement”. The Kremlin believes any move by Zelenskyy to accept something close to the 28-point draft would trigger political turmoil in Ukraine – an outcome Moscow would welcome. And Putin knows Ukraine cannot simply abandon the talks: it remains reliant on US-supplied weapons and intelligence and could face a catastrophic winter if its central ally walked away. “He will certainly say: Yes, let's work on this – here are my amendments.” Tatiana Stanovaya, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center, said the current proposal – which she described as clumsily drafted – leaves too much room for interpretation, making it the sort of document Putin would never sign. The proposal's vague wording on Ukraine's neutrality and Nato's future expansion, she said, would demand concrete “documents, timelines and commitments – none of which appear in the draft”. According to Stanovaya, Putin is unlikely to retreat from his main goal of subjugating Ukraine and will instead push for a revised version of the current plan that more fully reflects Russia's interests. But if diplomacy stalls, she said Putin would see “no problem with continuing the war” as the Kremlin believes Ukraine's position will worsen over time – especially if Trump follows through on threats to halt US military aid. It's far too early for Moscow to celebrate,” Stanovaya said. Ukraine's hope, as in past rounds of diplomacy, is that with its European allies it can reshape the proposal into something acceptable for Kyiv and persuade Trump to back that version. On Monday, the US and Ukraine produced a 19-point peace plan that is markedly more favourable to Kyiv, but deferred the most politically sensitive questions for later. Lukyanov said Russia would maintain military pressure “at its current level” until Ukraine accepted the original 28-point plan, after which Moscow would be ready to move to detailed discussions.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>While Russian attacks pounded Ukraine's power system, one energy company remained mostly unscathed — becoming the cash cow that fueled the largest corruption scheme of President Volodymyr Zelensky's presidency. Earlier this month, Ukraine's anti-corruption bureau (NABU) raided the homes of ex-Energy Minister Herman Halushchenko and Zelensky's former business partner Timur Mindich in connection with a $100 million kickback scheme involving Energoatom, the state-owned nuclear operator. So far, NABU has charged eight people in connection with the case. Russia's full-scale invasion opened the door to new opportunities for exploitation. Nuclear safety took priority over corruption issues, while contracts for anti-drone constructions and repairs facilitated bribes. It's also one of the only profitable state-owned companies left as Russian strikes terrorize other energy firms. Energoatom operates Ukraine's nuclear power plants, which produce around 50% of Ukraine's energy generation, making it the largest single source of generation. The NABU investigation into Energoatom shocked Ukraine as cash-strapped energy companies have struggled to buy equipment after devastating strikes plunged the country into blackouts. One of those allies is Halushchenko, who worked at Energoatom for years before heading the Energy Ministry in 2021 until July 2025. Desperate to do some damage control after the corruption scandal broke, Zelensky pressured Halushchenko to step down from his position as justice minister and announced a full reset of Ukraine's state-owned companies, including Energoatom. "It is critical how Zelensky deals with this scandal. He has to deal with it as a systemic problem, not just an isolated case," Viesturs Liegis, managing partner at Amrop, a supervisory board consultant that works with Ukrainian state-enterprises, told the Kyiv Independent. Supervisory boards were implemented to monitor and manage the big state players. But unlike its counterparts, Energoatom never established a fully functional supervisory board. For some companies like Ukrenergo, the state-owned grid operator, reforms were critical for EU integration in order to switch to European specifications. But since Brussels doesn't have a policy for nuclear energy, Energoatom's reforms weren't a major priority for Kyiv or its partners, Olena Pavlenko, president of DiXi Group, an energy think tank, told the Kyiv Independent. One glaring issue was the infestation of pro-Russian officials, Shevchuk said. They pushed back against efforts to drag Energoatom towards Europe and away from Moscow. Energoatom also hid behind an opaque procurement system, allowing it to price-gouge, justifying the lack of transparency by calling nuclear energy a sensitive security issue, Pavlenko said. He and his group made sure that Skoda, an engineering firm, won tenders for equipment in exchange for kickbacks, according to Ukraine's High Anti-Corruption Court. As a result of its toxic reputation, foreign financial institutions like the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) reconsidered their cooperation with Energoatom. With the Russians threatening a Chornobyl-level disaster after occupying the Zaporizhzhia plant, Kyiv and its allies reoriented their focus to nuclear safety. International financial institutions, which had once been very involved in corporate governance oversight, began to play a less active role, said Liegis. They refrained from publicly criticizing the government, likely because they didn't want to harm its reputation during the war, he added. "It seemed the Energy Ministry was determined to avoid appointing someone who understands finances." In 2023, Energoatom launched a competition for its supervisory board. Energoatom eventually formed a full five-person supervisory board in June 2024, with three independent experts and two state-appointed representatives. By that time, one board member, Timothy Stone, the only one with both a financial and nuclear background, refused to sign his contract due to the holdup. "From my perspective, it seemed the Energy Ministry was determined to avoid appointing someone who understands finances," said Liegis. It benefited from steadily increasing electricity tariffs, which Kyiv introduced to raise money for war-ravaged energy companies, while avoiding costly Russian strikes.The need for defensive structures around Energoatom's infrastructure, like substations and lines connecting plants to the grid, as well as damage from attacks, also presented the company with an opportunity. As Russian drones wrecked energy infrastructure, companies began seeking contractors for repairs and defensive fortifications. Halushchenko and his cronies were able to exploit these wartime contracts, charging contractors 10–15% kickbacks on deals, according to the NABU investigation. Without a working supervisory board, there was no corporate oversight to catch the scheme. As a result, defensive fortifications were delayed, helping push Ukraine to the brink of an all-out energy crisis. The NABU investigation has put pressure on the government and foreign partners to focus again on Ukraine's corporate governance, said Liegis. But while Zelensky's sweeping reforms of state enterprises will try to win back trust, Energoatom will likely remain a pariah for the near future. "If there is a cleaning of the procurement processes, an anti-corruption action plan, a proper compliance office, and they establish the integrity of the management team, and if there is a project that is commercially viable within our policies, then we will consider working with Energoatom again," EBRD Vice President Matteo Patrone told the Kyiv Independent on Nov. 20.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Kremlin is aware of a European peace plan for Ukraine; however, a brief review of its provisions reveals it to be unconstructive, Russian Presidential Aide Yury Ushakov told the media in response to a TASS inquiry. "Regarding the proposals circulating: this morning, we learned of a European plan that, at first glance, appears entirely unconstructive and unsuitable for us," Ushakov stated. Ukrainian media reported that Washington and Kiev reached consensus on most aspects of the plan. Rubio noted that the US agreed to separate negotiations on Ukraine's European integration and those concerning its NATO membership. Western media sources indicate that the initial draft of the US peace plan proposed Ukraine's renunciation of NATO membership and a commitment from the alliance not to pursue Kiev's integration. EU leaders voiced disagreement with the American proposals. In response, Germany, France, and Britain submitted their own draft settlement proposals for Ukraine, the full text of which was published by Reuters. The European troika's plan permits Ukraine's accession to NATO and the stationing of NATO troops on Ukrainian soil under national command. Additionally, the Europeans advocate for an armed force of 800,000 personnel during peacetime. In return, Russia is offered the opportunity to "resume security discussions."</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Donald Doolittle, 58, a safety director at the Gateway Community church in Webster, south-east of Houston, has been charged with impersonating a public servant. He wanted to pay with a credit card; the woman said she only accepted cash or payment via Zelle, a digital network. Police said Doolittle then pulled out an ID card labelled “ICE”, identified himself as an Immigrations and Customs Enforcement agent, and asked to see the woman's identification. She showed him her temporary visa but Doolittle allegedly then demanded money. “He demanded she Zelle him $500 or he would take her away and she would never see her family or children again,” a magistrate said during a court hearing on Saturday. Police said he later told her she wouldn't hear from any other ICE agents because he had marked her case for non-prosecution, and asked her to delete their text message exchange, according to ABC News. When interviewed by investigators, police said Doolittle denied getting a massage or going to the victim's business, but police said surveillance video proved otherwise. Some victims have been directed to download ransomware to their computer, which then freezes and shows a message that they must pay the ICE Cyber Crimes Center $400 within 48 hours to have it unlocked. Other extortion efforts, according to the Federal Trade Commission, include phone or email scammers pretending to be from ICE claiming you have violated immigration law, that your identity information is wrong or out of date, or that you owe fees or need to pay an immigration bond. “They'll threaten to alert the police or to have you deported if you don't give them the information they want.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When Volodymyr Zelensky was presented with the US plan to end the Ukraine war on Thursday, he met not Donald Trump's secretary of war but a little-known 38-year-old seen as the Pentagon's rising star. Mr Trump, the US president, refers to him as his “drone guy,” owing to his push to modernise America's forces with military tech and move away from heavy, outdated defence systems. He is also now seen as a favourite to replace Mr Hegseth as Pentagon chief should the position become available. A former senior White House official told The Telegraph that Mr Driscoll is the “workhorse” who is “exactly” what Mr Trump is looking for, and can deliver where the defence secretary has failed. Mr Driscoll had what he called a comfortable, middle-class childhood, “growing up in the mountains” of Boone, North Carolina. Most of it was spent outdoors, he said on a podcast. His father was an infantryman in the Vietnam War, and his grandfather served in the Second World War. Mr Driscoll was 18 years old when he realised that he too could not miss out on “my generation's war”, starting his basic training in September 2007 and being deployed to Iraq at the tail end of the troop surge. “I do not want to be the kind of person [when] I'm 40, 50, 60 years old and they ask the veterans to stand at an event, and I stay seated,” he recalled. After leaving Iraq, he joined Yale Law School in 2011 and graduated three years later. It was as a first year that he met a second year who had served in the Marine corps and took a group of veterans out for pizza to show them the “lay of the land”. “I know a lot of you guys are going to be self-conscious, you've been out of school for a while,” Mr Driscoll recalled Mr Vance saying. The two men had a lot in common. Both had made their way to Yale Law via the army. Mr Driscoll worked in venture capital and had a brief flirtation with politics in 2020 when he ran for a congressional seat in North Carolina, where he admits to getting his “ass kicked”. Four years later, he was on a summer break in Zurich when Mr Vance called and told him he had just been selected as Mr Trump's running mate. On the way he bought a “super s----y-fitting suit, belt and tie” that he had to retire a month later when a figure close to Mr Trump apparently told him he looked like an intern. The friendship with the vice-president may have protected him after he became army secretary, taking a job in a Pentagon that has been consumed by turmoil since Mr Hegseth took the reins and dismissed dozens of generals, admirals and top aides. Since the defence secretary was narrowly confirmed in his job in January, his reputation has taken a hammering – notably in the Signalgate scandal, when he accidentally leaked US military plans to a journalist. Externally, Mr Driscoll has avoided sticking his head above the parapet. Internally, he is determined to shake up the Pentagon, and tells members of Congress he is a “mixture of a southern Baptist preacher and a jihadist who's going to pull the temple down on all of our heads”. “After a year of endless drama at the Pentagon, Dan's brand of quiet and effective leadership is exactly what President Trump is looking for to get his important reform agenda back on track.” A source told Politico: “There's not a lot of trust in Hegseth to deliver these messages to key leaders… there is more trust in Dan to do that right now.” The Telegraph has previously reported friction between the Pentagon and White House, where Mr Hegseth's senior aides are said to be widely distrusted. Susie Wiles, the White House chief of staff, “doesn't distrust Pete” but “questions his judgment”, another source told Politico. On Friday, CNN reported that Mr Trump was preparing to reshuffle his cabinet after a year in office, although that report was denied by Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary. Mr Hegseth could come under renewed scrutiny once an internal report on his role in the Signalgate scandal is released. Mr Driscoll has been a soldier, law student, venture capitalist, congressional candidate, army secretary and Mr Trump's “drone guy”. Pentagon chief is looking increasingly likely to be his next move.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Premier says he was caught off guard by The Globe and Mail's report that Alberta and Ottawa are close to a pipeline deal This essay is part of the Prosperity's Path series. History appeared to be repeating itself last week. Premier David Eby appeared to offer Alberta something else in lieu of that pipeline. He offered to help increase the capacity of the Trans Mountain Pipeline again, a concession made “through gritted teeth” but which Alberta Premier Danielle Smith said was not good enough. Mr. Eby also raised the spectre of legal challenges, saying Alberta was “playing with fire.” Alberta, Saskatchewan ‘secret' pipeline talks with Ottawa jeopardize economic development, Eby says These events evoke Canada's fraught bid to build pipelines that began in the mid-2000s. Another northwestern pipe, another Trans Mountain expansion and a third route to the East Coast were bogged down in lengthy regulatory and legal processes. Only Trans Mountain was built, though the cost increased to $34-billion, from $5.4-billion, and it was years behind the initial schedule. Prime Minister Mark Carney makes a major projects announcement with Minister of Housing and Infrastructure Gregor Robertson, left, and head of the federal Major Projects Office (MPO), Dawn Farrell, in Terrace, B.C., on Nov. 13. But plainly we now see, the past still echoes. There is a risk of more court challenges if expedited regulatory processes are not properly implemented. To address approval delays for projects of national interest, Canada needs to not only speed up project approvals but also the courts and our dispute-resolution processes. This will provide the necessary timely access to justice that a top-tier economic power must have to attract capital and ensure predictability in major projects approval processes. Analysis: Pipeline mania is distracting from what the talks between Ottawa and Alberta could actually achieve Enbridge Inc.'s Northern Gateway, a pipeline from Alberta to the northwestern coast, was first proposed in 2005. The federally-owned Trans Mountain expansion project, which Mr. Eby wants to expand further, was proposed in 2013. Major natural resource and infrastructure projects in Canada often face challenges in the courts owing to concerns about the adequacy of consultation duties to Indigenous peoples. The Supreme Court of Canada has written hundreds of pages on Indigenous consultation requirements, and we still have much work to do to properly understand the full legal considerations for Indigenous rights and title. Now with projects fast-tracked under the Major Projects Office, the tidal wave in new approvals will likely face a seawall of court processes and disputes. This is to be expected even under the best of circumstances and attempts at obtaining agreements. The number of pending cases on judicial review before federal courts has more than doubled since 2021. It was only mid-March that data showed the vacancies had come down to 13. Federal Court committees have recognized that backlogged cases have created delays in Canadian courts – recommending increased dispute-resolution and case-management processes to address these delays. Judicial reviews of federal permits for major projects could be stuck in these backlogs, leaving proponents with federally approved projects in limbo. The resources that Ottawa is now putting into major projects should be complemented by a material investment in Canada's judicial and dispute-resolution processes. And Ottawa should consider sparing the Justice Department from its across-the-board, 15-per-cent budget cuts. This would ensure that courts are well funded with project-related decision makers ready to go for urgent matters. Court processes are not rubber stamps for government project approvals. Instead, all we seek is that well-resourced courts can ensure fast, fair and efficient processes for all parties, including Indigenous and non-Indigenous governments, project proponents and civil society as a whole. An alternative to adversarial court processes is collaboration. Indigenous governments are increasingly seeking equity stakes in major projects. Building up the courts' capacity must be accompanied by backing broadly supported Indigenous-owned projects. That is Ottawa's best option to avoid consultation-related court delays and positions Canada as a magnet for capital investment. For too long, Canada has overly depended on a market that is now threatening to close itself off. One can only look to the Saskatoon-based Nutrien Ltd.'s decision last week to ship fertilizer from Longview, Wash., instead of any Canadian port, to know that we must better support export infrastructure for Canadian resources. According to a Bank of Canada estimation, the expansion added 0.25 per cent to Canada's economy in the second quarter of 2024 alone. Opinion: What will you sacrifice for Carney and country?

JOHANNESBURG — Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi, who over the weekend took part in her first Group of 20 Summit meeting, sought to raise Japan's profile by actively working to get closer to other world leaders who were gathered for the meeting in Johannesburg. On late Saturday evening, the prime minister posted on X, formerly Twitter, a brief report on what she had done at the summit, along with four photos, including one showing her in a friendly hug with Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni. Takaichi and Meloni had already appeared to have become friendly earlier on Saturday, when Takaichi exchanged greetings with leaders at the beginning of a discussion on peace in Ukraine among relevant countries, which was held at a short notice during a break in the summit. She held her first face-to-face meeting with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, during which they discussed reinforcing security cooperation, as well as international affairs, including China-related issues. On Sunday, Takaichi held talks with German Chancellor Friedrich Merz and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. “The prime minister is quickly strengthening her connections with many other leaders,” said Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Masanao Ozaki, who accompanied Takaichi on the trip.

Sekiwake Aonishiki said he cannot find any words to describe his feelings after winning the Kyushu Grand Sumo Tournament on Sunday at Fukuoka Kokusai Center, a victory that most likely ensures him promotion to the second-highest rank of ozeki. Judo and other combat sports are popular in Ukraine, and sumo also is well known in the country partly because the father of legendary yokozuna Taiho is from Ukraine. Yavhusishyn reached a turning point in February 2022, when Russia began its aggression against Ukraine. He came to Japan in April 2022 and stayed with Yamanaka, then captain of Kansai University's sumo club. Yavhusishyn trained as a practice member of the club. He then joined the Ajigawa stable through an introduction from Yamanaka's high school mentor. He chose the name Arata because of his friendship with Yamanaka. Thanks to his dedication to training and a strong lower body built up through wrestling, which he had practiced alongside sumo since childhood, Aonishiki has never had a losing record since his professional debut. He climbed the banzuke rankings with double-digit wins in five consecutive tournaments after making his debut. “Having come from a foreign land, he has been working so hard to understand the culture of sumo,” said stablemaster Ajigawa, former sekiwake Aminishiki. Aonishiki reportedly said he was glad to have come this far and that he chose the right path in life. Yamanaka, who is now a coach for Kansai University's sumo club, watched the playoff on television at his home. “For me, it also was the happiest day of my life,” Yamanaka said. “Even before entering the stable, I believed he would become a wrestler who would thrill the world of sumo. “He grabbed the glory with his own efforts.” Kansai University Alumni & Alumnae Association Chair Yoshinobu Tanaka, 74, said: “I imagine he sometimes feels it is difficult, but he never shows it. He is humble, dedicated to sumo and even accepts defeat with grace.” Our weekly ePaper presents the most noteworthy recent topics in an exciting, readable fomat.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A 21-year-old Ukrainian sumo wrestler who fled the Russian invasion has won an elite-level sumo competition in Japan, where he's been lauded for his rapid rise in the hyper-competitive sport. Yavhusishyn Danylo, known by his ring name Aonishiki, emerged victorious from the November Grand Sumo Tournament on Sunday, according to national broadcaster NHK. In the deciding match, he defeated Mongolia-born Hoshoryu, a top-ranked wrestler. “It's a feeling that words can't express,” Aonishiki said after his win, according to NHK. I've been diligently doing what my master told me, and it led to this result.” His win caps a meteoric rise within the sport, dictated by ritual and tradition, in the three years since the 21-year-old arrived in Japan as war ravaged his home country. He had started with wrestling and judo as a child in Ukraine, where martial arts have long been popular; the country boasts a long list of Olympic medal-winning wrestlers. At seven years old, he switched to sumo after seeing sumo athletes training at his judo facility, according to CNN affiliate Asahi Shimbun. He quickly demonstrated a talent for the sport, placing third at the junior world sumo championships in Japan at just 15 years old – which is where he befriended Japanese sumo wrestler Arata Yamanaka. Then, that all shuddered to a halt in 2022 when Russia invaded Ukraine. “I thought it would be a shame to end my sports career there,” Aonishiki told NHK in a documentary about his journey that aired in July. Soon, he became fluent in Japanese and climbed the ranks at record speed – defeating his fellow university wrestlers despite not being the largest or heaviest (at only 140 kilograms, or 308 pounds – lower than average for top-division sumo wrestlers). He eventually joined the Tokyo-based Ajigawa stable to live, train and compete professionally. By Sunday's tournament, he had reached the third-highest rank of Sekiwake after competing in just 13 tournaments, a record pace in a sport where rankings often fluctuate, and wrestlers can be promoted or demoted depending on their competition performance. But the Ukrainian wrestler wants to go one better. “There's one more rank above this, so I want to aim for that,” he said, with his eyes firmly on the top title of Yokozuna.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A UK patrol ship has intercepted a Russian corvette and a tanker after shadowing them through the English Channel, the Defense Ministry said Sunday, adding that Russian naval activity around UK waters had increased by 30% over the past two years. With the past two weeks, the patrol ship HMS Severn intercepted the Russian corvette RFN Stoikiy and tanker Yelnya as they sailed through the English Channel, the ministry said. The Severn eventually handed over monitoring duties to an unidentified NATO ally off the coast of Brittany. In addition to the ships stationed around the UK coast, Britain has deployed three Poseidon surveillance aircraft to Iceland as part of a NATO mission patrolling for Russian ships and submarines in the North Atlantic and Arctic, the ministry said. The news comes just days after Defense Secretary John Healey told reporters that the Russian spy ship Yantar had aimed lasers at the pilots of surveillance aircraft monitoring its activities off the coast of Scotland. Britain described the Yantar's actions as “reckless and dangerous,” adding that Britain was ready to respond to any incursions into its territory. The Russian Embassy in London responded to Healey's comments by accusing the British government of “whipping up militaristic hysteria,” adding that Moscow has no interest in undermining the UK's security. Healey issued the warning as he made the case for increased defense spending a week before the government releases its new budget. Even though Prime Minister Keir Starmer has pledged big military spending increases in light of threats from Russia, China and Iran, the government is facing tough tradeoffs as it eyes tax increases and spending cuts to close a multi-billion-pound shortfall in its finances.
