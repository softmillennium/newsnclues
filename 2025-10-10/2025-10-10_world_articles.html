                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Following Russia's overnight large-scale attack on Ukraine's energy infrastructure, President Volodymyr Zelensky accused Russia on Oct. 10 of deliberately delaying strikes on Ukrainian energy infrastructure in an effort to maximize damage, while attempting to minimize the political implications of the attacks. "I believe that the weather conditions affected our capability to repel by something like 20-30%," Zelensky told reporters during a press briefing following the attack, Reuters reported. Zelensky's comments follow a large-scale attack on Ukrainian energy infrastructure overnight on Oct. 9-10, in which Russia used 465 drones as well as 32 cruise and ballistic missiles to target Ukrainian cities. Weather conditions overnight were favorable for Russia's attempt to evade air defenses, with low visibility reported in Kyiv and the country's eastern regions. In his evening address, Zelensky further lambasted Russia for staging the attack amid an international focus on the ongoing peace deal between Hamas and Israel. Most of the world's states, all key leaders, have focused their attention on what is happening there. And this is a really good chance to achieve real peace after so many victims in that region," Zelensky said. "And this is a new record of Russian meanness - to intensify terrorist attacks at such a moment, to strike precisely at the lives of our people," he added. Millions of Ukrainian suffered through power and water outages amid the attack on various cities. Bloomberg reported on Oct. 9, citing undisclosed sources, that Russian strikes on energy infrastructure have destroyed more than half of Ukraine's natural gas production capacity ahead of winter. Zelensky further revealed that a Ukrainian delegation is set to visit Washington next week to negotiate the purchase of additional air defense systems as well as HIMARS rocket systems as the country continues to cope with attacks on energy infrastructure. Dmytro Basmat is a senior news editor for The Kyiv Independent. "I believe that the weather conditions affected our capability to repel by something like 20-30%," Zelensky told reporters during a press briefing following the attack, Reuters reported. A Ukrainian delegation is set to visit Washington next week to negotiate the purchase of additional air defense systems as well as HIMARS rocket systems as part of a "Mega Deal," President Volodymyr Zelensky said during a press briefing on Oct. 10. Speaking at the White House briefing, Melania Trump said Putin responded to her earlier letter and that "both sides have participated in several back-channel meetings and calls, all in good faith." President Volodymyr Zelensky met with Dutch Defense Minister Ruben Brekelmans to finalize the agreement, describing drone production as "one of the most promising areas of our bilateral cooperation." Among the seven nations increasing their purchases, France saw a 40% jump, importing 2.2 billion euros ($2.5 billion), while the Netherlands' imports surged 72% to 498 million euros ($579 million). This month marks one year of the Kyiv Independent's Explaining Ukraine weekly newsletter on Ukrainian history, literature, and culture, written by culture reporter Kate Tsurkan. We remain committed to the basis of that discussion and have changed nothing for ourselves," Russian President Vladimir Putin said. Igor Kartavykh, editor-in-chief of Sputnik Azerbaijan, was moved from police detention to house arrest in Baku, according to Dmitry Kiselyov, who oversees Sputnik's parent organization.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>‘Nothing left' of munitions plant in Tennessee after deadly explosion that was felt 10 miles away Up to 19 people are missing, feared dead after an explosion that destroyed a munitions factory in Tennessee. The plant near Bucksnort, about 60 miles west of Nashville, caught fire and exploded on Friday. In a tearful press conference, Chris Davis, the Humphreys County sheriff, said: “This is the most devastating incident I have been on in my career. “I can tell you right now that we're looking for 19 individuals. Reluctant to say how many had died, Mr Davis told reporters there was a possibility that at least some of the missing could be injured. Asked if anything of the factory remained, he said: “There is nothing to describe, it's gone.” After the initial explosion at the Accurate Energetic Systems factory, which was felt more than 10 miles away, flames set off secondary blasts, delaying attempts to rescue any survivors. It also produces explosive charges used to control avalanches. It currently holds contracts worth $140m with the US government. A safety document written for regulators said the site, which covers 1,300 acres, contains large amounts of TNT. Sheriff Davis said: “We do have several people at this time unaccounted for. We are trying to be mindful of families and that situation. We're going to probably be here for a few days. We're prioritising people that are involved, their families, and trying to be very compassionate toward them.” Video from the scene showed flames and heavy smoke rising from a debris field, and residents miles away reported feeling the blast. A Hickman County emergency services spokesman said it is not yet known if any rescue workers were hurt in the secondary explosion. Brad Rachford, the mayor of nearby McEwen, where Accurate Energetic Systems' headquarters is based, said: “This is a tragedy for our community.” Drone footage from the scene showed at least one building had been almost completely obliterated, with rubble strewn across a huge stretch of ground. Burnt and smashed up cars, some still neatly parked, can be seen in the car park. He said: “I thought the house had collapsed with me inside of it.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Marimar Martinez, 30, was charged with impeding a federal officer with a deadly weapon in fracas preceding shooting Prosecutors allege Marimar Martinez, 30, rammed the vehicle of federal agents with her own before they shot her, which they say was an act of self-defense. Martinez's lawyer, Christopher Parente, said footage from one of the agent's body-worn cameras contradicted that account, and Martinez will plead not guilty at an arraignment scheduled in the coming days. According to Parente, that camera footage captured one of the officers saying, “Do something, bitch,” before opening fire. The footage has not been made public. Another person, 21-year-old Anthony Ian Santos Ruiz, was also indicted on Thursday in the same case. Federal agents allege that Martinez was involved in a vehicle chase before ramming a CBP vehicle. Authorities claim that a government vehicle carrying three CBP agents was followed and boxed in by a “convoy of civilian vehicles”, including cars driven by Martinez and Santos. The shooting occurred as immigration agents, at the behest of the second Trump administration, have been scouring Chicago – Illinois's largest city – for people to deport. The ramped-up immigration enforcement in Chicago has been met with protests.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Thousands of Palestinians began the long, dusty walk from the south of Gaza toward Gaza City after a ceasefire came into effect in the enclave on Friday. They found their city lying in ruins – yet were relieved to be returning home. Aerial footage shows vast stretches of land with nothing but ruins. Yet for many of those making the trek on Friday, there is no question about returning. “I pray that God relieves our sorrow and distress and that people return to their homes. Even if the houses are destroyed, we will return, God willing,” said Ahmad Abu Watfa. For many residents of northern Gaza, Friday marked the second time they tried to return home. While Israel forced most residents of northern Gaza to leave the area early in the war, it briefly allowed people to return to some parts during the last ceasefire in January. But that homecoming was short lived for most, as Israel once again ordered a complete evacuation of Gaza City in early September, ahead of a ground invasion into the city. That number represented about 90% of Gaza City's pre-war population, although it was not possible to verify that estimate. The situation in Gaza City was critical even before that ground offensive, with no fully functioning hospitals and few places to shelter. On Friday, medical teams from the Al Rantisi hospital in Gaza City returned to the facility to find it completely destroyed. Gaza's deputy minister of health, Dr Yousef Abu Al Rish, shared a video from the scene with CNN that showed ruins and burned and destroyed medical equipment. The Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC), a United Nations-backed initiative, said that famine took hold of Gaza City in August and has since spread to the rest of the strip. Footage from the city shows many multistory buildings completely flattened and others ripped apart by blasts. The whole area appears to be covered in grey dust, with mostly no other color visible. He said that it was impossible to identify some of the bodies, which is why they were sent to the hospital where forensic teams could examine them. Majdi Fuad Mohammad Al-Khour was standing amid the rubble of what used to be his house in Tal el Hawa when he spoke to CNN. His house was destroyed and nearly everything he ever owned is gone. “Forty years of work to build this home,” he said. My wife is also sick and cannot see with her eyes.” The Israeli military said on Friday that a ceasefire was now in effect in Gaza, with forces pulling back in accordance with the plan that was approved by the Israeli government. Nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners and detainees in Israel will also be freed as part of the agreement. Israel says ceasefire in effect as troops withdraw from parts of Gaza Sair Hikmat Subh from Beit Lahiya, a town just north of Gaza City said he was “tired and fed up” but hoping to return home soon. Subh spoke to CNN as he was dismantling and packing up his tent near Al-Rashid Street ahead of his trip north. “We are happy that the roadblock has been removed. Praise be to God for everyone's safety. Of course I am happy!” he told CNN. However, he said that experience taught him to be cautious. I have been displaced nearly 20 times,” he said. Subh was likely correct to be cautious. The IDF spokesperson said on Friday that Israeli troops would still be present in various areas of Gaza, including Beit Hanoun, Beit Lahia and Shuja'iyya, and warned people to avoid them. CNN's Abeer Salman and Eyad Kourdi contributed reporting.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Overworked and understaffed, over 45,000 health care workers at Kaiser Permanente are poised to strike. Overworked and understaffed, over 45,000 health care workers at Kaiser Permanente are poised to strike. Please support our boldly independent journalism with a donation of any size. In what has become an extended set of pitched battles with Kaiser management, the OFNHP has set out to address some of the most severe crises in nursing and health care — at Kaiser and elsewhere. Pressure from the rank-and-file to confront chronic understaffing, stagnating pay rates, and a loss of control over their schedules and work arrangements has driven the union to place these demands at the forefront in their return to contract bargaining this year. But their struggle is not a lonely one, and it's far from confined to Kaiser's Northwest branch. The OFNHP is one of the 23 unions that together make up the Alliance of Health Care Unions (AHU), a labor federation that comprises over 60,000 Kaiser workers across California, Hawaii, Oregon, Washington, Maryland, Colorado, Georgia, and Washington, D.C. A significant portion of the Alliance membership is bargaining as a single unit, simultaneously negotiating for better wages and conditions at national and local levels. Strike action has been authorized, and the countdown has begun: If management does not return to the table by October 14, Kaiser Permanente will witness an enormous nationwide walkout of more than 40,000 employees. It's telling that this year has seen a groundswell of nurses' strikes and other health care actions — a symptom of the widespread, deeply rooted and ever-worsening issues facing U.S. hospital staff, both at Kaiser and in countless medical facilities across the nation. But the structural issues remained unresolved, and wage gains that were won four years ago have been diluted by inflation. Kaiser has a largely unionized workforce, represented by the AHU as well as overlapping memberships like the Coalition of Kaiser Permanente Unions. Initially implemented as a compromise to avoid a strike in the late 1990s, the Kaiser conglomerate's unique partnership provides notable concessions to labor, codifying organizing rights and benefits and securing unions a seat at the bargaining table. The central compromise on the part of labor is that, by alleviating these pressures, worker militancy and possible strike action is averted, neutralized before it can take root. In theory, this works to the benefit of all involved. Broadly, this arrangement is still in place — but sources say that the process has become decidedly less cooperative. Her unit members have not yet seen their own particular contract expire and are therefore ineligible to join this strike. (One of their tertiary demands is to remedy this contract-timing misalignment so that all contracts are signed simultaneously.) Still, Rowe and her unit are actively involved in negotiations to settle terms for their renewal next year. Speaking to Truthout, Rowe emphatically shared that Kaiser technicians are proud to stand in solidarity with the strikers in their local counterpart bargaining units and with the multi-state AHU as a whole. Bargaining units are subdivisions of union membership: in the OFNHP, they include groups for workers with advanced degrees (the “Pro” unit), nurses at various tiers, Rowe's fellow technical staff, registered dental hygienists, and several others. Rowe explained how chronic staffing shortages wreak havoc on the complex operations of a hospital. “It's all intertwined.… When the nurses can't step in and cover as much, then that puts more pressure on lab techs, who are dealing with staffing shortages themselves. Neoma Palmer is a physical therapist with a sports-clinic specialty who has been employed at Kaiser for 12 years, largely in outpatient physical therapy. On a call with Truthout, Palmer explained that, “There's short staffing everywhere, and it's just been getting worse. We're seeing, ever since the end of June, that management started to not replace open positions.” Palmer said that as many as “hundreds of jobs” might remain unfilled. This is also the case for the increasing workloads and stagnant wages that tend to disincline new job seekers, to say nothing of top talent. A large AHU survey of the workforce found that a full 95 percent of respondents felt “Kaiser's staffing crisis is affecting patient care and access,” while over 90 percent worked in short-staffed departments. When you have to be 400 percent more productive … it's just not possible.” Management has backed away from what was once a more collaborative process. A new inflexible practice of top-down scheduling, said Rowe, doesn't “allow for adequate charting, adequate break time, being able to leave when you're supposed to be off work. As has been the case for so many other units in AHU locals, Palmer and her colleagues have arrived at unnavigable impasse: Management has seemingly decided to advance no further towards compromise. “But in reality, I don't think we've been working well together for at least the last five to 10 years. Part of that is because we have different management now, and they don't buy into the partnership as much.” Onetime opportunities for staff input and joint problem-solving, she says, have dried up — replaced by “a more of a traditional top-down approach” from newer managers. A likely motivator for this newly uncooperative, profit-focused management is the perverse incentives introduced to health care entities by financialization, especially after the intrusion of private equity firms — as has been apparent time and again at modern institutions like universities and hospitals (Kaiser among them). Many venerable institutions, handwaving away the lofty and noble aims of their founding charters, have moved to prioritize profit, often by leveraging their assets to reap returns for investors. But the intrusion of profit mechanisms reliably distorts institutional motives. Financialization of this type seems to inevitably compromise the original service — for instance, teaching medical students, or treating patients. The consequences of a profit-focused orientation for hospital patients can range from inconvenience to death — as credible research has shown, finding clear causal links between private equity acquisition of hospitals and the actual fatality rates in emergency rooms. “More and more, the managers and directors that are coming in are bean counters that have no experience in health care.” (It's also both alarming and revealing that Kaiser has proven ready to retaliate against those who blow the whistle on internal understaffing and patient safety concerns.) Many have also been dismayed to see Kaiser's reputation and metrics dwindle. “We know our access and staffing is really bad,” Palmer said, “because it's incredibly difficult to get just basic appointments.” Indeed, earlier this year, Kaiser was issued a $4 million fine from California's Department of Managed Health Care for its failure to address recurrent major mental health care delays — which had become so bad that they were actually illegal. Extended wait times are rampant, even in critical treatment areas. As Palmer said with chagrin, “Your cancer screening appointments are only available three, four months past the time when you're due” to have them. Needless to say, delays of this kind will also inevitably cost patients their lives. “The Alliance's campaign uses strong language, pickets, and strike threats to rally support,” they told Truthout in a statement. “They say their goal is to protect patients by ensuring better care and staffing, but the real issue is wages… Their claims about Kaiser Permanente's quality and staffing don't reflect the facts.” “Your cancer screening appointments are only available three, four months past the time when you're due.” “One of our main goals in bargaining was to be paid fairly, and to be paid for all hours worked,” Palmer said. (She described how at Kaiser, it's the norm to consistently get in early, stay late, and/or take on extra work, often multiple hours per week. This is done to keep up with workloads and licensing, but also very often out of a desire to provide patients with more attentive care.) On wage increases, she says, “We had lots of different ideas … and management had no interest in continuing to bargain with us on that topic.” Asked if she felt that Kaiser was abusing the knowledge that its employees would devote extra unpaid hours to make up shortfalls, Palmer replied without hesitation: “100 percent.” Management's current counteroffer grants 6.5-percent upticks for two years, and reaches 20 percent over four. As if to ensure that their reluctance at the bargaining table feels maximally galling, Kaiser Permanente has continued to grant CEO Gregory Adams millions of dollars in compensation per year, leading to his reliable appearance among the top three highest-paid chief nonprofit executives in the nation. Nevertheless, Kaiser negotiators have not budged an inch on wages. Ultimately, despite the painstaking negotiations, Palmer felt that “nothing has been touched when it comes to those really large issues about workloads, templates, and being paid for all hours worked, as well as the local wage increases … At national there has really been no movement as well,” she said. I feel like in 2021, Kaiser was still coming to the table and offering different things. In a statement, Kaiser wrote: “Taking the current economic environment into consideration, our across-the-board 4-year wage increases would normally have averaged 14 percent in total, to be consistent with estimated annual wage inflation. While it is true that management does regularly act to ease staffing shortages by recruiting extra help, they do so by bringing on travel nurses — akin to temps, or maybe gig workers or freelancers. They're paid fairly well, and Kaiser outlays considerable funds to make use of them. One possibility is that travel nurses, if not cheap, are less empowered and more expendable. “I think that they see hiring more union workers as too difficult to deal with,” she said, “whereas they see hiring travelers or externalizing us as a really easy fix, instead of having to deal with bargaining in good faith with us.” As a one-time travel nurse herself, Litts made it clear that criticizing this state of affairs does not imply any personal antipathy toward other individual nurses, travel or otherwise. Some research has found a correlation with their use and poorer patient outcomes. “I think the daily frustrations that have built up … there's a boiling point.” Litts herself expressed uncertainty that management is careless enough to place profit over patient welfare. Still, whatever the good intentions of individual administrators — and there are surely many — it appears evident that impersonal, structural pressures are acting upon all involved, with or without their willing complicity. As she told Truthout, “I think the daily frustrations that have built up … there's a boiling point. As Trump cracks down on political speech, independent media is increasingly necessary.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Smoke fills the air as debris covers the ground and vehicles after a powerful blast ripped through a military explosives manufacturing plant in Hickman County, Tenn., on Friday.The Associated Press A blast that leveled an explosives plant Friday in rural Tennessee left 19 people missing and feared dead, authorities said. People reported hearing and feeling the explosion from miles away. The company's website says it processes explosives and ammunition at an eight-building facility that sprawls across wooded hills in the Bucksnort area, about 60 miles (97 kilometres) southwest of Nashville. Emergency crews were initially unable to enter the plant because of continuing detonations, Hickman County Advanced EMT David Stewart said by phone. By Friday afternoon, there was no further danger of explosions, and the scene was under control, according to Grey Collier, a spokesperson for the Humphreys County Emergency Management Agency. Accurate Energetic Systems, based in nearby McEwen, did not immediately respond to a phone message seeking comment Friday morning. Accurate Energetic Systems has been awarded numerous military contracts, largely by the U.S. Army and Navy, to supply different types of munitions and explosives, according to public records. The products ranged from bulk explosives to landmines and small breaching charges, including C4. The blast rattled Gentry Stover from his sleep. “I thought the house had collapsed with me inside of it,” he said by phone. “It sounded like something going through the roof of our house.” The U.S. has a long history of deadly incident at workplaces, including the Monongah coal mine explosion that killed 362 men and boys in West Virginia in 1907. In 2019, Accurate Energetic Systems faced several small fines from the U.S. Department of Labor for violations of policies meant to protect workers from exposure to hazardous chemicals, radiation and other irritants, according to citations from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration.

Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba explicitly affirmed his commitment to the historical understanding of World War II expressed by successive cabinets, including Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's statement marking the 70th anniversary of the war's end. In his statement marking the 80th anniversary, he noted, “Past statements by former prime ministers have not sufficiently addressed the question of why that war could not be avoided,” and called for reflection on the problems within the domestic political system at the time. He expressed his view that “there was no mechanism to appropriately integrate politics and the military, and the military went out of control in the name of ensuring the independence of its supreme command.” While saying that there are institutional measures now in place to prevent these problems, Ishiba emphasized that “irresponsible populism” and “narrow-minded nationalism” must be never allowed, in order that the political system continues to be operated as it should be. “We must always be humble before history and inscribe the lessons from it on our heart,” he said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The magazine has featured contributions from many leading international affairs experts. Maximilian K. Bremer is a retired U.S. Air Force Colonel, a Nonresident Fellow with the Reimagining U.S. Grand Strategy Program at the Stimson Center, and Head of Mission Engineering and Strategy at Atropos Group. Kelly A. Grieco is a Senior Fellow in the Reimagining U.S. Grand Strategy Program at the Stimson Center and Adjunct Professor of Security Studies at Georgetown University. More than 80 years after Allied troops stormed the beaches of Normandy, D-Day is frequently referred to in discussions of potential conflict in the Taiwan Strait. Western observers often cite that historic event to highlight the formidable challenge that China's military would face in launching an amphibious assault on Taiwan. Chinese analysts and military planners also study the Normandy landing campaign closely, looking for insights into logistics for their air and sea forces. But the United States should learn another lesson from D-Day: how to keep U.S. forces supplied under fire without relying on fixed infrastructure. What made this feat possible were cheap gliders that delivered troops and cargo too heavy for parachutes, and artificial harbors that kept the beachhead supplied. As China depleted its missile arsenal attacking disposable logistics tools, U.S. and allied forces could turn to more permanent infrastructure to deliver supplies by air and sea. Beijing understands this well: authoritative texts about military strategy published by the People's Liberation Army identify logistics as a vulnerability that China can exploit to paralyze an adversary's forces. This approach combines speed and staying power, ensuring that the United States can repel initial Chinese aggression and prevail in a longer war. The D-Day invasion succeeded because Allied planners reimagined logistics at scale while under fire. When German antiaircraft fire intensified, the Allies simply sent more gliders and airborne troops. Prefabricated in England and assembled under fire off the beaches of Normandy, each Mulberry was engineered to handle 5,000 tons of cargo and 1,400 vehicles daily. Within two weeks of D-Day, more than one million Allied troops were ashore in France. But were it not for gliders and Mulberries, the Allies would never have gotten ashore. As U.S. General Dwight Eisenhower, the supreme Allied commander during the operation, said of these temporary logistical measures, “Without them our armies could not have been adequately maintained in the field.” It was a phased approach—fast and improvisational at first; steady and deliberate later. A recent Stimson Center analysis found that, in the opening phase of a potential conflict, Chinese missiles could render U.S. bases and airfields in Japan and Guam inoperable for days or weeks, grounding cargo aircraft essential for resupply. And time is exactly what China needs to take control of Taiwan. The U.S. military has responded to this challenge by shifting away from maintaining large regional bases and toward stationing forces across numerous smaller, often remote locations. This approach, which is called distributed operations, maximizes U.S. forces' ability to withstand precision strikes. But it also significantly increases the complexity of logistical coordination, creating new possibilities for failure. Consider the Marine Corps' new stand-in force concept, which involves deploying small, mobile units that carry minimal supplies and require frequent resupply. As General David Berger, then commandant of the Marine Corps, acknowledged in May 2022, sustaining stand-in forces requires “logistics capabilities designed for distributed operations over long distances in a contested environment”—that is, more aircraft, more ships, more support personnel, and better planning to maintain vulnerable supply lines. Today, conventional methods are insufficient to protect the United States against Chinese weapons. Large cargo aircraft and container ships—the backbone of traditional military logistics—become prime targets in contested environments. A 2022 wargame highlighted this dilemma, noting that it was unclear how the military would execute joint logistics across widely dispersed U.S. forces in the Indo-Pacific theater. Like the gliders and Mulberry harbors that initially sustained Allied forces in Normandy, today's autonomous logistics systems can bridge initial operations and protracted conflict. Reinvented gliders, now built from stronger materials such as carbon fiber reinforced polymers, incorporate autonomous navigation systems that can avoid obstacles, select landing zones, and deliver supplies to remote or contested locations. At roughly $40,000 each, these are inexpensive enough to be disposable. But today's aircraft can do so with a level of precision and reliability that was not possible in 1944. Autonomous cargo aircraft and ships can also reshape temporary logistics. Last year, for example, the air force successfully tested modified Cessna 208B Caravans, common single-engine turboprop planes, which used automated takeoff and landing systems to deliver supplies to eight remote locations spread across 1,150 miles. The same idea applies to larger, autonomous drones capable of moving oversize loads long distances. These aircraft could play the role that Mulberries did in Normandy, facilitating temporary supply lines where none previously existed. Similarly, autonomous surface vessels, such as uncrewed boats, could deliver one or two standard shipping containers of fuel, food, and ammunition to scattered forces with no need for a large port. Across the many islands of the Indo-Pacific, a large fleet of these autonomous vessels could provide near-continuous resupply while larger cargo vessels remained at a safe distance from Chinese attacks. Traditional military cargo ships, in contrast, are unsuited for these missions because they are too few in number, vulnerable to attack, and dependent on ports. If China opts not to engage, the resupply mission succeeds. As with flying waves of gliders through intense antiaircraft fire, adopting these tactics requires accepting that there will be attrition as China shoots down some drones. But these losses are necessary to impose costs on Chinese defenses. None of these expendable logistics systems could or should permanently replace traditional supply methods. As those weapons are exhausted, the conflict will return to the type of warfare that can use traditional logistics methods, including large cargo ships, aircraft, and fixed infrastructure. But to reach that point, the United States will first need disposable logistics as a stopgap, buying time in the initial stages when conventional networks are under attack and secure supply lines have yet to be established. Like Mulberry harbors and D-Day gliders, these systems prioritize immediate effectiveness over long-term efficiency. The United States should ensure that expendable systems are readily available in meaningful quantities. To ensure the viability of its aging logistics fleet in the Indo-Pacific, Washington should pursue development and production of scalable, expendable capabilities in partnership with key regional allies such as Australia and Japan. Neither the United States nor its allies can afford to stockpile large quantities of expendable systems that sit idle in peacetime, especially since the technology for autonomy, swarming, and propulsion evolves rapidly. Several U.S. firms are already developing small cargo drones designed to conduct resupply missions across the Indo-Pacific, which could be used in the initial fight. The United States needs to clear regulatory and policy obstacles that hinder commercial adoption of these systems in the air and at sea. China, by contrast, has already normalized drone delivery and established dedicated corridors for commercial operations, including for large cargo drones capable of delivering at scale. U.S. policymakers must accept that investing in deliberately temporary systems is essential, not wasteful. During the critical first weeks of any major Pacific conflict, container ships will not be able to dock at ports within range of China's weapons, and large aircraft will not be able to land at contested bases. Instead, the U.S. military will need to deploy autonomous drones and expendable systems. The war in Ukraine, in which units on both sides have used drones to deliver ammunition to frontline units, demonstrates the value of such approaches. Expendable and autonomous logistics systems would strengthen U.S. deterrence by overcoming what we call the “four tyrannies”—time, distance, water, and scale—that threaten American power projection in the Indo-Pacific. By targeting the few islands suitable for large-scale logistics operations, China can slow any U.S. response. But by demonstrating the ability to sustain dispersed forces under missile attack with expendable gliders, cargo drones, and swarming logistics, the United States can undermine China's confidence in its A2/AD capabilities. Deterrence depends on not just the number of bombers, submarines, and destroyers but also the ability to keep forces supplied—even when conventional logistics breaks down.

SEOUL, October 10. /TASS/. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has announced his intention to build a "prosperous socialist paradise" in the country, the Korean Central News Agency reported.

On October 9, he delivered a speech at a special gathering in honor of the 80th anniversary of the Workers' Party of Korea's establishment. "With faith in the people who support our party and in unity with them, I will make this country even more prosperous and beautiful and build the most wonderful socialist paradise in the world," Kim Jong Un said.

According to him, life in North Korea can significantly improve and that the set goals can be achieved if the North Korean people continue to work hard.

The Russian delegation at the anniversary celebrations is headed by Russian Security Council Deputy Chairman and United Russia party Chairman Dmitry Medvedev.</p>
