She's referring to their marriage, which, more than 20 years in and with two small children between them, has run its course. Their split spurs Alex's unconventional midlife crisis, one without fancy muscle cars or a hot young babe on the arm. Related Stories Martin Scorsese Calls on Streamers to Champion More Iranian Cinema, as Jafar Panahi Vows to Keep Working in His Home Country ‘After the Hunt' Writer Nora Garrett Unpacks That Ending — and How Luca Guadagnino Pushed for Essential Changes That crisis is the foundation of Bradley Cooper's blandly reassuring, at times tedious and tunnel-visioned new directorial effort “Is This Thing On?” That midlife crisis also involves a hairpin career pivot, and no, I'm not talking about Cooper's move into directing, starting with 2018's Oscar-winning “A Star Is Born,” then the handsomely staged, Oscar-bait Leonard Bernstein biopic “Maestro” two years ago. That pivot is in Alex's sudden move toward becoming an amateur stand-up comic, using the stage and the microphone as therapy platforms for his anguish. He doesn't register much on the emotional Richter scale.) For a film about comedy as part of its elevator pitch, “Is This Thing On?” is curiously unfunny, with Cooper preferring to linger on the film's melancholy, “Marriage Story”-lite core as Alex and Tess eventually, through a bit of movie magic in the shape of a screenplay, find their way back to each other. A couple of decades ago, the English comedian John Bishop (who gets a “story by” credit here, along with Cooper's co-writers Will Arnett and Mark Chappell) was working as a pharmaceutical rep, his marriage imploding, when he tried open-mic standup to avoid paying the establishment's entry fee. And now look at him: Since then, he's created multiple BBC One series. Perhaps also like this film's director, both John and the fictional character of Alex found what they discovered to be their truer calling later in life. Alex and Tessa's friend group, meanwhile, is one of mixed ambitions. There's Christine (Andra Day) and her seemingly permanently stoned-to-the-gills actor husband Balls (Cooper himself, and, yes, this is unfortunately the character's name), who are staring down the barrel of their own empty nest and a marriage that's pushing up against its expiration date. Alex says, “I've been doing standup.” Balls goes, “Is that her handle?” There are takes that drag on and on (such as one of Dern biting into a weed cookie, and we are meant to wonder if perhaps the camera crew were slowed to molasses by an edible as well) and could have used more editorial discipline from editor Charlie Greene. “Is This Thing On?” very much has a “let's let the cameras roll and catch lightning in a bottle!” feel, with Cooper falling perhaps a little bit too in love with the performances to rein in his naturalistic impulses. But “Is This Thing On?” feels like it doesn't really get going until hour two — and those long takes can feel like gaping maws of silence that leave you begging for music or a score to be inserted so as to at least point you in the direction of feeling something. The first scene in which you start to feel like, ah, yes, there is some spark underneath the hood here involves Alex scrambling to get his kids a sitter— he ultimately leans on his parents, played by Christine Ebersole and Ciarán Hinds, and their seemingly dysfunction-free marriage a little too much amid the separation — so that he can take another standup gig. All of this really happened to John Bishop, who ended up on reconciliation's way with his wife after she saw his own soul-bared open-mic performance. So, too, do Alex and Tess start to find their way back to teach other, starting up what I suppose you'd call an affair, as they're keeping the relationship a secret from their kids and their friends while Alex continues to live in a bachelor pad, with Tess in their upstate home while dreaming of becoming a volleyball coach as a way back into her old sport. What makes “Is This Thing On?” work when it does is the chemistry exchange happening between Arnett and Dern, who are adept at going at it one minute and then making out the next. Though often lethargic and listless, “Is This Thing On?” does stir up a vivid portrait of the New York City underground comedy milieu, even when New York City as a character feels more like the afterthought it isn't supposed to be. Cooper casts actual comedians in roles, from Amy Sedaris as the club's peppy emcee to a dry-as-a-bone Jordan Jensen as Alex's first sexual partner post-divorce. But his commitment to naturalism and immersion takes a chunk out of your soul after what feels like a very long 124 minutes; it could've used more spring in its step. “Is This Thing On?” premiered at the New York Film Festival.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>rom creating the Guardians of the Galaxy franchise's mixtapes to making the obscure Iggy Pop/Teddybears nugget “Punkrocker” one of the songs of the summer via Superman, DC Studios co-CEO James Gunn has an impeccable record when it comes to mixing music with superhero universes. Peacemaker‘s just-concluded second season, with its killer Foxy Shazam theme song (“Oh Lord”) and its finale performances by both Foxy and the long-haired rock band Nelson (playing the very deep cut “To Get Back to You”), was no exception. Gunn jumped on a Zoom with Rolling Stone to talk about the season's music and some broader DCU topics. (Some spoilers ahead — and to see what Matthew Nelson had to say about his band's appearance, check out our new interview with him and Gunn.) How did it happen?I picked the song first. As you know, when I'm putting together songs for Peacemaker, I'm working from a massive list — at this point it's a couple thousand songs that I think are Peacemaker-like songs. When I write a scene that utilizes a piece of music, sometimes I'm sort of inspired by the music to write the scenes, but a lot of times I'm like, “This is a good place for a piece of music. But the whole album is a pretty great example of melodic rock. You're about to change the course of that song's life.Yeah, for sure. You had that one in your pocket already?No. It was one of my favorite Foxy Shazam songs. And I'm a really, truly an enormous fan of the band. But I listened to a lot of different songs to try to figure it out, and I really didn't know what I was gonna do. Was I gonna use something else? And it really had the effect that I thought it would, which is at first everybody was complaining about, “Oh, I like the old song better. I like the old intro better.” And now, as we go into the eighth episode, the most common comment I get on threads is, “Wow, I didn't like it as much at first, but now I like it even more.” And it is such an emotional song. It really works in this scene as well. The 100 Best TV Episodes of All Time In the same way there was always this concept that, you know, “Do You Wanna Taste It” has various different meanings, but it ends up being kind of about the blood in Harcourt's mouth at the end of episode eight. And this song would be about the gathering together of these damaged souls in [new team] Checkmate. I became friends with Eric Nally, the singer of Foxy Shazam. And I was like, you know what, we're gonna be shooting Nelson anyway. What if we had just a couple shots of them and the reveal of them at this concert? Are you thinking about ways to use songs in cool ways in other upcoming DCU projects? Or are you leaving that to the individual creators?It's a mix. There's sometimes some hackneyed use of music and I really don't like it. I really don't need to hear “Ballroom Blitz” in another movie for as long as I live. Love the band, but don't need to hear “Ballroom Blitz” in a movie ever again. So when something like that comes up, and it comes up pretty often in these different projects and they're like, “Oh, James will like this because it's Seventies music.” . and James Gunn Explain That ‘Peacemaker' Musical Moment Only 1,000 of These Timex x DC Studios' Superman Watches Are Up for Grabs Terence Stamp, 'Superman' and 'The Limey' Actor, Dead at 87 I've become a sleaze-metal guy because of Peacemaker, which is a journey that started before this actually. All day long I've been listening to my 2025 list, which is a lot of [Canadian punk band] Pup and [Irish punk band] Sprints and then also a lot of other modern alternative, a lot of hip-hop. There's this guy named Russell — that's an amazing hip-hop artist. There's a lot of cool stuff out. In the upcoming stuff — the Supergirl movie and the HBO Max show Lanterns — are you thinking that way about songs?There's songs in both of those things. But I don't give a shit if there's songs in something or not. There's just the one song that is strangely probably the biggest sort of hit song I've had out of a show that wasn't Wig Wam. You know, maybe “Come and Get Your Love” from the first Guardians. Regarding the vicious twist at the end of Peacemaker from what seemed to be a happy ending — first of all, what's wrong with you?Listen, this journey's not done. Should people expect that thread to be enormous going forward?Yeah. Since you said you're setting up the semisequel to Superman, Man of Tomorrow, should people expect John Cena's fate, Peacemaker's fate, to be addressed in that movie?No, no, no. But people should expect that the way that the military and Rick Flagg and everybody are working together and they've created a probably illegal prison for metahumans on another dimension is gonna be a part of DCU stories going forward. There's an escalating war, obviously, that's going on between the government and metahumans. And this is a part of it. So, to be clear, you've made a key part of the DCU going forward about a government official abusing their power by having masked thugs come in the middle of the night and expel innocent people  from the planet.[Grins.] This is, like, something that can never happen on our planet, but that's the beauty of things like comic books — you can explore things that would never, ever happen on our world. We knew both of those stories were a part of what we originally put together, so they're part of the overall tapestry, but they're also their own thing. There's just a longer, sort of a bigger world we're building with all these different pieces and they do all come together and intersect sometimes in a story fashion and sometimes just in a, you know, “here's another piece of the world” fashion. Lanterns is really important in setting up things. People are wondering, by the way, if James Mangold's just-announced deal means that the Swamp Thing  movie he was planning for you is dead.No, no, it doesn't.

Or are we just left to wonder how this is going to carry forward?We'll find out as time goes on. That planet he's on doesn't sound so uninhabited. There's a comic series called Salvation Run.

Although “A House of Dynamite” star Idris Elba did say at the Netflix release's Venice Film Festival press conference that he “does not have the courage to be in politics,” he certainly does not shy away from playing heads of state on film. Over a decade after his Golden Globe-nominated performance as Nelson Mandela, former President of South Africa, in “Long Walk to Freedom,” the British actor has played both the British Prime Minister in “Heads of State,” and the President of the United States in the new political thriller from Best Director Oscar-winner Kathryn Bigelow. Speaking to IndieWire over Zoom, Elba said that while he is still not interested in being a politician, “I'm not shy of perhaps bringing my voice to something, bringing my soapbox in some way and articulating what I'd like to see happening.” But in accepting the presidential role in “A House of Dynamite,” he was not driven by some pain point he wanted to address, as much as he was excited to work with the people behind the film.

'”Below, Elba shares what it was like to not only play a President who must react to a nuclear missile headed for the United States but also what it was like to watch the movie as an audience member, without prior access to the full scope of the film, which also features strong performances from a star-studded cast that includes Rebecca Ferguson and Tracy Letts. The following interview has been condensed for length and clarity. IndieWire: Earlier this year, we saw you play the British Prime Minister in “Heads of State,” and now you play the President of the United States in “A House of Dynamite.” When and how did you become the go-to guy to play a world leader? Idris Elba: When Morgan Freeman said, “I ain't doing that no more.” That's a better answer than anything I could have thought. I found it very funny playing the Prime Minister and knowing that I am about to play the President. I was thinking about [how] the films are going to be in a similar cycle. So I was like, “OK, people are going to ask me about this. I'm not running for politics or anything like that. If you're following Morgan Freeman, the next step is deities. As far as how this film relates to more of your past work, I was wondering if you were attracted to “A House of Dynamite” as a story giving audiences a peek behind a power structure, similar to how “The Wire” informed audiences about the goings-on of different institutions. Are you particularly intrigued by scripts about how these systems and processes work? There's always a curiosity when I'm playing characters, especially characters that have a complexity to them. The complexities are really interesting to me. John Luther is a detective who is pretty much a crook at the same time. Is there a skill set that I get out of it?” I've learned to do all kinds of crazy things, from sword-fighting to driving cars really fast by way of these different characters. Was there at all a message in this project that you were attracted to? Not in the beginning, if I'm really honest. When I got to understand what the film was about and who my character is, I definitely latched onto the idea that [when] we elect a leader, I wonder, do we think long and hard enough about what and who we're electing, and what will happen if we put our lives in that person's hands? I suppose playing the character as a human being as opposed to a POTUS, big, strong guy, [who's] got to make all the decisions… Just someone that actually is a human being, wants to talk to his wife, doesn't have the answers, isn't afraid to ask, his shoe's a little tight, his coffee's a little cold. Playing that human side hopefully reminds the audience that, actually, when we do decide who's our leader, just remember they're human. And this is what it looks like when they have to make a very complex decision on all of our behalfs. Would you say there's any sort of partisanship applied to your character? And I don't know, as an audience member, what did you think? Did you think that he was there on one side or the other? There's things you can read into, but it does not fully imply he's this war hawk. But shifting gears, do you know if you were one of the first actors cast in this film? I remember Kathryn talking about wanting to know who her president would be, and that might help her put together some of the other pieces. I know that she said to me quite frankly that she didn't want to speak to any other actors about it, just wanted me, and to that I was like, “Wow, no pressure. Did you have any say in your cabinet? Because if you're someone coming in early, are you able to then say, “Well, I think this person would be good for this role.” Or anything along those lines? Again, I didn't have any exposure to who was going to be in the movie, and by the time I got to shoot that segment of the film, they had already shot everything else. But needless to say, it's Kathryn and her taste for amazing actors to pick the characters that she creates is good. Outside of Jonah Hauer-King and Brian Tee, who were around you physically? Did you actually get to work with this whole cast? Or were you acting opposite someone reading lines as, say, Tracy Letts? No, I was pretty isolated, apart from the characters that were in my story. And I got to listen to playback for the questions and, honestly, I was lucky that I got Tracy Letts's performance as my driving material. They had me [do] a telephone run of my lines before I even shot it, which was a bit like, “Oh, I don't even know what I'm going to do.” But I just trusted the script, and they used that in their side of the coverage. In terms of your character's First Lady, who is away in Kenya, had you ever met Renée Elise Goldsberry? Because that's such an emotional moment in the film, but it sounds like that might've also been playback. Yeah, actually, that was the one casting opportunity that Kathryn sort of asked [for] my opinion, and we were really lucky to get Renée, she was amazing. She came to set, but she shot all of her stuff in Kenya, but we were lucky to speak to each other and just look each other in the eye and have a quick connection, I guess. Hearing you talk about the basketball game, that wasn't all lined up in the script? Yeah, it very much felt like a documentary. She didn't want to know what I was going to say or what I was going to do, and of course, the lines that were written, I say those lines, but if I decided to take off my shoe and say, “Hey, what's going on with the shoe?” That was completely improvised. When I meet the girls on the basketball court and I'm telling them a story, I just made one up, and then I had to remember what I made up because we did it a couple of times, and I actually really felt quite liberated by that because it just meant that I was really in the character, in the moment. There's cameras everywhere, and you don't know where they all are, so there's no point acting, just being is what it is and being reactive. And there were scenes, there were some lines where Jonah and I were in the middle [of talking], and one of them made it into the scene; where he's talking and I stop him and I say, “How old are you, son?” And Jonah was so great, he  just made it up. “Hell, this isn't written down, what is this?” And it really just helped the realism aspect of it. Speaking of how real things got, did you actually have a close look at what you say is a diner menu of nuclear options that this president has to review? Would an actual POTUS see that to a T? We wouldn't know if it was to the T, but [we] very much designed on what we understood to be fact, the choices the POTUS has in that box all the time. And it is a menu of counterstrikes, thinking in an emergency. And many choices of what to do [were] mind-blowing for me. So you're taking a look at it for the first time in the scene, not quite beforehand? Now that you've seen the whole film, what is it like watching it and dealing with its entertainment factor versus its realism? I watched the film as an audience member because I didn't know much about the first two acts. I didn't know who was cast. So when I watched the movie, I was like anyone who watched it for the first time, and even my segment was like, “Oh my. It blew my mind.” I sat there [for] probably about three or four, five minutes just in silence afterwards. Some of the experience is a bit of frustration with your character until we actually see what's going on with him. From my character's perspective, “You're telling me I need to get on the phone, the phone is not working. I was in the middle of something. And then you watch the movie, “Is it a basketball game? Why is his phone not working?” But there you go, again, that's probably very close to how it would go down. I believe you've directed or are going to direct a couple upcoming features, “Above the Below” and “Infernus,” since working on “A House of Dynamite.” Did you have any takeaways on that front from working with Kathryn Bigelow? I've learned a lot working with Kathryn. “A House of Dynamite,” a Netflix release, is now in select theaters on Friday, October 10.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The most vexing obstacle for David Ellison and Paramount‘s expected offer to acquire Warner Bros. Discovery looks to be David Zaslav – though probably not for long. As of now, Zaslav is moving ahead with a somewhat-still-fuzzy plan unveiled this past summer to split WBD in half by next spring to free the studio and streaming of several billion in debt and freefalling cable assets. At the same time, word on the Burbank streets is that Netflix or Amazon could be looking to add some DC or GoT to their balance sheets, alternatives promoted by the WBD CEO. “He's always gauging the possibilities and getting the best value, and that is what I think he is doing here. Whether it works or not, who can say right now?” Zaslav has reportedly engaged Goldman Sachs to gauge buyer interest and is valuing the company's studios and streaming units at more than $30 per share, a premium to the $22 to $24 range floated by Ellison's camp. One thing, studio and Century City sources tell Deadline, is that the long and winding road to a regulatory green light from the Trump administration to close Skydance-Paramount last August established a template for further deals. The well-connected Ellison regime, whose patriarch has been a longtime Trump donor and White House visitor, anticipates it could seal a deal with the feds for the whole WBD enchilada in less than six months Stateside and within nine months in Europe and the UK – money music to shareholders' ears. Zaslav recently said the division of WBD into Warner Bros. and Discovery Global would happen by April 2026. Looming beyond the planned split date is a June 2026 annual shareholder meeting that could be rough if the split isn't accomplished or rescheduled by then. “I think if you just look at David Zaslav's performance, he's pretty much failed shareholders every step of the way, right?” an insider exclaims. “Servicing debt and bad decisions eroded billions and billions in market cap since Discovery basically took over Warner Bros. three years ago.” Says one East Coast banker with deep Hollywood ties who is wary of the upside of a WBD split: “My perspective is, they break up the company and they figure out how to get some more equity into it. Even then, their performance will lead to a bad balance sheet over time again.” “Amazon got stung by buying MGM with little to show for it, and the FTC just made them pay up a $2.5 billion civil penalty,” one studio (not Paramount) source says. “Buying Warner Bros any time soon doesn't fit with their M.O.” Amazon did not respond to Deadline's request for comment on a possible WBD purchase or interest. Contacted by Deadline, Netflix shut down speculation by referring to co-CEO Peters' blunt remarks on the subject earlier this week: “We come from a deep heritage of being builders rather than buyers,” Peters said Wednesday at the Bloomberg Screentime conference in Los Angeles. “One should have a reasonable amount of skepticism around big media mergers. They don't have an amazing track record over time.” It seems that unless a presently unidentified proxy investor group or K-pop billionaire jumps in at the eleventh hour, the Melrose lot-based Ellison is the only one openly(ish) looking at buying Burbank's debt-laden WBD one way or another. “When you have the kind of performance that Zaslav has had, he doesn't have a lot of options,” the moneyman adds. Number two: there are not a lot of companies that want to buy declining assets. Number three: shareholders, therefore, will be much more focused on certainty than on some fiction of fake buyers and corporate splits.” The separation would follow years of retooling during the three-plus rocky years since WarnerMedia and Discovery closed their $43 billion merger. That was a much smaller company buying a much bigger one, resulting in about $50 billion in debt and handing operational control of the new entity to Zaslav despite Discovery's minority stake in the merged company. Shareholders are generally bullish on the split plan, but they may like a hefty cash buyout better. How much a pre-split Warner Bros Discovery is really worth is a question under debate among the town's openly cash-infused player Paramount and its almost certain acquisition target. While specifics are fluid, Paramount and Ellison have landed on $60 million as a ballpark valuation, while WBD and Zaslav, unsurprisingly, have a higher number in mind. Even with a pre-pandemic box office level of $4 billion this year so far for the Michael De Luca- and Pam Abdy-led movie studio, Zaslav and CFO Gunnar Widenfels have had to pare and pare to pay down debt. In quarter after quarter, many missing targets, Zaslav and Weidenfels expressed surprise at just how bad things were at Warners once they got a good look under the hood; they said that hadn't really been possible until the deal formally closed in April 2022. WBD took a series of big write-downs for content, a huge one for cable, lost the NBA, created chaos at the viewer-bleeding CNN and flip-flopped over the DTC branding of HBO and Max. Yes, even with the fact that WBD no longer offers forward-looking guidance in earnings reports, the company outlook is better, in relative terms – and hoping for a further lift if one becomes two. Lifted from Comcast's playbook, the idea of the split – aside from whether it ever actually happens – provided a long-sought tonic for WBD stock, which had skidded below $8 a share earlier this year. The studio also helped Apple's F1 take the checkered flag in a distribution deal and launched gusty auteur gamble One Battle After Another, which has awards heat even with an iffy profit outlook. Debt, which haunted the old WarnerMedia when it was owned by AT&T, continues to hamper investment in WBD. A “restructuring in June took about $3 billion off their debt, but they also have a $17 billion bridge loan, which is syndicated across Wall Street banks, which had not yet been refinanced,” a well-placed finance chief told us of the math and risk.

The one thing that could massively change this equation is how quickly the streaming platforms start integrating AI tools (and charging a bit more for the AI creator tier) so customers start becoming content makers. When that happens, having popular IP will be a big draw. AI could give the legacy studios with big franchises a way to finally battle Netflix effectively. The one thing that could kick the legs out from under them is another tech disruption, such as AI could provide, and then only if they're not savvy and jump on the wave in time. At one point I would have been all for anyone taking WB away from Zaslav, and Skydance/Paramount would have been ideal, but after some of their recent dubious actions a Paramount+WB merger is looking less desireable. There will never be just one service with “everything” and if there was, they'd charge $100/month when it's much cheaper to churn around and you end up getting “everything” that way. Even with ad-free tiers, that's well under $20/month so that's the best deal, you can do it now, so do it and stop complaining. Even if there was an “everything” service, somebody would come along and launch a new one, make content for it, price it cheaper, and undercut the “everything” service. There's an equilibrium point that is a combo of the prices and consumer desires to have more than one service at a time. Or just HBO Max and the others die off. It would be 4 except Tim Cook wants to play Hollywood mogul and keeps Apple going irrationally. We use vendors that may also process your information to help provide our services.

That said, the album already has more than 3.4 million in pure album sales (physical and digital purchases), marking the largest sales week for any album since Luminate began electronically tracking music data in 1991, when the modern era of weekly music tabulation began. Previously, the modern-era record for single-week sales of an album was held by the opening frame of Adele's 25, with 3.378 million copies sold in its first week in November 2015. The Life of a Showgirl was released on Friday, Oct. 3. The Life of a Showgirl's official first-week numbers (equivalent album units, total traditional album sales and streaming figures) reflecting the tracking week of Oct. 3-9, are expected to be announced by Billboard on Sunday, Oct. 12, along with its assumed large debut on the multimetric Billboard 200 albums chart (dated Oct. 18). Luminate's streaming, sales and airplay data powers Billboard's charts. All numbers cited in this story are for the U.S. only. Life of a Showgirl's first-week sales were fueled by 34 different versions of The Life of a Showgirl — 27 physical iterations (18 CDs, eight vinyl LPs and one cassette) and seven download variants (not counting clean and explicit editions for wide digital retail). They were issued one a day, starting Monday, through Thursday, and all are adaptations of the four limited-edition CDs that Swift released in her webstore over the weekend. Those limited-edition CDs that were previously locked to Swift's webstore were later made available during the week to independent record shops.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Prime Video has canceled a pair of first-year series, Butterfly and Countdown. The Amazon MGM Studios series had summer debuts and each spent a short time on Nielsen's top 10 U.S. streaming charts, but neither will return for a second run. The cancellation of Butterfly, starring Daniel Dae Kim, comes about two months after it premiered as a binge release. Aldis Hodge Is Back on the Hunt in Season 2 'Cross' Teaser Countdown, from Chicago Fire co-creator Derek Haas, stars Ackles as an LAPD detective who's brought into a task force involving several agencies that's working against time to stop a potentially devastating conspiracy. Jessica Camacho, Eric Dane, Violett Beane, Uli Latukefu and Elliot Knight also star. Like Butterfly, Countdown had a two-week run on the Nielsen streaming charts shortly after its premiere. It didn't keep up that momentum as the season continued, however.

Aside from having the last two Knives Out movies, Netflix was also in business with Rian Johnson and Ram Bergman's T-Street after acquiring its erotic noir Fair Play out of Sundance 2023. Cover Story: Kathryn Bigelow And Her Cast On Why 'A House Of Dynamite' Should Disarm The World Netflix's Eleonora 'Tinny' Andreatta On "Telling Local Stories Away From The Stereotypes" During Streamer's First Decade In Italy Gordon-Levitt has been passionately outspoken about AI, and wrote the script with Kieran Fitzgerald. Both are producers on the pic and share “story by” credit with Natasha Lyonne. Fitzgerald wrote the 2016 Oliver Stone movie Snowden in which Gordon-Levitt starred. Next for McAdams is the upcoming Sam Raimi-directed genre movie Send Help at 20th Century Studios. Her cinematic canon includes star-making turns in Mean Girls, The Notebook, About Time, Disobedience, Game Night, Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret, and on stage in Mary Jane. The actress is repped by Magnolia Entertainment, WME and attorney Howard Fishman. Bergman produced Gordon-Levitt's 2013 feature directorial debut Don Jon, with Johnson also giving feedback on the script and reviewing multiple cuts of the film.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Let's start by establishing, for the sake of argument, that Super Mario Galaxy and its direct sequel are good video games. At the bare minimum, interesting ones: Not just their basic “Mario in space” premise, which allowed Nintendo's hero to do some really wild gravity-related stuff with his standard repertoire of jumps. There is a palpable idea behind each of the planets Mario drives his bizarre Mario's-head-shaped spaceship to in that game, whether he's drilling down through spheres to pop out on the other side, or using a limited supply of puffy clouds to ascend up into the literal stratosphere. Or using motion controls to fire blasts of “star bits” at giant monsters. Or using motion controls for basic functionality, like his all-important spin jump, or controlling his freshly released buddy Yoshi's irritating-as-hell-to-control prehensile tongue. Because the thing I kept thinking about, as I played the new Switch and Switch 2 releases of these (genuinely good!) To be fair, the Switch 2 is a better fit for old Wii software than a lot of consoles would be; the system's various technological toys do a pretty good job of simulating the Wii's motion controls, using gyroscopes and a touchscreen to fill in for the Wiimote's point-and-shake schtick. And yet, as I tilted my Joy-Con 2 fitfully to navigate my way through the canyons and bluffs of Galaxy 2‘s Wild Glide Galaxy, I started getting serious flashbacks to a whole generation of gaming where we all decided, collectively, to kiss off the classic controller. Nobody's going to stand here and tell you that the first time you played tennis or bowling in Wii Sports wasn't a magical moment, a true example of “Oh, grandma can do this!” gaming. I have two motion controllers charging in my house right now, queued up for an evening session of Beat Saber. Hell, I have fond memories of sticking a Wiimote to my nose because the dopey narration in WarioWare: Smooth Moves told me it was time to do “The Elephant.” But revisiting the Mario Galaxy games has also been a reminder of how pervasive, bordering on insidious, this stuff got, as designers tried to reinvent the wheel, and instead got a wheel that falls over a lot, while being about half as fun to play with. Movement and motion are vital elements of the human experience, but Mario Galaxy‘s version of it feels borderline cynical—like a team of very solid developers made a great 3D Mario game, and then got told they had to shoehorn in motion controls because, fuck, it's a Wii game, right? These control schemes have evolved, over 63 years of digital gaming, because people figured out pretty early on that cranking knobs on an oscilloscope is a pretty shitty way to control a virtual avatar. There's nothing wrong with exploring alternate control schemes—I was excited to see the mouse-based Mario & Wario make its way to the Switch's online nostalgia catalogue this week, and I'm the guy who will never shut up about how stylus-based Kirby game Canvas Curse actually kicked ass. (It helps, again, that so much work has clearly gone into the Super Mario Galaxy games that makes them genuinely important to Mario‘s evolution into games like Super Mario Odyssey or Bowser's Fury.) I've been having a blast with Galaxy 2 specifically, even if I want to slap that stupid “run as fast as you can” pepper out of Yoshi's gob every time I manage to get his tongue to fitfully connect with it. But sometimes revisiting video gaming's history means we're not just celebrating what was great about the past: We're also touring cul-de-sacs of design ideas that have now, quite rightly, been labeled as weird and dangerous dead ends.

Throughout the two-decade run of the venerable ABC medical drama, creator Shonda Rhimes and her showrunning successors have become infamous for killing off doctors in the most devastating ways — so much so that the hospital was once nicknamed “Seattle Grace Mercy Death” before being renamed after two dearly departed characters, Chyler Leigh's Lexie Grey and Eric Dane's Mark Sloan, in season nine. 'Grey's Anatomy' Boss Explains Painful Season 22 Premiere Casualty: "I Cried on That Phone Call" Jessica Capshaw Moves on From 'Grey's Anatomy' With '9-1-1: Nashville' In Thursday night's season 22 premiere, which picks up in the immediate aftermath of yet another big explosion that wiped out most of the OR floor, the teaching hospital claimed another casualty: Morales' Dr. Monica Beltran, who died of internal bleeding after the blast caused a heavy operating light to fall on her pelvis. Dr. Beltran had recurred for the last two seasons as a top attending pediatric surgeon who had endeared herself to Drs. Amelia Shepherd (Caterina Scorsone) and Winston Ndugu (Anthony Hill), but her exit was built around her protégée, Dr. Jules Millin (Adelaide Kane), who, after surviving the blast herself and being trapped in the OR, managed to successfully complete a pediatric surgery on her own with Dr. Beltran's verbal assistance. When she sat down with the rest of her writers room to decide which character should die in the premiere, showrunner Meg Marinis told The Hollywood Reporter that she considered “the chain reaction” of “each character's death and what that does for the show, what that does for other characters and what stories can be told from that death.” In the end, “I wanted to see someone die selflessly saving someone else's life, and she was not only saving that little kid on the table — she was saving Jules. It really speaks to the kind of character Monica was,” Marinis says. Below, Morales opens up to THR about how she worked with Marinis to craft her poignant (but admittedly, expected) Grey's exit, how she thinks Monica's death will affect Jules and Amelia going forward, and what she would say to fans who will inevitably be disappointed that Monica met her demise before she could explore the prospect of a romantic relationship with Amelia. At what point between seasons did Meg Marinis call you up to inform you that she was going to kill off Beltran in the premiere, and what was your reaction? At the end of last season, none of us knew who was going to make it or not. But I was like, “It's probably me [who dies]. There's a lot of people in that cast.” Then they called me and asked me to be in this season and to do this episode. I wasn't too surprised, but I was surprised and also excited to have a big, dramatic Grey's death. I have really enjoyed working with the people on this show, so it's a little bit sad in that sense. Could they have dragged out my death two or three episodes? It made sense to me, as somebody who watches the show. Meg said that once she broke that difficult news to you, the two of you went through all of Monica's scenes leading up to her death and you were able to give her feedback that she incorporated into the episode. Throughout my time on the show, I didn't really give her a lot of notes, because she is just great. It was more like, “Hey, what do you think about this? Or, how do you want me to play this? I knew with this episode that they wanted to do a misdirect with this death [by making audiences believe it was Chris Carmack's Link who was going to die]. I was like, “What's the best way for us to achieve that while also on second watch knowing what's happening and that Monica knows what's happening, what should her final words be?” Not that they needed to be so poignant that they give away what's going to happen, but maybe not something like, “Can you give me a hot dog?” (Laughs.) And this was already in there, but we talked about how to acknowledge the relationship that her and Jules had built over time and where it was going to go after this. There's something poignant about Monica's final words being that Jules didn't need her anymore, because she had effectively completed a solo surgery on her own. When do you think Monica realized she wasn't going to make it? We talked about this with the incredible medical team at Grey's. There's a point in the middle of this episode where she tries again to push this operating light off of herself, and what's happened medically, as far as I was told, is that she's pinned down by this and the second she moves, it shifts stuff, and then she starts bleeding internally and she starts to feel that because she knows what the symptoms are. So after that point is when she knows what's happening. I need her to finish the surgery.” She's just trying to keep it together as much as she can, and hopefully someone will rescue her. But if they don't, she's going to try and save that little boy's life until her dying breath, and Jules is as well. I haven't seen the episode, so I don't know exactly how it will play, and I hope it plays this way: The important thing, for me, was in those last moments for her to acknowledge the other people she loves in that hospital. The fact that she doesn't know what happened outside those doors, and that she hopes the people she loves — Amelia, Winston, all these people she became very close with outside of this operating room — she hopes they're all OK. That was important because I think Monica is a character written from the beginning very selflessly. How do you think Monica's death will affect Amelia and Jules individually going forward? I hope that they talk about Monica for seasons to come. Unfortunately, Monica's death will likely reignite talks of the infamous “bury your gays” trope, and some viewers who had been rooting for Monica to get together with Amelia will certainly be upset about this outcome. What would you say to fans who will be left heartbroken about your character's untimely demise? My second message is, “I'm not the writer. I don't have anything to do with it, so don't blame me.” And my third message is that it's totally valid for people to ship characters and want things. But in life, sometimes people have missed connections. I think the bigger takeaway is that life is short, and you gotta take those moments because someone you love — or potentially could love — could die, or not be around, or could have another thing. I think maybe Amelia or Monica should have taken one of those opportunities, but I also think it's realistic they didn't because they were in different points in their lives and different situations. But if there's a lesson in that, I think it's to shoot your shot, and don't waste the opportunities you're given. I don't know what the intentions were behind how that was framed, and I don't know, obviously in Amelia's history, what is right for her and what's right for her in the future. This wasn't meant for her in a romantic sense. Monica was also just getting out of a divorce. No matter what Amelia was ready for, I don't think Monica was in the place for something serious, which is maybe what Amelia wanted. Even though you only recurred on the show for two seasons, what will you miss most about playing Monica? Let's say you were in two and a bit. That was really fun, to be a very well-respected doctor/surgeon that people would be like, “Have you heard about [Beltran]? She's the best pediatric surgeon in the West.” And I'd just stroll in and people would respect me! But, really, I will miss the crew and cast and people I got to work with there a lot. I will miss that a lot, and I hope the fans don't take it out on me. It's a very big fandom, and I try really hard not to ever read the comments. Did you get a chance to take home anything from the set to commemorate your time on Grey's? And Monica, who did my makeup — her name is also Monica — gave me some of the makeup she used on me. But I should have kept a stethoscope or something. I'm calling it out right now on The Hollywood Reporter that ABC and Grey's and Shondaland should give me a stethoscope or something to commemorate.

As the pop star walked past a group of fans, one of them forcefully grabbed her and yanked her towards the crowd. A post shared by BILLIE EILISH (@biilleeiilsh) Eilish appeared to be stunned, but okay as she was helped by security. Another showed their support by writing, “I love you, Billie Eilish.” Another video showed the incident from a higher angle. A post shared by Daily Hourly (@dailyhourly) Back in September 2013 during a stop on her Mrs. Carter Show World Tour in Brazil, Beyoncé was grabbed by a fan while performing “Irreplaceable.” The megastar almost fell into the crowd after the audience member wrapped her into a hug, but she stayed incredibly calm and asked security not to intervene. A few moments later, Beyoncé shook the fan's hand and asked him his name. Back in 2019, Eilish spoke to MTV Australia about her fame, saying, “This is weird. I feel like this is a simulation.” She went on to address her fans, saying, “I don't want you to feel like, ‘Oh my god, I'm never gonna get to meet her.' Eilish then joked, “I don't mean come to my hotel, or or follow me around the airport. I just mean, I can go like this and you can grab me,” while reaching out her hand.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“That's the problem when you talk about John,” says Bill Murray in the opening of John Candy: I Like Me, “people don't really have a lot of negative things to say about him.” One of the worst pop cultural feelings is reading a biography, watching a behind-the-scenes special, or scrolling a Wikipedia entry and learning something terrible about someone or something you've idolized. So, not to worry: John Candy: I Like Me doesn't contain anything even remotely troubling about the Canadian comedy legend. In fact, it doesn't contain much at all aside from praise. Candy's relatives, childhood pals, and famous comedy coworkers line up to glowingly reminisce about the actor, who died at just 43 years old in 1994. To go back to that Murray line, he follows it by telegraphing an anecdote that might reflect something mildly negative about Candy. Director Colin Hanks, whose dad Tom was in Splash with Candy, begins his film in a Catholic church at Candy's funeral, with the literal worship songs preceding the metaphorical ones. This set-up is appropriate: Aside from a basic biography and the kinds of personal details so broad as to be perfectly impersonal (His family home was filled with food and laughter? Sure, it's mentioned that Candy's own father died young, and that his older brother had a heart attack in one of his dressing rooms, but this looming hereditary threat is skirted over just like the miniature histories of Second City, SCTV, and a stacked Toronto production of Godspell (which got its own documentary that premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival just two days after I Like Me). To be fair, it was almost always brought up in an insulting way, as was documented to even greater effect in the Luther Vandross doc Luther: Never Too Much, but this movie handles the topic off-handedly, brushing it away without much consideration to its effect on the psyche or the physique. Despite including plenty of home video footage and a clip show of Candy's comedy career, from his early “Yellowbelly” sketch to Stripes to Uncle Buck and of course Planes, Trains and Automobiles, I Like Me sticks to the surface. Tyler Strickland's shamelessly swelling score and Hanks' simplistic structuring mean that surface also has a slick sheen, moving frictionlessly from birth to fame to death. But telling that story would entail a lot more legwork than Hanks thumbing through his Rolodex and asking for a few minutes of time to wax nostalgic about Candy. Because John Candy: I Like Me positions itself as a feature-length eulogy, opening at the actor's funeral and closing with his funeral procession, its merits as a documentary seem secondary to Hanks' intentions. Anyone would be lucky to be remembered this way; most of us will merely get loving slideshows and a few choked-up speeches rather than 120 minutes of Amazon-hosted hagiography. For those who remember Candy through his work, which is most people, his performances offer far more connection, and far more nuance, than this memorial.
