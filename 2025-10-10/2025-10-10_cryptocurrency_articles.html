                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>October got off to a hot start, but the historically strong month for Bitcoin and crypto prices—called "Uptober" by many investors—hit a roadblock Friday thanks to President Trump's trade war. And now prices are falling fast as liquidations pile up. More than $1 billion worth of crypto positions have been liquidated over the last 24 hours, per data from CoinGlass, as crypto prices plunge alongside stocks following Trump's Friday morning declaration that "massive" tariffs against China are in the works. With those declines, Bitcoin has nearly erased all of its October gains, returning to a price last seen on October 1, while Ethereum and Solana both hit October lows on Friday per data from CoinGecko. October has historically been a particularly strong month for Bitcoin's price—a longstanding pattern that has led much of the crypto industry to expect the same results come every fall. The trend at first seemed poised to continue this year; the first week of this month, BTC surged some 10.5% to a new all-time high price north of $126,000. Polymarket Token Is Coming, But Likely Not This Year: Sources But this week, those gains started to fall off. And on Friday, they were nearly entirely erased after President Trump announced he was calling off a planned meeting with Chinese president Xi Jinping, ordering a “massive increase” of tariffs on Chinese goods entering the United States, in a move even he conceded could be “potentially painful” for Americans.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Friday brought carnage onto crypto markets as U.S.-China trade tensions ratcheted up with Trump threatening a massive increase in tariffs against Chinese goods. Worst-hit among the crypto benchmark CoinDesk 20 Index constituents was Ethereum's native token ether ETH$4,005.03, nosediving 7% from Friday's session high and hitting its weakest price since late September below $4,100. The broad-market downturn spurred a liquidation cascade across crypto derivatives markets, wiping out over $600 million of leveraged trading positions among all assets, CoinGlass data shows. ETH also led in liquidations with over $235 million long positions wiped out through the session. Longs are leveraged bets seeking to profit from the asset's price rise. Behind the liquidation cascade was ETH's breakdown of critical support levels, CoinDesk Research's technical analysis model suggested.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>With a decade of work spanning robotics, cloud infrastructure, large-scale financial systems, and now cryptocurrency, engineer Brindal Patel knows firsthand what that means. That rapid change sparked his curiosity about how machines could learn, adapt, and ultimately make life easier. For his master's project, he developed a system he called “R-eye,” designed to give robots a form of vision through real-time objects and facial recognition. The project pushed beyond academic theory, relying on low-power computing and low-resolution cameras to prove that AI could run efficiently even in constrained environments. Patel has described R-eye as a step toward merging the physical and digital worlds — a way for machines to process their surroundings independently, without constant human input. The experience cemented his interest in robotics and how it could play a central role in shaping the future, giving him a drive to build technology that serves practical, human-centered goals. After earning his master's degree, Patel began his career at an early-stage startup as an embedded software engineer, drawn to the chance to work on a little bit of everything. “Since I joined the company at a very early stage,” he recalls, “I actually ended up working with hardware, web, app, product management — everything you can imagine in startup culture.” The experience taught him how products take shape in real-time, where decisions about technology and design have an immediate impact. It also helped him discover a passion for cloud technologies and backend systems, where complex infrastructure meets problem-solving at scale. There, he helped build large-scale cloud systems capable of processing 18 billion daily events, a technical challenge that tested everything he had learned about designing for scale and reliability. Twilio, he adds, was also home to some of the best technical and non-technical colleagues he had ever worked with, reinforcing his value of collaboration in solving complex problems. For his next stage, Patel joined Meta during the COVID-19 pandemic, moving to Silicon Valley and working on two high-impact engineering teams: Payouts and Instagram Channels. On the Payouts side, he was involved with expanding systems that had been in place for nearly a decade, critical infrastructure for a company of Meta's scale. One of the most significant upgrades was a system for ad-hoc payments, allowing Meta to send funds more quickly during crises such as natural disasters or sudden large-scale service outages. “Our goal with these projects was to ensure people received support quickly both during regular events and unique emergencies, without needing manual intervention,” Patel explains. By replacing manual processes with automated, rules-based systems, Patel and his team helped reduce the risk of costly errors or regulatory penalties while improving the consistency and timeliness of payment operations. Today, Patel works as a senior software engineer at Coinbase, where, just like in his time at Meta, he's leading efforts on high-impact initiatives, where his decisions shape systems relied upon by millions of users and regulatory bodies. These systems help manage critical processes such as investigating fraudulent activity, resolving account issues, verifying user identities, and preparing reports for regulatory inquiries, all to make sure that customer information is handled with care and appropriate safeguards. Patel notes that Coinbase operates in what he calls “still the early days” of crypto, an industry evolving quickly as companies build the infrastructure for a more open financial system. That technical challenge, Patel says, is what drew him to the role. He believes technology can do more than power financial systems or social networks; it can personalize medicine, improve industrial safety, and expand access to life-saving tools, and he wants to assist in driving those innovations forward. Whether he's helping startups grow or designing next-generation tools for crypto compliance at Coinbase, Brindal Patel's career reflects a belief that engineering at its best solves both practical problems and human ones.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Give me control of a nation's money supply, and I care not who makes its laws. Centuries earlier, Roman emperors had resorted to similar tricks with the denarius, steadily reducing its silver content until by the 3rd century AD, it contained little more than trace amounts, undermining its credibility and contributing to economic instability. In 11th-century China, the Song dynasty pioneered paper money, extending state control over taxation and trade. Such episodes underline a timeless truth: money is never neutral. It has always been an instrument of governance – whether to project authority, consolidate control or disguise fiscal weakness. Our editors work with academics from many different backgrounds who are tackling a wide range of societal and scientific challenges. Today, the same story is entering a new digital chapter. As Axel van Trotsenburg, senior managing director of the World Bank, wrote in 2024: “Embracing digitalisation is no longer a choice. It's a necessity.” By this he meant not simply switching to online banking, but making the currencies we use, and the mechanisms for regulating it, entirely digital. Just as rulers once clipped coins or over-printed notes, governments are now testing how far digital money can extend their reach – both within and beyond national boundaries. But Trump's hostility toward the Fed is well-documented, and noisy. During his second term, Trump has publicly berated the Fed's chair, Jerome Powell, calling him “a stubborn MORON” over his interest rate policies, and even floating the idea of replacing him. In March 2025, when Trump issued an executive order establishing a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, he signalled the opening of a new front in this institutional battle. By incorporating bitcoin into an official US reserve, the world's largest economy is, for the first time, sanctioning its use as part of state financial infrastructure. Such a step reframes bitcoin as more than an investment fad or criminal fallback; it is being drawn into the formal monetary system – in the US, at least. Bitcoin is, by a distance, the world's most valuable cryptocurrency (at the time of writing, one coin is worth just shy of US$120,000) having established a record high in August 2025. But now, thanks in particular to Trump's aggressively pro-crypto, anti-central bank approach, bitcoin's potential role as part of a new form of state-controlled digital currency is in the spotlight like never before. At the same time, his blurring of public authority and private financial interest, when it comes to cryptocurrencies, has raised some serious ethical and governance concerns. Read more: Trump's love affair with crypto raises worries about presidential conflict and influence It is a hybrid model: one where the issuance of money may become privatised while control of the US's financial reserve strategy – and associated political and economic narratives – remains firmly in state hands. According to a 2023 paper published by the Bank for International Settlements, a powerful if little-known organisation that coordinates central bank policy globally: “The decentralisation of monetary functions across public and private actors introduces a new era of contestable monetary sovereignty.” In plain English, this means money is no longer the sole domain of states. Tech firms, decentralised communities and even AI-powered platforms are now building alternative value systems that challenge the monopoly of national currencies. Calls to diminish the role of central banks in shaping macroeconomic outcomes are closely tied to the rise of what the University of Cambridge's Bennett School of Public Policy calls “crypto populism” – a movement that shifts legitimacy away from unelected technocrats towards “the people”, whether they are retail investors, cryptocurrency miners or politically aligned firms. Supporters of this agenda argue that central banks have too much unchecked power, from manipulating interest rates to bailing out financial elites, while ordinary savers bear the costs through inflation or higher borrowing charges. In the US, Trump and his advisers have become the most visible proponents, tying bitcoin and also so-called “stablecoins” (cryptocurrencies designed to maintain a stable value by being pegged to an external asset) to a broader populist narrative about wresting control from elites. The emergence of this dual monetary system is causing deep unease in traditional financial institutions. Some rival US nations also feel deep unease about its approach to money – in part because of what analysts call the “weaponisation of the dollar”. This describes how US financial dominance, via Swift and correspondent banking systems, has long enabled sanctions that effectively exclude targeted governments, companies or individuals from global finance. As the Atlantic put it in 2023, the US appeared to be “pushing away allies and adversaries alike by turning its currency into a geopolitical bludgeon”. Spurred on by these concerns and an increasing desire to delink from the dollar as the world's anchor currency, many countries are now moving towards creating their own central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) – government-issued digital currencies backed and regulated by state institutions. Having been trialled in multiple cities since 2019, the e-CNY now has millions of domestic users and, by mid-2024, had processed nearly US$1 trillion in retail transactions. A key part of Beijing's ambition is to use the digital yuan as a strategic hedge against dollar-based clearance systems, positioning it as part of a wider plan to reduce China's reliance on the US dollar in international trade. Likewise, the European Central Bank has framed its digital euro – which entered its preparation phase in October 2023 – as essential to future European monetary sovereignty, stating that it would reduce reliance on non-European (often US-controlled) digital payment providers such as Visa, Mastercard and PayPal. The experience of using a CBDC will be much like today's mobile banking apps: you'll receive your salary directly into a digital wallet, make instant payments in shops or online, and transfer money to friends in seconds. In many countries, CBDCs are being pitched as more efficient tools for economic inclusion and societal benefit. A 2023 Bank of England consultation paper emphasised that its proposal for a digital pound would be “privacy-respecting by design” and “non-programmable by the state”. However, some critics see CBDCs as Trojan horses for surveillance. In 2019, a report by the professional services network PWC suggested that CBDCs, if unchecked, could entrench executive power by removing intermediary financial institutions and enabling programmable, direct government control over citizen transactions. A 2024 CFA Institute paper warned that digital currencies could allow governments to trace, tax or block payments in real time – tools that authoritarian regimes might embrace. Imagine, for example, a parent transferring 20 digital pounds to their child's CBDC wallet, but with a rule that this money can only be spent on food, not video games. In technical terms, programmable payments such as this are straightforward for CBDCs. But such a system raises big questions about privacy and personal freedom. Some critics fear that programmable CBDCs might be used to restrict spending on disapproved categories such as alcohol and fuel, create expiry dates for unemployment benefits, or enforce climate targets through money flow limits. The BIS has warned that CBDCs should be “designed with safeguards” to preserve user privacy, financial inclusion and interoperability across borders. CBDC architecture choices, such as default privacy settings, tiered access or transaction expiry can all shape the extent of executive control embedded in the system. If designed without democratic oversight, these infrastructures risk institutional capture. Some CBDC pilots – including China's e-CNY, the Sand Dollar and the eNaira – have been criticised for omitting clear privacy guarantees, with their respective central banks deferring decisions on privacy protections to future legislation. It's not difficult to see that this level of government control is incompatible with both economic and political freedom. The concerns being raised about central bank digital currencies extend beyond personal payment controls. A recent analysis by Rand Corporation highlighted how law enforcement capabilities could dramatically increase with the introduction of CBDCs. While this could strengthen efforts to stop money laundering and the financing of terrorism, it also raises fears of “mission creep”, whereby the same tools could be used to police ordinary citizens' spending or political activities. Concerns about mission creep – the idea that a system introduced for limited goals (efficiency, anti-money laundering) gradually expands into broader tools of control – extend into other areas of digital authoritarianism. The Bennett School has cautioned that without legal and political safeguards, CBDCs risk empowering state surveillance and undermining democratic oversight, especially in an interconnected global system. It is not anti-technology or overly conspiratorial to ask hard questions about the design, governance and safeguards built into our future money. As has been highlighted by the OECD, democratic values like privacy, civic trust and rights protection must all be integral to CBDC design. Predictably, the public view of what we want our money to look like in future is mixed. The tensions we see between centralised CBDCs and decentralised alternatives reflect fundamentally different philosophies. In the US, populist rhetoric has found a strong base among cryptocurrency investors and libertarian movements. At the same time, surveys in Europe suggest many people remain sceptical of replacing a central bank's authority, associating it with stability and trustworthiness. In this context, Trump's push to elevate crypto into a US Strategic Bitcoin Reserve carries serious implications. While US officials generally avoid direct comment on partisan moves, their policy documents make the stakes clear: if crypto expands outside regulatory boundaries, this could undermine financial stability and weaken the very tools – from monetary policy to sanctions – that sustain the dollar's global dominance. Meanwhile, the Bank of England's governor, Andrew Bailey, writing in the Financial Times this week, sounded more accommodating of a financial future that includes stablecoins, suggesting: “It is possible, at least partially, to separate money from credit provision, with banks and stablecoins coexisting and non-banks carrying out more of the credit provision role.” He has previously stressed that stablecoins must “pass the test of singleness of money”, ensuring that one pound always equals one pound (something that cannot be guaranteed if a currency is backed by risky assets). A much more recent example is the collapse of TerraUSD (UST) in May 2022. In practice, it relied on algorithms and reserves that turned out to be fragile. In his most recent Mansion House speech, the Bank of England governor said he remains unconvinced of the need for a “Britcoin” CBDC, so long as improvements to bank payment systems (such as making bank transfers faster, cheaper and more user-friendly) prove effective. Ultimately, the form our money takes in future is not a question of technology so much as trust. In its latest guidance, the IMF underscores the necessity of earning public trust, not assuming it, by involving citizens, watchdog groups and independent experts in CBDC design, rather than allowing central banks or big tech to shape it unilaterally.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Coinbase and Mastercard are reportedly competing to acquire BVNK, a UK-based stablecoin company. Depending on which deal wins, Coinbase would reinforce its position in the stablecoin market. Both outcomes represent a significant step in bringing mainstream users into the crypto space. Thus, there may not be a better time to scoop up the best altcoins to buy ahead of the next season. Since going live in 2021, BVNK has been well-known for seamlessly integrating stablecoins into payments, cross-border transfers, and treasury operations. The firm hit its stride in December of last year, raising $50M in a Series B round that valued it at $750 million. Suppose Mastercard does get its way, it wouldn't be the first major bank to back BVNK. Visa's investment was likely strategic, considering it occurred just before President Trump signed the GENIUS Act in July. As a result, there's now an established federal framework for stablecoin issuers in the US, helping the market hit a sizable $309.5B market cap to date. US dollar-backed stablecoins lead the race – $USDT with a $177.9B market cap, followed by $USDC at $75.4B. But it's not only stablecoins that benefit from this renewed institutional adoption and regulatory clarity. It may potentially fuel the growth of altcoins, such as those with competitive edges, like Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER), INFINIT ($IN), and Snorter Token ($SNORT). It aims to achieve this by launching a Layer-2 (L2) network that'll leverage the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM). As a result of Bitcoin's limited ability to handle Transactions Per Second (TPS), users compete for block space. Not only does this slow down Bitcoin's transaction speeds, but it drives up the network's fees, which currently average $1.258 – roughly 46,500% higher than Solana's $0.0027. Unlocking Bitcoin's full potential, however, is a Canonical Bridge. $HYPER has already raised a whopping $23M in presales, offering exclusive benefits to token holders, including governance rights, lower gas fees, and staking rewards currently at a 51% APY. There's no better time to join the $HYPER presale; its price will increase tomorrow and is anticipated to break $0.32 this year. (Check out our Bitcoin Hyper price prediction for more information.) $IN is the native token of INFINIT, a vertical banking platform that's solely built for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). And it's succeeding at doing precisely that, as evidenced by it operating across 10+ countries, generating $200M+ in finance, and targeting 200K SMEs. The token unlocks advanced AI-agent strategies, fee discounts, premium tools, and higher usage limits. For instance, the token has increased by over 119% since yesterday, following news that INFINIT launched ‘Agentic DeFi' on the Plasma platform. It's available on some of the best crypto exchanges (including MEXC and Binance) for roughly $0.25. As the native token of the upcoming Telegram trading bot Snorter Bot, Snorter Token ($SNORT) is making waves on presale, having raised over $4.5M. The bot will first launch on Solana to leverage its fast speeds, automation, simplicity, and cost-friendly fees. Then, it'll branch out across Ethereum and other EVM-compatible chains so that you can expand your horizons beyond the best Solana meme coins. In doing so, you'll also be granted lower trading fees (0.85% vs. up to 2%), 110% APY staking rewards, and exclusive premium tools. One $SNORT currently costs only $0.1075, but don't wait to buy at this price. Once listed on top exchanges, our Snorter Token price prediction says it could break around $0.94 this year.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin, Ethereum Dive Alongside Stocks as Trump Threatens 'Massive' China Tariffs Crypto prices plunged alongside stock market indices early Friday after President Donald Trump threatened to ratchet up tariffs on China. But other leading cryptocurrencies saw sharper dips, with Ethereum and Solana both down almost 5% in the last hour alone, to prices of $4,107 and $211 respectively. Crypto market liquidations have skyrocketed amid the plunge, with CoinGlass showing $459 million worth of liquidations in the last hour alone—the vast majority of them being long positions. Over the last 24 hours, nearly $773 million worth of positions have been liquidated. "Ultimately, though potentially painful, it will be a very good thing, in the end, for the U.S.A." Trump wrote on Truth Social. During this period, most federal agencies are partially closed, with only essential employees permitted to keep working. That said, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics has confirmed that it will release its September 2025 Consumer Price Index, which measures the rate of inflation in the U.S., on October 24. However, no further releases will be produced until the government resumes. Despite the increased tariff tensions, a price drop, and an ongoing government shutdown, 45% of predictors on Myriad Markets are bullish that Bitcoin will pump to $140,000 before it drops to $110,000.

C1, which focuses on digital assets and blockchain technology, did not announce the extent of the investment or other financial terms. Ripple is well-known in payments for its XRP ledger, a decentralized blockchain aimed at processing payments fast and at low cost. “Ripple's technology and international reach fit directly with our strategy to support core infrastructure and institutional progress in blockchain finance,” said Elliot Han, chief investment officer at C1 Fund Inc., in a statement. It created the XRP ledger in 2012 with a view toward fast settlement while processing as many as 1,500 transactions per second, with fees in fractions of a penny per transaction. In related news, BIT Mining Ltd., a company that provides technology for cryptocurrency processing, said it is changing its name to SOLAI Ltd. “We see the next wave of innovation emerging where intelligent systems connect with decentralized infrastructure — enabling faster, safer, and more efficient exchange of information and value,” says Bo Yu, chairman of BIT Mining, in a statement. “Ripple's technology and international reach fit directly with our strategy to support core infrastructure and institutional progress in blockchain finance,” said Elliot Han, chief investment officer at C1 Fund Inc., in a statement.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Jim Edwards is the executive editor for global news at Fortune. He also won the Neal award for an investigation of bribes and kickbacks on Madison Avenue. Hargreaves Lansdown, the largest retail investment platform in the U.K., which has about $225 billion in assets under management, issued a surprisingly harsh warning to its customers: Stay away from Bitcoin. The cryptocurrency has “no intrinsic value,” it told its clients, and should not be included in their life savings and retirement plans. HL is the third large financial institution recently to remind customers that crypto might be based on nothing, following Deutsche Bank and Elliott Management. “While longer-term returns of Bitcoin have been positive, Bitcoin has experienced several periods of extreme losses and is a highly volatile investment—much riskier than stocks or bonds. The HL investment view is that Bitcoin is not an asset class, and we do not think cryptocurrency has characteristics that mean it should be included in portfolios for growth or income and shouldn't be relied upon to help clients meet their financial goals. Performance assumptions are not possible to analyze for crypto, and unlike other alternative asset classes it has no intrinsic value,” the company said in a statement that also noted the platform would begin offering crypto trades for customers. A few days ago, Deutsche Bank told clients that Bitcoin was “backed by nothing” even though it would also likely end up being used as a reserve asset by central banks in the next few years. And back in January, activist investor Elliott Management told clients that Bitcoin faced an “inevitable collapse” because as an asset it has “no substance.” The argument that crypto has no fundamental value is based on the view that other assets—stocks, bonds, cash, property, or derivatives thereof—usually entitle holders to an underlying right, such as dividends, interest, land, or other legal rights.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Umbra, a privacy protocol powered by Arcium, has raised $154.9 million in USDC following the completion of its Initial Coin Offering (ICO) on Friday. However, because the cap was set to $3 million, an initial price of $0.30 per UMBRA token, participants will get approximately 2% of their allocation, the team explained. Therefore, each person will receive their share according to the USDC they committed, and have the remaining refunded. The project's token sale exceeded its $750,000 minimum target by more than 206x, reflecting growing market interest in privacy-focused blockchain applications and demand for confidential transaction infrastructure in decentralized finance. "We're genuinely overwhelmed by the support from our community," Umbra co-founder "Kru" said in a statement shared with The Block. Umbra joins a range of encryption applications powered by Arcium, such as Dark Pool, Blackjack, and Phantom Fleet. Proceeds from the raise will fund Umbra's development roadmap, including private swaps within the Umbra app, a redesigned interface, and a Zcash–Solana bridge to unlock ZEC liquidity for cross-chain privacy use cases, the team said. The protocol also plans to introduce a tiered fee model and monetize its SDK for integration with wallets, dApps, and financial platforms. Umbra plans to launch alongside Arcium's Mainnet Alpha, becoming one of the first privacy protocols on Solana to use its infrastructure. In May 2024, Arcium announced it had raised $5.5 million in a strategic funding round led by Greenfield Capital to develop its confidential computing network, The Block previously reported. Arcium, which recently completed the second phase of its public testnet, has now raised over $15 million in total to support an ecosystem of more than 20 projects. Its Multi-Party Computation (MPC) framework enables encrypted, trustless, and scalable data processing. The project previously developed Elusiv, a zero-knowledge privacy protocol based on Solana. "It's incredible to see Umbra's ICO become a record-breaking success. It's a clear message from users who want greater control and privacy over their onchain activity," Arcium CEO Yannik Schrade said on Friday. "What Umbra is doing for privacy on Solana is just the beginning; Arcium's infrastructure opens access to fast and trustless, encrypted computing power for every use cases that needs it, marking a monumental shift for public blockchains."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>SWIFT is building a blockchain-based payment system that could directly challenge Ripple's dominance in global money transfers. SWIFT is developing a blockchain ledger designed to handle real-time settlements and support tokenized assets. The project, built in partnership with Consensys, aims to upgrade the decades-old financial network and compete with Ripple's (XRP-USD) fast, low-cost transaction system. SWIFT's network connects more than 11,000 institutions across 200 countries, handling the bulk of cross-border transactions worldwide. The system does not move money itself but transmits secure payment messages between banks using unique SWIFT codes. The new blockchain infrastructure is meant to keep SWIFT relevant as digital currencies and tokenized assets reshape payments. It focuses on interoperability across public and private chains while allowing banks to adopt new technology without replacing their existing systems. Ripple continues to lead the market for blockchain-based remittances through its XRP token and On-Demand Liquidity network. Financial giants such as SBI Remit in Japan and Pyypl in the Middle East and Africa already use XRP for cross-border transfers. Ripple's network has become a preferred solution for markets where speed, liquidity, and lower fees are critical. Travel and loyalty firms such as Webus/Wetour plan to integrate XRP into reward programs, allowing users of Air China's PhoenixMiles to redeem blockchain-based points for services like airport transfers. SWIFT's blockchain project is designed to preserve its central role in international banking. The company's reach gives it a major advantage in adoption, as most global institutions already depend on its network. Ripple's technology remains faster and more efficient, but SWIFT's approach offers flexibility. This could appeal to traditional banks that prefer broader compatibility with existing regulatory frameworks. SWIFT's project also focuses on enhancing liquidity and improving transparency within its network, aiming to match the settlement efficiency of Ripple's On-Demand Liquidity system. Despite its scale, SWIFT faces significant technical and regulatory obstacles. Different jurisdictions have varying rules for digital assets and tokenized settlements, which could delay implementation. Many banks remain cautious about adopting new blockchain infrastructure until its stability and benefits are proven. SWIFT's blockchain initiative could reshape global payments by offering a regulated digital settlement platform that complements existing systems. Rather than replacing one another, the two systems may coexist.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Crypto space has witnessed increased interest in new initiatives that harmonize practical utility with cutting-edge technology. XRP Price Prediction continues to occupy investors' minds with developments in top blockchain ecosystems, while Chainlink continues to be in the running for its oracle platforms. Amidst all this, Remittix (RTX) has quietly been gaining steam as a cross-border payment system. Placed to connect crypto with fiat in an effortless way, Remittix allows for the direct sending of digital money to regular bank accounts in over 30 countries. Investors monitoring XRP Price Prediction closely are comparing these figures with broader market trends and the effect of oracle solutions such as Chainlink. Chainlink still gives decentralized apps important real-time data feeds that help make blockchain operations more open and accurate. As XRP and other older cryptocurrencies settle down, people are starting to pay more attention to projects that have real-world use and can be measured in terms of adoption. A second listing is planned with CEX LBank after passing the $22 million milestone. The announcements position RTX for liquidity and exposure, providing early-stage crypto investors with structured access while validating the project's legitimacy as a top crypto under $1 to watch. Remittix's focus on real-world adoption and robust presale performance establish it as an emerging contender to watch in 2025's cryptocurrency scene. Early adopters are witnessing a well-planned, utility-driven initiative that sets it apart from hype projects, making RTX one of the most valuable projects to keep an eye on.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Here, Faisal Toukan, CEO & Co-Founder of Ziina, explains why the future of money depends on a partnership between private innovation and public infrastructure. At Ziina, we have merged finance with art and user experience, earning global design recognition, including the Red Dot Award, for an interface built around speed and simplicity. This approach turns a mundane task like splitting a bill or paying for dinner into an intuitive and seamless process. A user-friendly interface, quick setup, and complete transparency reduce the friction that prevents many from embracing digital payments. Today, tens of thousands of SMEs and consumers across the UAE rely on Ziina for hassle-free money movement. As the first venture capital-backed fintech with a Stored Value Facilities (SVF) licence from the UAE Central Bank, we combine this design-led innovation with robust regulatory standards. For digital finance to reach its full potential, it needs a secure and efficient backbone, which is the role of the UAE's Digital Dirham. Globally, central banks are exploring similar models, with China piloting its e-CNY and the European Central Bank progressing on a digital euro. CBDCs offer stability but do not solve for usability or adoption on their own. Fintechs can build sleek experiences, but without trusted infrastructure, they risk fragility. Together, they close the loop: CBDCs deliver the foundation, and fintechs translate that foundation into everyday value for consumers and businesses. In practice, this means instant settlement for SMEs, real-time wages for gig workers, or cross-border payments that clear in seconds instead of days. Published Bimonthly, the Fintech Times explores the explosive world of financial technology, blending first hand insight, opinion and expertise with observational journalism to provide a balanced and comprehensive perspective of this rapidly evolving industry.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ethereum's bullish structure has started to show early signs of exhaustion as the price retraces from the $4,400 resistance zone. The next few days will be key to determining whether this is just a healthy correction or the start of a deeper pullback. On the daily timeframe, ETH remains inside a long-term ascending channel but has once again failed to break through the $4,800 resistance area. However, losing that level could open the door for a deeper move toward $3,400, where the next significant demand zone lies. In the 4-hour view, ETH has confirmed a Market Structure Shift (MSS) after failing to sustain higher highs near $4,800. A clear bearish divergence on RSI supported this move, showing momentum loss before the drop. The price has now entered a short-term corrective phase and could revisit the $4,200–$4,100 zone, which aligns with previous demand. Open interest across all exchanges remains elevated at around $28.5 billion, showing that derivatives traders are still heavily positioned despite the recent pullback. This suggests strong speculative interest, but it also means the market is vulnerable to liquidations if volatility increases. If open interest continues to stay high while price trends lower, it could trigger a cascade of forced long liquidations before a proper bottom forms. On the flip side, a gradual cooling of open interest during this correction would signal healthy resetting of leverage, potentially setting the stage for ETH's next leg higher.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Exchange-traded notes are debt instruments linked to one or more specified assets. In this case, they give traders exposure to digital tokens through the use of a regulated exchange. The new rules sparked a warning from Hargreaves Lansdowne — the U.K.'s biggest retail investment platform — which urged British retail investors to be cautious. "The HL Investment view is that bitcoin is not an asset class, and we do not think cryptocurrency has characteristics that mean it should be included in portfolios for growth or income and shouldn't be relied upon to help clients meet their financial goals," Hargreaves Lansdowne said in a statement. "Performance assumptions are not possible to analyse for crypto, and unlike other alternative asset classes it has no intrinsic value." It was hailed by crypto firms as a major breakthrough for the sector in Britain. The government also ruled on Wednesday that investors will be able to hold crypto ETNs in stocks and shares ISA accounts, an account where up to £20,000 ($26,753) a year can be invested tax-free. Cryptocurrencies, which are decentralized and therefore not regulated by central authorities like governments, have their critics and prices are notoriously volatile. In 2022, a so-called "crypto winter" saw investors lose $2 trillion. Bitcoin — the most commonly traded cryptocurrency — has led to major returns for early investors, however, and was last seen trading around $121,508. "While longer-term returns of bitcoin have been positive, bitcoin has experienced several periods of extreme losses and is a highly volatile investment — much riskier than stocks or bonds," the company said in its statement this week. The firm said, however, that it recognized that some traders wished to "speculate with cryptocurrency ETNs," and that it would therefore offer "appropriate clients" the opportunity to do so from early 2026. Cryptocurrencies have long divided market watchers, with some major institutions piling into digital assets while others have warned against them. The bank was the first major U.S. bank to offer wealthy clients access to bitcoin funds — a move that others have since followed. JPMorgan, meanwhile, plans to get involved in the stablecoin space, despite CEO Jamie Dimon being vocal in his criticism of crypto. Billionaire investor Warren Buffett has also openly lashed out at cryptocurrencies. Chris Mellor, head of EMEA ETF equity product management at Invesco, told CNBC on Thursday that he believes digital assets can offer investors a hedge against volatility in more traditional asset classes. "Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are sometimes considered 'digital gold' and questions have been raised around whether bitcoin might one day replace gold as the non-fiat asset of choice," he said via email. With the caveat that correlations can change, in recent months we have observed that bitcoin has displayed a very low correlation with stocks, U.S. Treasuries and gold." Meanwhile, Nigel Green, CEO of financial consultancy DeVere Group, argued that bitcoin's recent climb past the $125,000 mark was a signal that digital assets have entered the financial mainstream. "Volatility still exists, but it is now productive volatility, the kind that accompanies price discovery in a maturing market. Short-term swings are inevitable when capital rotates at this scale." Green labeled this "a structural realignment, not a temporary rally" for bitcoin, and pointed to the Trump administration's favorable policy mix as offering further support for its credibility. — CNBC's Ryan Browne and Hugh Son contributed to this article.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>SAN FRANCISCO (KGO) -- Bitcoin ATM machines that convert cash into cryptocurrency have become the favorite tool of scammers, many operating from overseas. The I-Team has been working with ABC News on this investigation. It's the same old scams with a new twist. But now, the bad guys are convincing victims to feed their life savings into these Bitcoin ATMs. He told Meduri to contact a defense attorney, who said the bail was $15,000. Meduri told the I-Team, "I went in there and we put, my wife and I put money into this ATM, you know, $100 bill at a time, you know? Meduri's next call was to the Santa Clara County DA's Fraud Unit, where attorney Erin West worked. So, when we were able to see where he sent his money, we were able to send them an email that day and get them to freeze it until we sent a warrant, and then we were able to get that money back for him." VIDEO: 83-year-old East Bay woman loses nearly $50K in Coinstar, Coinme scam Getting money back in these cases is extremely rare, according to West. She has started a nonprofit called "Shamrock" to investigate and expose the worldwide scams that are now using these Bitcoin ATMs. "Their primary industries in Cambodia prior to this were tourism and garments," she added. It makes up more than half of their GDP and they're coming for us." The woman told police, "And she says you gotta get $27,000 out of your savings and set up a dummy account and then we'll put cancel on something so they can't get it." Athena forcefully denied those allegations in a statement to ABC News, asserting in part that it maintains "strong safeguards against fraud including transparent instructions, prominent warnings and consumer education." They continue, "Just as a bank isn't held responsible if someone willingly sends funds to someone else, Athena does not control users' decisions." MORE: Bay Area victim duped by AI-generated Trump gold investment scam: Here's what to know The I-Team spoke with ATM Industry Association Executive Director David Tente and wanted to know if there's a serious problem with Bitcoin ATMs. Tente says the rate of Bitcoin ATM fraud is slightly less than credit card fraud, and that we shouldn't blame the technology. "We can't control human behavior with mechanical devices to a great extent. A lot of the scams that are going on have been around for decades and just using a different method of payment." AARP is warning its 38 million members that Bitcoin ATMs are becoming the preferred method for criminals. Amy Nofziger, Director of AARP Fraud Watch Network, said, "We want them to have similar consumer protections like every other financial instrument out there. Daily transition limits, so maybe a new customer can only put $1,000 into it."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Democratic senators have been criticized for pitching a counter-proposal to the market structure bill that could effectively “kill DeFi.” The Senate Banking Committee Democrats sent a proposal to the committee's Republicans on Thursday seeking to impose Know Your Customer rules on the frontends of crypto apps — including non-custodial wallets — and to strip protections from crypto developers, Punchbowl News reported on Thursday. Any US national who uses those protocols and makes “recurring revenues” from them may also face punishment, said the founder and president of MetaLeX Labs, Gabriel Shapiro. Chervinsky said the proposal seemed less like a regulatory framework and more like an “unprecedented, unconstitutional government takeover of an entire industry.” The Democrats behind the counter-proposal include Mark Warner, Ruben Gallego, Andy Kim, Reverend Raphael Warnock, Angela Alsobrooks and Lisa Blunt Rochester, according to Chervinsky. It also clashes with aspects of the Senate Banking Committee's Responsible Financial Innovation Act draft on Sept. 9, a bipartisan effort that seeks to assign the Commodity Futures Trading Commission oversight of spot markets and reduce the Securities and Exchange Commission's overreach. Digital Chamber's vice president of government and policy affairs, Zunera Mazhar, described the measures as heavy-handed and ineffective, adding that they risk pushing innovation offshore instead of addressing the real risks involved. Related: Democrats press bank regulator on Trump stablecoin conflicts Instead, Mazhar said the Democrats should target the “real chokepoints” where illicit finance occurs with a risk-based approach that doesn't crush innovation and create regulatory uncertainty. Blockchain Association CEO Summer Mersinger agreed with Mazhar's take, adding that the proposal would make compliance impossible for industry players in the US.
