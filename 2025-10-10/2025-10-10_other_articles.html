Historic Senate Panel Exposes How the US Government Turns a Blind Eye to the Corporate Cartels Fueling America's Health Crisis Our criminal justice system is tasked with maintaining public safety and upholding the rule of law. Yet far too often, social justice takes a backseat while those in authority violate human rights. See all inspiring news on criminal justice system reform. Considering the vital role money plays both in our lives and in the world, our educational system teaches us very little about how money is created, how banks operate, and what causes the huge banking scandals and bankruptcies that have occurred. Furthermore, rising wealth inequality is a major issue of our time. We delve into all things related to financial system corruption. Technology is a powerful force that has helped shape and define human life since the very beginning. Yet when exploited, technology comes with environmental, human rights, and existential costs while Big Tech corporations profit immensely. Now, the world's biggest tech companies are becoming more powerful than most countries. Becoming aware of the special interests driving what we see, hear, and read can help us navigate censorship, propaganda and misinformation campaigns that serve powerful interests over open, democratic debate.

But for more than five years, a former Wall Street trader used it as a sex “dungeon,” luring women in and leaving them maimed and bruised, federal prosecutors say. Howard Rubin, 70, a former Salomon Brothers bond trader ... was arrested Friday on sex trafficking charges. Prosecutors said he brought women to the penthouse blocks from Central Park, where a bedroom was painted red, soundproofed and fitted with devices to use on the women. Along with a personal assistant, Jennifer Powers, Mr. Rubin recruited and paid at least a half-dozen women to participate in bondage and sadomasochism, but the acts went far beyond what the women had signed up for. Though women were told they could use a “safe word” to stop any sexual encounter, prosecutors said they were often unable to utter it because they were gagged or Mr. Rubin simply ignored their pleas. Mr. Rubin also provided the women with copious amounts of drugs and alcohol before their sex acts. Howie Rubin (mentioned in this article) was accused in a 2017 lawsuit of beating a woman's breasts so badly that her right implant flipped. Elite predators like Rubin and Harvey Weinstein often make their victims sign non-disclosure agreements to keep them quiet using the law.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A relic of St. Gemma Galgani has reportedly moved within its sealed reliquary at the University of Nebraska–Lincoln's Newman Center, drawing Catholics from across the state eager to witness it.Video: Lillian Johnson pic.twitter.com/DngPROJScQ He told CNA that the Church has to look at such things with a “healthy skepticism” to see if there are any “natural” causes of the occurrences. “Not that these things can't happen — of course, they absolutely can,” he said. When St. Gemma's relic was removed from the hook, it ceased moving on its own. But La Rue also noted that miracles do happen and encouraged people to look for the ordinary ways God shows his presence in our lives. “Even if it's not supernatural, I think there's something that God wants all of us to take away from this experience because he either willed or permitted it to happen,” La Rue said. Church authorities investigate alleged miracles when they receive reports of them. Apparently miraculous phenomena often have to do with the Eucharist, Marian apparitions, and miracles of healing, among others. La Rue, however, noted that it's not impossible for a relic to be moving miraculously in this way. There's far more miraculous things that happen every day,” La Rue said. “You don't want to prematurely begin dampening the fervor. But at the same time, the Church is cautious for a reason because she wants our attention to be on truly miraculous things.” Healing miracles are especially important in the investigation of potential saints. These healing miracles undergo a scrutinous investigation in line with what is called “the Lambertini Criteria,” according to O'Neill. A miracle can be confirmed only if there is no possible scientific explanation for the healing. La Rue noted that the Newman Center has all-day Eucharistic adoration, where students and staff come to pray in the presence of Jesus Christ. He noted that the Eucharist “is the ultimate sign of God's abiding presence with his people and his desire to be a part of our life.” “Sometimes we maybe just don't pay attention to the little ways in which he is.” La Rue encouraged those who had hoped for a miracle to “be mindful of the ordinary ways in which God communicates his love and his grace to us throughout the day.” “It doesn't necessarily need to be something spectacular, but there's lots of little ways that God is constantly showing us his care for us,” La Rue said. “The number of people who came to join the church last year who just literally just showed up — nobody went and found them,” La Rue said. “We certainly have those people, but a lot of them just came on their own.” St. Ferdinand Church, located in the historic heart of Naples, Italy, was the scene of a July 24 event that many are already calling miraculous.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Sometimes high fashion is just a little bit over our heads. Bringing wearable art to the world of sneakers is a recipe for bold designs, intricate details, and unique materials, but just like runway-ready pieces, the results can often be hard to actually picture on foot. If you're trying to stand out from the pack, though, a new collaboration between Windowsen and Nike is exactly what you're looking for. Starting with the gold pair, the shoe features alien graphics subtly woven into an all-over print, adds bright blue behind the gold, and finishes things off with hits of red. On both shoes, the tongue gets a custom AM Windowsen label with alien eyes, and a custom alien head figurine affixed to the bottom lace. For a brand that Vogue once described as wanting you to “dress like a hot alien,” Windows did not disappoint. The Windowsen x Nike Air Max Muse Pack will be released Holiday 2025 through Windowsen, Nike, and select retailers in-store and online. Available in women's sizing, the retail price is set at $260.

On July 1, astronomers spotted an unusual object speeding through the Solar System at nearly twice the velocity of previous interstellar visitors ‘Oumuamua and Comet Borisov. The object was soon confirmed to be an interstellar comet, and is suspected to have a nucleus (the rocky center of the comet, excluding its coma) of around 5.6 kilometers (3.5 miles), and a potential mass of over 33 billion tons. We may even have seen it using NASA's Perseverance rover on Mars. Luckily for us, gravity is time-reversal symmetric, and if we know an object's trajectory, we can work backwards and trace its path. "We identify 93 nominal encounters, 62 of which are significant at the 2σ level. However, none of these encounters produced any meaningful perturbation," the team writes in their paper. Our results indicate that no stellar flybys within the past 10 Myr and 500 pc contained in Gaia DR3 can account for the present trajectory of 3I/ATLAS or be associated with its origin." In short, none of these potential close(ish) encounters could explain 3I/ATLAS's origin, and barely altered its trajectory. "Together, all data indicate that while 3I/ATLAS follows a thin-disk orbit in the solar neighborhood, it may nonetheless be an old object, consistent with ejection from a primordial planetesimal disk in an early-formed system, or from an exo-Oort cloud, and is most likely associated with the transition region between the thin and thick disk, although its origin remains undisclosed," the team concludes. Further study of 3I/ATLAS and other interstellar objects is needed to draw further conclusions, but this preliminary study suggests it could be a very old object, that may have been traveling alone for billions of years until we spotted it near our star. “What makes 3I/ATLAS unique is that it allows us to study the evolution of objects originating from other stellar systems – something we had only theorised about until now," Pérez Couto, Centre for Research in Information and Communication Technologies researcher and team leader, added in a statement. "Each observation is like opening a window into the Universe's past." Receive weekly science coverage direct to your inbox</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox WASHINGTON – With federal services crippled on Oct 10, the US government shutdown has one unexpected perk, according to believers in the long-debunked “chemtrails” conspiracy theory – “clear” skies. “Best thing about government shutdowns: no chemtrails,” Kentucky Republican Representative Thomas Massie wrote on Instagram. “Ever since we had the government shutdown, there has been zero chemtrails. I haven't seen the sky this clear in decades,” a Los Angeles-based artist says in a reel watched 1.7 million times. Chemtrails is a scientifically-unsound theory mistaking condensation trails emanating from aircraft as a government programme “spraying” toxic chemicals in the sky to manipulate the weather. In 2025, state legislatures have doubled down on efforts to block all geoengineering and local weather research programmes, moves that risk jeopardising scientific innovation. Others appeal to Florida's Republican Governor Ron DeSantis with footage of white trials, some positing the activities are being carried out by “private rogue companies and evil billionaires”. The state now allows residents to report “suspected weather modification” and “geoengineering” activities. Professor Holly Buck, who teaches environment and sustainability at the University at Buffalo, said people “invested in this idea of atmospheric manipulation” will view current events through that same prism.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Modern humans (homo sapiens) made their appearance on the world stage sometime between 200,000 and 300,000 years ago. Descended from grey wolves, canines became domesticated anywhere between 15,000 and 40,000 years ago. Domestication involved not just physical changes, but behavioural ones, too—unerring, unconditional, lifelong loyalty. Throughout their appearance in the arts, canines have remained mostly peripheral or background characters. Especially on film, they've rarely received top billing, both as a result of human-centric creativity (or lack thereof) and their physical limitations (speech, for example). First-time filmmaker Ben Leonberg saw the latter not as an excuse to focus his creative pursuits elsewhere, but as an opportunity to put his dog, Indy, a Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever, at the centre of Good Boy. Driven by the aforementioned loyalty, Indy never willingly leaves Todd's side, following him everywhere. But with Todd's health failing, punctuated by long, guttural coughs and the occasional spurt of blood, it seems like Indy might find himself alone or, if he's lucky, adopted by Todd's mostly off-screen sister, Vera (Arielle Friedman). As expected, Todd's return to the long-abandoned family home stirs up old ghosts—some imaginary, some possibly real. Where Todd, increasingly concerned about his ill health, begins the slow, painful pull-away typical of terminal patients, Indy stubbornly, steadfastly remains at his side, constantly scanning their dimly lit surroundings for the possibility or the potential of a supernatural threat, and all but physically interposing himself between said threat and a fading Todd. True to Good Boy's infinitely ingenious premise, Leonberg—working closely with cinematographer Wade Grebnoel—keeps the camera fixed at Indy's level. Lit with an emphasis on darkness as a suffocating shroud over other, dimly illuminated areas, Good Boy ably maintains a subtle sense of unease and discomfort throughout its brief, 73-minute running time. Good Boy wouldn't be more than a cleverly executed gimmick, however, without the presence of Indy in practically every frame. There's never a doubt about what Indy's feeling or even thinking in any scene. Patiently trained over several years by Leonberg and his life partner, Kari Fischer (who also co-produced under their “What's Wrong With Your Dog?” banner), Indy gives not only an impressively emotive performance, but a consistently believable one. His large, expressive eyes, floppy ears, and body language transparently communicate Indy's moment-by-moment experience. Good Boy premiered at the 2025 South by Southwest Film Festival this spring. #Darkfield at @stacktmarket is a deliciously unnerving experience, especially if you like to let raw fear run its icy fingers up and down your psyche. Mumblecore pioneer Jay Duplass returns with #TheBaltimorons, a middling comedy-drama about another lost man-child. #BoneLake is a sexy thriller that combines the art of seduction with sharp metal objects. First-time filmmaker Ben Leonberg gives canine star, Indy, the supernatural horror film he deserves and we want. At least they can agree “Bart Sells His Soul” is pretty much a perfect Simpsons episode.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The two self-proclaimed Montgomery County psychics may not have seen this coming: They were arrested for allegedly swindling two women out of more than $600,000 to remove black magic curses. Gina Marie Marks, 53, of Huntington Valley, and 40-year-old Steve Nicklas of Jenkintown have been charged with numerous felonies for their complex, yearslong fortunetelling scheme, Montgomery County District Attorney Kevin Steele said in a statement. Marks, who identified herself as “Naomi,” convinced the woman that a “powerful curse (was) preventing her from finding love and happiness and convinced her that a curse would destroy her marriage, business and family if it wasn't removed.” It was such a dire case of black magic doom that she needed the help of a second seer, Nicklas, who Marks called “Stephan.” She sent them cash, jewels, concert tickets, gift cards and luxury items, the DA said. But none of the cash and items totaling $595,959 ever came back. Marks kept “stringing her along,” a court record stated. Montco detectives examined various cash accounts owned by Marks and Nicklas, including Zelle and CashApp, which showed tens of thousands of dollars transferred to them by the victim. A Navy Federal Credit Union account owned by Nicklas showed thousands of dollars deposited into the account were spent on the betting site FanDuel. Montco detectives learned of the alleged fraud in December 2024. During their investigation, they found that a second victim who had also contacted Jenkintown Psychic Visions in June 2023. In that case, Marks told the woman to give her photos and personal life details in sessions that lasted through February 2024. In addition to cash, Marks demanded a Chanel purse. Marks and Nicklas were arrested Oct. 7, charged with corrupt organizations, dealing in the proceeds of unlawful activities, theft by unlawful taking, theft by deception and receiving stolen property, as well as fortune telling. “These defendants, through their con scheme, preyed on people who were looking for help, guidance and hope, exploiting them for financial gain,” Steele said. A preliminary hearing has been scheduled for 9:30 a.m. Oct. 20 before District Judge R. Emmett Madden.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Gary Arnold, an Oxford, Pa. resident, is inviting people to hear what he's been hearing since 2017; conversations he's had with other-worldly voices. Arnold said these voices have answered his questions and also given him winning lottery numbers. OXFORD, Pa. — It started with a recording on an inexpensive cellphone. Now, Gary Arnold has had more than 1800 eerie encounters since 2017 with some type of other-worldly speaker and he wants your opinion on what's being heard. He is inviting people to visit his Ultimate Haunted Attraction online. Think of it as another Halloween experience, he said. By going to https://wearenotalone-81923.medium.com/ visitors can listen to several short clips that Arnold says prove there's something out there. The voices have given him winning lottery numbers, he said. However, they do not want to predict election outcomes, indicating they “do not want to cause catastrophic disruption.” “They are not going to destroy us,” Arnold said, but added, “Some are not happy with us.” Arnold has run the recordings past audio-forensic professionals and through spectral analysis, and all agree the voices are non-human. “Every analysis confirms they are real phenomena, not tricks of the microphone. “I am not interacting with people who have passed on,” he said of the metallic sounds. He's had full conversations with these voices via Electronic Voice Phenomena (EVP), hearing them answer his questions in real time. The online clips are short — mere seconds — but in one conversation he's had, Arnold said he was told “You're our favorite.” Please avoid obscene, vulgar, lewd, racist or sexually-oriented language.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Reality TV can come in all shapes and sizes, and while many audiences are content with reality shows that create drama and romance, or seeing people compete for an ultimate prize, there are other genres worth exploring. Things that exist just beyond the explained remain interesting to viewers and can also deliver some genuine scares. Whether a viewer is a skeptic or a true believer, these series explore the ways in which paranormal experts and enthusiasts attempt to communicate with and understand spirits and the supernatural. Among the dozens of paranormal investigation TV shows available, HBO Max has one of the best collections of seemingly real encounters with the ghosts, demons, and supernatural creatures that bring nightmares to life. Josh Gates, the host of Destination Truth, is an archaeologist who has dedicated his life to exploring the world and documenting his experience and observations in various ways. Gates' Destination Truth isn't a ghost hunting show exactly because the team investigates various paranormal myths throughout the world, but many episodes include spirits. Some of the episodes are creepy, delving into vivid detail about the legends of these creatures, which can be a bit scary for some viewers. However, even those who aren't easily spooked by mythology and ghost stories can find the expedition series entertaining and informative. Ghost Brothers follows a group of friends, Dalen Spratt, Juwan Mass, and Marcus Harvey, who all had paranormal experiences as children and are now on the hunt to prove ghosts exist. By framing the show around two major questions-"Are ghosts real?" "-they strike a balance between traditional ghost reality shows and an important discussion about the structure and themes of previous series. Many Ghost Brothers fans prefer the team to many others, feeling they are more genuine than other paranormal investigations. The show has been praised for balancing eerie paranormal investigations and friendly, relatable banter. In A Haunting, people tell about their real-life experiences with the paranormal, detail the encounter, how it influenced their lives, and how it continues to have an impact on them. Each episode focuses on individual experiences, using the stories of these people to recreate the ordeal with a dramatized re-enactment. Though the creators of A Haunting don't hunt for ghosts themselves, they do engage with people who have claimed to have encounters with the paranormal, allowing their stories to be told. Those who had these experiences often sought the help of professionals, including ghost investigators and spiritual advisors. Ghost Adventures is an extensive ghost hunting series consisting of twenty-nine seasons of the paranormal investigators, led by Zak Bagans, exploring reported hauntings. After seventeen years, it's still one of the best paranormal reality shows for those looking to be a bit freaked out. In this series, Bagans hosts this show as well, exploring several of the haunted objects in his Las Vegas museum. Partnering with renowned horror filmmaker Eli Roth, each episode offers a dramatized version of the experiences people had with these haunted or possessed items. This horror anthology isn't the most realistic project of Bagans', especially considering the special effects and CGI utilized to bring these terrifying ghosts and demons to life. However, The Haunted Museum does paint a disturbing, eerie image of the stories of those who have encountered foreboding spirits. During these investigations, the team spends the night camping out at these locations, using their ghost-hunting technology to capture paranormal encounters. They learn the history of these locations to aid in their attempts to connect with whatever presence is supposedly haunting the property. At first glance, Destination Fear is like any other ghost-hunting reality TV show, exploring the locations of rumored hauntings. Kindred Spirits is an investigation team that includes Adam Berry and Amy Bruni, who were previously members of the teams featured on Ghost Hunters. In later seasons, the duo was joined by a psychic medium, Chip Coffey, who utilized his connection with spirits to aid in their cases. There was some skepticism from fans regarding the authenticity and style of Kindred Spirits, but the previous work of the team members gave them a level of credibility many amateurs lack. In addition, fans were entertained by the scary possibility of unsuspecting homeowners encountering lingering spirits. Paranormal Caught On Camera does not feature a team walking through haunted houses or trying to communicate with the dead, but analyzes available footage of various paranormal sightings. There are many instances of supposed ghost encounters, but the series also features other supernatural or mythological beings, such as Bigfoot and UFOs. It has a diverse cast of experts, such as the paranormal researcher Brian J. Cano and actress/paranormal investigator Susan Slaughter. A major critique of Paranormal Caught On Camera is that a majority of the cast is far too willing to accept the videos they are commenting on without addressing the possibility that these encounters are staged or faked in some way. However, not all paranormal fans are interested in skeptical opinions about supernatural encounters. The Dead Files follows former homicide detective Steve DiShiavi and current paranormal investigator and psychic medium Amy Allen, who was replaced by another medium, Cindy Kaza, in the final season. During their investigations of haunted places, Steve and Amy/Cindy had separate interviews with clients and examinations of the locations to see if their findings were consistent. Compared to other terrifying TV shows that seek to frighten viewers regardless, this series capitalizes on both skeptics and believers being entertained. Overall, it's a creepy, but fun take on paranormal investigations. Share your opinions in the thread below and remember to keep it respectful.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>CHARLESTON, W.Va. (WCHS) — Spooky season is upon us, and the Capital High School Theatre Department is embracing that fully by presenting Lucas Hnath's The Thin Place this weekend. The story centers around a friendship between two women: Hilda, who is dealing with loss and seeking answers to reconnect with those she lost, and Linda, a medium who can talk to the dead, who reside in "the thin place," a fine line between our world and the next. The Thin Place features an intimate cast of just four people, who, in Capital's production, are all played by women. "Learning to work in the round has been an interesting thing," Arthur said. Trying to speak around me, but also not scream or stare directly at someone has been a challenge lately." "You can walk around and you don't have to worry about cheating this way to look at the audience. You can just look wherever you want and it doesn't matter, because the audience is always there." The Thin Place has challenged the actresses, from learning to work with just four people to learning more about themselves as a performer. "In middle school, I'd always done huge musicals with about 40 people," Brown said. "I wasn't used to being only with four. "I've learned a lot from this show, more than I have from a lot of other shows." The Thin Place at Capital High School runs Friday through Sunday. The 7 p.m. performance on Friday will feature an American Sign Language interpreter. "I think the audience will walk away with a new perspective," Pierson said.</p>
