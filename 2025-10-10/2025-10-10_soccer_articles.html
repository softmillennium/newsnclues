                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Poker and Chaos: Aubameyang Keeps Gabon's World Cup Dream Alive Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang once again etched his name into African football history. The Olympique de Marseille striker, at 36 years old, delivered an epic masterclass by scoring all four goals in Gabon's 4-3 win over Gambia, keeping their hopes of reaching the 2026 World Cup alive. Aubameyang twice put the Panthers ahead in the first half, only for Gambia to equalize through Yankuba Minteh and Adama Sidibeh. Aubameyang's story didn't end with his goals. But things got worse when, just five minutes from time, he was sent off for shoving Gambian defender Alagie Saine. His dismissal left Gabon down to ten men in the closing stages, but the team held firm to secure a crucial victory. Now, coach Thierry Mouyouma's side will have to fight for qualification without their star man, who will serve a suspension in the final round. Ivory Coast remain top with 12 points after their 7-0 demolition of Seychelles, but Gabon now sit just one point behind with 11. The equation is simple: Gabon must beat Burundi and hope Ivory Coast slip up against Kenya. With this performance, Aubameyang reached 12 goals in the qualifiers, placing him among Africa's top scorers.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Belgium has revenge in sight as it hosts North Macedonia in the 2026 World Cup qualifying on Friday. North Macedonia has an opportunity to do something special and move within inches of an automatic qualifying place for the 2026 World Cup when it travels to Belgium on Friday. The top two teams in UEFA qualifying Group J will square off in Ghent, with North Macedonia holding the slimmest of advantages for the time being. That game in hand makes it all the more crucial that North Macedonia gets a result at the Planet Group Arena, having failed to beat Belgium in five previous meetings to date. Blagoja Milevski's side managed to frustrate the Red Devils when these countries clashed back in June, striking in the 86th minute to secure a 1-1 home draw. That brought an end to North Macedonia's three-loss streak in this rivalry, proof of the progress it has made in recent years. The Premier League duo of Youri Tielemans and Romeo Lavia aren't among Rudi Garcia's selection as they contend with injuries, while Romelu Lukaku is also sidelined. Meanwhile, the experienced duo of Kevin De Bruyne and Axel Witsel are back in the national team fold, as is Eintracht Frankfurt striker Michy Batshuayi, who hasn't scored for Belgium since 2022.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Steve Nicol believes Mo Salah could be facing a crisis in confidence this season as his struggles continued vs Chelsea. Bafana Bafana will look to get back on top of Group C of CAF FIFA World Cup qualifying when they face Zimbabwe at Moses Mabhida Stadium on Friday. According to Raymond Hack -- a CAS arbitrator who has previously served as South African Football Association (SAFA) CEO and a FIFA Disciplinary Committee member -- there is no realistic chance that the association's appeal will see Bafana's win over Lesotho reinstated. However - as Benin head coach Gernot Rohr has pointed out - Bafana still have a "crazy" advantage: playing away fixtures against neighbouring countries at home due to a lack of suitable venues in those countries. The clash with Zimbabwe is technically an away fixture, but it will be played on South African soil in Durban. Ahead of Bafana Bafana's final match of World Cup qualifiers against Rwanda on October 14, it is vital that they put themselves back in pole position to top the group. Meanwhile, the four best runners-up across nine groups in CAF qualifying will advance to a four-team knockout tournament to determine Africa's representative at the inter-continental playoffs. How to watch: The match is available on SuperSport and SABC. Notable absentees from the Bafana Bafana squad are Kamogelo Sebelebele (despite his form on the wing for Orlando Pirates) and veteran striker Bradley Grobler (despite his new lease on life at Sekhukhune United). Khuliso Mudau is likely to slot in at right-back, having returned to action at Mamelodi Sundowns after a standoff with the club amid reported interest from North Africa was resolved. Sphephelo 'Yaya' Sithole also makes the squad after his return from a long injury layoff and is likely to feature in midfield. Winger Relebohile Mofokeng is injured, with Mduduzi Shabalala taking his place in the squad. Iqraam Rayners was another late withdrawal due to medical reasons, with Evidence Makgopa replacing him.</p>

The United States men's national team will be back in action on Friday night, hosting Ecuador in Austin, Texas. Entering this match, there are slight concerns as Pochettino announced that Christian Pulisic didn't train on Thursday before the match. He'll be looked at and will have a chance to go for this match against Ecuador, but if he can't Haji Wright could get a chance on the left wing. Called back in due to his strong form for Coventry City, Wright is looking to make his second consecutive World Cup squad, and this will be a critical camp for that. Antonee Robinson has also returned to the USMNT setup and may not be fit to go 90 minutes. He acknowledged that he's not 100%, but if Robinson is good to go 60 minutes or so, it'd be a good time for Pochettino to get him into the XI in order to see what the side looks like with their starting left back. It's especially important for Robinson to feature if the back three that helped lead to the defeat of Japan comes back. Pochettino has called in center backs who are strong in a back three, and with him stating that no player is a lock for the World Cup squad, being able to see players like Mark McKenzie in a back three will show how sustainable this formation can be. Call it What You Want: A weekly podcast where Jimmy Conrad, Charlie Davies and Tony Meola cover all things USMNT and the state of the beautiful game in the United States. Catch the show YouTube live every Tuesday and Thursday at 10 a.m. Some players in Pochettino's squad are used to those kinds of matches, but this provides a chance to give players a group stage style test without the high stakes.

With eight goals scored and two conceded, Portugal began UEFA qualification for the World Cup well last month after winning their second UEFA Nations League trophy in Germany over the summer. In the past, Ireland have been able to be difficult to play against and beat against Portugal but there is pressure growing on manager Heimir Hallgrimsson, formerly of Iceland and Jamaica. Roberto Martinez is blessed with a simply ridiculous team that should be targeting Portugal's first ever FIFA World Cup after winning three pieces of silverware in the last decade. Portugal have the potential to blow pretty much any team they play away with their squad depth and quality and, as much as Ireland try to be defensive, Portugal should win comfortably. It is Portugal's first home game since the tragic death of Diogo Jota over the summer and so there will be a lot of emotion at Estadio Jose Alvalade in Lisbon. Here's how we think the two teams will line up for this World Cup qualifying clash.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Robbie Williams admitted that he delayed the release of his new album Britpop to avoid competition with Taylor Swift's The Life of a Showgirl as he chases a monumental U.K. music charts record. Britpop was originally slated to arrive today, Oct. 10, but in September (about one month after Swift announced her new album), the singer pushed his 13th studio LP to Feb. 6, 2026, because of “scheduling changes.” At the time, many speculated the change was Swift-related, especially because Williams is positioned to break a tie with the Beatles and score a record-setting 16th Number One on the U.K. Albums Chart. At an intimate show in London last night (Oct. 9) — originally scheduled to coincide with Britpop's release — Williams confirmed that's exactly what happened. While Williams admitted he was initially “worried” about making his fans wait several more months for the album, in an endearing display of pop star ego and self-deprecation, he quipped. How many times in your life do you get to have the most Number One albums the U.K. has fucking ever had?” What ‘Monster: The Ed Gein Story' Gets Right and Wrong No Doubt to Reunite for Sphere Residency in Las Vegas Rush Add New Dates, Doubling Length of Surprise 2026 Tour Funnily enough, while Williams is now likely to secure that chart record next year, he may not get to hold onto it very long — because of Swift. (The U.K. albums chart will refresh with releases from last week later today, Oct. In 2019, he released a holiday album, The Christmas Present, which contained a handful of seasonal standards but was otherwise filled with Christmas-themed originals.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After paying hundreds or thousands of dollars for the “right to buy” 2026 World Cup tickets, some fans now say they feel “ripped off,” “scammed” or “taken advantage of” by FIFA and its digital collectibles platform, FIFA Collect. Over the past year, FIFA and a crypto partner, Modex, have sold tens of thousands of “Right To Buy” tokens on the platform. Each token cost hundreds of dollars and promised buyers the ability to purchase one or two World Cup tickets at a to-be-determined later date, for a to-be-determined full price. Many saw the so-called “RTBs” as a clever way to bypass ticket lotteries, and perhaps more cost-effective than buying on the secondary market, where tickets are currently listed for far more than their original price. “This is so bad, there's no value in buying a RTB,” another said. Multiple RTB holders told The Athletic that they and many others had assumed they'd be able to use the tokens to buy more affordable tickets. Early buyers were told by FIFA Collect in a December 2024 email reviewed by The Athletic: “Tickets will be available across different categories, providing options to suit various preferences and needs.” Jon Heath, one of those buyers, told The Athletic: “The whole point for me was (seemingly) access to face value tickets in cheaper categories.” Instead, having already spent thousands of dollars apiece on RTBs for the U.S. men's national team's opening match, he'll now have to pay an additional $1,940 per Category 2 ticket or $2,735 per Category 1 ticket. FIFA Collect administrators said Tuesday that 70 per cent of the tickets that will soon be made available to RTB holders will be in Category 1, the most expensive category; 28 per cent would be in Category 2; and a mere 2 per cent would be in Category 3. Many also rushed to sell their RTBs on FIFA Collect's secondary marketplace. Before Tuesday's Discord call with users, dozens of RTBs per day were being resold for profit. Some RTB holders pointed out that, in some cases, the price of their RTB plus the price of Category 1 tickets they'll be able to buy is roughly equivalent to or less than the current price of those same tickets on FIFA's resale platform. “I feel ripped off,” said Weston Binford, who, over the past month, spent thousands on RTBs for several matches in Texas, but now feels “turned off” because the tickets themselves are too expensive. Blok, an avid user who spoke on the condition that he be identified only by his online alias, told The Athletic: “We were taken advantage of and we seem to have no voice.” For months, some of these same users had been asking FIFA Collect for answers: When would they be able to convert their RTBs into tickets? On Sept. 19, in an attempt to quell frustration, an administrator wrote to Discord users: “Guys, rest assured, you will be content with the outcome. But even as FIFA's first 2026 World Cup ticket sales phase opened, answers never came. In fact, FIFA never announced any ticket prices beyond a minimum and maximum. When tickets did ultimately go on sale last week, prices were multiple times higher than either point of comparison. And on Tuesday, RTB holders were told they would pay those same prices — or, perhaps, higher ones, subject to FIFA's “variable pricing.” (They were revealed by The Athletic, via screenshots and data from fans.) FIFA Collect did, though, continue to aggressively promote and sell RTBs through last weekend. On Saturday, it went to market with new batches of “City Glory” packs. Those, it seems, were some of the last sales before a November RTB conversion window, during which, a FIFA Collect administrator said, holders will be able to exchange their tokens for “what we call a digital collectible ticket” — an NFT that will then convert into an actual ticket in May or June, weeks or days before the World Cup begins. After learning details of the RTB conversion process this week, some users ridiculed the FIFA Collect admin's previous assurance that they'd be “content with the outcome.” One wrote: “Please help me understand one thing anyone could rationally think we would be content with. When asked why there were no Category 4 tickets and hardly any Category 3 tickets available to RTB holders, he said: “We are unfortunately just handling the allocations that we've been provided by FIFA. The platform is operated by Modex, a European-based blockchain provider, but Modex executives appear to work in coordination with multiple departments at FIFA. A FIFA spokesperson, when asked why it was appropriate to sell tens of millions of dollars worth of RTBs without telling fans what types of tickets the RTBs could yield, or how much they'd have to pay for the tickets, said in an emailed statement: “As per standard practice, FIFA does not disclose specifics on business, financial or commercial strategies. It does, however, continually analyse and assess these strategies on a regular basis to ensure they are working in the interest of the fan and global football.” When asked why 70 per cent of the tickets being offered were Category 1 tickets, with little to no availability in cheaper categories, the FIFA spokesperson said that category allocations “vary between sales phases and venues, and are reviewed continually to balance demand, venue capacities and fan access. In mid-July, new packs began including a note that said “20 per cent of all proceeds” would go to the FIFA Global Citizen Education Fund and “help provide education access to the world's most marginalized children, build safe learning environments, and accelerate progress toward every child's right to quality education across more than 200 countries.” FIFA Collect's website says that $3.1 million has so far been raised for the fund. A FIFA spokesperson, when asked last month about revenue breakdowns, wrote that the governing body “does not disclose the specifics of commercial and financial agreements or strategies.” But he did say: “As with all of FIFA's commercial activities, revenues go directly back into football development and social projects worldwide, with Modex taking a commission to scale operations and cover technical costs. FIFA Collect therefore provides life-changing opportunities for fans, new digital ecosystems for stakeholders, and additional revenue to grow the game globally.” Henry Bushnell  is a senior writer for The Athletic covering soccer.</p>

In the September break, the U.S. lost to South Korea 2-0 before beating Japan's rotated team 2-0 for some momentum entering October, which will feature friendlies against Ecuador and Australia. Head coach Mauricio Pochettino received criticism for the squad he called up last month, but will have some key names in Antonee Robinson and Tanner Tessman available this time. Tyler Adams, Yunus Musah, Johnny Cardoso and Sergino Dest are among some notable omissions. Create a free account with NBC 5 DFW to save articles and videos. First up will be a friendly against Ecuador, which is ranked No. Here's what to know about the upcoming friendly: The U.S. and Ecuador will meet on Friday, Oct. 10. The game will be broadcast in English on TNT and truTV. NBC's Universo will carry the game in Spanish. The game will be available to stream in English on HBO Max. 🫡26 players have been called into camp for upcoming matches against Ecuador and Australia! La Tri has a strong roster of its own, but will be without Chelsea star defensive midfielder Moises Caicedo, while Arsenal left-back/center-back hybrid Piero Hincapie is nursing a groin injury. Still, the team has veteran striker Enner Valencia, while Willian Pacho, Pervis Estupinian and Joel Ordonez form a robust and underrated backline that will cause the U.S. problems. 🇪🇨 Es el orgullo de estar junto a La Tri 🇪🇨📋 Con @PilsenerEcuador presentamos nuestra convocatoria para los amistosos de octubre.#LaTriNosUne 🇪🇨 | #LoNuestroEsPaArriba 🍺 pic.twitter.com/YTsBfikhee</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>France and Switzerland edged closer to World Cup qualification while Northern Ireland significantly improved their hopes John Brewin will be here tomorrow for another World Cup qualifying clockwatch. A selection of friendly scores from around the world today: Japan* 2-2 Paraguay* South Korea* 0-5 Brazil* Uruguay* 1-0 Dominican Republic Jordan* 0-1 Bolivia Russia 2-1 Iran* *nations that have qualified for the World Cup European champions Spain are in action tomorrow against Georgia (7.45pm BST). Sid Lowe has been speaking to Martín Zubimendi about Rodri, Arteta and settling in at Arsenal: There are still 28 places up for grabs at next summer's World Cup. His goal to make it 2-0 against Slovakia was a delightful lob over a stranded Martin Dubravka: “I flicked the ball, the keeper has come to clear it, and I just had to guide it towards the goal and thankfully I did.” He was full of praise for his “outstanding” captain, Conor Bradley, who will miss Monday's game against Germany through suspension. Kári Tulinius, who had emailed to express his delight after Iceland made it 3-3 against Ukraine, reflects on what was eventually a 5-3 defeat: Oh well, I guess Iceland will just have to pick themselves up again and *checks notes* beat France in the next game. Well, hope was nice while it lasted, I guess. North Macedonia will be thrilled with shutting out Belgium tonight. They lead Group J on 12pts ahead of Belgium (11pts), Wales (10pts), Kazakhstan (6pts) and Liechtenstein (0pts). France are firmly in control of Group D. They lead on 9pts, with Ukraine (4pts) leapfrogging Iceland (3pts) after their ding-dong battle. The best Sweden can hope for now is probably a playoff spot. Switzerland (9pts) are clear at the top ahead of Kosovo (4pts) and Slovenia (2pts). Germany, Northern Ireland and Slovakia, then, all locked on six points at the top of Group A. They are all taking points off each other too. France 3-0 Azerbaijan, Germany 4-0 Luxembourg and Belgium 0-0 North Macedonia are finished. Johan Manzambi finishes off Sweden tonight and perhaps their hopes of qualifying for the World Cup. Iceland had come back from 3-1 down to level it but Ivan Kaliuzhnyi gives Ukraine the lead once more. The former Newcastle winger – now at Lens – scores his first international goal, and an acrobatic one at that, since 2019 to seal the points for France! Could that be a clincher for Northern Ireland? Albert Gudmundsson has his second and Iceland's third. Conor Bradley is looking miffed at being shown a yellow card for bumping into Lukas Haraslin. The Northern Ireland captain will now miss Monday's visit of Germany through suspension, so no wonder. Group J Belgium 0-0 North Macedonia Kazakhstan 4-0 Liechtenstein (FT) Slovakia rue a missed chance at Windsor Park. Granit Xhaka converts from the spot after Alexander Bernhardsson was penalised for a foul on Djibril Sow in the area. Albert Gudmundsson pulls a goal back for the hosts, who need one more to stop their opponents overtaking them in the group. Joshua Kimmich gets his second of the game as he reacts first to a loose ball from a Germany corner. Jamie Reid threatens again for Northern Ireland but Slovakia manage to get close to him before he can get a shot away. Belgium will have wondered how they went into the break at 0-0 against North Macedonia having had 82% possession and 12 shots at goal. A very important half of football for Northern Ireland in particular. Anders Stephanson has more news about a “truly remarkable sitter” in Stockholm: Bergvall served by Isak (who in turn was served by Gyökeres), open goal from about 3 feet and he stepped on the ball. It's stalemate at the break in Stockholm where Sweden host Switzerland. Alexander Isak has hit the post for the hosts but his partnership with Viktor Gyökeres is yet to produce a goal. Half-time reading for you comes from Nick Ames, who is in Oslo ahead of tomorrow's World Cup qualifier between Norway and Israel. Here's how it looks across Europe at the break. Group J Belgium 0-0 North Macedonia Kazakhstan 4-0 Liechtenstein (FT) Five minutes of first-half stoppage time yield a third Ukraine goal. On the stroke of half-time, France are ahead. Ukraine regain the lead in Reykjavik through Oleksiy Gutsulyak. They are yet to register a shot against France but it's still 0-0. The ball eventually falls to Jamie Reid but he can only prod over. Iceland level it against Ukraine through Genoa's Mikael Egill Ellertsson. Conor Bradley is then on the end of some rough treatment from Slovakia's Leo Sauer. Northern Ireland's Justin Devenny has a shot saved at his near post by Martin Dubravka. France are yet to make the breakthrough against Azerbaijan. They've had 72% possession, 10 shots and four corners so far. Northern Ireland, Slovakia and Germany all locked on 6pts in Group A as it stands.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Steve Nicol shows empathy for Rasmus Hojlund and says he was unfairly criticized during his time at Man United. Nigeria's Super Eagles go into their final match window of the 2026 FIFA World Cup qualifying group stage promising to fight to the end as they hope to take advantage of any slip-up by South Africa and Benin. But their bullish attitude has not yet panned out on the pitch, and the three-time African champions need more than words. Forward Terem Moffi believes the Super Eagles will qualify for the World Cup, saying "we are really confident things will go our way" in a video published by the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF). But it is uncertain where he derives that confidence given the team's abysmal play and disastrous results in this qualifying campaign, especially with their fate no longer in their own hands. The Super Eagles need both South Africa and Benin to drop points to open the door for a Nigerian miracle. Group C's top four teams each have a chance of claiming the sole ticket to the World Cup, if they can win their final two games, although Bafana Bafana are best placed with both their fixtures being played in South Africa. South Africa face neighbours Zimbabwe, who are bottom of the group with no hope of qualifying, before hosting Rwanda in their final qualifier. For the Super Eagles, a win against Lesotho on Friday is all but non-negotiable before they host group leaders Benin in Uyo on Tuesday. Captain William Troost-Ekong is optimistic the team's belief and fight will carry them through. "We are always going to fight till the end," he said in an NFF-released video. Few Nigerians share that confidence, however, even after the Super Eagles were handed a lifeline when South Africa were docked three points and three goals by FIFA for fielding the ineligible Teboho Mokoena in their 2-0 win over Lesotho in March. Eritrea's withdrawal means teams vying for second place in the other groups will lose their points won against the bottom teams; Nigeria will lose only two points. Fulham defender Calvin Bassey says the Super Eagles must remain calm and call on their experience. "This is not the first time, club or country, any of us have been in high-pressure moments. So we've got an experienced team to handle this situation, and its just about doing everything right." There was a time when this bullish attitude would have been reassuring for Nigerian football fans, but the statement begs the question of where was that calmness and experience when the team was gifting points home and away in the previous games. Complicating matters for Nigeria coach Éric Sékou Chelle is the absence of wing-back Ola Aina, injured on an atrocious pitch in the clash with South Africa at Toyota Stadium, Bloemfontein, in September. Fellow defender Bright Osayi-Samuel, midfielder Raphael Onyedika, and forward Cyriel Dessers are also out injured. On the plus side, Chelle has two of Africa's best players in the past two years, Victor Osimhen and Ademola Lookman, to call upon. Osimhen, who was injured and missed the Bafana fixture after being hacked by a Rwanda defender in Uyo days earlier, returns bringing fire and hopefully goals to Nigeria. Victory against the Crocodiles at the new Peter Mokaba Stadium in the South African city of Polokwane on Friday will not provide redemption, but it will at least keep their fighting chances alive. The forward is a constant target of defenders, and he was savagely scythed in the game against Rwanda in September. If there is a misfire, Chelle should not hesitate to put the likes of Tolu Arokodare into the mix. Chelle has to make a decision on Troost-Ekong. Does he trust his captain to bounce back from the errors that have plagued him through these qualifiers, and thrust him back into the starting lineup? Or does he go with the starting XI that defeated Rwanda? Surely, that cannot be too much to ask.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>October 10 – FIFA president Gianni Infantino wants Europe's clubs us to keep an “open mind”, suggesting that the World Cup could be moved from its traditional summer slot to March or October – so football can “be better for everyone”. The issue here is that football will not be better for everyone and in fact will be significantly worse for 95%+ of Europe's clubs and all of its leagues. It won't be good for its leading players either who are already struggling with increased workload. With Infantino's increased competition sizes, and his move into the club game with the expanded 32-team Club World Cup (which he now wants to increase to 48 teams and hold every two years), the bulk of Europe's professional players who are not competing in these competitions also face potentially disastrous consequences. Fracturing the infrastructure of the European game will inevitably threaten their jobs as clubs and leagues battle to retain sponsors and schedules in the face of an aggressive FIFA who want to hoover up everyone's financial lunch. Infantino claims that they are calendar is impossible but essentially his message to Europe and its clubs on the sidelines of the European Football Club meeting in Rome is to expect more disruption to your calendars more often. Everywhere in the world they look at European football clubs. We will develop [football] here in Europe — coming from Rome to the entire world.” FIFA's concept of unity, an open mind and transparent debate is different to others, especially Europe's stakeholders where FIFA has refused to engage or invite either players' union FIFPRO or the European Leagues Association to the discussion table – though one suspects there is very little discussion in any case. If the schedule becomes bi-annual, Qatar are most people's front runners for 2031 which will again necessitate a move from summer. Last summer, the United States hosted an expanded 32-team Club World Cup during a heatwave that saw temperatures in New York reach 39°C. Players complained, protests piled in from player unions, managers and clubs but the tournament went full-steam ahead with Infantino later calling it “a huge success from every possible angle.” “Every possible angle,” of course, except the human one. Infantino points to the Uefa Champions League's growth from €40 million in its early years to a robust and growing €4 billion today as a model. In essence, the clubs are funding FIFA's World Cup finance fest, something Infantino refuses to acknowledge as he chases more and more money with very little thought for the top players without whom the World Cup would be a nonsense. Unlike FIFA's Congress where national federations generally sleepwalk their way through Infantino and FIFA's agenda as they count the promises of money made for the next year, the club's are different beasts with leaders who are not so complaint or easily bullied. However, Infantino knows that in their leader, PSG's Qatari chairman Nasser Al-Khelaifi, he has someone who, as their bromance grows without boundaries, will likely do what it takes to deliver the clubs to accept his calendar requirements.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>AUSTIN, Texas — Whatever happens in Friday night's difficult World Cup preparation game against Ecuador, U.S. coach Mauricio Pochettino is certain of one thing. "I promise you, no one is sure that he is going to be on the roster of the World Cup 2026," Pochettino said Thursday during his pre-match press conference. "I don't believe before that was the [case]. In short, he has forced the American players out of their comfort zone. It has also been a steep learning curve for Pochettino, who repeated on Friday that the USMNT shocking losses to that same Canaleros squad and fellow World Cup co-hosts Canada served as a "wake-up call" for him and his staff. Now, after leaving Juventus midfielder Weston McKennie off of his September roster and omitting Yunus Musah — another 2022 World Cup starter — from the current one, he feels the proper tone has been set. Whether he has them all at his disposal against Ecuador is another matter. Pochettino revealed on the eve of the exhibition that star man Christian Pulisic didn't train on Thursday and might not be available. Same for left back Antonee "Jedi" Robinson and winger Alex Zendejas, who scored the game-winning goal in the Americans' most recent test, a 2-0 win over Japan last month. All are nursing minor injuries and could be rested for Tuesday's meeting with Australia in Commerce City, Colo., the second of this month's two tune-ups. Ecuador won't be at full strength, either. After qualifying for the 2026 World Cup with ease, finishing second in South America behind only defending world champs Argentina following that continent's 18-match marathon, La Tricolor boss Sebastián Beccacece left several usual starters with their clubs this month, most notably Chelsea standout Moises Caicedo, possibly the best defensive midfielder on all of planet fútbol. But other stars, like Pulisic's AC Milan teammate Pervis Estupinan and PSG defender Willian Pacho are here. Just facing a South American foe will be different. The full-strength U.S. hasn't done that since being eliminated from the 2024 Copa América by Uruguay, two months before Pochettino was hired to succeed Gregg Berhalter. "They're also a team that's very aggressive," defender Chris Richards said. An ideal opponent, then, for a U.S. squad with World Cup roster spots on the line, one that hasn't swept a two-match international window since beating Jamaica home and away in the Concacaf Nations League quarterfinals last November. That goes for both the USMNT and those hoping to be still be on it on the biggest stage of all. "For sure the players that are going to play" against Ecuador, Pochettino said, "Are going to perform."
