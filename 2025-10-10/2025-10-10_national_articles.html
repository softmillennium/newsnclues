                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Russell Vought, Office of Management and Budget director, listens as he addresses members of the media outside the West Wing at the White House in Washington, Monday, Sept. 29, 2025, in Washington. ▶ Follow live updates on President Donald Trump and his administration WASHINGTON (AP) — The White House budget office said Friday that mass firings of federal workers have started, an attempt by President Donald Trump's administration to exert more pressure on Democratic lawmakers as the government shutdown dragged into a 10th day. Employees at the departments of Education, Treasury, Homeland Security and Health and Human Services, as well as the Environmental Protection Agency, were set to receive the notices, according to spokespeople for the agencies and union representatives for federal workers. The aggressive move by Trump's budget office goes far beyond what usually happens in a government shutdown and escalates an already politically toxic dynamic between the White House and Congress. Talks to end the shutdown are almost nonexistent. Typically, federal workers are furloughed but restored to their jobs once the shutdown ends, traditionally with back pay. Some 750,000 employees are expected to be furloughed during the shutdown, officials have said. Some leading Republicans were highly critical of the administration's actions. “I strongly oppose OMB Director Russ Vought's attempt to permanently lay off federal workers who have been furloughed due to a completely unnecessary government shutdown,” said Maine Sen. Susan Collins, the chair of the powerful Senate Appropriations Committee, who blamed the federal closure on Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski called the announcement “poorly timed” and “yet another example of this administration's punitive actions toward the federal workforce.” She urged affected Alaskans to reach out to her office. “Let's be blunt: nobody's forcing Trump and Vought to do this,” Schumer said. They're callously choosing to hurt people — the workers who protect our country, inspect our food, respond when disasters strike. The White House had previewed its tactics shortly before the government shutdown began on Oct. 1, telling all federal agencies to submit their reduction-in-force plans to the budget office for its review. It said reduction-in-force plans could apply to federal programs whose funding would lapse in a government shutdown, are otherwise not funded and are “not consistent with the President's priorities.” Notices of firings have also taken place at the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, which leads federal efforts to reduce risk to the nation's cyber and physical infrastructure, according to the Department of Homeland Security, where CISA is housed. Federal health workers were also being fired, though a Department of Health and Human Services spokesman did not say how many or which agencies were being hit hardest. An official for the American Federation of Government Employees, which represents federal workers and is suing the Trump administration over the firings, said in a legal filing Friday that the Treasury Department is set to issue layoff notices to 1,300 employees. “It is disgraceful that the Trump administration has used the government shutdown as an excuse to illegally fire thousands of workers who provide critical services to communities across the country,” AFGE President Everett Kelley said in a statement. But Trump signaled earlier this week that job cuts could be coming in “four or five days.” “If this keeps going on, it'll be substantial, and a lot of those jobs will never come back,” he said Tuesday in the Oval Office as he met with Canada's prime minister, Mark Carney. Some Republicans on Capitol Hill have suggested that Vought's threats of mass layoffs have been unhelpful to bipartisan talks on the funding standoff. And the top Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Committee, Sen. Patty Murray of Washington, said in a statement that the “shutdown does not give Trump or Vought new, special powers” to lay off workers. “This is nothing new, and no one should be intimidated by these crooks,” she added. Still, there was no sign that the top Democratic and Republican Senate leaders were even talking about a way to solve the impasse. The Partnership for Public Service, a nonpartisan organization that tracks federal service, says more than 200,000 civil servants have left since the start of this administration in January due to earlier firings, retirements and deferred resignation offers. “These unnecessary and misguided reductions in force will further hollow out our federal government, rob it of critical expertise and hobble its capacity to effectively serve the public,” said the organization's president and CEO, Max Stier.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A powerful blast ripped through a military explosives manufacturing plant in rural Tennessee on Friday morning, rattling homes miles away and bringing emergency responders to the scene, authorities and residents said. Smoke fills the air as debris covers the ground and vehicles after a powerful blast ripped through a military explosives manufacturing plant in Hickman County, Tenn., on Friday, Oct. 10, 2025. An explosives plant in rural Tennessee rocked by an explosion Friday that authorities said left 19 people missing and feared dead is owned by a company that processes explosives for the military, according to the company's website. The explosion at Accurate Energetic Systems' flattened a building on its 1,300-acre campus and shook houses miles away. Rescuers had to keep their distance for hours due to burning debris and risk of secondary blasts. The smoldering wreck could be seen in aerial footage by WTVF-TV, black smoke billowing up. It's gone,” said an emotional Chris Davis, the Humphreys County Sheriff. He said multiple people were killed but declined to say how many, referring to the 19 missing as “souls.” Officials were still speaking to family members, some of whom had gathered at the plant. Its facility has some eight buildings on a wooded hill near the town Bucksnort, some 60 miles (97 kilometers) southwest of Nashville. Accurate Energetic Systems' executives did not immediately respond to emails seeking comment Friday, and a call to the company's phone was not answered. The company sells explosive products for use ranging from structural demolition to strategic defense operations, according to its website. Public records show that Accurate Energetic Systems has been awarded numerous military contracts going back years to process different types of munitions and explosives. The contracts, which were awarded largely by the U.S. Army and Navy, were for a variety of products that ranged from bulk explosives to landmines and small breaching charges, including C4. The company also uses the sprawling campus to test explosives, according to its website, measuring the velocity as well as impact on surrounding areas under different conditions. The website noted that it “rigorously adheres to the stringent security standards” of Defense Department security and safety protocols.

American Principles Project President Terry Schilling praises President Donald Trump's performance in his second term while stressing that he should be nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize. Russian President Vladimir Putin praised President Donald Trump's efforts to negotiate peace deals around the world, specifically citing his work brokering a truce between Israel and Hamas. "He's really doing a lot to resolve such complex crises that have lasted for years and even decades," Putin said at a summit in Dushanbe, Tajikistan, where he met with leaders of nations once part of the former Soviet Union. The remarks came in response to a question about whether he felt Trump had been passed over for the Nobel Peace Prize. On Friday, Putin praised Trump's peacemaking efforts despite him not winning the Nobel Peace Prize. The award was given Friday morning to Venezuelan opposition leader and democracy activist María Corina Machado. "There have been cases where the committee has awarded the Nobel Peace Prize to people who have done nothing for peace," Putin said. "A person comes — good or bad — and [gets it] in a month, in two months — boom. He didn't do anything at all. "In my view, these decisions have done enormous damage to the prestige of this prize," he continued. In September, Trump alluded to the likelihood that he would again be passed over for the Nobel Prize despite helping to end several conflicts. That's pretty good," Trump said during remarks to dozens of top generals and admirals in Quantico, Virginia.

"They'll give it to the guy who wrote a book about the mind of Donald Trump and what it took to solve the wars. The Nobel Prize will go to a writer." Louis Casiano is a reporter for Fox News Digital.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump speaks during a cabinet meeting at the White House, Thursday, Oct. 9, 2025, in Washington. A federal judge ruled Friday that the Trump administration cannot put conditions on grants that fund efforts to combat domestic violence, including barring groups from promoting diversity, equity and inclusion or providing abortion resources. U.S. District Court Judge Melissa DuBose in Providence, Rhode Island, granted a motion by 17 statewide anti-domestic and sexual violence coalitions for a preliminary injunction, which blocks the Trump administration from enforcing its conditions while the lawsuit plays out. “Without preliminary relief, the Plaintiffs will face irreparable harm that will disrupt vital services to victims of homelessness and domestic and sexual violence,” DuBose wrote in her ruling. “On the contrary, if preliminary relief is granted, the Defendants will merely need to revert back to considering grant applications and awarding funds as they normally would.” DuBose, however, went further in the scope of her ruling. “Organizations serving survivors of domestic violence and sexual assault, LGBTQ+ youth, and people experiencing homelessness should not be forced to abandon their work, erase the identities of those they serve, or compromise their values just to keep their doors open,” Skye Perryman, president and CEO of Democracy Forward, which was one of the groups representing plaintiffs, said in a statement. “When this administration claims to be targeting ‘illegal DEI' and ‘gender ideology,' what it is really trying to do is strip life-saving services from survivors of sexual violence and domestic violence, LGBTQ+ youth, and people without homes,” Martin said. Neither HUD nor HHS responded to a request for comment. If they don't apply for federal money allocated under the Violence Against Women Act of 1994, they might not be able to provide rape crisis centers, battered women's shelters and other programs to support victims of domestic violence and sexual assault. They also argue that the conditions violate the Administrative Procedure Act by exceeding defendants' authority by “in some cases outright conflicting with governing law or failing to follow required procedure.” “Both agencies have long required compliance with federal antidiscrimination law as a condition of receiving a federal grant,” the government wrote in court documents. Another Rhode Island judge granted a preliminary injunction in August involving some of the same groups in a lawsuit against the Justice Department.</p>

Colin Cowherd asks what went wrong for the Eagles and whether Jaxson Dart is the Giants' franchise QB. The third start of rookie quarterback Jaxson Dart's career was undoubtedly his best.

(Kevin Sabitus/Getty Images) "If you've ever been on an NFL sideline, there's a lot of emotions," Daboll said after the game. And I certainly am an emotional guy. I apologized directly to our team physician. I just wanted his a-- out there if he was OK. "But I wanted the process — like, we were getting ready to go for it on a potential fourth down. So, I was asking how long is it gonna take?" Giants President and CEO John Mara said he had a conversation with Daboll about his actions during the game.

While I firmly believe, as he has stated, that he was not trying to influence the process in any way, he understands the appearance of going to the tent is inappropriate," Mara said in a statement. Daboll said he respects the medical staff and reiterated his apology. "So, again, you want your guy out there, not at risk of anything else. ‘I think he's gonna be good.' I'm like, ‘Is he gonna be good or not? The Giants have won two of their past three games. Meanwhile, the Eagles have dropped two straight.

Phoenix Sky Harbor International airport will not have the normal number of staff in its control tower from 9 p.m. to 1 a.m. Two separate parts of the Albuquerque Air Route Traffic Control Center, that manages flights over a large portion of the Southwest, is understaffed until 3 p.m. The Central Florida TRACON, where controllers guide planes approaching or departing Orlando International Airport, will be short-staffed from 7 p.m. Two different FAA operations that deal with traffic at Newark Liberty International Airport reported staffing problems earlier Friday. Not all staffing problems cause delays, as controllers can sometimes route planes to other airspace with more workers, but there are times slowing flights so a reduced number of staff can manage them is the only way to make everyone is safe. The reasons for the short staffing are not clear, but Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said Thursday a “small fraction” of controllers were “lashing out” because of the government shutdown and not going to work. Air traffic controllers, along with Transportation Security Administration officers, are considered essential employees and have to work during the shutdown, despite not being currently paid. Twelve FAA facilities saw staffing shortages Thursday, including airport towers, approach controls which handle arriving and departing flights as well as centers that handle flights en route. “It is safe to fly, but ATC staffing shortages strain the system and cause flights to be spaced out, slowing down everything. “The bottom line is that anyone heading to the airport right now is encouraged to pack their patience,” Airlines for America added. The “safety and efficiency” of air travel in the United States depends on unpaid air traffic controllers showing up to work, the FAA administrator said in a memo to employees on Friday morning. “To the entire FAA team, both those continuing operations and those currently furloughed, thank you for your professionalism and resilience,” FAA Administrator Bryan Bedford said in the email. “Your efforts to keep thousands of flights operating safely each day are noticed and deeply appreciated.” On Thursday Duffy noted more than half of air traffic delays are now being caused by staffing shortages, as opposed to only 5% earlier this year. “As Secretary Duffy has said, staffing shortages have increased across the country. When staffing constraints occur, we will reduce the flow of air traffic into affected airports and centers to maintain safe operations,” Bedford said. “We will get through this together and continue delivering for the American people.” On Tuesday, air traffic controllers will receive a partial paycheck for hours worked before the shutdown. Duffy said on Thursday he will not allow air traffic controllers to use their position as a “bludgeon” for political purposes, including calling out sick during the government shutdown. There has been a shortage of air traffic controllers for years, so even a small number of unscheduled absences can lead to delayed flights “When we have small sick outs, if you will, it has massive impacts on the airspace,” the secretary said in an interview with CNN partner Scripps News. “We can't be held hostage, anywhere in government or in our lives, with people who are going to use their positions as a bludgeon.” But if they're not showing up to work, and they're calling out for other reasons, and it's coordinated and they collaborate on it, I don't want those people working in air traffic,” he said. I don't like it, and so I'm willing to make changes that are necessary so that doesn't happen again in the future.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“The RIFs have begun,” Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought posted on X, announcing the government-wide reductions in force that have been anticipated since federal funding lapsed on October 1. It was not immediately clear how many federal workers had received RIF – or reduction in force – notices, but an OMB spokesperson said the layoffs would be “substantial.” While the White House has repeatedly placed blame on congressional Democrats for not reopening the government, it is initiating layoffs during this shutdown by choice – administrations are not required to carry out firings when government funding lapses. Democrats on Capitol Hill swiftly criticized the move. “Once again: if President Trump & Russ Vought decide to do more mass firings, they are CHOOSING to inflict more pain on people. Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer also argued that “nobody's forcing Trump and Vought to do this. But several agencies told CNN that they had started conducting the reductions. “HHS employees across multiple divisions have received reduction-in-force notices as a direct consequence of the Democrat-led government shutdown,” an agency spokesperson told CNN. “All HHS employees receiving reduction-in-force notices were designated non-essential by their respective divisions. HHS continues to close wasteful and duplicative entities, including those that are at odds with the Trump administration's Make America Healthy Again agenda.” Friday's announcement came on day 10 of the shutdown. The White House said furloughed employees can use government-issued equipment for purposes related to a shutdown, which include “checking for any Reduction in Force (RIF) updates.” Agencies must inform employees affected by a RIF at least 60 days before their termination date. “In AFGE's 93 years of existence under several presidential administrations – including during Trump's first term – no president has ever decided to fire thousands of furloughed workers during a government shutdown,” Everett Kelley, the union's national president, said in a statement. AFGE, along with another union representing federal workers, filed a lawsuit in a California federal court seeking to stop the Trump administration from initiating the mass layoffs, calling them illegal. “We will see you in court,” Skye Perryman, CEO of Democracy Forward, which is representing the unions, posted on X in response to Vought's post. Illston has not ruled on the requests but earlier this week ordered OMB to provide the status of RIF notices that are planned or in progress by 6 p.m. The judge also asked for information on which agencies would issue layoff notices and how many employees would receive them. “There is no extra legal authority on their part to conduct RIFs on the basis of a shutdown,” he said Tuesday. In a statement Friday, Stier criticized the Trump administration for using “civil servants as hostages in this ongoing breakdown of our public institutions.” “These unnecessary and misguided reductions in force will further hollow out our federal government, rob it of critical expertise and hobble its capacity to effectively serve the public,” he said. The Trump administration has been planning for – and at some agencies, already conducting – widespread reductions in force since soon after the president took office. More than 2 million people work for the federal government. As of September 23, more than 201,000 civil servants had left federal service, according to the Partnership's tracker. In February, Trump signed an executive order telling department officials to begin preparations for sweeping layoffs. The OMB and Office of Personnel Management followed up with a memo instructing agencies to submit two-part plans to carry out the reorganization – including submitting lists of agency divisions and employees performing functions not mandated by law or regulation who are not considered essential employees during government shutdowns. Federal employee unions sued, but in July, the Supreme Court allowed agencies to proceed with their RIF plans, putting on hold a lower court order that had temporarily blocked Trump from taking those steps without approval from Congress. Some agencies, including HHS, have already laid off sizeable portions of their staff, while others walked back some of their plans.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump slapped China with a 100% tariff increase starting Nov. 1 on imports “over and above any tariff that they are currently paying” in an escalation of a trade war. Trump slammed China's recent imposition of tougher export controls on rare earth minerals, set to take effect in December, in an apparent effort to gain a negotiating advantage over the Trump administration. “Some very strange things are happening in China!” Trump posted. “They are becoming very hostile, and sending letters to Countries throughout the World, that they want to impose Export Controls on each and every element of production having to do with Rare Earths, and virtually anything else they can think of, even if it's not manufactured in China. Our relationship with China over the past six months has been a very good one, thereby making this move on Trade an even more surprising one. There is no way that China should be allowed to hold the World ‘captive,' but that seems to have been their plan for quite some time.” As for canceling the meeting, Trump added that he has “not spoken to President Xi because there was no reason to do so.” White House officials did not say whether Trump's comments meant the meeting was off or simply a threat that he might skip out on the planned event. Trump also said China's decision to alert trading partners of the new trade restrictions was “especially inappropriate,” as Beijing announced them amid the Trump administration's efforts to advance a ceasefire in Gaza. “Dependent on what China says about the hostile ‘order' that they have just put out, I will be forced, as President of the United States of America, to financially counter their move,” Trump concluded.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>First lady Melania Trump said Friday that Russia has allowed eight Ukrainian children to reunite with their parents, following months of private discussions between Russian officials and the first lady's office centered on children separated from their families during the war. The first lady revealed that she and Russian President Vladimir Putin have had an “open channel” of communication since she wrote him a letter in August about the impact of the war in Ukraine on kids. She said the eight children were all returned to their families over the last 24 hours, with a commitment that the two sides will continue to work toward reunifying additional children displaced as part of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. “This remains an ongoing effort,” Melania Trump said in a brief speech at the White House. “Plans are already underway to reunify more children in the immediate future. The group produced reports on a slew of alleged Russian war crimes, including the extent of Moscow's efforts to relocate, re-educate, and sometimes militarily train or forcibly adopt out Ukrainian children. Privately influential but publicly absent, Melania Trump is picking and choosing her moments this term Their database included the information and identities of over 30,000 Ukrainian children who were allegedly abducted by Russia across 100 locations, according to a source familiar with the data. Researchers have lost access to evidence of alleged Russian war crimes following Trump admin funding cut The Yale Humanitarian Research Lab has raised enough money through private donations to continue their work until January 1, their executive director said, but they don't know what will happen after that. President Donald Trump hand-delivered a “peace” letter on behalf of the first lady to Putin in August. “Since then, President Putin and I have had an open channel of communication regarding the welfare of these children,” Melania Trump said. “We have agreed to cooperate with each other for the benefit of all people involved in this war.” She added that she's also pressed the country over those Ukrainians who were minors when the war started, but are now adults and still residing in Russia. Russian officials have agreed to work toward rejoining those adults in the near future, Melania Trump said. “My ongoing mission is twofold: To optimize a transparent free-flow exchange of health-related information surrounding all children who have (fallen) victim to this war,” Trump said, “and to facilitate the regular reunification of children with their families until each individual returns home.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? Yet Lindsay Halligan, the US attorney who brought that indictment, seems unbothered. Indeed, she very quickly moved on to the next task at hand: getting New York Attorney General Letitia James indicted for similarly dubious charges, which she accomplished Thursday. Meanwhile, White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller is heading a sweeping effort that he hopes will get leading Democratic groups and donors indicted for supporting purported “left-wing terrorism.” This seems similarly unlikely to stick in court. Watching all this unfold — the weaponization of the US Justice Department, in efforts that mostly seem groundless or doomed — I've recalled a phrase Steve Bannon coined during President Donald Trump's first term. They are going to bring one bogus investigation and prosecution after another. (There is already talk in MAGA-land of what else Comey could be charged with, and a separate US attorney's office is looking into James on other topics.) The main point is not really to win convictions. Trump's team would of course love that, but if they wanted to build cases that would actually hold up in court, they'd be going about things very differently. Often, these targets have been people who were involved in investigations of Trump, like Comey and James — the first two indicted. Sen. Adam Schiff (D-CA) has been targeted with a mortgage investigation. Former CIA director John Brennan and former FBI director Chris Wray are also targets, as is Fulton County district attorney Fani Willis. To go after these targets, Trump's allies have rummaged through their mortgage records or past congressional testimony in hopes of finding something that prosecutors can argue was a false statement or crime. Trump's justification would be: “They did it to me first.” He'd say this is simply what he and his allies have gone through for the past decade: repeated investigations during his first term, and eventually, four prosecutions during the Biden years, a legal saga that only came to an end when he won in 2024. Some of Trump's complaints are specious — he was prosecuted for trying to steal the 2020 election, something he really did do — but others have at least a grain of truth to them. Elected Democratic prosecutors in New York state did indeed spend years digging through his business history in search of any charges that could stick to him or his family. Miller has been furious for months about protests of the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents who are carrying out the mass deportation campaign that is his brainchild. But after Charlie Kirk's killing last month, he began putting together a multi-agency effort to go after the funding and organization of the left. According to a report from Reuters, Miller's effort is looking at protests where violence or vandalism occurred in hopes of accusing groups that supported or encouraged these protests of fomenting left-wing terrorism in some illegal way or another. “We need to use our anti-terrorism laws, our RICO [racketeering] statutes, our conspiracy statutes — we need to use every tool in our law enforcement arsenal to crush these left-wing terrorists legally, financially, and politically, and to cut off their funding sources, and throw them in prison,” Mike Davis, a legal activist close to the Trump administration, told Rolling Stone. A high-level Department of Justice official reportedly instructed US attorney's offices to investigate the network late last month. “Trump is going after boilerplate liberal nonprofits,” the leftist commentator Adam Johnson posted on X. “This isn't even a war on the left, it's a war on the left AND mainline democrats because republicans want to run without meaningful opposition in 2026 and 2028.” The problem for both Trump and Miller, and the silver lining for their targets, is that, so far, these cases seem extremely weak. The Comey and James indictments appear deeply flawed, and it will be quite a reach to link progressive groups or donors to actual violence, particularly without running afoul of the First Amendment. Most of these prosecutions appear likely to collapse, either at trial or before. (Though it's not necessarily clear that all of them will. Perhaps some could be brought in red jurisdictions and draw MAGA-aligned judges like Aileen Cannon.) Over the past decade, MAGA enforcers and foot soldiers have gotten quite good at concocting creative logical chains and legal theories to argue that their enemies are guilty of crimes. Trump's appointees can simply bring bogus charges against them on other topics, ensuring their legal nightmare won't end, at least until he leaves office. The NYC mayoral candidate's new proposal spotlights a flaw in progressive thought. The answer isn't just about parties dividing on policies.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In a time of noise, confusion, and spin, we're committed to clarity, truth, and depth — even when it's hard. We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? I'm not talking about potentially risky biodefense lab research, but something that doesn't yet exist: mirror life. Here's a refresher on normal biology: the cells in our bodies are composed of the building blocks of life. Nucleotides and sugars make up our DNA, which provides the blueprint for cells and codes for proteins that carry out key biological functions. In all of life, these biomolecules have a specific “handedness.” (Bear with me here.) We listen to the A-side, with genetic material made from right-handed nucleotides and proteins composed of left-handed amino acids. Natural life has evolved to only use this configuration. These biomolecules are chiral: they can't be superimposed on their mirror images. As my former colleague Kelsey Piper explained back in January, mirror life could represent a whole new way that the world could end. We're at least decades away from being able to create entire mirror cells — that includes bacteria. With the power of chemistry, researchers have created mirror proteins. This distinction is really important, and not only because I'm being pedantic. A paper published in Science last year made dramatic headlines after its authors laid out potential catastrophic risks of mirror life. Such risks include the possibility that mirror bacteria would evade our immune systems and lack natural predators, replicating to the point that they threaten to outcompete normal life. The authors concluded that “in the absence of compelling evidence for reassurance, our view is that mirror bacteria and other mirror organisms should not be created.” Well, only if we accept that those are the risks. Something that's gotten a bit lost in the noise of media coverage is that the 35+ authors — who hail from fields as diverse as ecology, immunology, and synthetic biology — want mirror biomolecule research to continue. Nearly everyone agrees on that, because mirror biomolecules can offer immense benefits for developing new therapeutics, diagnostics, and studying the biochemistry of life without making new life itself. But first, let's get into why the idea of mirror life is so frightening. “Mirror molecules are safe to make, because unlike mirror bacteria, the molecules don't replicate, so they don't pose any risks of spreading uncontrollably,” Adamala told me over email. One of her chief concerns is that normal cells may be unable to recognize mirror cells, because many of our immune mechanisms are based on chirality, or handedness. This could allow mirror cells to “grow unrestrained by the immune system and environmental predators” that keep normal cells in check. “It's hard to overstate how severe these risks could be,” Ruslan Medzhitov, an immunologist at Yale University and one of the paper's co-authors, told Science News. “If mirror bacteria were to spread through infected animals and plants, much of the planet's many environments could be contaminated. …Any exposure to contaminated dust or soil could be fatal.” Effective biocontainment, the researchers argue, would be incredibly difficult. That said, mirror life could offer real benefits. Mirror therapeutics, which wouldn't be recognized by our digestive enzymes, have the potential to last a lot longer in our bodies, opening up new possibilities for the treatment of chronic disease. Mirror bacteria could do this for us, and at a much greater speed, allowing us to produce mirror therapeutics en masse. The declarations of a scientific consensus around mirror life may be premature, but a growing number of voices are getting involved in discussions on the possibility. I want to make it very clear that right now, mirror life is only a possibility. And it might be more distant than we think. David Perrin, a synthetic chemist at the University of British Columbia, told me over email that science is nowhere close to creating a living mirror cell. He is also skeptical that mirror bacteria would be toxic to normal life, and believes our immune systems would likely be able to neutralize them after all. Immune responses are complex, and not all rely on handedness. By creating a second tree of life, we might create a second evolutionary arms race, with mirror life on the losing side. Or not — evolution is a funny thing — but at this point there's no way to know for sure. Trying to shut down work on creating mirror life “makes no sense. …What would have happened if we put a total moratorium on researching radioactivity? And we wouldn't have any radioactive treatments for cancer.” He thinks that red lines can be drawn — when people come closer to actually generating mirror life. Gigi Gronvall, an immunologist and senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, and biosecurity expert at Johns Hopkins University, told Science News that the paper's concerns were very theoretical. But this research could be purely computational, allowing us to assess the nature of potential threats without posing real biological risks. Creating mirror life could help us understand the origins of life and why it evolved in the direction that it did. This is completely new territory, and it might not remain the stuff of science fiction forever. But there is a debate to be had, and more evidence may emerge. I'm glad that the Mirror Biology Dialogues Fund is hosting events to facilitate them. It's unusual to have the opportunity to proactively shape biotech governance well before the technology becomes a real possibility.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The sole debate between Virginia gubernatorial candidates, Democratic candidate Abigail Spanberger and Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears (R-VA), quickly devolved into disagreements and personal barbs over the brewing scandal surrounding Democrat Jay Jones. Jones, the Democratic nominee for attorney general, previously sent violent text messages suggesting he would put two bullets into former Virginia Republican House Speaker Todd Gilbert. Earle-Sears, Virginia Attorney General Jason Miyares, and the National Republican Senatorial Committee have all released ads attacking Democrats over the Jones scandal. Earle-Sears lambasted Spanberger over her silence on whether Jones should end his campaign. “I'm wondering why my opponent won't say beyond its abhorrent and disgusting … that he must leave the race because Jay Jones advocated the murder, Abigail, the murder of a man, a former speaker, as well as his children, who were 2 and 5 years old,” Earle-Sears said during the Thursday night debate. As Earle-Sears grilled Spanberger, she remained silent, refusing to answer her questions about Jones's role on the Democratic ticket. What would it take — him pulling the trigger? And then you would say he needs to get out of the race. Spanberger stood facing forward and didn't engage each time Earle-Sears turned to her to ask questions. Spanberger told the audience at Norfolk State University that she abhors Jones's messages, but she repeatedly dodged questions about whether he should remain on the ticket. “The comments that Jay Jones made are absolutely abhorrent. She then attacked Earle-Sears for having selective outrage on political violence at the expense of Democrats. “My opponent, unfortunately, only denounces violence when her side is the target,” said Spanberger. “Don't lie like that, Abigail,” Earle-Sears interjected. “I hope that in the future, she will endeavor to denounce violent rhetoric and violence, no matter who the victim,” Spanberger continued. “You routinely refer to me as your enemy. “We are all running our individual races. I believe my opponent has said that about her lieutenant governor nominee,” Spanberger said as Earle-Sears interrupted her. I am running my race to serve Virginia, and that is what I intend to do.” Throughout the debate, Earle-Sears was on offense, interrupting Spanberger's responses and pivoting her answers repeatedly to questions for her opponent. Moderators dinged her multiple times for talking over Spanberger. “You have to make hard choices, and that means telling Jay Jones to leave the race,” Earle-Sears said. “Abigail needs to say something,” she repeated. Early voting has already begun in Virginia and ends Nov. 1 before Election Day on Nov. 4. The Jones scandal broke last week after early voting had started on Sept. 19.</p>
