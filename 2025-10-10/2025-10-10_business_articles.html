                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Apple is in late-stage talks to acquire top talent from computer vision startup Prompt AI, as well as the company's technology, CNBC has learned. Leadership at Prompt told employees of the pending transaction at an all-hands meeting on Thursday and said that those who don't end up joining Apple will be paid a reduced salary, and encouraged to apply for open roles at the company, according to audio that was accessed by CNBC. The 11-person company was approached by other potential suitors, including Elon Musk's xAI and Neuralink, executives said in the meeting. Co-founders include CEO Tete Xiao, a notable AI researcher with a Phd in computer science from UC Berkeley, and President Trevor Darrell who was a founder of the Berkeley Artificial Intelligence Research (BAIR) lab. Neither xAI nor Neuralink immediately responded to a request for comment. Investors will get paid some money in the deal but "won't be made whole," executives said in the meeting. Prompt employees were asked to refrain from mentioning Apple until further notice while searching for other jobs or updating friends and family on their situation. Prompt's flagship app, Seemour, connects to home security cameras, adding sophisticated capabilities. The technology helps cameras detect specific people, pets and other animals or objects around a household, and to send alerts and text-based descriptions of unusual activity or answer questions about what's been happening in front of the camera. The company is retiring the Seemour app, and plans to inform users their data will be deleted and privacy protected, executives said. Silicon Valley's tech giants have been snapping up top AI talent through acquihires, in part to bolster their AI research and development in a way that helps them skirt regulatory concerns. Apple's deal for Prompt is much smaller than recent high-profile transactions, such as Meta's $14.3 billion investment in Scale AI that brought with it the company's founder and other execs, and Google's $2.4 billion deal for Windsurf's CEO and leaders that included licensing fees. The company prefers to quietly acquire smaller teams and use their talent and technology to develop features for its product lines. Its stock is down 2% this year, badly trailing major indexes and the worst performance among the tech megcaps. While Apple Intelligence, the iPhone maker's foray into generative AI, has underwhelmed critics and faced delays, the company achieved technical success with computer vision, especially in its mixed reality headset, Vision Pro. The iPhone also has the ability to decipher what objects, people or pets are in photographs taken by users. Prompt's technology and talent are likely to be part of Apple's HomeKit smart home division.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump on Friday said the United States would impose new tariffs of 100% on imports from China "over and above any Tariff that they are currently paying," starting on Nov. 1. Trump also said that the U.S., on that same date, would also impose export controls on "any and all critical software." The president's announcement came hours after he threatened to slap "a massive increase" of tariffs on Chinese imports in retaliation for new controls that China imposed on exports of rare earths minerals from that nation. The minerals are essential for high-tech industries, including automobiles, defense and semiconductors. Trump suggested earlier Friday that he would cancel a meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping at the upcoming Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in South Korea because of China's new controls. Nearly every product imported into the U.S. from China already faces steep tariffs. While there are different levels of specific duties on imports, ranging from 50% on steel and aluminum, to 7.5% on consumer goods, the so-called effective tariff rate on Chinese imports currently is 40%, according to Wells Fargo Economics and analysts at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. "It has just been learned that China has taken an extraordinarily aggressive position on Trade in sending an extremely hostile letter to the World, stating that they were going to, effective November 1st, 2025, impose large scale Export Controls on virtually every product they make, and some not even made by them," Trump wrote in a Truth Social post on Friday. "This affects ALL Countries, without exception, and was obviously a plan devised by them years ago. It is absolutely unheard of in International Trade, and a moral disgrace in dealing with other Nations," Trump wrote. "Based on the fact that China has taken this unprecedented position, and speaking only for the U.S.A., and not other Nations who were similarly threatened, starting November 1st, 2025 (or sooner, depending on any further actions or changes taken by China), the United States of America will impose a Tariff of 100% on China, over and above any Tariff that they are currently paying," he wrote. China's Ministry of Commerce on Thursday said that starting Dec. 1 foreign entities must have a license to export products that contain more than 0.1% of rare earths sourced from that country, or that are manufactured using Chinese extraction, refining, magnet-making or recycling technology.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth on Friday announced an agreement to build a Qatari Emiri Air Force facility at a U.S. Air Force Base in Idaho. Hegeth said the facility at the Mountain Home Air Force Base will allow pilots from Qatar's air force to train with American military personnel. The Defense secretary made the announcement at a Pentagon press conference with Qatari Defense Minister Sheikh Saoud bin Abdulrahman Al Thani. Hegseth said the facility will "host a contingent a Qatari F-15's and pilots to enhance our combined training, increase lethality, interoperability, it's just another example of our partnership." The Mountain Home Air Force Base currently has a contingent of F-15 fighter jets from Singapore's air force stationed there as part of a training program for that nation's pilots. The Pentagon didn't immediately respond to a request for comment on Hegseth's announcement. Last month, following Israel's decision to go through with a military strike in Doha, Qatar's capital city, the president signed an executive order "assuring the security of the state of Qatar." A Pentagon spokesperson told CNBC that Hegseth accepted the luxury plane "in accordance with all federal rules and regulations." The gift drew criticism from Democrats and others who said the jet smacked as looking like bribe to President Donald Trump. Trump's family business has also been expanding its footprint in the Middle East -- including a golf resort in Doha with Qatar's sovereign wealth fund's real estate arm,  as well as a Trump International Hotel & Tower in Dubai, a Trump Tower located in Jeddah, and a hotel that is under construction in Muscat.

Some customers of the shipping service say that packages sent to the US from abroad are getting held up at the carrier's facilities for weeks and, in some cases, are being subjected to higher-than-expected tariffs and customs brokerage fees, according to tracking information. Eight people whom Business Insider spoke to said that they received updates indicating they might never get their packages at all. "The package is undeliverable and is in the process of being disposed of according to the local guidelines," reads one tracking update sent to several UPS customers Business Insider spoke with and posted widely on a subreddit for UPS users. For many of these UPS customers, the delayed packages marked their first encounter with international shipping in the era of tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump's administration this year. A UPS spokesperson said the company was seeing "a significant increase" in the number of shipments that require formal customs clearance. For some UPS customers, the changes have meant that additional information or payments are required to complete certain shipments. UPS sent three of the four wheels back to him. The fourth still hasn't shown up, he said. Last week, its tracking page said the shipment was being disposed of, though it's since moved between UPS facilities in Ontario, Michigan, and Tennessee. After Sharma emailed UPS CEO Carol Tomé about the fourth wheel, a UPS customer relations employee apologized for the problem, in a message viewed by Business Insider. "Because of changes to US import regulations, we are seeing many packages that are unable to clear customs due to missing or incomplete information about the shipment required for customs clearance," a UPS spokesperson told Business Insider. David Ordal, who lives in California's Bay Area, shared tracking information for his order of an annual supply of French sunscreen, which has been languishing for a month in Louisville, Kentucky. Katie Golden, who resells vintage clothing on Depop, told Business Insider that she ordered $179 worth of used apparel from the UK. The package left that country and made its way to UPS's facility in Louisville, Kentucky, according to a screenshot of UPS tracking information seen by Business Insider. UPS notified her that she had to pay $769 in import fees, including tariffs, as well as a UPS broker fee. At over four times the cost of her order, that's more than she was expecting to pay for used clothes, she said. Golden is currently trying to dispute that tariff amount with UPS. Recent changes to the Food and Drug Administration's review process for imports could also be causing issues. A consultant in Los Angeles who is starting a coffee business told Business Insider she received two out of 12 boxes of inventory from Taiwan and was notified that the remaining 10 would be marked as abandoned and disposed of. In a recording of a call with UPS that the customer provided to Business Insider, an agent tells her that the FDA and Border Protection "decided to approve only a percentage of the shipment." "They are getting very strict now," the UPS agent said, adding that they had received about 10 calls from other customers about similar issues. She paid that bill only to receive a second charge for roughly $289. Elliott's package was delivered, and UPS later refunded the initial $165 payment. Alex Castellani, cofounder of Toronto-based coffee roaster Subtext, said that many of his shipments to the US since late August have sat for weeks at UPS facilities in Buffalo, New York, and Detroit, according to tracking information. "They're now paying more in brokerage and tariffs than the entire value of their package," Castellani told Business Insider. UPS has made changes this year in response to the Trump Administration's tariff policies. In April, the shipping service said that it would cut 20,000 jobs and shutter dozens of facilities in response to what CEO Tomé called "a changing trade environment." Last week, UPS suspended its service guarantee for international shipments and many within the US. The guarantee allowed customers to get a refund if their package arrived later than UPS projected. Some recipients say UPS has items that can't be easily replaced. Nicole Lobo, a graduate student in Philadelphia, said that she shipped 10 boxes of personal possessions, including clothing that belonged to her grandfather and rare books on art history, using UPS after a year studying in the UK. Lobo shipped the boxes from the UK in late August but hadn't received them when Business Insider spoke with her on Thursday. The LA consultant said this is her second time launching a business that depends on imports, though it is her first time dealing with food. Now, she says she's not sure if there's a path forward if other carriers have the same problems as UPS.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Nineteen people were missing and possibly dead after a devastating explosion on Friday morning at a military explosives plant in Tennessee, officials said. The explosion at Accurate Energetic Systems about 50 miles (80 km) west of Nashville occurred at 7:45 a.m. local time (1245 GMT), Humphreys County Sheriff Chris Davis told a press conference. Davis said there were multiple fatalities but it was still too early to know precisely how many people had perished, saying it was still possible there were some survivors. When asked to describe the building where the blast occurred, Davis said, "There's nothing to describe. Aerial video on CNN showed what appeared to be the footprint of where a building once stood. In an adjacent parking lot, debris and what appeared to be ashes were scattered among a few parked vehicles. Efforts to reach the company were not successful. Accurate Energetic Systems develops, manufactures and stores explosives for "military, aerospace, and commercial demolition markets," according to the company's website. The 1,300-acre headquarters in Bucksnort, Tennessee, includes eight production buildings and a quality lab. Hickman County Mayor Jim Bates told CNN the plant did not have a history of safety problems, although there was a small ammunition explosion there in 2014. That incident killed one person and injured three, according to The Tennessean newspaper. We want to hear from you. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Office of Management and Budget, which Vought leads, soon after confirmed that "RIFs have begun and are substantial." No other details of the layoffs were immediately released. The announcement comes four days after National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett warned in a CNBC interview that President Donald Trump could "start taking sharp measures" if the shutdown continued due to the lack of a stopgap funding deal approved by Congress. While many federal workers have been furloughed because of the shutdown, it is not the normal practice in shutdowns to permanently lay off government employees. A spokesman for the Health and Human Services Department, in a statement to CNBC, said, "HHS employees across multiple divisions have received reduction-in-force notices as a direct consequence of the Democrat-led government shutdown." "HHS under the Biden administration became a bloated bureaucracy, growing its budget by 38% and its workforce by 17%," department spokesman Andrew Nixon said. " All HHS employees receiving reduction-in-force notices were designated non-essential by their respective divisions. HHS continues to close wasteful and duplicative entities, including those that are at odds with the Trump administration's Make America Healthy Again agenda." A number of Treasury Department employees also have received RIF notices. A union representing federal workers, the American Federation of Government Employees, quickly replied to Vought's tweet, writing, "The lawsuit has been filed." Since the shutdown began last week, Vought has announced in tweets decisions by the Trump administration to freeze and cut billions of dollars in federal funding for projects in states and cities controlled by Democratic elected officials. The Trump administration and Republicans in Congress have repeatedly sought to blame Democrats for the government shutdown and any negative fallout from it. Democratic senators have largely refused to vote for a Republican stopgap funding plan that would reopen the government, saying that any such resolution must include an agreement to extend enhanced Affordable Care Act tax credits. Those tax credits lower the cost of Obamacare health insurance plans purchased by millions of Americans from government-run ACA marketplaces. Dueling Republican and Democratic funding resolutions failed to pass in the Senate for the seventh time on Thursday. The shutdown is expected to continue until at least early next week because the Senate is not due to resume business until Tuesday.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Typically, reports surrounding BUA, a group owned by one of Nigeria's richest individuals, Abdulsamad Rabiu, consistently lean towards a positive reception. One of the group's primary companies, BUA Foods, posted a profit of ₦260.07 billion, making it Nigeria's most lucrative listed consumer goods company. The company recorded ₦912.5 billion in revenue for the half-year (up 36%) and PBT of ₦276.1 billion (a 101% rise year on year), driven by strong volume and margin gains in sugar, wheat, and pasta, according to Nairametrics. Earlier reports in September by the aforementioned publication also showed that Abdulsamad Rabiu was set to receive a record N216.7 billion in dividends as a result of resolutions adopted at BUA Foods Plc's fourth annual general meeting. As per Forbes's recent updates, Abdulsamad Rabiu is now worth $7.6 billion, a 21.05% increase from his net worth mid-way into the year. This growth puts him firmly in second place atop Nigeria's list of richest men, following Africa's richest man, Aliko Dangote, close behind. Prior to this growth, industrialist Wale Adenuga was Africa's richest man, with a net worth of $6.3 billion, which has been at the figure since June, but declined from $6.8 billion at the start of the year. In contrast, Abdulsamad Rabiu began the year with a net worth of $4.7 billion, which jumped to $6 billion in June, and now, as of the 10th of October, at $7.6 billion.

But those splurges look a little different compared to previous generations. For years, retail leaders and economists have talked about the "lipstick index," which is the idea that consumers forgo large purchases in favor of small luxuries like lipstick during economic downturns. Gen Z has its own version of the lipstick index, according to a new PwC report that analyzed nearly a million customer transactions, including credit card and debit card transactions. Young consumers are treating themselves with items like matcha and fancy kicks, more so than lipstick, the report said. "Micro luxuries like a pricey matcha, a resale sneaker drop, or cosmetics that double as skincare can telegraph cultural relevance without breaking the bank," the report reads. That includes products that make them feel good, but also represent good value and an opportunity to improve themselves, Ali Furman, a partner at PwC, told Business Insider. "For this generation in particular, self-improvement outcomes are very high on their interests list," Furman said. "Years ago, it was in the tea aisle on a shelf," Furman said. Gen Z's holiday spending plans reveal the pressure they're under this year. Millennials, by comparison, plan to reduce spending by 1%, while shoppers who identify as Gen X and baby boomers plan to increase holiday spending modestly. PwC surveyed 4,000 consumers — 1,000 from each generation highlighted — between June and July. Gen Z's tight spending relative to other generations might not be temporary, though. PwC's report says that Gen Z's habits represent "a generational shift in how value is defined and where money feels worth spending." While many Gen Zers are navigating a challenging entry-level job market and paying off student debt, they are also reaching critical life milestones, such as getting married and having children — both of which can be expensive endeavors, Furman said. All that financial pressure means that Gen Z's hunt for little luxuries and good deals might be more of a long-term trend than the lipstick index traditionally implies. "It's that coming-of-age issue combined with the economic climate," Furman said.</p>

This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Hayet Yasmine Chebbi, a 26-year-old content creator and podcaster based in Montreal. I lived in New York City for the first 24 years of my life. When the pandemic hit, my college went remote, I got laid off from my contract fashion job at Chanel, and I felt like the US's response to the pandemic was inconsistent. Although my income has been unsteady and there have been some culture shocks, I feel a lot less on edge, and my nervous system appreciates the change of pace. After graduating from college in 2021, I went to Dubai for a month to get out of the city, and I absolutely loved it. The city was efficient, organized, and clean, while still having the sensational sense of opportunity that I felt in New York. On that trip, I met a friend who introduced me to my now-husband, who was living in Montreal. We started dating right away, and I spent the next two years traveling between New York City and Montreal. In the meantime, I got a job at Christian Dior in NYC as an e-commerce client advisor and later transitioned into my marketing role at a media company. I was doing the whole "climbing the corporate ladder" — working long hours, sacrificing sleep, working through lunch breaks, and carrying the mental workload home on weekends — all in an effort to prove myself. Over time, that lifestyle caught up with me. In time, I realized that no amount of career success was worth sacrificing my well-being. I realized living in Dubai would be very expensive, and the entry-level jobs I found didn't pay enough to offset that cost, but I still wanted to live in a place that could offer me an affordable, well-balanced lifestyle. In late 2023, I married my husband and officially moved to Montreal by applying for a work permit under his name. I created my own LLC, which is technically registered in the US, to do content creation and a podcast. I haven't made an income from it yet. Babysitting has allowed me to earn an income while maintaining flexibility in my schedule, but to be transparent, my income has been unsteady. I've been relying on my husband for the majority of our bills, but I've been seeing some slow growth for my business. I've built a circle of artists and musicians who've helped me see a whole new life outside corporate, and they've motivated me to create. My husband and his friends are more French-speaking, so there are times I just can't keep up, and my husband will have to translate for me. I took an amazing three-month, government-funded class to learn the language and integrate with Quebec culture, and I can now comfortably navigate day-to-day interactions. In Montreal, about six months of the year are winter, so I've really had to adapt to the weather. In New York, a snow day was a miracle; it meant schools would close, and you were going to meet up with your friends to make snow angels. People seem to be a lot more present here. For example, people in Montreal stand still on the escalator, while people in New York City walk on it. One time, I was jogging on the street in Montreal to get to a hair appointment, and I felt like people were staring at me like there was something wrong with me. If the right opportunities open up and it feels like the best decision for my family and my career, I'd consider moving back. I sacrificed myself in corporate America to make my bank account happy, but now I'm making my soul happy. It can be made through slowness, steadiness, and even rest.

The startups that help train AI chatbots, such as Encord and Micro1, say they're seeing a surge in demand from robotics companies hungry for high-quality training data — and creating it often requires paying people to film themselves performing tasks like folding laundry, loading dishwashers, or making espresso. Venture capital investment in robotics is surging, reaching $12.1 billion so far this year, according to PitchBook data. Companies like OpenAI, which build large language models (LLMs), can train on massive troves of data from the internet. Robots require different kinds of data, though, to learn basic dexterity so they can ultimately join a factory line or mop your kitchen floor. "Unlike LLMs, robotics doesn't have the internet as a ready-made dataset — you have to generate training data from scratch in the real world, which is far harder," Ulrik Hansen, cofounder of data labeling startup Encord, told Business Insider. Hansen says his startup is seeing four times as much volume for this kind of data compared to last year. For humans, the money isn't half-bad — as long as you're willing to wear a pair of Meta's Ray-Ban glasses to record yourself doing things like folding clothes on a table. Hansen, the Encord cofounder, says rates can reach up to $150 an hour for videos of highly technical tasks, like handling surgical equipment. Scale AI, for example, says that it's rapidly expanding into robotics and has established a dedicated lab at its San Francisco headquarters, which has produced over 100,000 hours of training footage to date, the company wrote in a blog post published last month. Encord cited both as customers; Scale AI says Physical Intelligence is a customer, too. It's still early days, and finding suitable training data for robots remains a challenge. "There are no major datasets you can buy," the founder said. "The biggest ones are around 5,000 hours, which is not nearly enough."</p>

Microsoft plans to ward off competition from AI coding tools by overhauling its GitHub service, according to audio from an internal meeting reviewed by Business Insider. The transformation has its roots in something that used to frustrate cofounder Bill Gates. "Bill used to always say that there's only one category: It's called Information Management," CEO Satya Nadella said in the meeting. GitHub, which Microsoft acquired in 2018, had an early lead because of its popularity as a place to store code along with a partnership with OpenAI. Lately, though, GitHub has faced more competition from AI tools such as Cursor and Anthropic's Claude Code. Microsoft's AI coding assistant, GitHub Copilot, was the top tool of choice in a recent survey by Jellyfish. But the tool recently lost share in a key part of the developer market to Cursor, according to data cited in a recent note from Barclays. A Microsoft engineer in the internal meeting asked executives to explain how the company is addressing competition from these tools, particularly Cursor or Claude Code, which they characterized as "moving quickly and capturing a lot of mindshare." "GitHub is just not the place anymore where developers are storing code," Microsoft executive Jay Parikh said. And earlier this year, Nadella tapped Parikh to lead a new AI unit called CoreAI that oversees GitHub. Microsoft wants GitHub's AI tools to be available wherever developers work, not just inside one app, whether that's in the command line interface, in a web browser, inside different coding apps like VS Code, or even within other Microsoft products. Microsoft also envisions GitHub becoming a kind of dashboard for managing multiple AI agents. The company is also investing in improving the basic parts of GitHub, Parikh said, like its GitHub Actions tool that automates building, testing, and deploying code, analytics and insights tools so teams can see how their code is performing, security for keeping the code safe, and making sure the company can meet local data storage rules to offer GitHub in new countries. "We're gearing up for what should be the best GitHub universe ever." Parikh also echoed recent comments from Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman that the company should work with and build more large language models rather than depending on its relationship with OpenAI. Microsoft earlier this year started working on a major upgrade of its flagship software-development product Visual Studio, a sign the tech giant is responding to intense competition from new AI coding tools, according to an internal memo viewed by Business Insider. The company also asked some managers to evaluate employees based on how much they use AI internally, and the software giant is considering adding a metric related to this in its review process, according to another memo Business Insider viewed.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The EU delegation to South Africa said the move reflects Europe's resolve to “work with South Africa to become global leaders in the just energy transition, sustainable infrastructure, digital connectivity and pharmaceutical value chain.” The announcement builds on a previous €4.7 billion ($5.1 billion) pledge made in March, though it remains unclear if the new figure is in addition to that earlier commitment. EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen reaffirmed the bloc's support in a post on X, addressed to President Cyril Ramaphosa, writing: “Dear @CyrilRamaphosa, with Global Gateway investments worth almost €12 billion, we're fully behind your ambition to become a clean energy leader. According to the EU, about €8.7 billion ($9.5 billion) of the total will come through blended financing, combining public and private sector resources, to help develop facilities for critical mineral processing and green hydrogen production in South Africa, Africa's most industrialised economy. The remaining funds will support projects aimed at climate resilience, modern transport networks, and vaccine manufacturing capacity, underscoring Europe's growing interest in long-term African supply chains and local production ecosystems. “This is more than investment, it's collaboration for mutual growth. Africa's green transformation is vital for the world's sustainable future,” an EU official noted. The initiative positions South Africa as a key hub in Europe's broader Africa strategy, potentially unlocking new industrial and trade opportunities across the continent.
