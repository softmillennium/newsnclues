María Corina Machado, a Venezuelan opposition leader driven into hiding since a disputed election last year, has been awarded the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize for keeping “the flame of democracy burning amid a growing darkness.”
    


            Machado received the accolade for tirelessly promoting democratic rights in Venezuela and “for her struggle to achieve a just and peaceful transition from dictatorship to democracy,” the Norwegian Nobel Committee said Friday, announcing the award at a ceremony in Oslo.
    


            Born in Caracas, Venezuela's capital, in 1967, Machado trained as an industrial engineer before entering politics. In 2002, she founded Súmate, a volunteer group that promotes political rights and monitors elections.
    


            Machado has described her life's work as promoting “ballots over bullets.” The Nobel committee lauded her as “one of the most extraordinary examples of civilian courage in Latin America in recent times.”
    


            “Oh my god … I have no words,” Machado said after being woken in the middle of the night by a phone call from the committee to tell her she had won the prize.
    


            Although the White House criticized the committee for overlooking the peacemaking efforts of Donald Trump – who has long publicly coveted the prize – the US president praised Machado in January for “peacefully expressing the voices and the WILL of the Venezuelan people.”
    


            In a statement, Machado dedicated her award to the “suffering people of Venezuela” and to Trump “for his decisive support of our cause.” She said her award should be act as an “impetus” to all Venezuelans “to complete our task: achieving freedom.”
    


            “We are on the threshold of victory, and today more than ever we count on President Trump, the people of the United States, the people of Latin America, and the democratic nations of the world as our main allies in achieving freedom and democracy. Venezuela will be free!” she said.
    


            Tensions between the US and Venezuela have escalated in recent weeks. CNN has previously reported that Trump is conducting a broad strategy aimed at weakening Maduro, according to sources briefed on the administration's plans.
    


            Machado's work has become more difficult over time. Freedom House, a monitoring group, says Venezuela's democratic institutions have deteriorated since 1999 and “have grown sharply worse in recent years” due to a harsh crackdown by the government of President Nicolás Maduro.
    


            Machado attempted to run against Maduro in the 2024 presidential election, but her candidacy was voided by the regime. She then switched her support to the party of Edmundo González Urrutia, and worked to mobilize citizens and train election observers to try to ensure the vote was free and fair.
    


            Both Maduro and González claimed victory after the vote. When Venezuela's government-aligned electoral authorities declared Maduro the winner, with 51.95% of the vote, opposition forces cried foul. Analysts reported “suspicious” data patterns in the reported results. One expert said there was about a “one in 100 million chance that this particular pattern will occur by chance.”
    


            After the election, Machado claimed she could prove that Maduro had lost “in a landslide to Edmundo, 67% to 30%.” Writing in the Wall Street Journal, she said her group had “receipts obtained directly from more than 80% of the nation's polling stations.”
    


            The Nobel committee praised Machado on Friday for making sure “the final tallies were documented before the regime could destroy the ballots and lie about the outcome.” At the time, the Biden administration also concurred that there was “overwhelming evidence” that Maduro lost the vote.
    

In the past year, #NobelPeacePrize laureate Maria Corina Machado has been forced to live in hiding. Despite serious threats against her life she has remained in the country, a choice that has inspired millions of people.When authoritarians seize power, it is crucial to… pic.twitter.com/GA3C7asz4Y


            After declaring victory, the Maduro government moved to crack down on dissent. Human Rights Watch, a monitoring group, said this year that the government has “killed, tortured, detained, and forcefully disappeared people seeking democratic change.”
    


            As a result, Machado has lived in hiding in Venezuela since last year, resurfacing briefly during protests in January. Speaking to CNN from an unknown location in August 2024, Machado said the regime had “lost total touch with reality and lost its social base,” allowing her movement – with no resources, and operating under strict censorship – to mobilize “millions of Venezuelans” committed to democracy.
    


            “Everyone in Venezuela is afraid of losing our freedom or even our lives,” she told CNN's Christiane Amanpour. “But above all we are committed to make the truth prevail… and get a transition to democracy peacefully.”
    


            The Nobel Peace Prize is awarded each year to the individual or organization which has done the most to satisfy the terms set out in the will of Alfred Nobel, the Swedish chemist whose fortune established the Nobel Prizes.
    


            The will says the award will be given to “the person who shall have done the most or the best work for fraternity between nations and the abolition or reduction of standing armies and the formation and spreading of peace congresses.”
    


            Jørgen Watne Frydnes, chair of the Norwegian Nobel Committee, said Machado had satisfied the full criteria.
    


            “She has brought her country's opposition together. She has never wavered in resisting the militarization of Venezuelan society. She has been steadfast in her support for a peaceful transition to democracy,” he said Friday.
    


            In selecting Machado as this year's laureate, the committee signaled its concerns about the health of democracy worldwide, according to Karim Haggag, director of the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI).
    


            “The Nobel Committee clearly chose to highlight democracy as a priority area, underscoring that this award comes at a time of global backsliding of democratic values and norms,” Haggag told CNN.
    


            Nina Græger, director of the Peace Research Institute Oslo, said Machado's award is “above all, a prize for democracy.”
    


Nobel Peace Prize awarded to Japan's Nihon Hidankyo for efforts to rid world of nuclear weapons



            “Research shows that democracy is an important precondition for peace. At a moment when authoritarianism is on the rise across the world, this award highlights the courage of those who defend freedom with ballots, not bullets,” she told CNN.
    


            Analysts say the committee often uses the prize to send a message about areas of concern over the past year. The 2024 prize went to Nihon Hidankyo, a grassroots Japanese organization of atomic bomb survivors, at a time when the world was once again confronting the specter of nuclear weapons, amid Russia's threats during its war in Ukraine.
    


            Friday's award came after a months-long campaign of self-promotion by US President Donald Trump, who stressed repeatedly that he believed he deserved the prize for ending “unsolvable” wars during his second term.
    


            Although Trump scored a major diplomatic victory this week in announcing the first phase of a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, this likely came too late to influence the Nobel commitee. Nominations for this year's prize closed on January 31, when Trump had only been in office for 11 days.
    


            The White House nonetheless criticized the committee for snubbing Trump.
    


            “President Trump will continue making peace deals, ending wars, and saving lives,” said communications director Steven Cheung. “The Nobel Committee proved they place politics over peace.”
    


            The prize also comes at a time of rising antagonism between the United States and Venezuela, with the US military carrying out lethal strikes on boats off the coast of Venezuela, which the Trump administration has deemed to be “narco-trafficking” vessels.
    


Fact check: Trump's absurd claim that he saved 100,000 lives by attacking alleged Venezuelan drug boats



            The US has also deployed at least seven warships to the southern Caribbean and announced a $50 million reward for information leading to Maduro's arrest. The Venezuelan president who has faced formal drug trafficking charges from the Justice Department since 2020.
    


            The peace prize carries a cash award of 11 million Swedish kronor ($1 million) and will be formally presented at a ceremony in Oslo in December.
    


            Frydnes, the chair of the committee, could not confirm whether Machado will be able to attend.
    


            “It's a question of security. It's too early to say. We always hope to have the laureate with us in Oslo, but this is a serious security situation which needs to be handled first,” Frydnes said.

Live Updates


• Ceasefire in effect: The Israeli military said a ceasefire is now in effect in Gaza, as its forces pull back in accordance with the deal approved by the government overnight.
    


• On the ground: Thousands of Palestinians have been seen walking from the south of Gaza toward Gaza City. An Israel Defense Forces spokesperson said troops would still be present in various areas of Gaza, warning people to avoid approaching them.
    


• Netanyahu remarks: In a televised address, the Israeli prime minister publicly implied for the first time that not all the deceased hostages held captive in Gaza may return.
    


• What's next: The 72-hour period for the release of the hostages held by Hamas has now begun, and nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners and detainees in Israel will also be freed as part of the agreement. US President Donald Trump will visit Israel on Monday, according to police.
    


            The 250 Palestinians set to be released from life sentences in Israeli prisons come from across the political spectrum, according to a list released by Israel ahead of a ceasefire-related prisoner exchange.
    


Here's a closer look:



            The list states that 142 of the prisoners will be deported. The rest will return either to the occupied West Bank or East Jerusalem.
    


            Fifteen hold Israeli citizenship.
    


            UNICEF's James Elder said trauma weighs heavily on Palestinian children, and education is fundamentally critical in the effort to rebuild Gaza.
    


            The United Nations Children's Fund spokesperson, who has been to Gaza several times since 2023, said driving through the enclave yesterday was heartening, as children were joyous and wearing “wall-to-wall smiles.” But he said the impact of war will likely be visible for many years to come.
    


            Speaking of the famine experienced in Gaza, Elder said that “malnourished children end up, quite frequently, being stunted. That has a cognitive decline.”
    


                    “So we are looking at irreversible damage if this doesn't stop,” he added.
                





            The spokesperson said that the immune systems of the children have been severely compromised, describing the youngsters as “shattered.” He added that a third of all births in the first half of this year were to malnourished babies, or babies who went straight into incubators.
    


            “The level of trauma, which is unprecedented, we can't even start to treat the post-traumatic stress disorder in children because it's being intersected — there is no ‘post' yet, it's day-to-day trauma — that has to start with the classroom,” Elder said.
    


            While missed education is bound to affect each child, Elder stressed that the role education can play in the restoration of Gaza is crucial in elevating the quality of life for the entire population. He said, “If Gaza is to rebuild, if Palestinians are to take agency again, education is that bedrock.”
    


            Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has visited a medical center preparing for the arrival of the hostages set to be released from Gaza in the coming days, his office said today.
    


            Netanyahu visited the Sheba Medical Center at Tel HaShomer in the outskirts of Tel Aviv as part of “Operation Returning Home,” the Prime Minister's Office said.
    


            While there, Netanyahu met with Israeli soldiers who were wounded in the war in Gaza, calling them “heroes” and saying that he has “boundless appreciation” for them.
    


            The first phase of the deal between Israel and Hamas is in effect as the two move forward cautiously amid mutual distrust.
    


            Video shows thousands of Palestinians moving on foot from the south of Gaza toward Gaza City along a coastal road. Last month, the Israel Defense Forces ordered the evacuation of Gaza City, which was estimated then to have a population of about 1 million people.
    


Here's everything you need to know:



            A program coordinator for INARA (International Network for Aid, Relief and Assistance) who is living in a tent in Gaza with her children has spoken of the fatigue felt by people in the enclave — and their hope for a better future.
    


            Yousra Abu Sharekh told CNN's Becky Anderson that the most recent period of the war has been the hardest on Palestinians.
    


                    “The ceasefire is just in time because people on the Gaza Strip are so exhausted, overwhelmed and also drained,” she said, adding most now feel “a glimpse of hope.”
                





            Sharekh said the first phase in the framework agreed upon by Israel and Hamas marks a long-awaited end to the ongoing bombardment of Gaza, but not an end to the suffering of civilians.
    


            “It's an ending for the bleeding, but it's just the start for Palestinians who lost their beloved ones, their houses, their normality,” she said.
    


            The aid worker also said that “families are in need of everything,” adding that many have lived for months without shelter.
    


                    “It's the start to think of how to rebuild Gaza better. Not only the buildings, not only the neighborhoods, but most importantly, the souls … the health and the mental health,” Sharekh said of her vision for Gaza.
                





            “We hope we will have the environment to enable us to achieve sustainable and more impactful result on the mental health and social support,” she added.
    


            CNN's Salma Abdelaziz outlines what's already happened in Gaza after the ceasefire came into effect at noon local time, and what questions remain as many Palestinians start the trek back to their homes.
    

CNN's Salma Abdelaziz breaks down some of what we know after the Israeli government approved a Gaza ceasefire resolution.


            The family of Bipin Joshi, a Nepali student who was kidnapped during Hamas' October 7 attacks, is in a “unbearable state of uncertainty regarding his fate,” they said in a statement today.
    


            Joshi is one of two hostages held in Gaza that authorities have said they do not know the status of. Of the 48 hostages, 20 people are presumed alive, while 26 are presumed dead.
    


            Earlier today, however, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu referenced “20 living hostages and 28 dead hostages.”
    


            Joshi's family said in their statement that “these are tense and complex days for all of us; days of tremendous joy, anxiety, anticipation and sadness.”
    


            “We feel surrounded by love and support, yet we kindly ask that the family's privacy and our wish to wait for news in silence be respected,” they said. “Thank you for your open hearts, please pray with us for good news.”
    


            The Office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said US President Donald Trump deserves the Nobel Peace Prize after the Norwegian Nobel Committee gave the award to Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado.



            “The Nobel Committee talks about peace. President @realDonaldTrump makes it happen.The facts speak for themselves. President #Trump deserves it,” Netanyahu's office said on X.
    


            In July, Netanyahu presented Trump with a nomination for the prize at a White House dinner. Pakistan had also nominated the president in June, citing his “decisive diplomatic intervention” following a spike in violence between India and Pakistan this year.
    


            Machado, a Venezuelan opposition leader, received the accolade for promoting democratic rights in Venezuela and “for her struggle to achieve a just and peaceful transition from dictatorship to democracy,” the Norwegian Nobel Committee said today, announcing the award at a ceremony in Oslo.
    


            She dedicated her prize “to the suffering people of Venezuela and to President Trump for his decisive support of our cause!”
    


            Although the White House criticized the committee for snubbing Trump for this year's peace prize, the US president — who has long coveted the award — praised Machado in January for “peacefully expressing the voices and the WILL of the Venezuelan people.”
    


CNN's Christian Edwards contributed reporting.



This post has been updated with reaction from Machado. 



            The father of an American citizen taken hostage by Hamas on October 7, 2023, has spoken of the anticipation and uncertainty that continues to shroud his family while they wait for news on his son.
    


            Ruby Chen told CNN's Kate Bolduan he holds on to the hope his son, Itay, is still alive but fears for the worst.
    


            Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu earlier publicly implied for the first time that not all the deceased hostages held captive in Gaza will return. CNN previously reported that the Israeli government has, for months, been aware that Hamas may not know the location of, or is unable to retrieve, the remains of some of the deceased hostages.
    


            More than two years after Hamas and its allies kidnapped 251 people from Israel and took them to Gaza, 47 hostages remain in the enclave, with at least 20 believed to be alive. The remains of another hostage, Israeli soldier Hadar Goldin, have been held there since 2014.
    


            “There is that scenario, some say even a realistic scenario, that Hamas will come back and say, ‘Look, we don't have 48. We only have a lower number.' So it might be that there are some families, including mine, that do not have closure,” he said.
    


            Itay, a dual US-Israeli citizen, is presumed dead, but his father has previously said that his son remains a hostage even in death. This, he said, is what he has expressed to US President Donald Trump as well as former President Joe Biden during his administration.
    


            “I would hope to believe that this administration, that speaks so highly about America … will do their best efforts as well … making sure that my son is one of the first that come out,” he added.
    


            The Israeli military is “well prepared to go back into combat” and fight Hamas if the militant group retains control of Gaza after the end of the war there, according to Effie Defrin, an Israel Defense Forces spokesperson.
    


            The Hamas of today “isn't (the) Hamas of two years ago,” Defrin said, adding that “Hamas has been defeated everywhere we fought it,” both “military and government-wise.”
    


            The 20-point ceasefire plan agreed upon by Israel and Hamas outlines that a transitional government should rule Gaza until the Palestinian Authority completes its “reform program” and “can securely and effectively take back control of Gaza.”
    


            If Hamas were somehow able to gain control of Gaza despite this part of the proposal, the Israeli military would have to take action, Defrin said.
    


                    “We won't be able to live with Hamas control of Gaza Strip on ‘the day after,'” he said.
                





            “If this is achieved through negotiations, that would suffice. If not, we shall know how to go back and fight it whenever necessary,” he said.
    


            The IDF is “well prepared to go back into combat, fight Hamas and defeat its government capabilities. They won't go back to controlling the Gaza Strip,” he stressed.
    


            Israel's justice ministry has published the full list of 250 Palestinian prisoners serving life sentences who are due to be released as part of the hostages-ceasefire agreement.
    


            More than half of the prisoners will be deported to third countries, while 100 will be released to the occupied West Bank.
    


Here who is — and isn't — included: 



CNN's Abeer Salman contributed to this report.



            The bodies of at least 33 Palestinians have been recovered from Gaza City today, Al-Shifa Hospital Director Dr. Mohammed Abu Salmiya told CNN, after the Israeli military withdrew from some areas of the city.
    


            Some of the bodies were unable to be immediately identified, so they were sent to Al-Shifa as it is the only hospital in Gaza with a forensic medicine department, Salmiya said.
    


            A former deputy Pentagon press secretary said she expects a United States military presence to assist with the transportation of humanitarian aid into Gaza, rather than on the ground in the enclave.
    


            Sabrina Singh told CNN's Audie Cornish that the promise of US military support was pivotal to finalizing the agreement made between Israel and Hamas to initiate the first phase in ending the war.
    


            “One of the commitments that helped secure this ceasefire deal, and hopefully lead to a longer lasting peace, is the fact that there will be a US presence nearby, but not boots on the ground in Gaza,” she said.
    


            Singh, now a CNN political commentator, explained how the US would help coordinate the operation to get aid into the enclave, parts of which are experiencing a “man-made” famine, according to a UN-backed initiative.
    


            Singh said that there was no quick fix to rebuilding Gaza and creating a meaningful peace. “It's going to take a lot of time. This is not weeks or months in the making, this is going to take years,” she said.
    


            While Singh acknowledged that many questions remain unanswered regarding how the ceasefire deal advances, she said the developments provide reason to be hopeful. “We still don't have answers, but we have steps towards progress, and that's important,” she said.
    


            US President Donald Trump is expected to visit Israel on Monday, Israel Police said in a statement outlining the security measures it will implement during the trip.
    


            Thousands of police officers, Border Police personnel, and volunteers will be deployed while Trump visits the country, the police spokesperson's unit said.
    


            Roads will be closed and aircraft, including drones, will be forbidden from flying over Ben Gurion Airport and Jerusalem.
    


            Trump said yesterday that he would “try and make a trip over” to the region to mark the release of the hostages held in Gaza, which he said would take place on Monday or Tuesday.
    


            Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has publicly implied for the first time that not all the deceased hostages held captive in Gaza will return.
    


            In a televised address, Netanyahu said that Israel will work to locate all of the dead hostages in Gaza “as soon as possible,” underscoring previous assessments that Hamas may not be able to find and return all of their remains.
    


            CNN previously reported that the Israeli government has, for months, been aware that Hamas may not know the location of, or is unable to retrieve, the remains of some of the 28 remaining deceased hostages.
    


            Forty-seven hostages who were kidnapped in the October 7, 2023, attacks are still in Gaza, with at least 20 believed to be alive. The remains of another hostage, Israel Defense Forces soldier Hadar Goldin, who was killed in 2014, have been held there since.
    


            Saying that he fulfilled his promise to the families of the 48 hostages, Netanyahu said, “we would not give up on anyone.”
    


            “And indeed, all the hostages will return to us. In the coming days, God willing, we will bring them all,” he said.
    


                    Netanyahu added: “We will bring the deceased hostages to burial in Israel. We will work to locate all of them as soon as possible, and we will fulfill this as a sacred duty of mutual responsibility.”
                





Remember: The ceasefire agreement outlines that a joint task force will be set up to try and find the dead hostages' remains. That task force will include representation from Israel, the United States, Egypt, Qatar and Turkey, according to the agreement.
    


            The withdrawal of Israeli troops to new lines in Gaza means that the 72-hour period for the release of hostages held by Hamas has now begun.
    


            The Israel Defense Forces said the ceasefire agreement had come into effect at 12 p.m. local time.
    


            Under the terms of the deal brokered by the US and other mediators, the redeployment means that over the next three days, and before the deadline of 12 p.m. local time on Monday, the hostages held by Hamas will be handed over, and nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners and detainees in Israel will be freed.
    


            The Israeli Justice Ministry has published the names of 250 Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails and set for release as part of the agreement for a ceasefire in Gaza.
    


            We'll bring you more information as we get it.
    


            We've just heard from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in an address to his country.
    


            He thanked US President Donald Trump, Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner and US special envoy Steve Witkoff for their help in securing the Gaza ceasefire plan that has gone into effect.
    


            “I wish to thank President Trump for his global leadership and his relentless efforts to put together this plan to return the hostages. Once again, he proved his great friendship toward our people and country. I thank the representatives of President Trump, Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, who worked extensively to reach this hostage release deal,” Netanyahu said in a televised speech.
    


            The ceasefire plan agreed upon was proposed by Trump last week. Kushner and Witkoff met with Netanyahu in Jerusalem yesterday, before his government met to vote on the plan, an Israeli official told CNN.
    


            The pair also praised Netanyahu's decisions during the war, saying his actions had pressured Hamas into striking a ceasefire deal.
    


            Palestinians have begun moving from the south of Gaza toward Gaza City after the withdrawal of Israeli forces from the area.
    


            Video shows thousands of people streaming north on foot along the coastal road.
    


            Earlier, the Israeli military had fired at points along the road to prevent people from trying to return to Gaza City ahead of the withdrawal of Israeli troops to new lines inside Gaza, one element of the agreement brokered by the US and other mediators.
    


            Last month, the Israel Defense Forces ordered the evacuation of Gaza City, which was estimated then to have a population of about one million people, as it began a new ground offensive.
    


            As the ceasefire came into effect at 12 p.m. local time, according to the Israeli military, an IDF spokesman posted on X that “movement from the south to the north of the Gaza Strip is permitted via Al-Rashid Street and Salah al-Din Road.”
    


            Israel's Hostages and Missing Families Forum said that “no leader or organization has done more for peace around the world than (US) President Donald J. Trump,” after this year's Nobel Peace Prize was announced.
    


            Trump had made it clear that he was hoping to receive the prestigious award, which today was given to María Corina Machado, a leader of Venezuela's democracy movement.
    


            The US leader's Gaza ceasefire plan made his ambition appear more likely. A number of Israeli Nobel Prize winners pledged to support Trump's bid for the award if he brought about an end to the war. The Hostages and Missing Families Forum had also urged the Nobel Committee to give the prize to Trump.
    


            “President Trump's unprecedented achievements in peacemaking this past year speak for themselves, and no award or lack thereof can diminish the profound impact he has had on our families and on global peace,” the forum said in a statement.
    


            “His commitment to bringing every last hostage home and ending this war does not depend on awards or accolades. We will continue to stand with President Trump as he works to complete this mission, and history will record his achievements as the most significant contributions to world peace in our time,” it continued.

US President Donald Trump has been overlooked for the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize, which was awarded on Friday to Venezuelan opposition politician Maria Corina Machado.

Trump has repeatedly claimed he deserves the prize for purportedly resolving multiple international conflicts since taking office in January, including most recently in Gaza.

White House communications director Steven Cheung reacted to the news by claiming that the committee “proved they place politics over peace” and said Trump would “continue making peace deals, ending wars, and saving lives.”

The Norwegian Nobel Committee praised Machado – a prominent critic of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro – “for her tireless advocacy of democratic freedoms in Venezuela and her commitment to achieving a peaceful transition from dictatorship to democracy.” Maduro has accused Machado of channeling US funds to “fascist” anti-government groups, calling her a front for Washington's interference in Venezuelan affairs.

Machado has had close contacts with the US government for decades. In 2005, then-President George W. Bush received her at the Oval Office.

During Trump's first term, the US and several other Western nations recognized Venezuelan opposition figure Juan Guaido as the country's “interim president,” although Guaido's attempts to seize power through protests and attempted coups failed.

Since returning to office in January, Trump has renewed pressure on Caracas through sanctions and military measures that his administration describes as anti-narcotics operations. Critics, including Republican Senator Rand Paul and Juan Gonzalez, a senior diplomat in the administration of President Joe Biden, argue that the White House is pursuing a familiar regime-change strategy. Trump's secretary of state, Marco Rubio, is a staunch opponent of Maduro and is viewed as the key driver of the effort.

Earlier this week, the Nobel Committee awarded the literature prize to Hungarian author Laszlo Krasznahorkai, a noted critic of his country's prime minister, Viktor Orban – one of Trump's most vocal allies in Europe.

The US Senate on Thursday approved a $925 billion defense spending bill for fiscal year 2026, extending and boosting Ukraine aid through 2028.

The National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) passed 77–20 after weeks of delay. The bill had been stalled amid disputes over troop pay during the ongoing government shutdown, triggered by Congress' failure to approve fiscal year 2026 funding, as well as over President Donald Trump's use of the National Guard to curb illegal migration and US military operations against alleged drug traffickers in the Caribbean. Lawmakers ultimately advanced the measure after agreeing to several amendments.

The legislation reforms the Pentagon's contracting system and expands investments in advanced technologies, missile defense, unmanned systems, and AI. It requires the Pentagon to brief lawmakers before withdrawing US troops from Europe or South Korea, while repealing long-standing war authorizations from the Iraq and Persian Gulf conflicts used to justify US interventions abroad.

The NDAA also extends the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative (USAI) through 2028 and raises its funding to $500 million. The program supplies Kiev with weapons, training, intelligence, and logistics through congressional allocations and contracts with US defense manufacturers.

The House of Representatives passed its own version of the defense bill last month – totaling nearly $900 billion – which also extended Ukraine aid, but capped it at $400 million. The two chambers must now reconcile their drafts before sending the final version to Trump for signing, expected by late November.

Under the previous administration, Washington was Kiev's largest donor in its conflict with Moscow. Since returning to office earlier this year, Trump has not approved new US-funded military aid, instead urging European NATO members to increase defense spending and take greater responsibility for their security without relying on Washington. However, last month he authorized NATO's $500 million Prioritized Ukraine Requirements List (PURL) – a mechanism through which the US can supply Kiev with weapons while other member states cover the costs.

Moscow has condemned Western aid and arms deliveries to Kiev, warning that they prolong the conflict and undermine peace efforts.

DUBAI, October 10. /TASS/. The Israeli army has stopped airstrikes on the Gaza Strip, Qatar's Al Jazeera reported.

According to the TV channel, the attacks stopped after the country's government approved the ceasefire agreement.

Earlier, it was reported that the radical Palestinian movement Hamas demanded that the mediators of the indirect ceasefire talks in the Gaza Strip and the US leadership obligate Israel to stop shelling the enclave. The statement noted that more than 70 people were killed or injured as a result of the shelling of western Gaza City.

On October 9, US President Donald Trump announced that Israel and Hamas had reached agreements on the first stage of a peace plan following negotiations in Egypt. According to him, this stage involves the release of all hostages in the near future and the withdrawal of Israeli troops to an agreed line within the Gaza Strip.

LONDON, October 10. /TASS/. US President Donald Trump may increase trade tariffs on Norway if the Norwegian Nobel Committee does not award him the Peace Prize, The Daily Telegraph reported.

Norway should prepare for possible measures from the US, given that Trump, who has openly spoken of his desire to win the Nobel Peace Prize, ""has a long record of punishing those who upset him."" The article noted that the US leader, in particular, may call on other countries to refuse to purchase Norwegian gas or oil or to limit official contacts with Oslo.

Previously, Trump's associates had threatened to impose visa restrictions on Norway after the country's sovereign wealth fund announced plans to sell its stake in Caterpillar, a leading global manufacturer of construction equipment, due to the company's bulldozers and other machinery being used by Israeli authorities to demolish Palestinian homes in the Gaza Strip.

At the same time, The Daily Telegraph, based on conversations with former members of the Norwegian Nobel Committee, said Trump had little chance of winning the prize. The US president's competitors include the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), the World Health Organization, the International Criminal Court (ICC), and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.

MOSCOW, October 10. /TASS/. Since the end of 2024, the Ukrainian armed forces have doubled the number of attacks on liberated settlements in the Kharkov Region with the aim of terrorizing civilians amid the Russian troops' advance in the region, Vitaly Ganchev, the head of the Kharkov military-civilian administration, told TASS.

""Compared to the end of 2024, we are now seeing approximately twice as much shelling from enemy drones and artillery. Our troops are pressing along the entire front line, so the enemy is trying to put pressure on us, including on the civilian population. But we see that the front line continues to expand anyway.

He clarified that the situation in the liberated part of the region remains extremely difficult, with the Ukrainian military carrying out daily attacks on civilians' homes.

Number of people dead unknown as secondary blasts initially kept first responders from entering site

A huge explosion at a Tennessee military munitions plant on Friday morning has left multiple people dead or missing, according to a county sheriff, as first responders said secondary blasts initially forced rescuers to keep their distance from the burning site.

The powerful blast ripped through the explosives manufacturing plant in rural Tennessee on Friday morning, rattling homes miles away and bringing the emergency services dashing to the scene, authorities and residents said.

The incident happened at Accurate Energetic Systems near the town of Bucksnort, about 60 miles south-west of Nashville, the Hickman county sheriff's office said. The agency asked people in a social media post to avoid the area to allow responders to do their work.

Further blasts were initially keeping rescuers at some distance, Hickman county advanced EMT David Stewart told the Associated Press by telephone.

Some time later on Friday morning, access was achieved and first responders and explosives experts were searching the rubble for casualties and trying to determine what caused the explosion.

There were casualties and injuries related to the explosion, but the Tennessee emergency management agency was not yet sharing any numbers early on Friday afternoon because the state department of health hasn't confirmed them, spokesperson Kristin Coulter said by telephone.
 Humphreys county sheriff Chris Davis said at a press conference that there were “several people at this time unaccounted for”.

“We do have some that are deceased, he said, adding: “We are trying to be mindful of families and that situation.”

Accurate Energetic Systems, which makes and tests explosives and is based in nearby McEwen, did not immediately respond to a phone message seeking comment on Friday morning. The cause of the explosion is not yet known.

Video from the scene showed a burning debris field with smoke billowing into the air. WTVF-TV in Nashville broadcast images of debris strewn about the site, with damaged vehicles in a parking lot. The news station said it received calls from people in the area who felt a large explosion.

Residents in Lobelville, more than a 20-minute drive from the manufacturer, said they felt their homes shake and some people captured the loud boom of the explosion on their home cameras.

The blast rattled Gentry Stover from his sleep.

“I thought the house had collapsed with me inside of it,” he told the AP by phone. “I live very close to Accurate and I realized about 30 seconds after I woke up that it had to have been that.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Agencies like Ice are way ahead of Donald Trump, who wants the military to treat cities like ‘training grounds'

Even without the national guard, law enforcement agencies of the federal government have been using military hardware and tactics on civilian targets.

At a low-rent apartment complex on Chicago's south shore, people started hearing the boots hit the roof around one in the morning. The oh-dark-thirty immigration enforcement raid in the early hours of 1 October featured an air assault from helicopters. Officers went door to door in the building, using charges to blow the hinges off doors and flash-bang grenades to clear apartments. They hauled men, women and children from the building in zip ties and often little else, ostensibly to capture undocumented gang members.

The troubled apartment building at 7500 S South Shore Drive hadn't passed an annual inspection since 2022. With the remains of doors and furniture and the bloodied, scattered belongings of former tenants in tatters, it may struggle to pass another.

“So many of these people remain without shelter or a place to live because it essentially rendered their homes and that entire apartment complex uninhabitable,” said Colleen Connell, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Illinois. She described the apartment raid as a military-style attack. Days afterward, the building looked like a war zone, which may be the point.

Addressing an assembly of high-ranking military officers last week, Donald Trump in impromptu comments called for the military to use American cities as “training grounds for our military”. The comment was a continuation of his belligerence toward cities full of Democratic voters and populations of color, delivered a couple of weeks after he meme-posted an image cribbed from the war movie Apocalypse Now about going to “war” in Chicago.

For those on the receiving end of federal force from masked agents in military fatigues, a flash-bang grenade thrown by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) agent or a soldier may be a distinction without a difference.

Mónica Solórzano was standing next to the mayor of Carpinteria, a farm town in southern California, watching Ice raid a marijuana farm when a flash-bang grenade went off at her feet.

“The canister flashed and made a loud explosive sound, like a firecracker. The noise hurt my ears,” she wrote in a deposition for a suit filed by the Los Angeles Press Club in July, seeking an injunction against attacks on the press, protesters and observers there during the administration's immigration enforcement surge. “When the flash-bang detonated, the people around me started screaming and running. I fell to the ground and thought I was going to be trampled.”

Solórzano, a Carpinteria city council member, was one of dozens of witnesses who described homeland security officers wearing military-style fatigues, using armored personnel carriers and military equipment as they rolled through communities as part of Ice's surge.

Flash-bang grenades are standard tools for clearing a room when soldiers conduct military operations on urban terrain. But the use of them by civilian police officers has been sharply curtailed, with many jurisdictions banning them entirely.

“The use of flash-bang or stun grenades for crowd control is an example of the inappropriate, inadequately regulated use of military weapons for crowd management,” wrote the California physician Rohini J Haar, offering expert testimony for the LA Press Club suit. “While the stated objective of stun grenades is to cause disorientation and a temporary sense of panic, the potential for severe blast injuries and even death caused by the pressure of the blast or by shrapnel from the fragmentation of plastic and metal constituents of the grenade is disproportionately high. The blinding light and deafening sound they produce can also cause injuries indiscriminately.”

Haar is the author of Lethal in Disguise: The Health Consequences of Crowd-Control Weapons, a report cataloguing deaths from flash-bang use.

Federal agents used flash-bang grenades both to disperse crowds of protesters in California in July, and as room-clearing munitions on the raid on an apartment building in Chicago last week.

“Treating a US city like a war zone is intolerable,” wrote a group of eight Democratic lawmakers on the US House homeland security committee, asking the Department of Homeland Security to produce arrest or search warrants for the operation, arrest figures, confirmation of anyone they claim was a member of Tren de Aragua, and a justification for the “heavy-handed” tactics employed. “Please detail why helicopters were needed for this operation,” they asked. “Which agency provided the helicopters and agents manning them?”

The DHS has not responded to their questions, nor to those of the Guardian.

Gil Kerlikowske, former commissioner of Customs and Border Protection and former Seattle police chief, reviewed the testimony offered in support of the LA Press Club suit, concluding that the DHS had regularly engaged in excessive use of force.

“Some of the agencies involved have no responsibility for urban crowd control, such as Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), which is an investigative agency within DHS, that typically does fraud investigations and human trafficking investigations,” Kerlikowske wrote in an affidavit. “Similarly, the Special Response Team (SRT) is a tactical unit with DHS that is part of CBP Office of Field Operations that executes dangerous warrants. It also provided security for me, when I was head of CBP. These officers are not accustomed to policing urban civil unrest; nor are they trained to do so.”

A preliminary injunction was granted last month barring LA police from arresting journalists and limiting their use of force.

Even without reference to the use of national guard troops and equipment in support of enforcing the law – a proposition by Trump that federal courts have rejected multiple times this year – the use of military equipment and military tactics like armored vehicles, Black Hawk helicopters, Predator drones and military weapons by civilian law enforcement in the administration has drawn notice and condemnation.

The police agencies of large cities have experience with street protests, and the crowd-control tactics permitted to those agencies are often the result of arduous, deeply argued policy debates by locally elected leaders.

That's not what Chicago is seeing on the ground.

“What we have seen in particular is the shooting of projectiles, so-called nonlethal rounds, at protesters and at members of the press,” said Connell of the ACLU. “Rather than shooting at the ground, we've seen actual incidents of protesters and the press being hit by those projectiles … We've seen an exacerbation of the sort of display of military-style equipment and tactics, whether it's an armored vehicle with an armed, masked, camouflaged Ice agent or other federal law enforcement agent atop the turret, armed with heavy military-style equipment.”

Journalists from Block Club Chicago, the Chicago Headline Club and other press organizations filed suit Monday in federal court, seeking an injunction against the federal government for actions against journalists outside the Broadview Ice facility. Four of Block Club's journalists were “indiscriminately shot with pepper-spray bullets and tear-gassed by federal agents” while covering the raid. The lawsuit is an attempt to bar federal agents from, among other things, indiscriminately using chemical weapons against journalists asserting their first amendment right to report.

While federal agencies could fly a helicopter in for a raid on an apartment building in Chicago, many civilians in the Windy City have been locked out of their homes for two weeks.

Citing “special security reasons”, the Federal Aviation Administration imposed a 12-day-long ban on drone flights by anyone without a special commercial operating exemption across a 15-nautical-mile radius around the Ice facility near Chicago. As a practical matter, it denies anyone except news stations with a helicopter from observing federal operations from the air. Practiced drone operators – and journalists – have little experience with this kind of airspace control.

“I've had a drone license basically with the FAA for almost as long as that program has existed – at least eight years – and I've never seen anything like that before,” said Adam Rose, press rights chair of the LA Press Club and deputy director of advocacy for the Freedom of the Press Foundation. “They're trying to basically take their militarization techniques to the sky. They're trying to keep the enemy out of the sky, the enemy being anyone who is observing them.”

Rose notes that the no-fly space above Los Angeles during the protests earlier this year was 900 times smaller than Chicago, but that DHS filled that airspace with Predator drones drawn from the border to surveil crowds.

“It doesn't matter what uniform they wear, whether they are federal agents or troops, they are bound by the constitution,” said Hina Shamsi, director of the ACLU's National Security Project. “People need to know that if any member of the federal force violates their rights, they need to be held accountable”.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

As many as 40 academics have been dismissed in aftermath of shooting, allegedly without due process

A “climate of fear” is still shrouding college campuses across the US, academics have warned, after a string of professors were fired or punished for their comments after Charlie Kirk's assassination.

As many as 40 academics have been dismissed in recent weeks, according to the American Association of University Professors. Many were targeted by rightwing campaigners, who seized on remarks they wrote or shared, and pressured their employers to take action.

The late-night comedy host Jimmy Kimmel became the most high-profile suspension for comments related to Kirk. Kimmel is now back on air. But firings, suspensions and disciplinary actions have continued and – have incited concern about the state of freedom of speech in the US.

Dr Karen Leader, an associate professor of art history and faculty associate in the Center for Women, Gender and Sexuality Studies at Florida Atlantic University, shared posts quoting and paraphrasing Kirk's rhetoric, such as Kirk stating that Taylor Swift should “submit” to her fiance, his claim in 2023 that “happening all the time in urban America, prowling Blacks go around for fun to go target white people, that's a fact”, and comments about the second amendment being worth the gun deaths. “This is Charlie Kirk,” she wrote herself.

“Academics are particularly sensitive about Charlie Kirk because we were one of his first targets with the professor watch list,” Leader said. The list, launched by Kirk in 2016, includes hundreds of professors around the US which it accuses of left-leaning bias. Many of those listed subsequently faced threats and harassment.

A group of rightwing users on social media have jumped on posts critical of Kirk, tagging the employers of academics who wrote and shared them. Prominent influencers behind such campaigns include Jordan Chamberlain, a former Ron DeSantis staffer, and the LibsofTikTok account, which has a record of pushing misinformation and targeting individuals and businesses, resulting in bomb threats and harassment.

Chamberlain and LibsofTikTok posted screenshots of Leader's posts, tagging her employer, Florida Atlantic University. Shortly afterwards, the university released a statement announcing that she was placed on academic leave and citing “repeated comments ... regarding the assassination of Charlie Kirk”.

“It was signed by the president of our university, and mischaracterized what I had done,” Leader said. “I had not commented on the assassination of Charlie Kirk. I hadn't commented on his death. I hadn't commented on the means of his death. I hadn't in any way condoned it or celebrated it.”

It comes amid a wave of disciplinary measures at universities and other workplaces. The Florida commissioner of education warned teachers they could be fired over “despicable comments” about Kirk.

“Why is academia bending over and folding on our basic principles in such a blatant way?” Leader continued. “It's a violation of the first amendment in such a blatant way that nobody should have obeyed it. But instead, there is this climate of fear.”

A spokesperson for Florida Atlantic University said: “Florida Atlantic University does not comment on personnel matters.”

A staffer at Ball State University, Suzanne Swierc, called Kirk's death a “tragedy” and said that “while it's difficult, I can and do pray for his soul” in a post on a private social media account, adding: “Charlie Kirk's death is a reflection of the violence, fear and hatred he sowed. It does not excuse his death, AND it's a sad truth.”

The post was later publicized, however, and Swierc was fired. “September 12, the day that my private post was made public without my consent, was one of the worst days of my life,” she said during a press conference on 22 September. “I was terrified most of that day with some of the messages, phone calls and voicemails I was receiving to my personal number, to my work accounts.”

Swierc has filed a lawsuit with American Civil Liberties Union challenging her termination. Ball State University declined to comment on the lawsuit.

These cases are part of a troubling wider trend, according to union officials and lawyers representing academics nationwide.

“I think our numbers are around 40 faculty have been fired since the Kirk assassination, and that number is rapidly rising, although some folks who are fired, we're seeing getting reinstated,” Todd Wolfson, president of the American Association of University Professors, said.

Some were dismissed after aggressive criticism of Kirk, or even expressing satisfaction after his death. Others had been more restrained, but still faced reprisal.

“I don't know what all those 40 faculty said, and I probably don't agree with much of what was said, or some of what was said,” said Wolfson. “I don't know. But what we do know is that faculty have a right to due process, 100%, and this is a complete breach of their due process because of political pressure coming down from shock troops, from the Trump administration to state leaders, who are then attacking our members and faculty ruthlessly.”

Phillip Michael Hook, a tenured art professor at the University of South Dakota, is on leave over a post he made about Kirk. He, too, has filed a lawsuit, in which a court has granted a temporary preliminary injunction.

On a private social media account, Hook disparaged Kirk, stating that “apparently he was a hate spreading Nazi” and adding “where was all this concern when the politicians in Minnesota were shot?”

While he deleted the post three hours later, a screenshot was spread by LibsofTikTok, which called for his firing, along with South Dakota Republican officials.

“The essence of this case is the government cannot punish people for speech and the government cannot punish people for speaking out on the issues of the day,” Jim Leach, Cook's attorney, said. “The state of South Dakota sought to punish a university professor for speaking out after the shooting of Charlie Kirk and almost immediately the governor and the speaker of the house of South Dakota said this is unacceptable and he should be fired, and the University of South Dakota unfortunately complied.”

The University of South Dakota did not respond to multiple requests for comment.

“We think our members and faculty in higher ed deserve due process,” said Wolfson. “We think this is like one of many attempts to undermine academic freedom and freedom of speech on our campuses.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

An expert on anti-fascist groups who teaches at Rutgers University said he is fleeing with his family to Spain after getting death threats amid a campaign by the campus chapter of Turning Point USA and other conservative groups to get him fired.

Mark Bray, an assistant professor of history, on Thursday said that he made the move out of concern for his family's safety after being falsely labeled as a member of antifa, a term used to describe far-left activist groups that oppose fascism.

“I do not have any affiliation with any antifa group and don't plan to,” said Bray, who wrote the book Antifa: The Anti-Fascist Handbook, which documents the philosophy and tactics of militant anti-fascist movements in the US and around the world. He has taught courses on anti-fascism and terrorism at the university since 2019.

Right-wing influencers and others began criticizing Bray on social media after US President Donald Trump signed an executive order late last month designating antifa as a domestic terrorist organization. 

He said he moved his three classes online after he received a death threat late last month.

A petition calling for his removal from the university had been launched in the weeks following the assassination of the Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk. Bray's home address was revealed on social media.

The petition said he was an “outspoken, well-known antifa member” and referred to him as “Dr. Antifa.” 

Bray said he learned of the petition calling for his ouster when Fox News contacted him for comment, adding that he has since received additional threats. 

Rutgers said in a statement that it did not comment on personnel or student conduct matters.

The Turning Point chapter did not immediately respond to an e-mail seeking comment. 

Megyn Doyle, a Rutgers student and the treasurer for its Turning Point USA chapter, told Fox News last week that “when you have a teacher that so often promotes political violence ... we believe that it puts conservative students at risk for Antifa to come in.”

The group's online petition now has a statement saying it does not support the harassment or doxing — collecting and publishing a person's private or identifying information without their consent — Bray or anyone else.

Bray was previously the subject of public criticism over comments he made in news interviews in 2017, when he was a lecturer at Dartmouth College. 

In an appearance on NBC's Meet the Press, he said there were circumstances where violent self-defense is “a legitimate response” to violence by white supremacist and neo-Nazis.”

Bray told the New York Times earlier on Wednesday that “my role in this is as a professor. I've never been part of an antifa group, and I'm not currently.” 

Bray said that what he is experiencing is part of a broad effort to shut down discourse on college campuses.

“This is an example of the Trump administration trying to conflate protest with terrorism and public scholarship in a university with extremism,” he said. “Ultimately, it's manufactured outrage to create a boogeyman term to demonize protests.”

Bray plans to live in Spain and teach remotely for the current academic year, then hopes to be back on campus next fall. 

He had planned to fly to Spain on Wednesday night, but said that shortly before takeoff, he was notified by the airline that his family's reservations had been canceled. He and his wife, Yesenia Barragan, who is also an associate professor of history at Rutgers University, along with their two young children, flew out of the US for Spain early yesterday on another flight.

LONDON — The University of Tokyo was 26th in Times Higher Education's World University Ranking 2026, which was released on Thursday, its highest ever ranking.

Last year, it was ranked 28th. Kyoto University's ranking dropped from 55th place to 61st.

The University of Oxford in the United Kingdom topped the list for a tenth consecutive year. The top 10 universities were again dominated by American and British institutions.

China's Tsinghua University was 12th for a third consecutive year, making it the highest-ranked Asian university. Peking University also held on to its position, coming in 13th for the second year in a row. In total, five Chinese universities made the top 40, two more than last year.

Nine Japanese universities were listed among the world's top 500. Tohoku University rose to 103rd, its highest ever placement. The university was designated in November last year as the first recipient of the Universities for International Research Excellence program, a government program that will allocate portions of a ¥10 trillion university fund.

The Institute of Science Tokyo, which was formed in October last year through a merger of Tokyo Institute of Technology and Tokyo Medical and Dental University, was ranked in the 301–350 bracket. The rankings are calculated based on factors such as education environment, research quality and international outlook.

While the magazine noted that Japanese universities have improved in areas such as investments in doctoral programs, it noted that the country's representation at the top of the rankings has dipped slightly.

19:04 JST, October 10, 2025

Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba explicitly affirmed his commitment to the historical understanding of World War II expressed by successive cabinets, including Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's statement marking the 70th anniversary of the war's end.

In his statement marking the 80th anniversary, he noted, “Past statements by former prime ministers have not sufficiently addressed the question of why that war could not be avoided,” and called for reflection on the problems within the domestic political system at the time.

“On this milestone, I wish to contemplate this together with the people,” he added.

He pointed out five specific problems: The Constitution of the Empire of Japan, which lacked the principle of civilian control over the military; the government losing control over the military; the failure of parliament to provide oversight; media that actively supported the war; and inadequate intelligence gathering and analysis that failed to accurately grasp the international situation.

He expressed his view that “there was no mechanism to appropriately integrate politics and the military, and the military went out of control in the name of ensuring the independence of its supreme command.”

While saying that there are institutional measures now in place to prevent these problems, Ishiba emphasized that “irresponsible populism” and “narrow-minded nationalism” must be never allowed, in order that the political system continues to be operated as it should be.

“We must always be humble before history and inscribe the lessons from it on our heart,” he said.

The slow development of hypersonic weapons by the U.S., combined with the efforts of Russia and China, is creating ""battlefield asymmetry,"" Axios reported on Oct. 9, citing an Atlantic Council study.

The assessment shows a critical gap in U.S. military capabilities as Russia deploys hypersonic missiles against Ukraine and China rapidly advances its own arsenal.

The analysis, produced by a group that includes former senior U.S. defense and nuclear officials, urges Washington to accelerate deployments and overhaul production to close the gap.

The report assesses Russia's Kinzhal missile, which has been used against Ukraine, along with the Tsirkon and Avangard systems. It also reviews China's missile capabilities, including DF-17 and DF-26.

Russia is expected to manufacture close to 2,500 high-precision missiles in 2025, spanning cruise, ballistic, and hypersonic classes, according to Ukraine's military intelligence (HUR).

The U.S. is developing several weapons, including the Long-Range Hypersonic Weapon, Conventional Prompt Strike, Air-Launched Rapid Response Weapon, and Hypersonic Attack Cruise Missile.

Hypersonic weapons travel at speeds exceeding Mach 5 (approximately 3,800 miles per hour or 6,200 kilometers per hour), covering long distances in seconds, which can render traditional interception systems ineffective. 

Defense systems, including terminal high-altitude weapons and Patriot air defense systems, can be overwhelmed by barrage fire, and replenishing them is too expensive.

The Patriot system, a U.S.-made surface-to-air missile platform, is widely recognized for its high-precision detection, tracking, and interception of aircraft, cruise, and ballistic missiles.

The study appeared amid reports that U.S. President Donald Trump's administration is developing expensive defense programs, such as a missile shield costing $175 billion, known as the ""Golden Dome.""

The report's authors recommend combining rapid deployment with long-term changes in production and international cooperation to close the gap with Russia and China.

The U.S. recently concluded that it is also lagging behind Russia in drone production. Washington unveiled a low-cost combat drone aimed at rivaling Iranian-designed Shahed-type attack drones.

U.S. President Donald Trump said on Oct. 9 that he might propose removing Spain from NATO, claiming the country fails to meet defense spending requirements.

The president made the remark during a meeting with Finnish President Alexander Stubb, praising Finland for increasing its defense spending while criticizing Spain as a ""laggard.""

""Spain — you have to call them and find, why are they a laggard?"" the U.S. president said. ""And they're doing well too, you know. Because of a lot of the things we've done, they're doing fine.""

""They have no excuse not to do this. Maybe you should throw them out of NATO, frankly.""

Trump has long accused NATO members of underfunding their militaries and relying too heavily on the U.S. He has pushed to raise the defense spending targets well above the 2% standard.

At NATO's June summit, allies agreed to Trump's proposal to increase defense spending to 5% of gross domestic product (GDP), with 3.5% for core military spending and 1.5% for security investments. 

Spain, governed by a Socialist-led coalition, was the only member that refused to adopt the benchmark.

""Committing to a 5% target would not only be unreasonable, but also counterproductive,"" Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez wrote, arguing it would ""move Spain further away from optimal spending.""

According to NATO estimates for 2024, only 23 of 32 members reached the 2% goal. NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte nevertheless said that all allies are expected to hit the 2% benchmark by the end of this year as defense expenditures grow.

Spain spent only 1.24% GDP on defense in 2024 — the lowest share in the alliance — but pledged to increase it to 2.1% on core military spending.

While Trump's remarks underscore his confrontational approach to alliance burden-sharing, NATO's founding treaty does not provide a mechanism for expelling a member.  

Membership is based on sovereign consent, and decisions are made by consensus, meaning only political or diplomatic pressure could be used if a member fails to meet commitments.

Prime Minister Mark Carney has been under pressure to achieve relief from U.S. tariffs, especially those on steel, aluminum, lumber and autos.Adrian Wyld/The Canadian Press

Prime Minister Mark Carney says that intense negotiations continue at the highest levels of the Trump administration for tariff relief on key Canadian sectors, and that those talks include reviving the Keystone XL pipeline. 

The Globe reported Thursday that Dominic LeBlanc, the minister responsible for U.S. trade, has remained in Washington since Tuesday's meeting between the Prime Minister and President Donald Trump.

Mr. LeBlanc and Kristen Hillman, Canada's ambassador to the U.S. and Ottawa's chief negotiator, have been meeting with U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and Trade Representative Jamieson Greer. 

Privy Council Clerk Michael Sabia, Canada's top public servant, had also been part of the Washington talks but returned to Ottawa late Thursday.

Mr. LeBlanc returned to Ottawa Friday and said on X that Canadian officials will continue talks with U.S. officials over the coming days.

Top Carney minister and officials remain in Washington for trade talks

At a news conference in Ottawa on Friday, Mr. Carney acknowledged that the U.S. talks are at a critical stage.

“Intensive negotiations are in train right now for the sectors of steel and aluminum and in parallel conversations on forest products and automobiles,” he told reporters. 

The goal of the talks is to reach an agreement so that those industries are not punished again when the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement comes up for renewal next year. That deal allows about 85 per cent of Canadian goods and products to flow duty-free into the U.S. economy. 

“We are negotiating specific sectoral deals with them, which would likely persist with a revised USMCA,” the Prime Minister said. “It means that this is not one simple trade deal which will resolve all the issues, which is why we are focused on retaining the huge advantage that we have relative to the rest of the world.”

He added that both sides are also “bearing down on a few projects within the energy sector,” including reviving the Keystone oil pipeline to Texas from Alberta, which was cancelled by former president Joe Biden.

Opinion: A Keystone notion for Trump but still a mostly a pipeline dream

Members of Mr. Carney's government have held talks with possible proponents of Keystone, but he did not get into details of which companies have been approached.

The Prime Minister said the government has also not ruled out lifting a tanker ban on the Pacific coast – if conditions such as a reduction of greenhouse gas emissions through carbon capture and storage can be achieved.

He also did not rule out a second oil pipeline from Alberta to the West Coast, providing there is a viable private corporate sponsor, Indigenous buy-in and measures in place to protect the climate.

Mr. Carney, who ran for prime minister on a promise to defend the Canadian economy against U.S. protectionism, has been under pressure to achieve relief from punitive U.S. tariffs, especially those on steel, aluminum, lumber and autos from Canada and other countries.

Trade talks faltered after no deal was reached by an August deadline imposed by Mr. Trump. But the relationship between the two administrations appeared to strengthen in the weeks leading up to Tuesday's visit, which was Mr. Carney's second as Prime Minister after a trip in May.

After the meeting this week, Mr. Carney and Mr. Trump instructed their ministers to work quickly to try to iron out a deal on the sector-specific tariffs.

Welcome to The Globe and Mail's business and investing news quiz. Join us each week to test your knowledge of the stories making headlines. Our business reporters come up with the questions, and you can show us what you know.

This week: Artificial intelligence companies are powering a surge in the stock market, but not everyone believes the sector's prosperity is here to stay. Who said that? Take our quiz and find out.

c. US$4,000 per troy ounce. Gold has doubled over the past two years and this week rocketed past US$4,000 a troy ounce. What's driving the bullion frenzy? It's not entirely clear, but it's tough to argue with such powerful momentum.

a. The Bank of England. On Wednesday, the Bank of England flagged the growing risk that tech stock prices could burst. Hours later, the head of the International Monetary Fund raised a similar alarm.

b. Jeff Bezos. Mr. Bezos, the founder of Amazon.com, told an Italian tech conference that artificial intelligence is currently in an “industrial bubble,” with some prices disconnected from reality. However, he said AI is “real” and will bring big benefits to society.

a. U.S. President Donald Trump said it of Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney. Their talks seemed more genial than past negotiations, but settled little, especially when it came to the contentious matter of the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or USMCA. Mr. Trump suggested he might walk away from the deal, which is up for review next year and instead pursue separate trade pacts with Canada and Mexico. So who's really the nasty one?

a. Large trucks. Mr. Trump said all medium- and heavy-duty trucks imported into the U.S. will face a 25 per cent tariff rate starting Nov. 1. The announcement is a bit baffling, since making trucks more expensive will raise the cost of transportation for all products – not a great outcome for someone who says he wants to tame inflation.

d. It announced the U.S. government is investing in its shares. The U.S. government is paying US$35.6-million for a 10 per cent stake in Canadian junior miner Trilogy Metals as part of an aggressive push by the Trump administration to bolster national security by improving U.S. access to key critical minerals. Trilogy shares surged by more than 210 per cent on the news.

d. 3,700 pages. The report, from the Chartered Professional Accountants of Ontario, recommended that Ottawa form a royal commission to conduct a thorough review of the entire Canadian tax system – the first such review since 1962. Since then, the Income Tax Act has swelled to around 3,700 pages.

c. It launched a couple of lower-cost models. Tesla rolled out “affordable” versions of its best-selling Model Y SUV and its Model 3 sedan, but the starting prices of US$39,990 and US$36,990 strike some observers as still too high.

b. It violated rules of a migrant workers' program. Bolero Shellfish Processing Inc., based in Saint-Simon, N.B., was fined $1-million for violating rules of the Temporary Foreign Worker Program – the largest fine that the federal government has ever levied on a company for misusing the program for migrant labour.

d. The report was full of AI-generated errors. Hey, isn't AI supposed to be a huge productivity boost? Maybe not. Deloitte Australia will partially refund the AUD$440,000 (CAD$405,000) that the Australian government paid for a report that was littered with apparent AI-generated errors, including a fabricated quote from a federal court judgment and references to nonexistent academic research papers.

b. Three. Mr. Lecornu was the third French prime minister to resign in the past year. His departure – hours before his first cabinet meeting – will pile more pressure on French President Emmanuel Macron to either find someone else who can form a government or call parliamentary elections.

c. More competition. The Bank of Canada warned this week against imposing more regulations on the financial sector. Instead, it urged measures to encourage more competition in the industry.

Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado, who lives in hiding, won the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize on Friday for fighting dictatorship in the country, receiving the award despite U.S. President Donald Trump's repeated insistence he deserved it.

Machado, a 58-year-old industrial engineer, was blocked in 2024 by Venezuela's courts from running for president and thus challenging President Nicolas Maduro, who has been in power since 2013.

“Oh my God ... I have no words,” Machado told the secretary of the award body, Kristian Berg Harpviken, in a phone call which the Nobel Committee posted on social media.

“I thank you so much, but I hope you understand this is a movement, this is an achievement of a whole society. I am just one person. I certainly do not deserve it,” she added.

The White House criticized the decision, just days after Trump announced a breakthrough in talks to halt the fighting in Gaza between Israel and Hamas.

“President Trump will continue making peace deals, ending wars, and saving lives ... The Nobel Committee proved they place politics over peace,” White House spokesperson Steven Cheung said in a post on X.

Maduro, whose 12 years in office have been marked by deep economic and social crisis, was sworn in for a third term in January this year, despite a six-month-long election dispute, international calls for him to stand aside and an increase in the U.S. reward offered for his capture.

“When authoritarians seize power, it is crucial to recognize courageous defenders of freedom who rise and resist,” the Norwegian Nobel Committee said in its citation.

It was not immediately clear whether she would be able to attend the award ceremony in Oslo on December 10.

Should she not attend, she would join the list of Peace Prize laureates prevented from doing so in the award's 124-year-history, including Soviet dissident Andrei Sakharov in 1975, Poland's Lech Walesa in 1983 and Myanmar's Aung San Suu Kyi in 1991.

Machado is the first Venezuelan to win the Nobel Peace Prize and the sixth from Latin America.

The United Nations human rights office welcomed the award to Machado as a recognition of “the clear aspirations of the people of Venezuela for free and fair elections.”

The head of the award committee, Joergen Watne Frydnes, said he hoped the award would spur the Venezuelan opposition's work.

“We hope that the entire opposition will have renewed energy to continue the work for a peaceful transition from dictatorship to democracy,” Frydnes told Reuters after the announcement.

It could also strengthen international pressure against the Maduro administration, said Human Rights Watch's Americas director, Juanita Goebertus Estrada.

The lead-up to this year's award was dominated by Trump's repeated public statements that he deserved to win the Nobel Peace Prize. Trump is also a fierce critic of Maduro.

“I think the main takeaway is that the committee is again demonstrating its independence, that they wouldn't be swayed by popular opinions or political leaders to award the prize,” Halvard Leira, research director at the Norwegian Institute of International Affairs, told Reuters.

“The democratic opposition of Venezuela is something that the U.S. has been eager to support. So, in that sense, it would be hard for anyone to constitute this as an insult to Trump.”

The United States has struck several vessels allegedly carrying drugs off the coast of Venezuela in recent weeks.

Trump has also said the U.S. would look into attacking drug cartels “coming by land” in Venezuela.

Trump has determined that the U.S. is engaged in “a non-international armed conflict” with drug cartels, according to a document notifying Congress of its legal justification for deadly U.S. strikes on boats off Venezuela.

Frydnes, the Nobel committee leader, declined to say what it would take for Trump or others to win the prize in the future, or if efforts to end the fighting in Gaza could lead to an award in 2026.

“If it is nominated, then it will be considered, but time will show,” Frydnes said.

“It's not our task to tell other people or other countries what to do, our task is to give out the peace prize ... So we'll have to see next year.”

The committee took its final decision before a ceasefire and hostage deal under the first phase of Trump's initiative to end the war in Gaza was announced on Wednesday.

Ahead of the Nobel announcement, experts on the award had also said Trump was very unlikely to win as his policies were seen as dismantling the international world order the Nobel committee cherishes.

The peace prize is the fifth Nobel awarded this week, after literature, chemistry, physics and medicine. Japanese organization Nihon Hidankyo, a grassroots movement of atomic bomb survivors from Hiroshima and Nagasaki, won in 2024.

The Nobel Peace Prize, worth 11 million Swedish crowns, or about US$1.2-million, will be presented in Oslo on December 10, the anniversary of the death of Swedish industrialist Alfred Nobel, who founded the awards in his 1895 will.

In her announcement at the White House Friday, Melania Trump said she has ""an open channel of communication regarding the welfare"" of thousands of children who were forcibly transferred to Russia from occupied eastern Ukraine.

She said the talks were initiated after she sent Putin a letter via her husband Donald Trump when the US and Russian presidents met for a peace summit in Alaska in August, which has failed to yield any meaningful breakthrough.

""Much has unfolded since President Putin received my letter last August. He responded in writing signalling a willingness to engage with me directly and outlining details regarding the Ukrainian children residing in Russia,"" the US First Lady told a press conference.

She added that both Russia and the US had had ""several back channel meetings and calls, all in good faith"" concerning the reunification of children with their families.

The leaders of the United Kingdom, France and Germany said Friday that they have agreed to ""progress toward using"" the value of frozen Russian assets to help finance Ukraine in its defense against Russia's invasion.

In a joint statement, the leaders of the three European allies — known collectively as the E3 — said they aimed for the United States to closely cooperate in that endeavor.

""We will increase pressure on Russia as President Putin continues his stalling tactics and abhorrent attacks in response to peace talks,"" the statement by the UK's Keir Starmer, France's Emmanuel Macron and Germany's Friedrich Merz said.

""To that end, we are ready to progress towards using, in a coordinated way, the value of the immobilized Russian sovereign assets to support Ukraine's armed forces and thus bring Russia to the negotiation table.""

At a meeting in Copenhagen this month, the European Commission (EC) proposed the new ""reparations"" loan mechanism, which would see the funds disbursed in tranches, EC President Ursula von der Leyen said.

Earlier on Friday, Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelenskyy had said that he had discussed using Russian assets with the president of the European Central Bank, Christine Lagarde.

""We discussed how to ensure the fair use of frozen Russian assets to protect against Russia's war and to help rebuild life in Ukraine. There are solutions for how this can be done,"" Zelenskyy said on X. 

In a later post, the Ukrainian leader said a decision on using the assets was ""getting closer.""

Moscow has accused authorities in Kyiv of interrupting negotiations brokered by Turkey to resolve the war in Ukraine.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov on Friday blamed ""Kyiv's unwillingness to respond in any way"" to issues raised by Russia.

Moscow has repeatedly said the ""root causes"" of the war in Ukraine need to be addressed for a lasting peace to be agreed.

But those core demands include Ukraine abandoning its pro-Western ambitions, including joining NATO, as well as installing a government that favors close ties with Moscow. 

When Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022, Russian President Vladimir Putin said one of the aims of Moscow's ""special military operation"" was to ""demilitarize and denazify"" the regime in Kyiv.

Those aims refer to claims propagated by the Kremlin that the Ukrainian government is backing neo-Nazis, particularly in the Donbas region in eastern Ukraine, where Russia has backed separatists and occupied swathes of resource-rich territory.

During the interview with Russian state television, Peskov also said that Russia remains optimistic that an August summit in Alaska between Putin and US President Donald Trump would deliver peace. 

""Given that we maintain our determination to proceed towards a peaceful resolution, it's possible to say that the impetus is alive and will hopefully continue, and that President Trump retains the political will for peaceful settlement,"" he said, according to Russian state news agency TASS.

Peskov's remarks come despite the fact that no tangible progress has been made since Putin and Trump met in Anchorage.

Trump has spoken of his frustration with Putin at the situation and has appeared to shift his support towards Ukraine in recent weeks.

Russian President Vladimir Putin has said his country is already in a nuclear arms race with the United States and other major world powers.

Putin was speaking to reporters at the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) summit in Tajikistan on Friday, which gathers the leaders of former Soviet states from across Eurasia. 

His remarks come two weeks after Putin said he was willing to extend the limit on nuclear warheads under a treaty between the US and Russia, if Washington is ready to do the same. The New START treaty is set to expire in February. 

""Will these few months be enough to make a decision on an extension? I think it will be enough if there is goodwill to extend these agreements. And if the Americans decide they don't need it, that's not a big deal for us,"" Putin said.

The Russian leader added that Moscow would continue to develop and test next-generation nuclear weapons.

""We're ready to negotiate if it's acceptable and useful for the Americans. If not, then no, but that would be a shame, because then there would be nothing left in terms of deterrence in the area of ​​strategic offensive weapons,"" Putin said.

Russia's president also addressed the possibility that other, unnamed countries might be preparing to carry out nuclear tests. Putin warned that Russia would perform a test if other countries do so first.

North Korea, one of Russia's closest allies, is the only country to have tested nuclear weapons in the 21st century.

Some seucirty experts have raised fears that one country testing a nuclear weapon could trigger a domino effect that sees other nuclear powers do the same.

""There's always a temptation to test the effectiveness of the same fuel that's been in missiles for many, many years. All of this is being simulated on computers, and experts believe that is sufficient, but some of these same experts believe repeat tests are necessary,"" Putin said.

""So some countries are thinking about it; as far as I know, they're even preparing, and that's why I said that if they do it, we'll do the same,"" Putin added.

Poland's Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski has said his country is ready to provide generators, extra electricity supplies and a Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) terminal to neighboring Ukraine.

The pledge comes after Moscow has stepped up its attacks in recent weeks targeting Ukrainian energy infrastructure, including a massive barrage of drones and missiles overnight.

The attack severed power to large parts of the country, including the capital, Kyiv, where water supplies were also interrupted.

During a visit to the western Ukrainian city of Lviv, Sikorski said, ""Generators, extra electricity supplies, accelerated construction of power connections between Ukraine and Poland, and of course, our LNG terminal in Swinoujscie"" would be made available to Ukraine. 

""This is another escalation, because we know why it's being carried out. It's meant to intimidate people ahead of winter,"" Sikorski added during a press conference with his Ukrainian counterpart Andrii Sybiha.

Russia's overnight strikes on Kyiv temporarily cut off water supplies to 2 million households, Ukraine's deputy prime minister has said.

In a post on Telegram, Oleksiy Kuleba said that the water supply had been restored to 2 million customers, but some 4,000 homes were still cut off.

Kuleba also said that work to ""eliminate the consequences of the massive shelling of Ukraine's energy facilities is ongoing.""

""This is a deliberate decision by the Russian Federation to disrupt the heating season, sow panic within the country, and destabilize the situation,"" Kuleba said.

Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko had said earlier on Friday that around half of the Ukrainian capital had been left without power.

He said the strikes overnight came exactly three years after Russia first targeted Ukraine's energy system with drones and missiles.

Oleksandr Syrskyi, commander of the Ukrainian armed forces, said Ukraine struck targets in Russia 70 times last month.

""We are destroying the production of fuels and lubricants, explosives, and other components of the Russian military-industrial complex in the aggressor country,"" he wrote on Facebook.

""In particular, oil refining in Russia has been reduced by 21%,"" Syrskyi added.

With diplomatic efforts to end the war stalled, Ukraine has increasingly targeted Russia's oil refining capacity. Meanwhile, Russian forces have focused on crippling Ukrainian gas production and energy infrastructure.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called on allies to respond with concrete measures after Russia launched a barrage of drones and missiles at Ukrainian energy facilities.

In a statement posted on X, Zelensky said, ""What's needed is not window dressing but decisive action — from the United States, Europe, and the G7 — in delivering air defense systems and enforcing sanctions.""

He added that Russia had launched more than 450 drones and over 30 missiles in the overnight attack.

US President Donald Trump suggested expelling Spain from NATO due to a disagreement about the Western European nation's military spending.

During Thursday's meeting in the Oval Office with Alexander Stubb, president of Finland, Trump said European leaders must persuade Spain to increase its commitment to the alliance.

""You people are going to have to start speaking to Spain,"" Trump said. ""You have to call them and find out why they're lagging behind.""

He added, ""They have no excuse not to do this, but that's all right. Maybe you should throw them out of NATO, frankly.""

In June, NATO members agreed to sharply increase their military spending to 5% of their gross domestic product (GDP), a major priority for Trump, who wanted Europeans to spend more on their own defense.

However, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said at the time that he would not commit to the 5% target, calling it ""incompatible with our welfare state and our world vision.""

Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, has been targeted in an overnight missile and drone attack by Russia, the Ukrainian air force said.

""The capital of the country is under an enemy ballistic missile attack and a massive attack by the enemy strike drones,"" the Ukrainian air force said and urged residents to remain in shelters. 

Journalists from the AFP news agency reported hearing several large explosions in the city and power outages at their homes located in several parts of the capital.

Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko said Russian attacks on ""critical infrastructure"" left at least nine people injured, five of whom needed hospital treatment.

""The left bank of the capital is without electricity. There are also problems with water supply,"" Klitschko said on the Telegram platform.

Ukrainian Energy Minister Svitlana Grynchuk said Russian forces were ""inflicting a massive strike"" on the country's energy sites.

""Energy workers are taking all necessary measures to minimize the negative consequences,"" Grynchuk said on Facebook.

""As soon as security conditions allow, energy workers will begin clarifying the consequences of the attack and restoration work,"" she said.

A regional official said that a seven-year-old child was killed in Zaporizhzhia in the southeastern part of the country.

""Tragic news. A 7-year-old boy who was wounded in a nighttime Russian attack has died in hospital,"" Ivan Fedorov said on the Telegram platform.

As another winter approaches, Russian forces have been targeting Ukraine's critical infrastructure as the invasion continues.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:dw.com","Germany news: Investigators raid homes of Frankfurt police","https://www.dw.com/en/germany-news-investigators-raid-homes-of-frankfurt-police/live-74302972","Fri, 10 Oct 2025 10:40:37 GMT","

Investigators have searched the homes and offices of 17 Frankfurt police officers accused of assault and obstruction of justice. Meanwhile, two far-right AfD lawmakers have lost parliamentary immunity. DW has the latest.

State police and prosecutors have searched the homes and offices of 17 Frankfurt police officers accused of assault, obstruction of justice, and wrongful prosecution.

Prosecutors say six men were allegedly injured during or after arrest between February and April, and that officers may have filed false cases to cover up their actions.

About 150 state police officers joined the raids, seizing phones and data devices, with investigators stressing there are no signs of extremist motives.

Meanwhile, Germany's lower house has removed legal immunity from two far-right politicians, paving the way for proceedings against them.

Here is a roundup of this and other top headlines from Germany on Wednesday, October 10:

German police were involved in a car chase in the western German city of Münster (NRW) on Thursday night, pursuing a stolen Porsche driven by a 15-year-old suspected to have been under the influence of narcotics.

Police were reportedly informed of a group of teenagers sat in an expensive sports car in a supermarket carpark by a witness. When a police patrol arrived at the scene, the driver allegedly sped off, scraping the police car as he did so.

Shortly after, he reportedly ignored instructions to stop from another police patrol.

The car, which was eventually spotted in a wooded area by a police helicopter, was found to have been reported stolen at the end of September.

The teenage driver, who had tried to hide in the woods, was arrested and is set to face a string of charges.

The center-left Social Democrats (SPD), the junior partner in Germany's conservative CDU/CSU-led coalition, have defended their support for the government's welfare reforms and criticized senior conservatives for suggesting that basic unemployment benefits known as Bürgergeld (""citizens' money"") are effectively being scrapped.

Recipients who work cooperatively with job centers and fulfill the usual requirements ""have absolutely nothing to fear,"" said Minister for Labor and Social Affairs, Bärbel Bas (SPD), on Friday.

She insisted that the reforms are not aimed at ""abolishing"" the basic payments, but merely at ""sharpening"" sanctions for those who don't fulfill requirements.

Bas also criticized remarks from senior conservatives including Chancellor Friedrich Merz (CDU) and Bavarian Premier Markus Söder (CSU) after the latter claimed for instance: ""Bürgergeld is now history.""

""For those who do everything correctly, who cooperate, who want [to find work], this legislation changes absolutely nothing,"" Bas said.

""I found the phrase 'Bürgergeld is history' problematic because it suggests that we've scrapped unemployment benefits altogether.""

Introduced in January 2023 by the previous SPD-led government, the Bürgergeld replaced its previous iteration with a higher grant of €502 per month (instead of €449), which increased to €563 per month in 2024.

Germany's national rail operator Deutsche Bahn will not raise long-distance ticket prices next year, the company said Friday.

""We want to send a clear signal with stable prices,"" a spokesperson for the state-owned company said, adding that BahnCard discounts will also remain unchanged. The decision comes in response to widespread delays and aims to prevent passengers from switching to other modes of transport.

In September 2025, only about 55% of long-distance trains arrived on time — significantly fewer than a year earlier.

Trains are considered on time if they arrive less than six minutes late.

The rail company has said the main cause of delays is the aging rail network, which is set to undergo extensive renovation over the next decade.

Prosecutors and state criminal police have searched the homes and offices of 17 officers from Frankfurt's 1st Police Precinct, authorities said Friday.

The five female and 12 male officers, aged between 24 and 56, are under investigation for assault in office, obstruction of justice and wrongful prosecution.

The probe concerns incidents between February and late April in which six men allegedly suffered physical harm during or after arrest. Investigators said officers may also have opened criminal cases against five of the victims to justify their own actions.

Around 150 Hesse state police officers took part in the searches, seizing mobile phones and data storage devices for analysis. Prosecutors said there is no evidence so far of extremist motives. The investigation is ongoing.

German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has hailed the agreed ceasefire in Gaza as ""good news for people in the Middle East and far beyond,"" after more than two years of war.

In a series of posts on the social media platform X, Merz thanked US President Donald Trump for his peace initiative and expressed gratitude to mediators in Qatar, Egypt, and Turkey, as well as to Israel ""for opening the path to peace.""

Merz said the priority now is the swift implementation of the agreement.

Germany's parliament has lifted the immunity of far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) lawmakers Stephan Brandner and Matthias Moosdorf, paving the way for criminal investigations into alleged offenses, including insult and a suspected Nazi salute.

Lawmakers from the conservative CDU/CSU bloc, the center-left Social Democrats, the Greens, and the socialist Left Party voted in favor of the move late Thursday, while the AfD abstained. The decision allows prosecutors to proceed with formal investigations.

According to an AfD spokesperson, Brandner is accused of insulting a journalist, while Moosdorf faces allegations of making a Hitler salute.

Brandner, the AfD's deputy leader, has been in a legal dispute for more than a year with a journalist from Der Spiegel news magazine whom Brandner allegedly called a ""fascist."" Prosecutors in Gera are leading the case.

Moosdorf, known for his pro-Russian stance, is also under scrutiny within the party over an honorary professorship in Moscow. The Bundestag committee overseeing parliamentary immunity said enforcement and criminal proceedings will now go ahead.

Chancellor Merz's coalition has agreed to place tight restrictions on welfare recipients and promote the purchase of German-made electric vehicles. The news came ahead of a major auto industry summit. 

This blog is now closed. Thank you for reading. 

Here are the headlines from across Germany on Thursday, October 9:

Police shot and wounded a man thought to be carrying a firearm in central Düsseldorf on Thursday. 

Police said the man was seen brandishing a weapon near a fast-food restaurant on a large commercial street. 

It was not clear if the weapon was real or a replica, police said, but the man did not heed orders to lay it on the ground. 

At that point, police opened fire, hitting the man at least once. He was treated by an emergency doctor at the scene and then taken to hospital injured. 

Police cordoned off a large are of the street amid the operation.

A glass of Glühwein, or mulled wine, at Germany's Christmas markets this year is liable to cost at least €5 (not including the deposit for the mug) this winter, according to a newspaper report on Thursday. 

The head of the German Federation of Wine Cellers, Peter Rotthaus, said in an interview with the Rheinische Post newspaper that he anticipated average prices to rise by at least 10% this year compared to 2024. 

Rotthaus named a number of reasons for this, but primarily he cited what appears to be a poor harvest year internationally for fruit wines. 

He also said that costs including freight, packaging, wages and energy all contributed to the rising prices. 

Rotthaus also said consumers should expect quite large regional variations in prices based on local conditions. His federation estimates that Germans and visiting tourists consume around 50 million liters of mulled wine in a bid to stay warm and lubricated at Christmas markets each winter.

German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has spoken out against the EU's current goal of phasing out new cars with internal combustion engines by 2035, only allowing the registration of new electric vehicles by that date. 

Merz was speaking at a summit with other German political leaders and leading representatives of the country's struggling car industry. 

""Such a hard cutoff in 2035 will not take place, if I have anything to do with it, and I will do all I can to achieve this,"" Merz said in Berlin. 

Deputy Chancellor Lars Klingbeil, a member of the Social Democrats and so the leading representative of Merz's junior coalition partner, had also signaled a willingness for changes to the plans.

In particular, he cited cars like plug-in hybrids, so-called range extenders (fuel-powered generators used to augment an electric motor and battery pack with a fraction of the fuel needed to power a traditional engine) and those using innovative fuel mixtures.

The EU set the target of registering no new fuel-powered cars as of 2035 in 2022. Many industry leaders have voiced doubts in the feasibility of the proposal, and some have even questioned its environmental credentials. The EU itself is now racing to review the policy proposal, perhaps with an eye to compromise.

Germany is scrambling to try to prop up its renowned car industry, which has been struggling with increased competition from China, decreased demand for cars in general in Europe, new barriers to trade in the US and China, and an array of other issues as well as the transition toward electric motoring. 

More than 50,000 jobs were lost in the car sector in Germany in 2024, a recent study found.

Germany's DAX index has hit a new all-time high, eclipsing the previous record level set this July. 

The benchmark index rose 0.5% to a high of 24,708.97 points during Thursday's trade.

The DAX has been buoyant so far in October, rising by roughly 3.5% during the month.

Factors including the potential reduction in tensions in the Middle East and hopes for a cut in interest rates in the US and possibly from the European Central Bank are thought to play a role.

However, the signals on trading floors remain mixed, at best. While western indices broadly continue their largely inexplicable and accelerated upward trend of recent years, renonwed ""safe haven"" investments like gold remain in extreme demand — which is usually a sign of low investor confidence.

Germans are booking significantly fewer trips to the United States this winter, according to the DRV travel association. The group predicted a 27% drop in sales for the November to April season.

Over the summer, bookings to the US had been about one-fifth lower than the previous year, DRV said.

Increasing costs may be a factor, as well as the fact that Germany updated its travel advisory for the US in March. The warning stated that a valid ESTA visa waiver was not a guarantee for entry into the United States after a string of high-profile detentions of ordinary Germans by US immigration authorities.

In contrast, the DRV reported that winter trips to Southeast Asia and Africa are expected to climb by 16% and 25%, respectively.  

Britta Hasselmann, parliamentary leader of the opposition Green party, slammed the government's planned reforms shortly after they were announced. Hasselmann called the proposals ""cold-hearted and inhumane"" as well as ""unconstitutional.""

""The CDU and SPD want to take away everything people need to live,"" Hasselmann told the German news agency dpa, saying the reforms take away money for food and housing, including from families with children.

""It would also be unconstitutional,"" she said, because the state has ""a responsibility and a welfare state that provides for a sociocultural minimum standard of living.""

Those on the right, however, celebrated the news. Markus Söder, the leader of the CDU's Bavarian sister party, the CSU, hailed that a form of basic income for welfare recipients was ""history.""

There was also criticism launched at the SPD for abandoning its dedication to a robust social welfare state, but party leadership seemed to have little time for nay-sayers, particularly from the SPD's left flank.

""We are tightening sanctions to the limit of what is constitutionally permissible,"" Minister for Labor and Social Affairs Bärbel Bas of the SPD said.

Germany's governing coalition presented their final agreement for package of reforms that has been heavily touted by Chancellor Merz for months.

The marathon discussions lasted most of Wednesday and well into the night, amid claims there has been significant opposition to many of Merz's plans from the more left-leaning members of junior coalition partner the SPD.

However, the parties showed a united front on Thursday morning, announcing tigher restrictions on social welfare payments, changes to the pension system, and new subsidies for electric vehicles in response to competition from China.

""We will significantly strengthen obligations to cooperate and we will also significantly increase the possibilities for sanctions,"" Merz said of the changes to the German welfare system.

Melania Trump convinced Vladimir Putin to reunite eight Ukrainian children with their families through one-on-one talks with the Russian president.

In a rare public speech at the White House, the first lady said Putin had engaged with her “directly” on the issue of repatriating Ukrainian children held in Russia.

“President Putin and I have had an open channel of communication regarding the welfare of these children,” she said. “For the past three months, both sides have participated in several back channel meetings and calls, all in good faith.

“We have agreed to cooperate with each other for the benefit of all people involved in this war.

“My representative has been working directly with President Putin's team to ensure the safe reunification of children with their families between Russia and Ukraine.”

In August, the White House revealed she had written to Putin, asking him to help protect children afflicted by the Ukraine-Russia war.

Her letter was handed to the Russian president when he met with his American counterpart in Alaska for high-level talks about the Russia-Ukraine conflict.

Mrs Trump wrote that “it is time” to protect children and future generations worldwide.

“Every child shares the same quiet dreams in their heart, whether born randomly into a nation's rustic countryside or a magnificent city centre. They dream of love, possibility, and safety from danger,” her letter said.

US researchers have identified more than 210 sites where Ukrainian children have been taken for military training, drone manufacturing, and other forced re-education by Russia, as part of a large-scale deportation programme.

“Again, this remains an ongoing effort,” Mrs Trump said. “Plans are already on their way to reunify more children in the immediate future.

“I hope peace will come soon. It can begin with children.”

The first lady made her announcement in the grand entry foyer of the White House, against a backdrop of portraits of former US presidents.

Mrs Trump, recently emerging as a quiet diplomatic power in the White House, was a largely absent figure for much of Mr Trump's first six months.

She made clear that she detests the attention of the press and is reluctant to speak in public. Her announcement was brief and she left without taking questions.

Despite rarely appearing in public, Mrs Trump has emerged as a quiet force in the administration's foreign policy.

Mr Trump has described how his wife has guided him at times in his talks with Putin, and how they had looked at horrifying images of emaciated children in Gaza together.

She has advised her husband to take a more sceptical approach to Putin.

“I go home,” Mr Trump told reporters in July. “I tell the first lady ‘I spoke to Vladimir today. We had a wonderful conversation.'

“She said ‘oh really? Another city was just hit.”

Earlier this year, The Telegraph revealed how the first lady had been the driving force in her husband's decision to launch air strikes on Syria in 2017.

A former official described how she had been deeply moved by images of children dying after a chemical weapons attack by the regime of Bashar al-Assad.

“I think she reacts to human suffering as a mom, without a policy or political filter, and shares her gut reaction with her husband,” they said.

Volodymyr Zelensky has repeatedly called for the release of Ukrainian children held in Russia.

Speaking on Tuesday, Mr Zelensky said that returning the children was a “priority”.

“We need to bring them back to their families, to their relatives,” he said, announcing that “preparations are under way for a UN General Assembly resolution condemning the abduction and deportation of Ukrainian children”.

Mrs Trump's diplomatic efforts have also extended past Ukraine. In September, the Turkish first lady wrote to her American counterpart urging her help in ending the suffering in Gaza.

Her announcement came at the end of an extraordinary week of diplomacy.

Mr Trump is expected to fly to the Middle East at the weekend as Hamas begins to release hostages as part of its historic ceasefire deal with Israel to end the war in Gaza.

Mr Trump has not enjoyed the same luck in making progress to end the Russia-Ukraine conflict, despite pledging to end it on day one of his presidency.

Following a meeting with Mr Zelensky at the United Nations General Assembly in New York last month, Mr Trump made a post on Truth Social in which he urged the Ukrainian leader to take back all of Ukraine's territory won by Russia and “go even further than that”.

He said in his post: “I think Ukraine, with the support of the European Union, is in a position to fight and WIN all of Ukraine back in its original form.”

Dismissing Russia as a “paper tiger” in economic peril, Mr Trump added that Ukraine could “take back their country in its original form and, who knows, maybe even go further than that!”.

On Friday, the Russian leader praised Mr Trump's peace efforts in Ukraine and the Middle East.

Asked about the US president's apparent Nobel Peace Prize snub, Putin said: “[Trump] is really doing a lot to resolve such complex crises that have lasted for years and even decades.

“There have been cases where the committee has awarded the Nobel Peace Prize to people who have done nothing for peace... In my view, these decisions have done enormous damage to the prestige of this prize.”

Mr Trump thanked Putin for his comments in a post on Truth Social.

The charges come weeks after Trump demanded that Attorney General Pam Bondi target James for prosecution.

A Virginia-based federal grand jury has charged New York Attorney General Letitia James (D) with mortgage fraud, weeks after President Donald Trump demanded that Attorney General Pam Bondi push Department of Justice (DOJ) officials to target her for prosecution.

James's office had sued Trump while he was a private citizen between his two presidential terms, alleging that his company had committed fraud while he was running for office in 2016. She has been a frequent subject of Trump's ire since then, most recently in September, when Trump posted a message on Truth Social directing Bondi to go after James and a number of other figures he perceives as political opponents.

This week, it was revealed that the Truth Social post was actually meant to be a private message from Trump to Bondi.

Never miss the news and analysis you care about.

James faces charges of bank fraud and making false statements to a financial institution. In a statement immediately after the charges were announced, James denounced the investigation as being politically motivated.

“This is nothing more than a continuation of the president's desperate weaponization of our justice system,” James said in a video message on X. “He is forcing federal law enforcement agencies to do his bidding, all because I did my job as the New York State Attorney General.”

“I am not fearful — I am fearless,” James added. “We will fight these baseless charges aggressively.”

Detailed evidence demonstrating that James supposedly defrauded financial institutions has not been made public. However, the case has garnered great scrutiny, as the charges only came about after Trump forced former United States Attorney Erik Siebert out of his position at the Eastern District of Virginia. Trump replaced Siebert with his former personal lawyer, Lindsey Halligan, who has never worked a case as a federal prosecutor. 

Siebert reportedly refused to prosecute the case due to weak evidence after overseeing the investigation since May, according to sources with knowledge of his thinking. 

The charges come as Trump's DOJ has also issued dubious charges against his former FBI director James Comey. Charges against more of Trump's political opponents are rumored to be coming soon, including against his former United Nations Ambassador John Bolton and current Sen. Adam Schiff (D-California), who prosecuted one of the impeachment trials against Trump. 

The DOJ is alleging that, while purchasing a home, James marked on a form for a loan that she intended it to be a primary residence, rather than an investment property. This gave her a better mortgage rate than if she were renting the property to someone else, which she ended up doing for her niece. 

But James has provided evidence that she had checked the box on the form as a mistake — indeed, in an email to her loan originator, she made it very clear she didn't intend the property to be for herself. 

“This property WILL NOT be my primary residence,” she wrote in the email.

James checked another box on a separate form stating the same thing — that the residence would not be a primary one.

A number of lawmakers and advocates have condemned the Trump administration for targeting James.

“This is what tyranny looks like,” New York Sen. Chuck Schumer (D) said in a Facebook post. “President Trump is using the Justice Department as his personal attack dog, targeting Attorney General Tish James for the ‘crime' of prosecuting him for fraud — and winning.”

“This isn't justice. It's revenge. And it should horrify every American who believes no one is above the law,” Schumer added.

Jasmine Gripper and Ana María Archila, co-directors of the New York chapter of the Working Families Party, also panned the charges.

“This indictment is nothing more than a politically motivated attack by Trump's Justice Department aimed at intimidating a Black woman who dares to hold Trump accountable,” the two wrote in a joint statement. 

Earlier this week, when charges against James seemed imminent, Molly Roberts, senior editor at Lawfare, came to the same conclusion.

Wrote Roberts:

Let's assume for a moment that prosecutors have James dead to rights on one or more of these charges. Even then, this is not the kind of mortgage fraud case federal prosecutors normally bring. U.S. attorneys offices typically prosecute mortgage fraud cases to nab big-time swindlers attempting to trick banks into six- to eight-figure losses. If Letitia James had committed mortgage fraud, her efforts would have yielded her only thousands of dollars — tens of thousands at most.

“The only world in which James's activities would merit this level of attention is the political one,” Roberts added.

As Trump cracks down on political speech, independent media is increasingly necessary.

Assata Shakur's passing unleashed a flowering of hope that the freedom she fought for could one day be real for us all.

The recent passing of Black Panther and Black Liberation Army leader Assata Shakur unleashed more than a sense of loss. It sparked a sense of pride in her defiance, a sense of gratitude for the movements and organizations that sustained her and a flowering of hope that the freedom she fought for could one day be real for the rest of us.

The collective grief is still fresh following Assata's passing in Havana, Cuba, on September 25. News of her death arrived amid a national conversation in the U.S. about violence and grief that had centered around the murder of far right activist Charlie Kirk, the ongoing genocide in Gaza, and the onslaught of a news cycle that delivers a steady stream of bad news daily about health care, education, the environment, and draconian immigration policies. 

Despite widespread outrage and a growing resistance, grief, demoralization, and exhaustion are daily realities. There was already a lot to mourn.

After Assata's passing, I spoke with Orisanmi Burton, author of Tip of the Spear: Black Radicalism, Prison Repression, and the Long Attica Revolt, to hear how he was processing the news. He told me:

The news was bittersweet. Bitter because Assata will never again walk among us, tell another story, or author another poem; bitter because no longer can we point to her as a living example of she who struggled for Black people with courage and dignity, she who remained steadfast in the face of such fierce opposition. But also, sweet. Sweet because although they hunted her, the forces of U.S. Empire — with all their monstrous technology, were unable to kill her, or put her back in a cage. Sweet because although she is no longer of the physical realm, Assata Shakur remains with us in spirit.

From podcasts to social media, the celebration of life for Assata catapulted her to the top of the news cycle. Assata had eluded capture and lived in freedom, sheltered by the Cuban government and people. In contrast, other political prisoners from the movements of the 1960s and ‘70s like Herman Bell, Jalil Muntaqim, Sundiata Acoli, and Mutulu Shakur had — after suffering through decades in prison — eventually been released after tireless advocacy and organizing by their supporters. Many others are still caged. Assata had died the way few revolutionaries did: in older age, from natural causes, and free.

Writer and activist adrienne maree brown emphasized this when I reached out for her reflections, saying:

Assata Shakur has always been a model to me of how to live a revolutionary poetic life, and how to live without compromise. I am so moved by her story — that she was the most wanted woman of the largest empire of this time, that she managed to live a long life on liberated land, and that she died free.

Meanwhile, when I asked Julia Wright — the veteran Black Panther, activist, and writer who is also the daughter of famous novelist Richard Wright — for her thoughts on Assata's legacy, she responded with a spontaneous poem, writing:

you are the Mother

of all ancestors

you let us know

our dead

as many as they are

have lost their shackles

and

though we weep 

we can let them sleep

you reminded us

that the living

those still chained 

throughout the darkened dungeons

need all our energy

because they are alive

and

can still be saved

from tortuous pain

but you –

you are alive

in our hearts

but you –

you walk at our side

but you –

you whisper to us

that just as Love

eats away

all bars, 

Love

eats away

your death

The upsurge of positive reflections on Assata was so threatening to the status quo that FBI Director Kash Patel re-branded her as a terrorist and warned the public that she should not be romanticized. Attempts to re-criminalize her posthumously in a climate of escalating political repression of dissent and domestic terrorism only confirmed the validity of Assata's condemnation of the FBI's campaign to “discredit, disrupt, and destroy” the Black freedom movement. 

Assata's death reminds a new generation of activists that organizing works and solidarity is life. Her liberation from Clinton Correctional Facility for Women in New Jersey on November 2, 1979, was the result of the organization of her comrades in radical social movements who delivered her into a clandestine network. This modern underground railroad sustained her until she was granted asylum in Cuba.

The recent passing of Assata Shakur unleashed more than a sense of loss. It sparked a flowering of hope that the freedom she fought for could one day be real for the rest of us.

We don't know the name of the people or the location of the places where Assata hid, but we do know that sustaining the underground network involved faith, risk, audacity, and ingenuity. There is a lesson here about the kind of accomplice praxis needed to stand up and shield others from the onslaught of the state — and the kind of deep commitment to struggle and refusal that it took to escape the dragnets and bounties on her head.

We see this enacted every day as ordinary people stand up for those ensnared by ICE agents or attacked by the National Guard deployed in the Trump administration's militaristic incursions into American cities. Assata called Cuba one of the “Largest, Most Resistant and Most Courageous Palenques (Maroon Camps) That Has Ever Existed on the Face of This Planet” and called herself an escaped slave. Revisiting these plantation metaphors in 2025, when the history of slavery is being actively erased from museums, further connects the dots between past and present. 

Assata Shakur had tremendous cultural impact on music. Hip Hop legend Tupac Shakur was her godson, a reflection of the familial bonds between members of the Black Panther Party. Assata's name and story have been mentioned in at least 50 songs, reflecting the best of Hip Hop's rebellious potential. In Cuba she was a supporter of Hip Hop music and a deep believer in the power of art. Reflections on her life as “revolutionary” and “poetic” speak to the power of art as language, expression, and compass. It is perhaps the most fitting reflection on what her legacy might be to movements of today. 

Magia López Cabrera and Alexey Rodriguez — two musicians from the Cuban Hip Hop group Obsesión — shared with me their testimony on the profound ways in which Assata also shaped Cuban social movements during her years on the island, writing:

Assata Shakur had strong connections with the Cuban Hip Hop movement. She and Nehanda Abiodun were fundamental guides in understanding the need for strong political thought from the beginning. It became increasingly difficult to see her in public spaces. Her visits to specific places held a secretive atmosphere, which emanated a certain complicity between people. Almost at the end of activities or gatherings, when there were not many people left, she would appear. Deep conversations would ensue on certain topics. More than once we saw her give her opinion on issues arising in the movement. She was listened to and cared for. Many of us decided not to talk about her to protect her, to take care of her in her forced secrecy. She taught us the value of humility, of listening and stepping back when necessary. Her runaway story leaves great lessons for humanity.

That runaway story, partially told in Assata's memoir (Assata, 1987) has been given new life after her death. Assata recounts her life using dialogue, poetry, and snippets from speeches alongside prose. Her life history unfolds in a nonlinear structure that moves readers across space and time, chapter by chapter, weaving a narrative of growing up and growing political consciousness. The book has gone viral and spread across social media with people taking photos of the book, buying or swapping it, and most of all, reading it in reading circles and book clubs.

More and more ordinary people are revisiting the freedom dreams of 1960s activists who imagined a just world order and the end of racism and imperialism. This is not nostalgia but a concerted effort to unearth the lessons and legacies of the Black Freedom movement. It is a turn to history and an embrace of reading, a powerful rebuke to censorship, book bans, attacks on education, and the attempt to erase history in textbooks and museums. With Assata as their inspiration, people are holding a mirror up to the part of themselves that dares to hope, to see beyond this moment and connect the past to the present.

 The Real Logistics Challenge in the Taiwan Strait

 Maximilian K. Bremer and Kelly A. Grieco

More than 80 years after Allied troops stormed the beaches of Normandy, D-Day is frequently referred to in discussions of potential conflict in the Taiwan Strait. Western observers often cite that historic event to highlight the formidable challenge that China's military would face in launching an amphibious assault on Taiwan. Chinese analysts and military planners also study the Normandy landing campaign closely, looking for insights into logistics for their air and sea forces.

But the United States should learn another lesson from D-Day: how to keep U.S. forces supplied under fire without relying on fixed infrastructure. In June 1944, Allied forces landed hundreds of thousands of troops and vehicles and tons of materiel on fortified beaches, secured a defensible position, and pushed inland—all without access to a single major port. What made this feat possible were cheap gliders that delivered troops and cargo too heavy for parachutes, and artificial harbors that kept the beachhead supplied. Those disposable logistics tools provided the speed and flexibility needed when permanent infrastructure and traditional supply methods such as large transport convoys became liabilities, and when delay could have proved fatal.

Today, in the event of war in East Asia, China could cut off supply lines across the vast Pacific, potentially isolating U.S. forces. The solution, as in Normandy in 1944, is innovative, temporary logistics. The United States should invest in expendable and autonomous systems, such as disposable cargo drones and one-way gliders, which use programmed routes and onboard sensors to keep forces stocked with ammunition, fuel, food, and other supplies during the critical early stage of a conflict. As China depleted its missile arsenal attacking disposable logistics tools, U.S. and allied forces could turn to more permanent infrastructure to deliver supplies by air and sea.

Temporary logistics might seem wasteful, but the alternative—attempting to maintain peacetime standards of logistical efficiency in the opening phase of a conflict—risks the type of supply failures that have decided countless wars throughout history. Beijing understands this well: authoritative texts about military strategy published by the People's Liberation Army identify logistics as a vulnerability that China can exploit to paralyze an adversary's forces. Strengthening U.S. deterrence in the Indo-Pacific therefore requires the ability to deploy fast, flexible, and cheap logistical resources at the outset of a conflict, which can complement traditional, centralized logistics systems required for protracted operations. This approach combines speed and staying power, ensuring that the United States can repel initial Chinese aggression and prevail in a longer war.

The D-Day invasion succeeded because Allied planners reimagined logistics at scale while under fire. In the predawn hours of the invasion, hundreds of gliders delivered paratroopers and equipment behind enemy lines. Constructed from wood and canvas, these gliders were cheap, required no fuel, and needed neither runways nor return flights, making them ideal for delivering heavy weapons and supplies that parachutes alone could not handle. When German antiaircraft fire intensified, the Allies simply sent more gliders and airborne troops. They accepted the attrition of intentionally disposable gliders—as well as the risk to airborne personnel and their equipment—as necessary to achieve the operation's objectives.

While gliders deposited troops and materiel behind enemy lines during the invasion's opening hours, temporary, mobile harbors—known as Mulberries—addressed the urgent need to rapidly fortify forces to repel the inevitable German counterattack. Prefabricated in England and assembled under fire off the beaches of Normandy, each Mulberry was engineered to handle 5,000 tons of cargo and 1,400 vehicles daily. The installation at Arromanches, for example, moved tens of thousands of tons of food, ammunition, vehicles, and other supplies daily, sustaining Allied forces during their most vulnerable period in the landing.

These logistical innovations proved decisive. Within two weeks of D-Day, more than one million Allied troops were ashore in France. Once the beachhead was secure, the Allies began to repair ports, build pipelines, and extend railways. But were it not for gliders and Mulberries, the Allies would never have gotten ashore. As U.S. General Dwight Eisenhower, the supreme Allied commander during the operation, said of these temporary logistical measures, “Without them our armies could not have been adequately maintained in the field.” It was a phased approach—fast and improvisational at first; steady and deliberate later.

Deterring potential Chinese action in the Taiwan Strait poses logistical challenges even more daunting than those the Allies faced in Normandy. The People's Liberation Army has spent two decades developing anti-access/area-denial capabilities, known as A2/AD—including long-range missiles, maritime militias, and cyberweapons—that the Pentagon says are specifically designed to disrupt and destroy American and allied supply lines. China's long-range missiles can strike airfields, ports, and supply depots across the Pacific, and PLA cyberattacks threaten the communications networks and digital systems that undergird U.S. and allied military logistics. A recent Stimson Center analysis found that, in the opening phase of a potential conflict, Chinese missiles could render U.S. bases and airfields in Japan and Guam inoperable for days or weeks, grounding cargo aircraft essential for resupply. Logistical delays can break an operation by denying the one resource that can never be recovered: time. And time is exactly what China needs to take control of Taiwan. Effective logistics, therefore, underwrites credible U.S. deterrence.

The U.S. military has responded to this challenge by shifting away from maintaining large regional bases and toward stationing forces across numerous smaller, often remote locations. This approach, which is called distributed operations, maximizes U.S. forces' ability to withstand precision strikes. But it also significantly increases the complexity of logistical coordination, creating new possibilities for failure. Consider the Marine Corps' new stand-in force concept, which involves deploying small, mobile units that carry minimal supplies and require frequent resupply. As General David Berger, then commandant of the Marine Corps, acknowledged in May 2022, sustaining stand-in forces requires “logistics capabilities designed for distributed operations over long distances in a contested environment”—that is, more aircraft, more ships, more support personnel, and better planning to maintain vulnerable supply lines.

Today, conventional methods are insufficient to protect the United States against Chinese weapons. Large cargo aircraft and container ships—the backbone of traditional military logistics—become prime targets in contested environments. A 2022 wargame highlighted this dilemma, noting that it was unclear how the military would execute joint logistics across widely dispersed U.S. forces in the Indo-Pacific theater.

Modern technology offers a path forward, allowing the United States to reimagine D-Day's legacy of disposable logistics for the Indo-Pacific. Like the gliders and Mulberry harbors that initially sustained Allied forces in Normandy, today's autonomous logistics systems can bridge initial operations and protracted conflict. These systems would need to be cheap enough to be expendable, small enough to minimize their value as targets, and numerous enough to ensure success despite individual losses.

Emerging technologies are well suited to the task. Reinvented gliders, now built from stronger materials such as carbon fiber reinforced polymers, incorporate autonomous navigation systems that can avoid obstacles, select landing zones, and deliver supplies to remote or contested locations. The U.S. Air Force has tested lightweight cargo gliders capable of delivering 1,000 pounds of supplies up to 40 miles. At roughly $40,000 each, these are inexpensive enough to be disposable. By comparison, a single C-130J, a traditional cargo aircraft used by the air force, costs about $110 million.

In an Indo-Pacific conflict, modern gliders could deliver supplies nightly to marines in remote locations, much as wooden gliders sustained Allied paratroopers in Normandy. But today's aircraft can do so with a level of precision and reliability that was not possible in 1944.



Autonomous cargo aircraft and ships can also reshape temporary logistics. Last year, for example, the air force successfully tested modified Cessna 208B Caravans, common single-engine turboprop planes, which used automated takeoff and landing systems to deliver supplies to eight remote locations spread across 1,150 miles. Rather than relying on large transport planes, the air force could use numerous smaller aircraft able to land on shorter and narrower runways to deliver supplies to dispersed units. The same idea applies to larger, autonomous drones capable of moving oversize loads long distances. These aircraft could play the role that Mulberries did in Normandy, facilitating temporary supply lines where none previously existed.

Similarly, autonomous surface vessels, such as uncrewed boats, could deliver one or two standard shipping containers of fuel, food, and ammunition to scattered forces with no need for a large port. Across the many islands of the Indo-Pacific, a large fleet of these autonomous vessels could provide near-continuous resupply while larger cargo vessels remained at a safe distance from Chinese attacks. Traditional military cargo ships, in contrast, are unsuited for these missions because they are too few in number, vulnerable to attack, and dependent on ports.

The most revolutionary approach would employ swarming logistics, in which the U.S. military launches dozens or hundreds of small, cheap drones persistently, or in waves, to overwhelm China's ability to selectively target the most valuable cargo. Because of their sheer quantity, these drones create uncertainty about the value of any single target, especially when the cost of intercepting them exceeds the value of what might be onboard. If China attempts to intercept them, the United States benefits by accelerating the depletion of China's costly and limited antiaircraft missiles. If China opts not to engage, the resupply mission succeeds. As with flying waves of gliders through intense antiaircraft fire, adopting these tactics requires accepting that there will be attrition as China shoots down some drones. But these losses are necessary to impose costs on Chinese defenses.

None of these expendable logistics systems could or should permanently replace traditional supply methods. In the case of a drawn-out war over Taiwan, the battle for control of the air and sea is likely to eventually shift in favor of more powerful U.S. and allied forces. China's cruise and ballistic missile arsenal is extensive, but it is not unlimited. As those weapons are exhausted, the conflict will return to the type of warfare that can use traditional logistics methods, including large cargo ships, aircraft, and fixed infrastructure. But to reach that point, the United States will first need disposable logistics as a stopgap, buying time in the initial stages when conventional networks are under attack and secure supply lines have yet to be established. Like Mulberry harbors and D-Day gliders, these systems prioritize immediate effectiveness over long-term efficiency.

Meeting this challenge demands fundamental changes in how the Pentagon thinks about conflict in the Indo-Pacific. The United States should ensure that expendable systems are readily available in meaningful quantities. At present, the United States and its allies severely underinvest in both traditional logistical capabilities, such as airlift and sealift cargo platforms, and in disposable systems. For example, most of the Ready Reserve Force's so-called roll-on, roll-off vessels, which can transport wheeled vehicles and are essential to large-scale military deployments, were primarily built in the 1970s, with some dating to the early 1960s. To ensure the viability of its aging logistics fleet in the Indo-Pacific, Washington should pursue development and production of scalable, expendable capabilities in partnership with key regional allies such as Australia and Japan. Disposable logistics based close to the theater of operations would reduce production delays and ease the strain on already limited logistics capacity.

The United States should also support, and the U.S. military should embrace, the emerging commercial market for lower-cost, autonomous cargo aircraft and ships. Neither the United States nor its allies can afford to stockpile large quantities of expendable systems that sit idle in peacetime, especially since the technology for autonomy, swarming, and propulsion evolves rapidly. What is state of the art today is often obsolete tomorrow. Instead, Washington should partner with private industry to prepare for the swift adoption of autonomous logistics systems for military use. Several U.S. firms are already developing small cargo drones designed to conduct resupply missions across the Indo-Pacific, which could be used in the initial fight.



The United States needs to clear regulatory and policy obstacles that hinder commercial adoption of these systems in the air and at sea. Although the Federal Aviation Administration has proposed a rule that would allow drones to deliver small packages in the United States, implementation remains uncertain, and the proposed rules severely restrict the size of drones and cargo. China, by contrast, has already normalized drone delivery and established dedicated corridors for commercial operations, including for large cargo drones capable of delivering at scale. The United States has fallen behind China in commercial shipbuilding and is unlikely to regain its dominance in that market, but it has an opportunity to lead in autonomous logistics. The more the United States invests now, the greater its capability to deter and, if necessary, fight a protracted conflict with China.

U.S. policymakers must accept that investing in deliberately temporary systems is essential, not wasteful. During the critical first weeks of any major Pacific conflict, container ships will not be able to dock at ports within range of China's weapons, and large aircraft will not be able to land at contested bases. Instead, the U.S. military will need to deploy autonomous drones and expendable systems. The war in Ukraine, in which units on both sides have used drones to deliver ammunition to frontline units, demonstrates the value of such approaches.

Expendable and autonomous logistics systems would strengthen U.S. deterrence by overcoming what we call the “four tyrannies”—time, distance, water, and scale—that threaten American power projection in the Indo-Pacific. Beijing's strategy depends on exploiting these tyrannies to seize Taiwan before the United States can bring sufficient military force to bear. By targeting the few islands suitable for large-scale logistics operations, China can slow any U.S. response. But by demonstrating the ability to sustain dispersed forces under missile attack with expendable gliders, cargo drones, and swarming logistics, the United States can undermine China's confidence in its A2/AD capabilities.

Deterrence depends on not just the number of bombers, submarines, and destroyers but also the ability to keep forces supplied—even when conventional logistics breaks down. As on the beaches of Normandy in 1944, logistics itself can be a decisive weapon in battle. Failing to invest in these capabilities signals unpreparedness or dangerous overconfidence that there will be time to adapt once war begins. Reliable and effective logistics is crucial in any war—and especially so when that war is half a world away.

            “I want to thank the medical staff in Italy for the excellent treatment I received,” said McCain. “My recovery is progressing well thanks to their outstanding care.”
    


            McCain was appointed in March 2023 to lead the world's largest humanitarian organization after serving as US ambassador to the UN agencies for food and agriculture under former President Joe Biden. McCain broke with Republicans when she endorsed Biden for president in 2020, making her a key surrogate for the Democrat after now-President Donald Trump spent years criticizing her husband and his military service.
    


            She has since become the face of the World Food Program, one of the few UN agencies that has received bipartisan support for its efforts to help nearly 150 million people confronting conflicts, disasters and impacts of climate change this year. McCain and the WFP have been in the spotlight as the agency has sought to respond to the humanitarian crises caused by the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine and Israel's offensive inside the Gaza Strip.
    


            In late August, after visiting Gaza, McCain told The Associated Press it was “very evident” that there isn't enough food in the Palestinian territory. She said she had spoken with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu about the urgent need for more aid.
    


            Her comments came a week after the world's leading authority on food crises said the Gaza Strip's largest city is gripped by famine, and that it was likely to spread across the territory without a ceasefire and an end to restrictions on humanitarian aid.
    


            “I personally met mothers and children who were starving in Gaza,” she said. “It is real and it is happening now,”
    


            An advocate for children, McCain has served on the board of directors for Operation Smile, a nonprofit organization dedicated to addressing facial deformities for children around the world, visiting India, Morocco and Vietnam, the joint announcement said.
    


            McCain succeeded David Beasley, a former South Carolina governor who had led WFP through challenging times, including the COVID-19 pandemic and the global food crisis sparked by Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Beasley was at the helm when the World Food Program was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2020, in part for being “a driving force in efforts to prevent the use of hunger as a weapon of war and conflict.”
    


            Carl Skau, the deputy executive director of WFP, is expected to oversee the organization's day-to-day operations until McCain's return.
    


            In the statement Thursday, McCain said she has “full confidence” in her leadership team's ability “to stay laser-focused on delivering urgently needed food assistance to the more than 100 million people WFP is working to serve across 87 countries.”
    


            She added, “The fight against hunger has never been more critical, and I am incredibly proud of the work our teams do every day. I look forward to being back in the field soon — alongside WFP teams — pushing back against famine and supporting communities in need.”

            The bearded vulture, a large bird of prey with an unusual diet consisting primarily of bones, has long fascinated ornithologists. But now, a new study has shown why the bone-eating birds could be even more intriguing than once thought. Their carefully crafted nests, serving multiple generations, may also act as “natural museums,” preserving centuries-old cultural artifacts, according to scientists.
    


            In Spain, researchers studied a dozen bearded vulture nests between 2008 and 2014. The team analyzed them layer by layer, uncovering over 200 human-made objects that the birds may have repurposed as building materials. Carbon dating of these items revealed that the nests date back to at least the 13th century, with the oldest artifact being a sandal that's over 700 years old. The findings were published September 11 in the journal Ecology.
    


            “We knew that the bearded vulture is a transporting species that can carry objects to its nest for construction, but we were surprised by the number of objects found and their age,” said lead author Antoni Margalida, an ecologist at the Pyrenean Institute of Ecology at the Spanish National Research Council in Jaca, Spain. “This means that these sites, used for centuries, are quality locations that different generations have used for breeding.”
    


            Not only does the research open new avenues for finding cultural artifacts, but it could also help future conservation efforts for the species, the scientists said.
    


            The bearded vulture is the only known vertebrate to specialize in eating bones, comprising up to 90% of the creature's diet. As the study authors set out to find historical nests — sites no longer in use either due to local extinction or unsuitable habitat factors — they were primarily interested in finding bone remains. The team aimed to study the past inhabitants' diet and compare it with the diet of modern birds today.
    


            But the researchers said stumbling upon the copious number of artifacts entangled in the historical nests took them by surprise. Over 9% of the specimens pulled from the structures were human-made.
    


            Besides the sandal, which was crafted from woven twigs and grasses, other items found within the nests included a painted piece of medieval leather that resembles a mask, remnants of a basket dated to the 18th century, an arrow from a crossbow, ropes and rigging for horses, and more. The sandal is the oldest artifact so far, but the study team has yet to carbon-date other items, Margalida said.
    


            The documented findings offer an intriguing look into human culture, according to Margalida. “This can give us information about how people dressed, how they hunted (through the slingshots and crossbows found), and which domestic and wild species were most abundant in the ecosystem,” he said.

            Because bearded vultures, which have a nearly 10-foot (3-meter) wingspan, like to nest in cliff caves or rocky areas that have stable temperatures and humidity, bone remains, human-made objects and other nest materials can stay relatively well-preserved, according to the research.
    


            “This study sheds new light, and really a whole new angle on the place of the Bearded Vulture in our understanding of the interplay between a fascinating bird and the history of human culture,” John Fitzpatrick, director emeritus for the Cornell Lab of Ornithology, said in an email.
    


            “The fact that Bearded Vultures are now recognized as ‘recording artists' documenting human history just adds to their unique mystique,” he added. Fitzpatrick, who is also professor emeritus of ecology and evolutionary biology at Cornell University, was not involved with the new research.
    


            In southern Spain, where the researchers recovered the nests, bearded vultures have been locally extinct for 70 to 130 years, according to the study. To find the nest sites, the study authors spent years looking into historical records as well as speaking with older residents of the area who remember the birds when they were around. Today, bearded vultures can still be found in areas of Europe, Asia and Africa, but they are less common and widespread than they once were centuries ago.

            “While this research occurred in Spain, the Bearded Vulture has a broad distribution over the Old World — including in the Himalayas, the Caucasus, and the Ethiopian highlands,” said Evan Buechley, a researcher on raptor ecology and vice president of conservation for international programs with The Peregrine Fund, a nonprofit that aims to conserve birds of prey worldwide.
    


            Studying other nests, such as those in Ethiopia or Tibet, “could reveal fascinating insights into the human histories of other mountainous regions of the world,” he added in an email. Buechley was also not involved with the study.
    


            The International Union for the Conservation of Nature Red List categorized the bearded vulture in 2014 as near threatened. By studying the birds' nests, including those that are no longer in use, researchers can better understand factors that make habitats suitable, such as the basis of their diet or the effects of pesticides in the area, Margalida said.
    


            In addition, understanding the species' historical factors, such as their breeding distribution and diet, could help researchers decide where and how to reintroduce the species in future projects, Buechley said.
    


            The research also highlights the large effect humans have on wildlife. Buechley pointed to the California condor. This New World vulture is a critically endangered species that faces issues with its chicks ingesting trash brought back to the nests by their parents.

            “This underscores the importance of maintaining vast areas of wild habitat that remain largely free of some of the worst toxins that humans create and leave around the landscape for curious critters — even as big and rock-solid as Bearded Vultures — to play with and take home,” Fitzpatrick said.
    


            “Bearded Vulture is already a revered bird bearing a special place in the hearts and minds of people who know about it,” he added. “Anything that informs the public about the fascinating ways in which wild birds and human culture intersect has huge value, both for our own appreciation of the extraordinary world around us and for our commitment to ensure the long-term protection of wild species and wild places.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+national+news+site:cnn.com","Measles outbreaks across the US continue to add to record case count","https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/10/health/measles-outbreaks-utah-arizona-south-carolina","Fri, 10 Oct 2025 11:32:10 GMT","


            A deadly measles outbreak in Texas ended in August, but outbreaks in other parts of the United States continue to add hundreds of new measles cases to this year's record national total.
    


            There have been an average of 27 new measles cases reported each week since the end of August, according to data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The annual total – now up to 1,563 cases since January – is the highest by a significant margin since measles was declared eliminated in the US a quarter-century ago.
    


            There's a new outbreak in Ohio, a recent surge in cases in Minnesota and more than 150 unvaccinated schoolchildren in South Carolina are in quarantine because of an ongoing outbreak there.
    


            Before this year, the US had recorded only 10 large measles outbreaks – defined by the CDC as more than 50 related cases – since reaching elimination status in 2000. But an ongoing outbreak along the border between Arizona and Utah is already the third large outbreak this year.
    


            There have been more than 90 confirmed cases related to the outbreak – at least 59 in Arizona and 36 in Utah, according to state health departments – and case counts continue to grow.
    


Tracking measles cases in the United States



            Dr. Leisha Nolen, state epidemiologist in Utah, said there is still a lot of opportunity for measles to continue to spread in the area.
    


            “Unfortunately, I think we still have quite a while to go with infections. We know that most of our infections have been localized down towards the southern end of our state, but I think we are starting to see now people get infected even at the very north end of our state,” she said. “So I do think that this is going to continue to bop around and spread in different communities. I suspect we're in the middle of it.”
    


            Experts say that any amount of measles spread is cause for concern, and large outbreaks highlight the dangers of declining vaccination rates.
    


            “When you have multiple cases happening, particularly with those numbers, it's only possible because you have susceptible individuals,” said Dr. Scott Harris, president of the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials.
    


            There are measles cases in the US every year, often introduced via international travel, Harris said. But those cases can really multiply only if they're happening among other people who are unvaccinated – and can multiply at large scale only if large parts of a community are unvaccinated. The Texas outbreak is evidence of this, he said, with state health department data showing that 97% of its cases were among people who had not gotten one or both of the recommended two vaccine doses.
    


            “The story here is: Parents of young children are skeptical about vaccination,” Harris said. “There are lots of reasons why, but if that weren't the case, this wouldn't be a story, because we wouldn't have these outbreaks.”
    


            A record share of US kindergartners had an exemption for a required vaccination in the last school year, and coverage for all reported vaccines – including the measles vaccine – continued on a downward trend, according to the CDC.
    


            Coverage with the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine dropped to 92.5%, the latest data shows. Because measles is such a highly contagious disease, public health experts say that at least 95% MMR coverage is needed to prevent spread. Last year marks the fifth year in a row that coverage has been below that target.
    


            In Utah, Nolen says that public health officials have a good grasp on where measles is spreading thanks to wastewater monitoring that can capture virus levels beyond official case counts, and where the risk is elevated due to low vaccination rates.
    


            “In those areas, we try to work with the local health department and the community to get the word out that we know that there is measles in their area and that we really encourage families to consider getting vaccines,” she said. Misinformation has created some vaccine hesitancy, she said, but vaccination rates have ticked up as awareness about the current outbreak has grown.
    


Acting CDC director, citing Trump directive, calls for MMR shot to be split into three despite no evidence of benefit



            A separate ongoing outbreak in South Carolina also threatens to grow quickly.
    


            More than 150 unvaccinated children are in quarantine after measles exposures at two schools in the northern part of the state, one public elementary school and one public charter school in Spartanburg County.
    


            “Those schools are following the protocols to exclude these students until the period of potential disease transmission has safely ended,” Dr. Linda Bell, South Carolina's state epidemiologist, said Thursday. “Those students are identified as having been exposed and not having been vaccinated, and that's the reason for the exclusion.”
    


            About 90% of people who have been exposed to measles and do not have immune protection from vaccination could get infected, Bell said, and “worst-case scenario” would be that rate of infection among the at-risk students who are being closely monitored for symptoms while in quarantine.
    


            There have been 11 confirmed measles cases in South Carolina this year, including seven associated with the Spartanburg County outbreak since September 25, according to the state health department.
    


            Spartanburg County has one of the lowest school vaccination rates in the state, according to data from the state health department. Last school year, less than 90% of school students there received their required immunizations, which includes two doses of the MMR vaccine. School vaccination coverage has been falling in Spartanburg County for years, as it has across the state and nationwide.
    


            A measles case reported Thursday in Greenville County, South Carolina's most populous county, is being investigated for a possible link to the Spartanburg outbreak. But the state health department is not aware of any other potentially related cases in other states or jurisdictions, Bell said Thursday.
    


            It's “incredibly expensive and demanding” for local health departments to respond to measles threats, said Dr. Caitlin Rivers, an epidemiologist and director of the Center for Outbreak Response Innovation at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. The organization has worked with health departments from across the country to help them learn from their experiences responding to measles.
    


            “Health departments are already stretched thin by budget constraints and staff attrition. Adding measles outbreaks to their workload is draining the reserves of even the best-resourced departments,” Rivers said. “It's been hard to understand from the outside what supports the federal government is offering to local responders.”
    


Trust in federal health leadership is failing under RFK Jr., new poll finds



            The CDC has continued to update its measles tracker during the federal government shutdown, even as other surveillance data systems have come to a halt. And local health leaders say they have continued to stay in contact with CDC experts, although they have been warned that response times may be a bit slower.
    


            “Due to a lapse in federal funding, CDC has developed an orderly shutdown plan, ensuring critical public health and safety functions continue without interruption. As found in the plan, CDC and [the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry] would collect data being reported by states, hospitals, and others, and report out critical information needed for state and local health authorities and providers to track, prevent and treat diseases,” according to a statement from the CDC.
    


            But federal surveillance systems are far from perfect, and experts say that formally reported measles cases in the US are probably a significant undercount, with some estimating that this year's total could be closer to 5,000 cases.
    


            Current measles outbreak trends are “consistent with an undervaccinated population,” said Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center and an attending physician in the Division of Infectious Diseases at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. US Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has exacerbated problems with both disease surveillance and vaccination rates, he said, by cutting federal health agency workers and failing to fully endorse the MMR vaccine. Instead, as the measles outbreak in Texas spread earlier this year, Kennedy touted unconventional therapies for treatment and said that getting vaccinated is a personal choice.
    


            “We're in the midst of a measles epidemic,” Offit said. “We should have an administration that stands up clearly and definitively and holds press conferences saying, ‘Vaccinate your children. These are preventable illnesses.' ”
    


            In a statement to CNN, HHS said that “Secretary Kennedy has been outspoken in his support for the measles vaccine and has encouraged both national and state-level action to address and prevent outbreaks.”
    


            Trust in federal health leadership has suffered under Kennedy, a new poll shows, with most US adults saying they disapprove of the way he's handled vaccine policy and his role as health secretary overall.

President Donald Trump says he'll target “only” programs favored by Democrats as the federal government shutdown continues. Trump told a Cabinet meeting, we're going to give the Democrats “a little taste of their own medicine.”

The White House budget office said Friday that mass firings of federal workers have started in an attempt to exert more pressure on Democratic lawmakers as the government shutdown continues.

Russ Vought, the director of the Office of Management and Budget, said on the social media site X that the “RIFs have begun,” referring to reduction-in-force plans aimed at reducing the size of the federal government.

The White House previewed that it would pursue the aggressive layoff tactic shortly before the government shutdown began on Oct. 1, telling all federal agencies to submit their reduction-in-force plans to the budget office for its review. It said reduction-in-force could apply for federal programs whose funding would lapse in a government shutdown, is otherwise not funded and is “not consistent with the President's priorities.”

A federal judge late Thursday ordered ICE to temporarily remove a fence outside an ICE facility in the western Chicago suburb of Broadview.

The Village of Broadview sued DHS, accusing them of erecting an 8-foot-tall fence to illegally block the public street outside the facility, creating problems for local emergency services trying to access the area. The ICE facility has been the site of intense protests over the last few weeks.

Broadview Mayor Katrina Thompson said the decision was a “validation of local law and, most importantly, a decisive win for public safety.” 

She said it “remains to be seen if ICE will respect the judge's order and dismantle this hazard immediately, or if they will continue their pattern of defiance.”

Sen. John Thune is showing no sign of backing away from his current tactic of pressing Democrats to vote for a stopgap government funding bill.

Thune, a South Dakota Republican, has tried to peel away Democratic senators to vote to advance the bill. So far, it hasn't worked. Despite repeated votes on the bill since the government shutdown, the voting pattern has not changed, leaving Republicans five votes short of advancing the legislation.

Yet Thune at a news conference laid down a challenge to any Democrat who may be thinking about crossing party lines: “All it takes is a little backbone, a little courage on behalf of five Democrats.”

MIT President Sally Kornbluth said she “cannot support” the proposal that calls for universities to adopt Trump's political agenda in exchange for favorable access to federal funding.

MIT was one of nine universities invited last week to sign a compact the White House billed as providing benefits including “substantial and meaningful federal grants.” 

Leaders of the University of Texas system said they were honored its flagship university in Austin was invited, but most other campuses have remained silent as they review the document.

Putin's invasion of Ukraine has resulted in Russia taking Ukrainian children out of their country so that they can be raised as Russian.

Correction: A previous version of this post mistakenly said only Ukrainian children were reunited with their families.

Trump says “there seems to be no reason” to meet with Chinese leader Xi Jinping as part of an upcoming trip to South Korea after China has restricted exports of rare earths needed for American industry.

Trump suggested that he was looking at a “massive increase” of import taxes on Chinese products in response to Xi's moves.

“One of the Policies that we are calculating at this moment is a massive increase of Tariffs on Chinese products coming into the United States of America,” Trump posted on Truth Social. “There are many other countermeasures that are, likewise, under serious consideration.”

 The White House says that the president's Friday afternoon announcement in the Oval Office is aimed at reducing drug prices.

It follows Trump announcing late last month that his administration had reached an agreement with Pfizer aiming to reduce the prices of its U.S. prescription drug to be similar to the lowest prices paid by other developed nations.

The Venezuelan opposition leader said in a statement that she wanted to dedicate the award to the U.S. president for support of her cause, along with dedicating it to the people of her country.

“We are on the threshold of victory and today, more than ever, we count on President Trump, the people of the United States, the peoples of Latin America, and the democratic nations of the world as our principal allies to achieve Freedom and democracy,” Machado said in a statement on X.

Johnson is making clear he won't be bringing House lawmakers back to Washington until the Senate passes a government funding bill.

The House has not held votes for about three weeks. 

It could take up other issues besides a government funding bill, and Democrats have described the situation as House Republicans going on vacation.

But Johnson said members are working diligently in their districts to help constituents.

“We will come back here and get back to legislative session as soon as the Senate Democrats turn the lights back on,” Johnson said.

Steven Cheung, the White House communications director, made the comment on X Friday as he reacted to Trump being passed over for the Nobel Peace Prize on Friday despite jockeying from his fellow Republicans, various world leaders and — most vocally — himself.

Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado received the award.

Cheung did not comment on Machado's recognition but said Trump “has the heart of a humanitarian, and there will never be anyone like him who can move mountains with the sheer force of his will.”













This morning, Trump is having his appointment at Walter Reed Medical Center. At 3 p.m., he will return to the White House before a 5 p.m. announcement.

At 11 a.m., first lady Melania Trump is expected to make an announcement as well.

Also, the next paycheck for civilian workers will be a partial one. He's blaming Democratic lawmakers for that scenario during a press conference and emphasizing that Republicans have voted multiple times to keep the government funded temporarily.

“You've got millions of American families who will now have to figure out how to make their mortgage, how to cover the rent, pay the car note, keep food on the table because Democrats, Chuck Schumer and his colleagues in the Senate are here playing games,” Johnson said.

National Guard troops were seen patrolling in Memphis for the first time on Friday, as part of President Donald Trump's federal task force, which faces multiple legal challenges.

National Guard troops have been seen patrolling in Memphis for the first time, as part of Trump's federal task force. 

The deployment comes a day after a federal judge in Illinois blocked the deployment of troops in the Chicago area for at least two weeks. 

It was unclear Friday how many Guard members were on the ground in Memphis or were expected to arrive later. Tennessee Republican Gov. Bill Lee supports the deployment.

 Senators are leaving Washington after a late night of votes Thursday, but without making progress towards ending the government shutdown.

The Senate is not scheduled to meet again until Tuesday, leaving many government services shuttered, federal employees furloughed and no scheduled payday for military members and other federal employees.

The nation's third shutdown in 12 years is once again raising anxiety levels among service members and their families because those in uniform are working without pay. While they would receive back pay once the impasse ends, many military families live paycheck to paycheck. During previous shutdowns, Congress passed legislation to ensure that troops kept earning their salaries, but time is running out before they miss their first paycheck in less than a week.

“There are so many things that Congress can't agree on right now,” said Kate Horrell, the wife of a Navy veteran whose Washington, D.C., company provides financial advice to military families. “I don't want to assume that they're going to be able to agree on this.”

The economic impact will ripple through regions with large military footprints, like coastal Virginia, home to the nation's largest Navy base and several other installations. The area's 88,000 active duty service members and their families likely have pulled back significantly on spending, said Rick Dwyer, executive director of the Hampton Roads Military and Federal Facilities Alliance, an advocacy group.

The U.S. is sending about 200 troops to Israel to help support and monitor the ceasefire deal in Gaza as part of a team that includes partner nations, nongovernmental organizations and private-sector players, U.S. officials said Thursday.

The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss details that were not authorized for release, said U.S. Central Command is going to establish a “civil-military coordination center” in Israel that will help facilitate the flow of humanitarian aid as well as logistical and security assistance into the territory wracked by two years of war.

The remarks provide some of the first details on how the ceasefire deal would be monitored and that the U.S. military would have a role in that effort. After Israel and Hamas agreed to the first phase of a Trump administration plan to halt the fighting, a litany of questions remain on next steps, including Hamas disarmament, a withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza and a future government in the territory.

New York Attorney General Letitia James was indicted Thursday in a mortgage fraud case that President Donald Trump urged his Justice Department to bring after vowing retribution against some of his biggest political enemies.

James, a Democrat who infuriated Trump after his first term with a lawsuit alleging that he built his business empire on lies about his wealth, was charged with bank fraud and making false statements to a financial institution in connection with a home purchase in Norfolk, Virginia, in 2020.

The top federal prosecutor for the Eastern District of Virginia, a former Trump aide, personally presented the case to the grand jury weeks after she was thrust into the role amid the administration's pressure to deliver charges.

The indictment, two weeks after a separate criminal case charging former FBI Director James Comey with lying to Congress, is the latest indication of the Trump administration's norm-busting determination to use the law enforcement powers of the Justice Department to pursue the president's political foes and public figures who once investigated him.

Trump is undergoing what he has described as a “semiannual physical” at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center on Friday.

The visit, which the White House announced earlier this week, comes as Trump is preparing to travel to the Middle East on the heels of a ceasefire deal in the Israel-Hamas war. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt described it as a “routine yearly checkup,” although Trump had his annual physical in April.

The White House declined to explain why Trump was getting a yearly checkup six months after his annual exam. But in an exchange with reporters Thursday, the Republican president said it was a “semiannual physical.”

Trump's April physical found that he was “fully fit” to serve as commander in chief. The three-page summary of the exam done by his doctor, Navy Capt. Sean Barbabella, said he had lost 20 pounds (9 kilograms) since a medical exam in June 2020 and said he has an “active lifestyle” that “continues to contribute significantly” to the well-being of the president, who's 79.

National Guard troops were expected to begin patrolling in Memphis, a day after a federal judge in Illinois blocked the deployment of troops in the Chicago area for at least two weeks.

The on-again, off-again deployments are the result of a political and legal battle over Trump's push to send the National Guard to several U.S. cities. His administration claims crime is rampant in those cities, despite statistics not always backing that up.

If a president invokes the Insurrection Act, they can dispatch active duty military in states that fail to put down an insurrection or defy federal law, but the judge in Chicago said Thursday she found no substantial evidence that a “danger of rebellion” is brewing in Illinois during Trump's immigration crackdown.

In Tennessee, where Republican Gov. Bill Lee supports the deployment, the troops are expected to serve as “additional eyes and ears” across Memphis.

The order in Illinois is set to expire Oct. 23 at 11:59 p.m. U.S. District Judge April Perry set an Oct. 22 hearing to determine if it should be extended for another 14 days.

HONG KONG (AP) — China has hit U.S.-owned vessels docking in the country with tit-for-tat port fees, in response to the American government's planned port fees on Chinese ships, expanding a string of retaliatory measures before trade talks between U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping.

Vessels owned or operated by American companies or individuals, and ships built in the U.S. or flying the American flag, would be subjected to a 400 yuan ($56) per net ton fee per voyage if they dock in China, China's Ministry of Transport said on Friday.

The fees would be applied on the same ship for a maximum of five voyages each year, and would rise every year until 2028, when it would hike to 1,120 yuan ($157) per net ton, the ministry said. They would take effect on Oct. 14, the same day when the United States is due to start imposing port fees on Chinese vessels.

China's Ministry of Transport said on Friday in a statement that its special fees on American vessels are “countermeasures” in response to “wrongful” U.S. practices, referring to the planned U.S. port fees on Chinese vessels.

The ministry also slammed the United States' port fees as “discriminatory” that would “severely damage the legitimate interests of China's shipping industry” and “seriously undermine” international economic and trade order.

China has announced a string of trade measures and restrictions before an expected meeting between Trump and Xi on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in South Korea that begins at the end of October. On Thursday, Beijing unveiled new curbs on exports of rare earths and related technologies, as well as new restrictions on the export of some lithium battery and related production equipment.




The port fees announced by Beijing on Friday mirrors many aspects of the U.S. port fees on Chinese ships docking in American ports. Under Washington's plans, Chinese-owned or -operated ships will be charged $50 per net ton for each voyage to the U.S., which would then rise by $30 per net ton each year until 2028. Each vessel would be charged no more than five times per year.

China's new port fee is “not just a symbolic move,” said Kun Cao, deputy chief executive at consulting firm Reddal. “It explicitly targets any ship with meaningful U.S. links — ownership, operation, flag, or build — and scales steeply with ship size.”

The “real bite is on U.S.-owned and operated vessels,” he said, adding that North America accounts for roughly 5% of the world fleet by beneficial ownership, which is still a meaningful figure although not as huge as compared to Greek, Chinese and Japanese ship owners.

However, the United States has only about 0.1% of global commercial shipbuilding market share in recent years and built fewer than 10 commercial ships last year, Reddal added.

While shipping analysts have said that the U.S. port fees on Chinese vessels would likely have limited impact on trade and freight rates as some shipping companies have been redeploying their fleets to avoid the extra charge, shipping data provider Alphaliner warned last month in a report that the U.S. port fees could still cost up to $3.2 billion next year for the world's top 10 carriers.

The two warring sides have agreed to the “first phase” of U.S. President Donald Trump's peace plan to pause fighting in Gaza and release at least some hostages and prisoners, in a major breakthrough in the two-year-old war.

Tens of thousands of Palestinians began returning to northern Gaza on Friday after the Israeli military said a ceasefire had gone into effect.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu insisted on Friday that the next stages of deal to end the fighting in the Gaza Strip would see Hamas disarm and the enclave demilitarized.

Thousands of people are waiting in central parts of the Gaza Strip for the ceasefire to come into effect between Israel and Hamas. Many of them are hoping to go back but many fear their homes have been destroyed in the last Israeli offensive on Gaza City.

A ceasefire between Israel and Hamas came into effect in Gaza on Friday, the military said, hours after Israel's Cabinet approved a deal to pause the fighting and exchange the remaining hostages for Palestinian prisoners.

WADI GAZA, Gaza Strip (AP) — Tens of thousands of Palestinians headed back to the heavily destroyed northern Gaza Strip on Friday as a U.S.-brokered ceasefire came into effect in a deal that raised hopes for ending the Israel-Hamas war. All the remaining hostages were set to be released within days.

Questions remain over who will govern Gaza as Israeli troops gradually pull back and whether Hamas will disarm, as called for in U.S. President Donald Trump's ceasefire plan. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who unilaterally ended a ceasefire in March, hinted that Israel might renew its offensive if Hamas does not give up its weapons.

The latest truce nevertheless marks a key step toward ending a ruinous two-year war that was triggered by Hamas' 2023 attack on Israel. The fighting has killed tens of thousands of Palestinians and displaced around 90% of the Gaza population of some 2 million, often multiple times. Many of them will find fields of rubble where their homes once stood.

The military confirmed the start of the ceasefire Friday, and the remaining 48 hostages, around 20 of them believed to be alive, are to be released by Monday. Palestinians said heavy shelling in parts of Gaza earlier on Friday had mostly stopped after the military's announcement.

Netanyahu said in a televised statement Friday that the next stages would see Hamas disarm and Gaza demilitarized.




“If this is achieved the easy way — so be it. If not — it will be achieved the hard way,” Netanyahu said. He added that Hamas agreed to the deal “only when it felt that the sword was on its neck — and it is still on its neck.”

The Israeli military has said it will continue to operate defensively from the roughly 50% of Gaza it still controls after pulling back to agreed-upon lines.

Meanwhile, the United Nations was given the green light by Israel to begin delivering scaled-up aid into Gaza starting Sunday, a U.N. official said. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss details not yet made public.

The aid will include 170,000 metric tons that have already been positioned in neighboring countries such as Jordan and Egypt as humanitarian officials awaited permission from Israeli forces to restart their work.

In the last several months, the U.N. and its humanitarian partners have only been able to deliver 20% of the aid needed in the Gaza Strip, according to U.N. humanitarian chief Tom Fletcher.

A steady stream of people, the vast majority on foot, crammed onto a coastal road in the central Gaza Strip, heading north to see what might remain of their homes. It was a repeat of emotional scenes from an earlier ceasefire in January. Others headed to other parts of the Palestinian territory in the south.

The destruction they find this time will be even greater, after Israel waged a new offensive in Gaza City, in the north, in recent weeks. The military bombed high-rises and blew up homes in what it said was an attempt to destroy Hamas' remaining military infrastructure.

Palestinians have expressed relief that the war may end, tempered with concern about the future and lingering pain from the staggering death and destruction.

“There wasn't much joy, but the ceasefire somewhat eased the pain of death and bloodshed, and the pain of our loved ones and brothers who suffered in this war,” said Jamal Mesbah, who was displaced from the north and plans to return. 

In Gaza's southern city of Khan Younis, hundreds of Palestinians returning to their homes found wrecked buildings, rubble and destruction after Israeli troops withdrew.

“There was nothing left. Just a few clothes, pieces of wood and pots,” said Fatma Radwan, who was displaced from Khan Younis. People were still trying to retrieve bodies from under the rubble, she added.

Many buildings were flattened, and none was undamaged, as people went back to search for their belongings. “We came to a place that is unidentifiable. An unidentifiable town. Destruction is everywhere,” said Hani Omran, who was also displaced from Khan Younis.

The war began when Hamas-led militants stormed into Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people and taking 251 hostage.

In Israel's ensuing offensive, more than 67,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza and nearly 170,000 wounded, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which doesn't differentiate between civilians and combatants but says around half the deaths were women and children. The ministry is part of the Hamas-run government, and the United Nations and many independent experts consider its figures to be the most reliable estimate of wartime casualties.

The war has also triggered other conflicts in the region, sparked worldwide protests and led to allegations of genocide that Israel denies.

Israel is set to release around 2,000 Palestinian prisoners in exchange for the remaining hostages. A list Israel published Friday did not include high-profile prisoner Marwan Barghouti, the most popular Palestinian leader and a potentially unifying figure. Israel views him and other high-profile prisoners as terrorists and has refused to release them in past exchanges.

Khalil al-Hayya, a senior Hamas official and lead negotiator, said Thursday evening that all women and children held in Israeli jails will be freed.

The hostage and prisoner releases are expected to begin Monday, two Egyptian officials briefed on the talks and a Hamas official said, though another official said they could occur as early as Sunday night. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to be publicly named speaking about the negotiations. 

A relative of one of the Israeli hostages believed to have died in captivity says the family is hoping that his body will be returned for burial.

“It's a measured sense of hope in all hostage families,'' said Stephen Brisley, whose sister, Lianne Sharabi, and her two teenage daughters were killed in the Oct. 7 attack. 

Lianne's husband, Eli Sharabi, was eventually released, but his brother, Yossi, is believed to have died in an airstrike in January 2024. The family hopes to give him a dignified burial.

“We hold our hope lightly because we've had our hopes dashed before,” Brisley told The Associated Press from his home in South Wales. “It still feels like a long way between the announcement of the deal and actually getting Yossi's body back to bury him.''

As part of the deal, five border crossings are expected to reopen, including the Rafah crossing between Gaza and Egypt, Egyptian and Hamas officials said. That will allow aid to flow into the territory, parts of which are experiencing famine.

The Trump plan calls for Israel to maintain an open-ended military presence inside Gaza, along its border with Israel. An international force, comprised largely of troops from Arab and Muslim countries, would be responsible for security inside Gaza. 

To help support and monitor the ceasefire deal, U.S. officials said they would send about 200 troops to Israel as part of a broader, international team. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss details not authorized for release.

The U.S. would also lead a massive internationally funded reconstruction effort.

The plan envisions an eventual role for the Palestinian Authority — something Netanyahu has long opposed. But it requires the authority, which administers parts of the West Bank, to undergo a sweeping reform program that could take years.

The Trump plan is even more vague about a future Palestinian state, which Netanyahu firmly rejects.

People in colorful costumes were among the demonstrators outside of Portland, Oregon's U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement building on Thursday night. President Donald Trump and his administration describe Portland as a city under siege by antifa, labeling it a war zone.

National Guard troops were seen patrolling in Memphis for the first time on Friday, as part of President Donald Trump's federal task force, which faces multiple legal challenges.

MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) — National Guard troops were patrolling in Tennessee's second-largest city for the first time Friday without the legal challenges, protests and vigorous public criticism that ultimately led to a court-ordered halt of soldiers in the Chicago area.

At least nine armed Guard members began their patrol at the Bass Pro Shops located at the Pyramid, an iconic landmark in Memphis, and a nearby tourist welcome center along the Mississippi River. Wearing Guard fatigues and protective vests labeled “military police,” they were being escorted by a local police officer and posed for photos with visitors.

It was unclear how many Guard members were on the ground or were expected to arrive later.

Mayor Paul Young, a Democrat, said he never requested that the Guard come to Memphis. But after President Donald Trump made the Sept. 15 announcement and Republican Gov. Bill Lee agreed, Young and others said they wanted the task force to focus on targeting violent offenders rather than use their presence to scare, harass or intimidate the general public.

Police Chief Cerelyn “CJ” Davis said Wednesday she hoped Guard personnel would help direct traffic and have a presence in “retail corridors,” but not be used to operate checkpoints or anything similar.

Lee previously said troops would not make arrests and would not be armed unless local law enforcement officials request it.

For years, Memphis, whose population exceeds 600,000, has dealt with high violent crime, including assaults, carjackings and homicides. While this year's statistics show improvement in several categories, including murders, many acknowledge that violence remains a problem.




Federal officials say hundreds of arrests and more than 2,800 traffic citations have been made since the task force began operating in Memphis on Sept. 29. Arrest categories include active warrants, drugs, firearms and sex offenses, according to the U.S. Marshals Service. Four arrests have been made on homicide charges, the Marshals Service said.

Some residents said the Guard is not what Memphis needs.

“Totally useless, worthless, not called for because the money that they're gonna spend on that — if they would give it to us to let us do improvements in our city,” said Loretta Davis, who emphasized that young people need more options. 

Friday's development comes a day after a federal judge in Illinois blocked deployment of troops in the Chicago area for at least two weeks.

The on-again, off-again deployments stem from a political and legal battle over Trump's push to send the Guard to several U.S. cities. His administration claims crime is rampant in those cities, despite statistics not always supporting that.

If a president invokes the Insurrection Act, they can dispatch active duty military in states that fail to put down an insurrection or defy federal law. However, the judge in Chicago said she found no substantial evidence that a “danger of rebellion” is brewing in Illinois during Trump's immigration crackdown. 

The court order offered a victory for Democratic officials who lead the state and city and who have called the deployments unnecessary and illegal.

“The court confirmed what we all know: There is no credible evidence of a rebellion in the state of Illinois. And no place for the National Guard in the streets of American cities like Chicago,” Gov. JB Pritzker said.

The order in Illinois is set to expire Oct. 23 at 11:59 p.m. U.S. District Judge April Perry set an Oct. 22 hearing to determine if it should be extended for another 14 days.

It wasn't clear what the 500 Guard members from Texas and Illinois would do next. They were mostly based at a U.S. Army Reserve Center in Elwood, southwest of Chicago. A small number were sent to a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement building in Broadview, which for weeks has been home to occasional clashes between protesters and federal agents.

The Defense Department declined to comment. The troops had been activated for 60 days.

U.S. Justice Department lawyer Eric Hamilton told the judge that the Guard's mission would be to protect federal properties and government law enforcers in the field, not “solving all of crime in Chicago.”

A federal appeals court heard arguments Thursday over whether Trump had the authority to take control of 200 Oregon Guard troops. The president had planned to deploy them in Portland, where there have been small nightly protests outside an ICE building.

A judge last Sunday granted a temporary restraining order blocking the move. Trump had mobilized California troops for Portland just hours after the judge first blocked him from using Oregon's Guard.

Two dozen other states with a Democratic attorney general or governor signed a court filing in support of the legal challenge by California and Oregon. Twenty others, led by Iowa, backed the Trump administration.

LIMA, Peru (AP) — Peru's Congress voted early Friday to remove deeply unpopular President Dina Boluarte from office as a crime wave grips the South American nation and quickly replaced her with 38-year-old lawyer José Jerí, the legislative body's leader.

Lawmakers had set up a debate and impeachment trial late Thursday in the 130-member unicameral Congress after voting to accept four requests for a vote to remove Boluarte from office over what they said was her government's inability to stem crime.

They requested that Boluarte come before them shortly before midnight to defend herself, but when she did not appear they immediately voted to oust her. In short order, 124 lawmakers voted just past midnight to impeach Boluarte. There were no votes against the effort.

The shocking turn of events came just hours after a shooting at a concert in the capital inflamed anger over crime roiling the country.

Unlike eight previous attempts to remove Boluarte, almost all legislative factions expressed support for the latest requests.

Boluarte, Peru's first female president, took office in December 2022 after Parliament used the same mechanism to impeach her predecessor. 

After Friday's vote, Boluarte spoke on national television, recounting her administration's achievements. 

“I have not thought of myself, but rather of Peruvians,” she said. 

Minutes into her speech, the broadcast was interrupted to show Jerí's swearing in. 




Jerí, the president of the Congress, was sworn in early Friday as the interim president to serve out Boluarte's term. Elections are scheduled for next April and Boluarte's term was to end July 28, 2026.

Jerí said he would defend Peru's sovereignty and hand over power to the winner of the April election.

Boluarte was Peru's sixth leader in just under a decade. A normal presidential term is five years. 

She assumed power in Peru in 2022 to complete the term of then-President Pedro Castillo, who was removed from office just two years into his five-year term after attempting to dissolve the legislature to avoid his own removal. She had served as Castillo's vice president before becoming president.

There were more than 500 protests demanding her resignation in the first three months of her presidency.

Plagued by scandals, her administration's inability to address Peru's incessant crime proved to be her undoing. 

On Wednesday, she partially blamed the situation on immigrants living in the country illegally. 

“This crime has been brewing for decades and has been strengthened by illegal immigration, which past administrations haven't defeated,” she said during a military ceremony. “Instead, they've opened the doors of our borders and allowed criminals to enter everywhere... without any restrictions.”

Official figures show that 6,041 people were killed between January and mid-August, the highest number during the same period since 2017. Meanwhile, extortion complaints totaled 15,989 between January and July, a 28% increase compared to the same period in 2024.

The country's latest presidential crisis erupted after a man opened fire and injured five people Wednesday during a concert of Peru's most popular cumbia groups, Agua Marina.

Prime Minister Eduardo Arana on Thursday defended Boluarte during a crime-focused hearing before Parliament, but it was not enough to dissuade lawmakers from pursuing the motions to see the president out of office.

“Parliament's concerns are not resolved by addressing a request for impeachment, much less by approving it,” Arana told lawmakers. “We are not clinging to our positions. We are here, and we knew from the beginning that our first day here could also be our last day in office.”

Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier reacts after an illegal migrant truck driver licensed in the state of California caused a fatal crash on the Florida Turnpike that left three people dead.

FIRST ON FOX: An illegal immigrant carrying a New York state commercial driver's license with ""NO NAME GIVEN"" listed as his name was arrested by ICE in Oklahoma, according to DHS.

The agency said that it has been working in conjunction with the U.S. Department of Transportation as well as state and local law enforcement to get illegal truck drivers off American highways following the high-profile accident involving Indian illegal Harjinder Singh.

Working with the Oklahoma Highway Patrol, ICE arrested another Indian illegal alien named Anmol Anmol. DHS said that Anmol was carrying a New York commercial driver's license on which his first name was listed as ""NO NAME GIVEN.""

A redacted photo of the license obtained by Fox News Digital shows it is a Class A CDL that was issued in April and is valid until May 2028. There is a star at the top right corner of the license, indicating that it is a REAL ID.

DHS said that ICE arrested Indian illegal Anmol Anmol who was carrying a New York commercial driver's license with ""NO NAME GIVEN"" listed as his name. (DHS)

Anmol was arrested by ICE on Sept. 23, 2025, during a routine inspection at a truck scale on I-40. Record checks conducted by ICE revealed that Anmol is an illegal alien from India who entered the country in 2023. DHS said he was released by the Biden administration into the country.

Anmol has now been placed in removal proceedings.

Commenting on Anmol's arrest, DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said that ""New York is not only failing to check if applicants applying to drive 18-wheelers are U.S. citizens but even failing to obtain the full legal names of individuals they are issuing commercial drivers' licenses to.""

""Allowing illegal aliens to obtain commercial driver's licenses to operate 18-wheelers and transport hazardous materials on America's roads is reckless and incredibly dangerous to public safety. Thanks to the successful 287g partnership of ICE and Oklahoma Highway Patrol, Anmol Anmol is no longer posing a threat to drivers,"" added McLaughlin.

""DHS is working with our state and local partners to get illegal alien truck drivers who often don't know basic traffic laws off our highways.""

Left: Tricia McLaughlin, assistant secretary of the Department of Homeland Security. Right: ICE agents (DHS; ICE )

An official with the New York Department of Motor Vehicles, however, contested the license holder's illegal status, telling Fox News Digital that the individual holding the license has lawful status in the U.S. through a federal employment authorization issued in March and ""was issued a license consistent with federal guidelines.""

""This commercial driver's license was issued in accordance with all proper procedures, including verification of the individual's identity through federally issued documentation,"" the official said, adding that ""it is not uncommon for individuals from other countries to have only one name.""

The official said that ""procedures for that are clearly spelled out in the US Citizenship and Immigration Services policy manual,"" and added that ""it is important to note that federal documents also include a ‘no name given' notation.""

In response, McLaughlin told Fox News Digital that ""the Biden Administration gave this illegal alien work authorization in 2023"" and that ""work authorization does not give anyone lawful immigration status.""

McLaughlin called it ""insane that New York is issuing commercial drivers licenses to illegal aliens."" 

""The state of New York needs to stop trying to pass the buck and admit they need to have stricter standards for issuing commercial drivers licenses. They are putting the safety of all American drivers at risk,"" said McLaughlin. 

Pressed further by Fox News Digital on Anmol's immigration status, a New York DMV official said, ""Any questions about immigration documentation should be directed to the federal government.""

In a statement to Fox News Digital, Oklahoma Republican Gov. Stitt said that ""if New York wants to hand out CDLs to illegal immigrants with ‘No Name Given,' that's on them. The moment they cross into Oklahoma, they answer to our laws.""

The arrest was part of a three-day operation, Sept. 23-25, that targeted threats to public safety along Interstate 40 in Oklahoma. ICE was able to work in conjunction with the Oklahoma Highway Patrol because of the state's 287(g) program, which enables state and local law enforcement agencies to directly cooperate with ICE.

During that period, ICE and the Oklahoma Highway Patrol arrested 120 illegal aliens, 91 of whom were operating a commercial motor vehicle with commercial driver licenses granted by sanctuary states. The office of Oklahoma Republican Gov. Kevin Stitt said that the operation arrested illegals from India, Uzbekistan, China, Russia, Georgia, Turkey, Tajikistan, Ukraine and Mauritania.

Stitt's office said that the illegals arrested posed a public safety risk ""by operating 80,000-pound commercial vehicles without proper verification.""

According to DHS, other illegals arrested during the operation included aliens with prior convictions for driving under the influence, money laundering, human smuggling, assault, conspiracy to distribute cocaine, possession of a controlled substance and illegal re-entry into the U.S.

Among those arrested was Guatemalan national Kevin Ivan Escobar-Dionicio, who has a criminal history including charges for human smuggling and money laundering. Another Guatemalan illegal arrested during the operation, named Alfredo Sanic Chipix, had past charges for assault.

Adrian Betancourt Rodriguez, from Cuba, was also arrested and has been convicted of selling cocaine.

Another, Firuz Khamidov, from Russia, was arrested and has charges for forgery.

This comes amid national concerns about illegal aliens operating commercial trucks on U.S. highways, following the high-profile case of Harjinder Singh, who is charged with three counts of vehicular homicide in St. Lucie County, Florida, for his involvement in a fatal crash on Aug. 12.

According to the Florida Highway Patrol, Singh was carrying a commercial driver's license issued in the state of California.

The U.S. Department of Transportation said that Singh had been issued a CDL despite having failed an English language proficiency assessment and having only correctly identified one out of four roadway signs in the same test.

Singh's case sparked national concerns about how widespread a public safety issue illegal aliens driving on American roadways could be.

Commenting on Operation Guardian Sweep, Deputy ICE Director Madison Sheahan said that illegal aliens ""have no business operating 18-wheelers on America's highways.""

Sheahan said that the operation ""clearly demonstrates how federal and local law enforcement agencies can work together to make America safe again"" and that ""our roads are now safer with these illegal aliens no longer behind the wheel.""

She encouraged more state and local law enforcement agencies to join the 287(g) program ""to help remove public safety threats and receive reimbursement funds available to our law enforcement partners.""

Fox News contributor Michael Pillsbury weighs in on China reportedly dangling an investment in the United States and the trade relationship between the two nations on ‘The Ingraham Angle.'

President Donald Trump has called off efforts to arrange a meeting with President Xi Jinping after China tightened export controls on rare earth minerals this week. 

""Some very strange things are happening in China!"" Trump wrote on Truth Social. ""They are becoming very hostile, and sending letters to Countries throughout the World, that they want to impose Export Controls on each and every element of production having to do with Rare Earths, and virtually anything else they can think of, even if it's not manufactured in China.""

""We've never seen anything like this,"" Trump added. 

""One of the Policies that we are calculating at this moment is a massive increase of Tariffs on Chinese products coming into the United States of America. There are many other countermeasures that are, likewise, under serious consideration.""

The president said his relationship with China over the past six months has been ""very good"" and called the crackdown on exports ""surprising."" 

""I have always felt that they've been lying in wait, and now, as usual, I have been proven right!"" he added. 

The administration had suggested Trump might meet Xi at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit later this month in South Korea, but ""now there seems to be no reason to do so,"" he said.

US TURNS TO FINLAND TO CLOSE ARCTIC ‘ICEBREAKER GAP' AS RUSSIA, CHINA EXPAND POLAR PRESENCE

Over the past few decades, China has captured a dominant position in the rare earth minerals and magnets industry and now uses that control — vital for electronics worldwide — as political leverage.

""Some very strange things are happening in China!"" Trump wrote on Truth Social. ""They are becoming very hostile, and sending letters to Countries throughout the World, that they want to impose Export Controls on each and every element of production having to do with Rare Earths, and virtually anything else they can think of, even if it's not manufactured in China."" (Reuters)

""There is no way that China should be allowed to hold the World ‘captive,' but that seems to have been their plan for quite some time, starting with the ‘Magnets' and, other Elements that they have quietly amassed into somewhat of a Monopoly position, a rather sinister and hostile move, to say the least,"" Trump added. 

The world's two largest economies have been locked in trade negotiations for months, imposing tit-for-tat tariffs on each other.

China announced Thursday it is expanding export controls on five additional rare earth metals — holmium, erbium, thulium, europium and ytterbium — adding to the seven restricted in April.

China also restricted exports of technology used to refine rare earth minerals.

China cited national security concerns for the restrictions. ""Rare-earth-related items have dual-use properties for both civilian and military applications. Implementing export controls on them is an international practice,"" a Chinese Ministry of Commerce spokesperson said.

Rare earth metals are essential for both commercial goods — including electric cars, household appliances, lithium batteries and camera lenses — and critical to the U.S. defense industry.

Rare earths are also used to produce semiconductors vital for artificial intelligence processing.

As of 2024, China mines about 60 percent of the world's rare earth minerals and processes nearly 90 percent, according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies.

The Trump administration has invested heavily in domestic rare earth mining and processing to reduce U.S. dependence on China.

John Lodge, the legendary bassist and vocalist of The Moody Blues, has died. He was 82.

In a statement shared with Fox News Digital on Friday, Lodge's family said that he died ""suddenly and unexpectedly."" The family added that Lodge ""peacefully slipped away surrounded by his loved ones and the sounds of The Everly Brothers and Buddy Holly.""

Birmingham-born Lodge joined The Moody Blues in 1966, two years after its formation, along with fellow singer Justin Hayward, following the departure of Denny Laine and Clint Warwick. He remained with the band until they stopped performing live in 2018.

Lodge was a pivotal force behind the group's groundbreaking fusion of orchestral rock and psychedelia.

His contributions to albums like 1967's ""Days of Future Passed"" and 1968's ""In Search of the Lost Chord"" set the tone for the rock movement.

Lodge was also featured on the 1977 album ""Octave,"" which saw The Moody Blues embrace a more pop-oriented sound.

His career with The Moody Blues was far from over when the band released their final studio album, ""December,"" a collection of Christmas songs, in 2003.

The band continued to take the stage until 2018 — the same year they were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

Lodge is survived by his wife, Kirsten, whom he married in 1968. The couple had two children, Emily and Kristian, with the former being referred to on The Moody Blues song ""Emily's Song"" from the 1971 album ""Every Good Boy Deserves Favour.""

Known for his deep faith, Lodge was also an Evangelical Christian, a belief he credited for helping him stay grounded throughout his long career in the rock world.

Former Gov. Andrew Cuomo told business leaders on Wednesday that New York City has already experienced the ""danger"" of socialism.

With less than four weeks until Election Day, Zohran Mamdani maintains a double-digit lead in the race for New York City mayor, but former Gov. Andrew Cuomo is narrowing the gap, according to a new poll.

Mamdani, the 33-year-old democratic socialist state lawmaker from Queens who shocked the political world in June with his convincing win over Cuomo and nine other candidates to capture the Democratic Party's mayoral nomination, stands at 46% support among likely voters in a Quinnipiac University poll.

Cuomo, who resigned as governor in 2021 amid multiple scandals and who is running as an independent candidate in the general election after losing the primary, grabbed 33% support in the survey.

Guardian Angels co-founder Curtis Sliwa, who for a second straight election is the Republican mayoral nominee in the Democratic-dominated city, stood at 15% in the poll.

The survey in the nation's most populous city was conducted Oct. 3–7, entirely after embattled Mayor Eric Adams, a Democrat who was running for re-election as an independent, dropped out of the race. 

TRUMP LOOMS LARGE OVER 2025 ELECTIONS

In Quinnipiac University's previous poll, conducted in early September, Mamdani held a 22-point 45%-23% lead over Cuomo, with Sliwa at 15% and Adams at 12%.

""The numbers changed, but the contours of the race haven't. Andrew Cuomo picked up the bulk of Adams' supporters, cutting into Zohran Mamdani's lead, but Mamdani's frontrunner status by double digits stays intact,"" Quinnipiac University Poll Assistant Director Mary Snow said.

But Cuomo campaign spokesman Rich Azzopardi claimed in a statement that the survey confirmed that ""this race is shifting decisively"" and that ""Mamdani remains stagnant.""

Mamdani's strongest support is among Democrats (60%), Asian American voters (67%), voters 18 to 34 years old (62%) and voters 35 to 49 years old (60%), according to the poll.

Mamdani was winning the enthusiasm battle with 90% of his supporters saying they were very or somewhat enthusiastic. The level of enthusiasm dropped to 85% among Sliwa supporters and down to 69% among those backing Cuomo.

The Ugandan-born Mamdani, if elected, would become the first Muslim and first millennial mayor of the nation's most populous city.

Mamdani surged to the Democratic primary victory thanks to an energetic campaign that put a major focus on affordability and New York City's high cost of living. It was fueled by a grassroots army of supporters and backing from top national progressive champions, including Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont.

Mamdani made smart use of social media platforms, including TikTok, as he engaged low-propensity voters. He proposed eliminating fares to ride New York City's vast bus system, making CUNY (City University of New York) ""tuition-free,"" freezing rents on municipal housing, offering free childcare for children up to age 5 and setting up government-run grocery stores.

Mamdani has been heavily criticized by his rivals not only for his far-left proposals, but also for his criticism of Israel, his past negative comments regarding the New York City Police Department (NYPD) and his proposal to shift certain responsibilities away from the NYPD and focus on social services and community-based programs.

Acting U.S. attorney in California Bill Essayli discusses the arrest and charges of the suspect allegedly behind the Palisades fire on ‘The Ingraham Angle.' 

Federal investigators say a Florida man has been arrested in connection with one of the most destructive wildfires in California history, a blaze that began as a New Year's spark that charred some 7,000 structures and killed 12 people.

According to federal prosecutors, 29-year-old Jonathan Rinderknecht allegedly ignited a fire just after midnight on Jan. 1 along the Temescal Ridge Trail above Pacific Palisades. What began as a small brush fire on federal land soon roared into an inferno that would later reignite as the Palisades Fire, scorching more than 200 acres across the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area.

In a strange twist, authorities say that after the fire, Rinderknecht turned to ChatGPT, reportedly asking the artificial intelligence whether he might be responsible for the disaster.

A criminal complaint filed by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) details the sequence of events leading up to the fire and Rinderknecht's arrest. Federal prosecutors have charged him with arson of property receiving federal financial assistance, a felony carrying a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison. Below is a detailed timeline of the events, drawn from the federal complaint.

Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado dedicated her Nobel Peace Prize to President Donald Trump, thanking him for his help.

Machado was awarded the prize on Friday despite a campaign from Trump and his international allies, who said his peacemaking efforts earned him the award. The award put Trump and Machado in an awkward place, as the two are close allies. However, in a statement on X, Machado dedicated her award to Trump, saying he was pivotal in the fight for Venezuelan democracy.

“This recognition of the struggle of all Venezuelans is a boost to conclude our task: to conquer Freedom. We are on the threshold of victory and today, more than ever, we count on President Trump, the people of the United States, the peoples of Latin America, and the democratic nations of the world as our principal allies to achieve Freedom and democracy,” Machado said.

“I dedicate this prize to the suffering people of Venezuela and to President Trump for his decisive support of our cause!” she added.

The White House was noticeably disappointed by the snub but refrained from criticizing Machado.

“President Trump will continue making peace deals, ending wars, and saving lives. He has the heart of a humanitarian, and there will never be anyone like him who can move mountains with the sheer force of his will. The Nobel Committee proved they place politics over peace,” White House communications director Steven Cheung said on X.

Trump has painted himself as the peacemaker president, pointing to his decisive role in ending wars between India and Pakistan earlier this year and brokering a preliminary peace agreement between longtime foes Armenia and Azerbaijan.

His chances appeared better than ever this week after he won near-universal praise for his role in brokering a peace deal to end the Israel-Hamas war. However, the Nobel committee had already made up its mind. Trump's chances will be better next year if the Israel-Hamas peace deal holds.

While Trump has distinguished himself for peaceful overtures around the globe, his approach to Venezuela has been highly hawkish. He has moved significant military assets to the Gulf of America to combat drug traffickers from Venezuela, moves many analysts jointly see as an effort to intimidate Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro.

The aggressive moves by Washington, D.C., have sent Caracas into a panic, with Venezuela's United Nations representative warning that Trump was seeking to topple Maduro and threaten “peace, security, and stability regionally and internationally.”

Caracas said it expected an “armed attack” against Venezuela in “a very short time.”

VENEZUELAN OPPOSITION LEADER MARIA CORINA MACHADO AWARDED NOBEL PEACE PRIZE OVER TRUMP

Any regime change in Venezuela would involve installing Machado into power.

World leaders have taken turns praising Trump's peacemaking efforts and arguing that he deserves the Nobel Peace Prize for months. Russian President Vladimir Putin joined this chorus on Friday, saying the award had lost its legitimacy due to politicization and suggesting that Trump deserved it for his fruitful peace efforts. Trump thanked Putin in a post on Truth Social.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

President Donald Trump appeared to announce on Friday that he will no longer meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping on his trip to Asia, possibly endangering recent talks on a bilateral trade agreement with Beijing.

In a Friday post on Truth Social, Trump slammed China's recent imposition of tougher export controls on rare earth minerals, set to take effect in December, in an apparent effort to gain a negotiating advantage over the Trump administration. The decision could upend supply chains for American technology companies, which still source the vast majority of the rare earth metals and minerals required for chip production from China.

“Some very strange things are happening in China! They are becoming very hostile, and sending letters to Countries throughout the World, that they want to impose Export Controls on each and every element of production having to do with Rare Earths, and virtually anything else they can think of, even if it's not manufactured in China,” Trump said. “Our relationship with China over the past six months has been a very good one, thereby making this move on Trade an even more surprising one. I have always felt that they've been lying in wait, and now, as usual, I have been proven right! There is no way that China should be allowed to hold the World ‘captive,' but that seems to have been their plan for quite some time.”

As for canceling the meeting, Trump added that he has “not spoken to President Xi because there was no reason to do so.”

“This was a real surprise, not only to me, but to all the Leaders of the Free World. I was to meet President Xi in two weeks, at APEC, in South Korea, but now there seems to be no reason to do so,” he said.

White House officials did not say whether Trump's comments meant the meeting was off or simply a threat that he might skip out on the planned event.

WHAT WILL TRUMP'S ULTIMATE LEGACY BE: PEACEMAKER OR ‘DISRUPTOR'?

Trump also said China's decision to alert trading partners of the new trade restrictions was “especially inappropriate,” as Beijing announced them amid the Trump administration's efforts to advance a ceasefire in Gaza.

“Dependent on what China says about the hostile ‘order' that they have just put out, I will be forced, as President of the United States of America, to financially counter their move,” Trump concluded. “One of the Policies that we are calculating at this moment is a massive increase of Tariffs on Chinese products coming into the United States of America. There are many other countermeasures that are, likewise, under serious consideration.”","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

The sole debate between Virginia gubernatorial candidates, Democratic candidate Abigail Spanberger and Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears (R-VA), quickly devolved into disagreements and personal barbs over the brewing scandal surrounding Democrat Jay Jones.

Jones, the Democratic nominee for attorney general, previously sent violent text messages suggesting he would put two bullets into former Virginia Republican House Speaker Todd Gilbert. 

REPUBLICAN GOVERNORS ASSOCIATION POURS $1.5 MILLION IN VIRGINIA GUBERNATORIAL RACE AFTER JAY JONES SCANDAL

The revelation has roiled the Virginia race, with Republicans, including President Donald Trump, calling for Jones to exit the race. Earle-Sears, Virginia Attorney General Jason Miyares, and the National Republican Senatorial Committee have all released ads attacking Democrats over the Jones scandal. 

Democrats have condemned the messages but stopped short of calling for Jones to exit the race. Earle-Sears lambasted Spanberger over her silence on whether Jones should end his campaign.

In her response to the first question of the debate about the commonwealth's car tax, Earle-Sears quickly sought to make the debate about Jones and continued to attack in the one-hour discussion.

“I'm wondering why my opponent won't say beyond its abhorrent and disgusting … that he must leave the race because Jay Jones advocated the murder, Abigail, the murder of a man, a former speaker, as well as his children, who were 2 and 5 years old,” Earle-Sears said during the Thursday night debate.

“I was born in Jamaica, and when I was 10 years old, I saw that kind of political violence, which is why I'm asking my opponent to please ask him to get out of the race. Have some political courage,” she added. 

As Earle-Sears grilled Spanberger, she remained silent, refusing to answer her questions about Jones's role on the Democratic ticket.

“You have little girls. What would it take — him pulling the trigger? Is that what would do it? And then you would say he needs to get out of the race. Abigail, you have nothing to say? Abigail?” Earle-Sears taunted her.

Spanberger stood facing forward and didn't engage each time Earle-Sears turned to her to ask questions.

Spanberger told the audience at Norfolk State University that she abhors Jones's messages, but she repeatedly dodged questions about whether he should remain on the ticket. 

“The comments that Jay Jones made are absolutely abhorrent. I denounced them when I learned of them, and I will denounce them every opportunity I get,” Spanberger said at first. “As a mother, as a public servant, as a candidate for governor, I denounce them.”

She then attacked Earle-Sears for having selective outrage on political violence at the expense of Democrats. 

“My opponent, unfortunately, only denounces violence when her side is the target,” said Spanberger. 

“Don't lie like that, Abigail,” Earle-Sears interjected.

“I hope that in the future, she will endeavor to denounce violent rhetoric and violence, no matter who the victim,” Spanberger continued. “You routinely refer to me as your enemy. I'm not your enemy. You are not my enemy. We are political opponents.”

The Democratic gubernatorial candidate was again asked about the future of Jones's campaign, and she dodged the question.

“We are all running our individual races. I believe my opponent has said that about her lieutenant governor nominee,” Spanberger said as Earle-Sears interrupted her. “And it is up to every person to make their own decision. I am running my race to serve Virginia, and that is what I intend to do.” 

“I'm saying as of now, it's up to every voter to make their own individual decision. I am running for governor. I am accountable for the words that I say, for the acts that I take, for the policies that I have put out,” she added when asked again.

SPANBERGER TRIES TO REDIRECT ATTENTION AS REPUBLICANS POUNCE ON MOMENTUM AFTER JONES'S TEXTS

Throughout the debate, Earle-Sears was on offense, interrupting Spanberger's responses and pivoting her answers repeatedly to questions for her opponent. Moderators dinged her multiple times for talking over Spanberger.

Earle-Sears said Spanberger's refusal to pull her endorsement of Jones is a sign of poor leadership. 

“You have to make hard choices, and that means telling Jay Jones to leave the race,” Earle-Sears said.

“Abigail needs to say something,” she repeated.

Early voting has already begun in Virginia and ends Nov. 1 before Election Day on Nov. 4. The Jones scandal broke last week after early voting had started on Sept. 19.

It's difficult to say what the most telling fact is in the Middle East triumph of President Donald Trump and Israel. Is it that terrorist Iran backs the president's 20-point peace plan for Israel and Gaza? Is it that key Muslim neighbors, including Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Turkey, are all on board? Is it that Hamas, which started the war, will hand over all Israeli hostages, who are its last remaining bargaining chips, even while Israel keeps hold of more than half (53%) of Gaza?

What matters is that these and many other stunning developments add up to a massive win for the Middle East, the Palestinian people, Israel, the hostages and their families, and, not least, the United States.

No one knows if Trump's deal will lead to an overarching peace, which has eluded all American, Israeli, and Arab leaders since 1948. But even without it, there is more progress and hope now than at any time since at least the 1978 Camp David Accords and possibly since the founding of Israel.

The long, seemingly interminable, intractability of the problem is one reason that success is possible now. The Palestinians' Arab neighbors are sick of it. They want to end the pretense that war after war has been fought for Palestinian statehood and self-determination, when everyone knows they've really been about fanatical genocidal Islamism that is a problem for Arab nations, not just their Jewish neighbors. Arab nations want normal relations with Israel. They don't want to continue the definitional madness of repeated failure. They want economic growth, which would calm their restive peoples.

Pressure from Arabs and military defeat by Israel utterly isolated Hamas terrorists and left them this choice: surrender or death. They claim to love death, but their leaders enjoy their billions of dollars and chose survival.

This peace deal makes many things starkly clear, but three stand out.

First, whereas once-serious nations Britain, France, Canada, and Australia gave away Palestinian statehood, which they cannot deliver, in exchange for precisely nothing, Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu got a ceasefire without giving away statehood.

Second, the United Nations has proved irrelevant at best and at worst a grotesque impediment to peace. The U.N. was set up to achieve precisely the kind of international agreement that Trump now appears to have delivered, and all the gabfest on the East River did was help Hamas teach Jew-hatred to generations of Palestinian children.

OCT. 7 FACTS VS. FALSEHOODS 

Third, although Israelis and Gazans are jubilantly celebrating the prospect of peace, there is no similar joy among the phalanxes of Western lefties who've been demanding a ceasefire and an end to the nonexistent genocide of Palestinians from the moment Israel started fighting back two years ago. These schmucks didn't really want peace or care about Palestinian civilians. All they really wanted was for the terrorists to be able to murder, torture, rape, and kidnap Jews without being punished for it.

The lack of good faith in these supporters is apt, given the total absence of good faith among the people they support. Hamas cannot be trusted, and we should assume that it and others will return to anti-Israel, anti-Western terrorism. But right now, it is time to celebrate the return of hostages and a glimmer of light in this dark, benighted region.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:theatlantic.com","Why María Corina Machado Deserved the Nobel Peace Prize","https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2025/10/maria-machado-nobel-peace-prize/684510/","Fri, 10 Oct 2025 12:28:24 GMT","

The Venezuelan opposition leader shows why participation matters.

María Corina Machado, the leader of the Venezuelan opposition, has been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. The Norwegian Nobel Committee cited “her tireless work promoting democratic rights for the people of Venezuela” and “her struggle to achieve a just and peaceful transition from dictatorship to democracy.” When announcing the award, the committee chair described her as “a woman who keeps the flame of democracy burning amidst a growing darkness.”

This metaphor is apt. Machado is in hiding, deep inside a country that is failing. I spoke with her twice late last year, without knowing where she was. A few months before, the country had just held presidential elections. The opposition movement that she leads had won. Even though activists were being picked up off the streets, or simply shot and killed, they had held a primary, run a presidential campaign—Machado herself was barred, so Edmundo González was the candidate—and made sure that votes were counted accurately. Still, even after his definitive loss, Nicolás Maduro, the country's illegitimate leader, refused to hand over power.

Lately, Americans have been hearing little about Venezuela other than drugs and gangs, but the country has long been the home of one of the world's most impressive grassroots-democracy movements. At this moment, when citizens in many of the world's most successful liberal democracies are giving up, even questioning whether popular participation in politics has any value, Venezuelans fight violence with nonviolence, and oppose corruption through bravery. As I wrote in December:

During both of our conversations, Machado sat in front of a blank wall, with no other backdrop. Both times she was also calm, assured, even elegant. She didn't look tired or stressed, or whatever a person who hadn't seen her family or friends since July should look like. She wore makeup and simple jewelry. She sounded determined, positive. This is because, Machado told me, she believes that the campaign and its aftermath altered Venezuela forever, bringing about what she describes as “anthropological change.”

By this, she meant that the grassroots political movement she and her colleagues created has transformed attitudes in Venezuela and forged new connections between people. Her organization, in concert with others, carefully organized a primary campaign that brought together old opposition competitors. Volunteer training, she told me, gave hundreds of thousands of people a real experience not just of voting but of building institutions from scratch. Those efforts didn't end with last summer's election. “The 28th of July was not just an event,” Machado told me. “It's a process that has brought our country together. And regardless how many days it takes, Venezuela has changed forever and for the good.” Her team, with its leaders across the country, built not just a movement for one candidate or election, but a movement for permanent change. The scale of their achievement—the number of people involved, and their geographic and socioeconomic range—would be notable in a liberal democracy. In an authoritarian state, this project is remarkable.

What Machado wanted, she told me, was to

“transform completely—completely—the relationship we had between citizens and the state. We've only known the state deciding for us. Now it's going to be the other way around. We're going to have the society in power and making their own decisions, and the state at its service.”

She added:

“I went around the country saying, ‘I have nothing to offer but work. I have nothing to offer you but [the possibility] that we're going to get together, and we're going to put this country back on our feet. So we're going to do this right.' And people cried and prayed.”

Machado continues to be a fierce, uncompromising optimist. She founded an election-monitoring group more than two decades ago. Since then, she has continued to argue that engagement matters, and that change is possible. Participation, she argues, can make a difference. Any society can be made better, more just, and more free—even in places where that seems impossible.

Monticello was Thomas Jefferson's home in retirement, after decades of public service, including as the nation's third president. It was also, on any given day, crowded with women and young people—Jefferson's daughters by his wife, Martha; their 12 surviving children (six of them girls); his sister. Female visitors, including First Lady Dolley Madison, often popped by. Among the plantation's large enslaved workforce, women and children outnumbered men by roughly two to one. Some of those enslaved children were Jefferson's own, by Sally Hemings, who was also the half sister of his dead wife. Throughout the Age of Revolution, families made Monticello run.

Check out more from this issue and find your next story to read.

And so the site, where I serve as president, debuted a tour called “Women at Monticello” in 2024. Our guides prepared with customary rigor, reading widely in the ever-growing scholarship on women in the early republic. They devised a premise as sound as it was simple: The extraordinary stories of ordinary women, free and enslaved, would take center stage. And areas where women mostly spent their time, which guests are moved through quickly on regular tours, would claim pride of place.

Reviews were glowing. “I have been coming to Monticello for fifty years. This was in the top three best experiences ever,” one visitor wrote. Yet only a third of the tickets sold. At year-end, we made the difficult decision to concentrate the tour in the ghetto that is March: Women's History Month.

The fate of “Women at Monticello” hinged, in large part, on men. We built it; they didn't come. Barely one in five people who took the tour was male, though roughly 40 percent of our visitors are, which illustrates a long-standing problem: The general public doesn't much care about women's history. In the world of nonfiction best sellers—those wide-spined histories and biographies sold at airports—the wielding of public power remains the big story. The kitchen, the marriage bed, and the cradle are sideshows at best, and women's thoughts rarely make it onto the page.

Once upon a time, Abigail Adams hoped that America's Revolution might shift perspectives and priorities. “In the new Code of Laws which I suppose it will be necessary for you to make I desire you would Remember the Ladies,” she famously urged her husband in March 1776.

“I cannot but laugh,” John Adams replied.

In the quarter millennium since, scholars and activists have in different ways done their damnedest to wipe the smirk off his face. From the Revolution to the suffrage movement to the campaign for an Equal Rights Amendment and beyond, advocates have worked to wedge women's lives into the laws of the land. For decades, academic historians have painstakingly documented those efforts and their mingled successes and shortcomings. Field-altering books have deepened scholars' understanding of the domestic turmoil of Revolutionary America, among other moments.

Yet there has been no women's-history equivalent of Ron Chernow's Alexander Hamilton (2004), which has sold more than 2 million copies, much less of David McCullough's John Adams (2001), reprinted 19 times during its first three months, reaching 1 million copies well before the acclaimed HBO miniseries. In 2006, Publishers Weekly wondered whether a “Distaff David McCullough,” as a headline put it, might appear on the horizon. First ladies and other women close to male power seemed likeliest to break through. Yet PW 's candidate, A Perfect Union: Dolley Madison and the Creation of the American Nation, by the historian Catherine Allgor, fell short of high sales expectations. Women read novels, men read about influential men, and the world goes round.

Now, nearly two decades later, Amanda Vaill's Pride and Pleasure: The Schuyler Sisters in an Age of Revolution has a chance to inspire some welcome crossover. Vaill has an impressive track record as a biographer (character!) and a screenwriter (plot!). She need not plead, “Remember the ladies”; her trio of luminous sisters is lodged in public memory already. Thanks to Lin-Manuel Miranda's Hamilton, Eliza Schuyler (the middle sister who married the musical's eponymous hero), fiery Angelica Schuyler Church (the eldest), and clear-eyed Peggy Schuyler Van Rensselaer (the youngest) come with their own playlist. America's 250th anniversary makes securing their position on the country's patriotic bookshelf an especially worthy challenge.

But for Vaill to take her place as the “Distaff David McCullough” demands more than familiar protagonists and narrative brilliance. The core premise of women's history has long been that when we reorient the inquiry, we not only introduce new characters but change the story itself, upending ideas about what lies at the margins and what at the center. One mustn't, as the saying goes, simply add women and stir. Half the human race aren't mere chips in the batter; their inclusion calls for a whole new cake.

The colonial struggle against the British Crown began in the household, over taxes on home goods. One of the earliest artifacts of what would become the independence movement is a teapot, produced in London circa 1766, emblazoned with the motto No Stamp Act. Tea was consumed chiefly in private; Mother poured out. Newspapers were filled with columns urging women to boycott imported items. “Love your country much better than fine things,” exhorted an “Address to the Ladies” in The Boston Post-Boy. Many women did so, forswearing British wares, spinning flax on town greens, and swapping handwritten patriotic verse while drinking herbal-tea substitutes.

Up and down the Eastern Seaboard, women spoke the language of American liberty. The poet Phillis Wheatley, whose literary renown had helped secure her freedom from slavery, addressed George Washington, praising America's struggle on the battlefield as “freedom's cause,” which any reader would have recognized as her own. “And be it known unto Britain, even American daughters are Politicians & Patriots,” Boston's Hannah Winthrop told her friend Mercy Otis Warren, who would become, in 1805, the author of one of the first comprehensive accounts of American independence. In a preface to her three-volume History of the Rise, Progress and Termination of the American Revolution, Warren said she had written it because “every manly arm was occupied,” a convenient fiction.

Abigail Adams was hardly alone in raising what soon came to be called “the woman question.” Her husband's laughter was the nervous sort. “We have been told that our Struggle has loosened the bands of Government every where,” he explained: “Children and Apprentices were disobedient—that schools and Colledges were grown turbulent—that Indians slighted their Guardians and Negroes grew insolent to their Masters.” But women, he continued, were a “Tribe more numerous and powerfull than all the rest.” He feared “the Despotism of the Petticoat.” Thomas Jefferson was likewise discomfited by the revolutionary possibility of female citizenship. He understood Warren as a political ally, and helped fund the publication of her trilogy, which he placed on a list of recommended titles by authors including Herodotus, Voltaire, and Benjamin Franklin. Yet he counseled Angelica Schuyler Church, with whom he had grown quite chummy in Paris, that the “tender breasts of ladies were not formed for political convulsion.” Angelica had been reading up on the struggles of the Federalists, especially her brother-in-law Alexander Hamilton's, to ratify their blueprint for the nation. The “question on the new Constitution,” so consuming for men, “need not agitate you,” Jefferson wrote. She mustn't imitate Parisian salonistes: “French ladies miscalculate much their own happiness when they wander from the true field of their influence into that of politicks.”

At home as in society at large, the Revolution really did threaten to turn the world upside down. Still, what John Adams called “our Masculine systems” mostly held fast.

The American Revolution clearly meant something to North American women. Some of them waged it, encamping with the armies, cooking, cleaning, and nursing, and, in a few exceptional cases, grabbing muskets themselves. Many reckoned with its ideals; pervasive talk of liberty held particular portent for women's lives. And virtually all women east of the Appalachians experienced the violence, sickness, and scarcity of a civil war in which front lines and home fronts were never far apart.

But what did women mean to the American Revolution? Modern scholarship on its formative role in women's lives, and vice versa, took an important turn in 1980, when two young historians published landmark books on the subject—second books, because each had been told that a dissertation on a topic quite so pots-and-pans wouldn't do. Mary Beth Norton offered a social historian's answer in Liberty's Daughters: The Revolutionary Experience of American Women, 1750–1800. She focused on “the constant patterns of women's lives”—bleeding, marrying, birthing, tending—and the ways the Revolutionary War altered them. The shifts she analyzed were more personal than political: subtle changes in duties, in self-conception, and occasionally in willingness to advocate. Judith Sargent Murray, who in 1790 published the pseudonymous essay “On the Equality of the Sexes,” offered one case in point. In 1798, Murray “confidently predicted the dawn of ‘a new era of female history.' ” Norton's own assessment of the Revolution's “ambiguous” legacy for women was far more sober.

In Women of the Republic: Intellect and Ideology in Revolutionary America, Linda K. Kerber addressed the ideas that remade the political family. Instead of a royal patriarch ruling over voiceless subjects, America would be a fraternity of virtuous (male) citizens, created equal in their potential for self-government. Even those who thought women shouldn't meddle in government acknowledged that they “could—and should—play a political role through the raising of a patriotic child,” and needed education to do so. The figure Kerber called the “Republican Mother” forged the polity at one step's remove, “a citizen but not really a constituent.” Kerber underlined the “inherent paradox” of republican motherhood: It thickened the boundary between male and female realms. Yet her book is sunnier than Norton's, more confident that the Revolution set American women on a road toward equality, however steep and circuitous.

Two years after Norton and Kerber launched their revolutionary books, the Equal Rights Amendment went down in defeat. In the ensuing decades, feminism stalled, regrouped, and fizzled again. One major party put forth its first female candidates for president, both of whom lost, consequentially. Women's rights rolled back, and a new pronatalism—republican motherhood for the 21st century—marched forward.

All the while, historians remembered the ladies, broadening the cast of Revolutionary-era female figures to include enslaved and self-liberated Black women, Loyalist women, poor women, Native women, and “female husbands,” who rejected the gender binary altogether. Across their differences, shared status bound most women in the early republic. Their paths to property blocked by law and custom, and their literacy limited by education and expectation, their lives left fewer traces. In other words, they resisted the McCullough treatment.

Washington, Adams, Hamilton, Jefferson, Franklin; rinse and repeat: A new life of one of the Revolution's male heroes appears in bookstores most years around Father's Day. In the 1990s, a time of crisis for the publishing industry, Founders' biographies revived an old tradition. At least since 1800, when Parson Weems published his Life of Washington, biography has been the medium through which most Americans have understood the birth of their country. That is not a bad thing: The genre admits nuance, with every human life as patterned yet unique as a fingerprint. And it insists that everyone, past and present, lives in both epochal and personal time, making and made by history.

So, too, Amanda Vaill's Schuyler sisters. Staking a claim not just to the significance of her protagonists but also to her own stature as a portraitist in the grand manner, Vaill builds on some of the most compelling writing about women in early America, which has peered into the households of famous men, drawing on ample records to cast light in otherwise shadowy corners. Annette Gordon-Reed's The Hemingses of Monticello (2008) made Sally Hemings, from whom not a word survives, a figure crucial to understanding the workings of power in the early American republic. Jill Lepore deftly explored the chiaroscuro nature of famous-man/hidden-woman histories in Book of Ages: The Life and Opinions of Jane Franklin (2013), her biography of Benjamin Franklin's sister.

The Schuyler sisters' proximity to male power similarly helps them assert main-character status. Eliza, Angelica, and Peggy may not have been “in the room where it happened,” as Lin-Manuel Miranda puts it. But a lot of things did happen in the elegant rooms where they lived and loved. Born into a wealthy Dutch landowning clan in upstate New York, they led a cosmopolitan and politically connected existence, surrounded from childhood by political ferment. The combination of their privilege and their family's mobility—scattered by war, public service, and personal ambition—created a rich trove of correspondence, more of which has surfaced since Chernow published Hamilton.

The short life of Alexander Hamilton both feeds and fetters Vaill's project. The book opens with his violent death, in 1804, before he turned 50. By then Peggy was dead, her health having declined after a string of miscarriages. Angelica had barely a decade left, but Eliza lived another half century. Tragic though Hamilton's early death was, it offers Vaill a rare opportunity: less time to worry about the capital-F Founder dominating the foreground, and more space in which to figure out what flavor and texture that whole new cake might have. It also creates a rare burden: Can Eliza make history on her own?

Vaill's bold choice to narrate the family's experience in the present tense, as they lived it, while rendering the broader course of human events in the simple past, keeps us close to the action. Indeed, it redefines what counts as action. The sidelining of women's lives, Vaill argues, leaves readers with the illusion of “two histories”: a vivid chronicle of events without women, and quieter female annals without events. To encompass both, she swaps foreground and background. She muses: What if the painter John Trumbull—a side character in the Schuylers' lives—had portrayed an exchange of marriage vows with the stylistic gravitas of history painting? Vaill creates that canvas, dismantling the false binary of public and private that Linda Kerber's work analyzed long ago.

Philip Schuyler, the father of Angelica, Eliza, and Peggy, was, like so many others of his day, a marriage-made man. In wedding Catherine Van Rensselaer in 1755, as the Seven Years' War began, he increased his wealth, acreage, and political standing. He represented his Albany district in the provincial assembly in Manhattan, regularly shuttling between the two cities. As the imperial crisis deepened, he joined the second of the colonies' Congresses in Philadelphia, in 1775; before the delegates debated independence, he departed to serve as a major general in the new Continental Army. “My heart bleeds as I view the horrors of civil war,” he wrote that spring.

Meanwhile, Catherine continued to bear child after child, 15 in all. As fighting began, the three eldest Schuylers—now marriageable young ladies—attended dancing assemblies, on the lookout for mates. For a time, “the war—if it is a war yet—makes little difference in their lives,” Vaill writes. The girls' second cousin and sometime ﻿guardian hoped to keep it that way, noting: “Our Sex are doomed to be obedient in every stage of life so that we shant be great gainers by this contest.” About this, she was both right and wrong.

The Schuyler sisters and their friends, not unlike European heads of state, knew that intimate alliances cemented political ones. But Angelica, Eliza, and Peggy participated in a marriage market where young people's preferences had begun to trump parental wishes. The sisters received gentleman callers, including, in Eliza's case, the dashing young officer and future British spy John André. In a startling number of instances, women eloped, making their choices before parents could intervene—or even, in Angelica's case, flying in the face of paternal disapproval. At 21, she ran off with an English émigré calling himself John Carter, a match that set the course of a wild and roaming life.

A combination of lusty letters and Vaill's writerly gifts gives Eliza's courtship with Hamilton dramatic momentum. How quickly he pivots from assuring his bosom friend John Laurens, in 1779, that he had no use for a wife—“I have plagues enough without desiring to add to the number that greatest of all”—to telling Eliza, the following year, that his love for her has induced “a sort of insanity.” As their wedding nears, Hamilton reminds Eliza, “You are going to do a very serious thing,” because husbands “retain the power of happiness and misery.” As Abigail Adams said, all men would be tyrants if they could.

Hamilton was no tyrant, but he wasn't a very good husband, either. Low-born and yearning, he was in many ways insatiable. He told Eliza she was “a woman I love to weakness,” and he meant it. But to say that he loved women to weakness may have been more accurate. John Adams later attributed Hamilton's passionate nature to a humoral imbalance: “a superabundance of secretions which he could not find Whores enough to draw off.” The Freudian in me senses an attachment disorder. Deprived of a father, mortified by his mother, he craved the reflection he saw in women's eyes. Marrying Eliza was, as a friend told him, an epic “conquest” that delivered him riches and family station. His life would have been longer, and happier, had he stopped there.

From the start, Hamilton ingratiated himself with Eliza's sisters, especially Angelica. By 1781, as he fought alongside Washington to win the new country, Hamilton had begun to tuck saucy private notes for his sister-in-law into letters to his wife. In 1783, Carter, soon to be revealed as the absconded and bankrupt John Barker Church, spirited Angelica to Europe. Over the years they spent in London and Paris, Angelica adopted ever more continental manners, playing the coquette with Jefferson, the Marquis de Lafayette, and Franklin, and communicating regularly, and secretly, with her brother-in-law.

Meanwhile, Hamilton drew Eliza into his public world after the war, moving their growing family to Lower Manhattan, where he practiced law and entered government. Vaill places the writing of The Federalist Papers in a busy household context, with Hamilton testing out arguments on Eliza, his “sounding board” and sometime amanuensis. When the essays were published in book form, Eliza dispatched an early copy across the Atlantic to Angelica, but not before she inked her own name on the title page, “giving herself a position of ownership, if not authorship,” Vaill writes. “See? she all but says to her sister, I do important things, too.”

In London, Angelica used her private connections to elevate her husband's public power, scheming to ensure Church's election to Parliament in 1790. She pitied Eliza, whom Hamilton had by then dragged to Philadelphia, the new seat of the federal government. “Are you obliged to bear the formalities of female circles, and their trifling chit chat?” she asked. But Eliza knew that the role of hostess was political. Angelica, too, helped shape Hamilton's thinking, sending him Adam Smith's The Wealth of Nations from a London bookshop. Men at the time acknowledged such contributions: Noting Eliza's facility with the household accounts, Secretary of War James McHenry told Hamilton that she “has as much merit as your treasurer, as you have as treasurer of the wealth of the United States.”

Would that Hamilton had had a republican mother to teach him the straight and narrow path of self-government! He might have been warier when, in the summer of 1791, a 23-year-old stranger named Maria appeared on his doorstep with a terrible tale. Seduced at 15, she'd been married, abused, and abandoned by a man named James Reynolds. Maria said she needed money, which Hamilton agreed to supply. But no sooner had he repaired to her boardinghouse with a check than he felt moved to offer softer solace. “Some conversation ensued,” he later wrote, “from which it was quickly apparent that other than pecuniary consolation would be acceptable.”

As any reader of novels should have realized, the ardent Cabinet secretary with a savior complex had wandered into a trap, which James Reynolds soon sprang: He had pimped his wife in a blackmail scheme. Eliza, who had taken the children to Albany for several months, returned and was soon pregnant with the Hamiltons' fifth child. A block away, the affair and the extortion continued.

So far, so wretchedly private.

Then, in late 1792, James Reynolds was arrested for fraud. When Hamilton refused him legal help, Reynolds told all who would listen that the Treasury secretary had masterminded his financial chicanery. Maria, doubtless at her husband's direction, supplied Hamilton's political opponents with revealing letters that she and Hamilton had exchanged. A delegation confronted Hamilton, who confessed to being an adulterer, but no thief. They took him at his word of honor, and gave him theirs.

But five years later, copies of the incriminating letters found their way to the scurrilous newsman James Callender, the same columnist who would soon break the story of Jefferson's sexual relationship with Sally Hemings. Hamilton, convinced that salvaging his fiscal reputation required him to air his personal failings, published a lengthy tract, baring all.

The Reynolds affair has long been well documented. Chernow lavished pages on it, as Vaill does. His chief concern was the impact on the great man's career; she cares more about what Eliza experienced. Nothing has surfaced to document her anguish. And so Vaill leaves the disgraced politician and his wife where the evidence does, “alone with their thoughts in the dark.”

“A disappointed politician is very apt to take refuge in a Garden,” Hamilton wrote to a friend in 1802 from his new home, the Grange, in Upper Manhattan. Relegated to private life, he was in his mid-40s, father to seven living children. (The eldest, Philip, had died the year before, in a duel.) But his last two years proved anything but an idyll. They swirled with rumors and reckless dares, and, finally, public insults directed at his longtime rival Aaron Burr, whose bullet killed him in 1804. Philip, Eliza's father, died just months later.

Chernow's Hamilton ends there; widowed Eliza gets a scant nine pages. “For Eliza Hamilton, the collapse of her world was total, overwhelming, and remorseless,” Chernow writes. Vaill has a different project, which demands different proportions. Eliza lived to the astonishing age of 97, having spent just 24 years with Hamilton. Vaill devotes about a quarter of Pride and Pleasure to Eliza's widowhood, in a section called, fittingly, “Nameless Satisfactions.”

Vaill reads Eliza's widowed years as a kind of breakout: Nora's life after A Doll's House. “Until now, she's been—while not passive—a person to whom things happened,” she writes. “Now she begins to be, as much as her circumstances allow, a person who makes them happen.” Eliza had been enmeshed in world-historical events through the careers of her father and her husband. After their deaths, the headlines receded. And after Angelica's, so did the family letters.

Yet the second half of Eliza's life remained quietly consequential. She joined the kinds of organizations that American women pioneered in the early 19th century—activism that made claims on the public purse and prefigured demands for formal political rights. Even as she coped with her husband's debts and her father's incomplete will, she focused on others less fortunate, becoming a director of New York's Orphan Asylum Society, which tried to fill with charity the holes in a legal system that had yet to address the lives of women and children. The society had a constitution, written by women, and public meetings gaveled and attended by them. The directors petitioned New York State for an official charter, which they received, like a woman-run bank. They bought land and put up a building, housing numerous poor children.

Eliza also lobbied Congress to safeguard the historical records of the Founders. She arranged and preserved Hamilton's archive, painful though the work could be. Vaill paints a wonderful scene in which Eliza discovers, among her husband's personal effects, “sheets and sheets of paper covered with Angelica's distinctive slanting handwriting,” some sent directly to his office. “Suddenly all the hints and whispers and sideways glances Eliza has spent years trying to ignore make sense.” She sets them aside but does not destroy them. Her advocacy shaped Hamilton's official papers, too. Eliza sued the politician Rufus King to repossess the documents establishing Hamilton's authorship of George Washington's farewell address, which she knew about because she had been in the room where it happened. Every book that has been written about Washington's administration since—whether scholarly or popular, whether great-man or women's history, or Vaill's marvelous fusion of both—owes a debt to Eliza Schuyler Hamilton.

In 1848, Congress invited Mrs. Alexander Hamilton, venerable relic, to the ceremony laying the cornerstone for the Washington Monument. She attended, sweltering in widow's weeds, on July 4, weeks shy of her 91st birthday. She had lived to see the flesh-and-blood brotherhood that waged Revolution turned to marble memorials. She can't have remembered them that way, and Vaill won't let her readers do so, either. Her book is an act not only of recovery, but of world building, restoring the connections between home and history that made the American Revolution.

Vaill's historical and literary achievement is to convey what it felt like to be a woman who, as she writes of Angelica, longed “to put her fingertips to history,” even if she touched it only softly. Just as important, she restores the era's male headliners to the households that nurtured and sustained them. Her Founders were fathers, and mothers, too. But for Pride and Pleasure to escape the fate of “Women at Monticello,” male readers will need to find Vaill's truths self-evident: that women mattered to the political life of the early republic. And that household life mattered, and still matters, to history.

Telling the full story of the town's past is an easy way to make a lot of people mad.

Thirty-one years ago, there was a slave auction at Colonial Williamsburg.

On October 10, 1994, two Black men and two Black women were led up the steps and onto the porch of an 18th-century tavern. They were made to stand in front of thousands of people as their bodies were examined by prospective buyers. An auctioneer informed the crowd that only gentlemen with appropriate letters of credit would be permitted to bid. Some in the crowd looked on in astonishment; some turned away and began to cry. That the people onstage were actors did not make the spectacle easy to watch.

“It was done realistically, with all the horror and pain that you'd expect,” Ron Hurst told me recently. Hurst, who has worked at Colonial Williamsburg for more than 40 years, was a curator at the time. He now oversees preservation and education efforts at the site. Reactions to the event were mixed, he recalled. Some people thought it was a powerful indictment of the 18th-century injustice. Others were deeply upset; members of the local Black community had tried to stop the auction from happening. Two protesters sat on the steps of the tavern and challenged officials to call the police. How, they wondered, could the event's organizers not have understood the pain and humiliation it would cause?

The slave auction was the first and last of its kind. But it was hardly unique for Colonial Williamsburg in its blurring of the lines between performance and reality. In the '90s, visitors might encounter the sounds of human beings being whipped, or the sight of fugitive slaves trying to escape. Black actors would portray enslaved people while white actors portrayed men on slave patrol. A few visitors attacked the white actors, attempting to wrestle away their muskets. Another visitor tried to lead a revolt against the enslavers. “There are only three of them and a hundred of us!” he shouted. The site no longer depicts slave patrols, but it does not shy away from the realities of slavery.

In June, I went there to find out how the nation's largest living-history museum is telling America's origin story at a time when questions of how best to convey the truth about the past have become highly politicized. Since January, the Trump administration has put pressure on schools, universities, and museums to provide students with a so-called patriotic education. In March, an executive order outlined a policy to “restore” federal historical sites “to solemn and uplifting public monuments that remind Americans of our extraordinary heritage” and “unmatched record of advancing liberty, prosperity, and human flourishing.” In this environment, even private historical sites that rely on federal funding have been forced to lay off staff and halt the opening of long-planned exhibits. Colonial Williamsburg, which is run by a private foundation and receives no federal funding, has largely been spared these painful choices.

Clint Smith: What it means to tell the truth about America

Still, the site, which welcomes hundreds of thousands of visitors a year, has long had to consider questions of whose history it is telling, how, and to whom. The land on which it sits was purchased during the 1920s by John D. Rockefeller Jr., who used his wealth to re-create Virginia's colonial capital with an eye toward nostalgic patriotism. Colonial Williamsburg's founders, Hurst told me, holding his thumb and index finger about an inch apart, were seeing “a picture that was this big.” World War I had just ended, and Rockefeller wanted the site to look back fondly on the nation's founding.

This sensibility persisted through World War II and well into the Cold War. The site made extensive efforts in the 1980s and '90s to incorporate more stories of Black life—hence the slave auction and the whippings. But critics argued that these efforts did little to change the overall narrative put forward by Colonial Williamsburg, in which, they said, slavery was not so much part of a greater set of American contradictions as a speed bump on the otherwise straight road of progress. In 1997, the scholars Richard Handler and Eric Gable referred to the site as a “Republican Disneyland.”

Black people visiting and working in Colonial Williamsburg have felt these tensions keenly. Parts of Colonial Williamsburg, notably its facilities for employees, remained segregated throughout the 1950s and '60s. In more recent decades, up through the present, Black “interpreters”—Colonial Williamsburg's word for its employees who dress in period costume—have shared stories of being subjected to harassment and abuse from visitors: Are you going on the auction block today? How much do you sell for? On other occasions, Black interpreters have had “boy” shouted at them jeeringly or had the old Dixie anthem whistled in their direction.

As we sat in front of the Governor's Palace, where Thomas Jefferson and Patrick Henry once lived, Hurst said that Williamsburg has tried to become more thoughtful about the way it depicts the history of Black life, both free and enslaved. Today, for example, one can go on the Freedom's Paradox walking tour, which examines how America's revolutionary ideals of liberty and freedom could exist at the same time as the savagery of chattel slavery. “I think our founders in the 1920s and '30s would be shocked at the stories we tell today,” Hurst said.

So are many contemporary Americans. In 2023, Hurst said, Colonial Williamsburg was criticized by both “The 1619 Project” docuseries and the Heritage Foundation: “ ‘1619' saying we weren't doing enough history of the enslavement. Heritage Foundation saying we were doing too much. So we figure we must be in the right place.”

To Hurst, talking about things like slavery is a matter not of politics, but of empirical truth. He cited the fact that more than half of Williamsburg's population was Black at the time of the Revolution. Colonial Williamsburg, he said, has a duty to tell the stories of the people who were, in fact, the majority, most of whom were enslaved. If that makes some visitors uncomfortable, so be it.

From the December 2023 issue: Lonnie G. Bunch III asks why America is afraid of Black history

According to Hurst, the foundation's board deliberately reflects a mix of political views and professional backgrounds; Carly Fiorina, who ran for president in 2016 as a Republican, serves as chair. Interpreters are careful not to give contemporary political opinions when interacting with the public, and to ground their commentary in the historical record. “We're not trying to convince them of anything,” Hurst said. “We're teaching them American history.” Mostly, visitors are grateful. “What we hear most often, and we hear it again and again, is ‘I had no idea. Thank you for doing this.' ”

The goal, Hurst said, is “to tell you everything that happened—the good and the bad.” But of course that isn't as simple as it sounds.

“So my nephews were shocked to hear that you owned slaves,” a woman behind me said to the man playing Thomas Jefferson. How, she asked, could this Founding Father have held people in bondage—more than 600 over the course of his lifetime, including four of his own children—while proclaiming that all men were created equal?

Beneath a canopy of white oaks and red maples, “Jefferson” stood onstage in a knee-length navy-blue coat and a black tricorn hat. He leaned forward with both hands on his cane to make eye contact with the woman's 5-year-old nephew, Nathan. “Is that the question, young friend?” Nathan nodded.

The actor, Kurt Smith, straightened up. “The truth is, I grew up in one world,” he said as Jefferson, extending his left arm, “and I'm hoping to create another”—here he extended his right arm. He explained that when his father died, he, as the eldest male, had inherited everything, including his father's enslaved property. “This is a strange thing,” he said, “to be 14 years of age and own people.” His voice became softer. “I grew up with them. I grew up in that society. And yet, in '76 we had the opportunity to convert what we grew up with, what we literally inherited, and ask ourselves, Can we do something else? Can we do something better? Can we create a society that is different from the one that we inherited? ” Jefferson and the other Founding Fathers, of course, failed to rid the nation of its original sin; in many ways, they actively codified it.

Earlier, during Jefferson's monologue, Smith had posed another rhetorical question. “We have asked ourselves an audacious question in 1776—is mankind ready to self-govern?”

“Doesn't seem like it,” a woman said from the back row. Some in the audience laughed nervously. Others shook their head.

A few hours later, I met Smith, who was still in costume, under the shade of an oak tree behind Wetherburn's Tavern, a popular gathering place in Williamsburg in the 1750s. It was swelteringly hot and humid, and sweat rolled down both of our faces. “Can I take this thing off?” Smith asked, pointing to his wig. He fanned himself with his tricorn hat. Even when he was out of character, his voice carried the melodic cadence of theatrical performance, as if he was always within a moment of transitioning into song or soliloquy.

Smith started playing Jefferson nearly 10 years ago, and is one of two people in the world who play the role full-time. (The other, Bill Barker—who plays an older Jefferson—worked at Colonial Williamsburg for 26 years before moving to Monticello in 2019.) His job involves research as well as acting: Smith told me he's read tens of thousands of documents written by Jefferson. The day we met, he had just come back from the Huntington's library in San Marino, California, which has an extensive collection of the third president's letters.

Smith often does a presentation on the contentious election of 1800, in which Federalists in the House of Representatives, faced with a choice between Jefferson and Aaron Burr, two Democratic Republicans, began plotting how they might steal the election, preventing either candidate from being elected by appointing someone of their choice. After January 6, 2021, Smith said, people would ask, Are you trying to say something? “And the truth is, no. This is just what's in Jefferson's life.”

During his tenure, which has included two Trump presidencies, COVID‑19, and the murder of George Floyd, Smith has encountered visitors from all across the political spectrum. Most audiences, he said, ask about Jefferson's slave ownership. Some people think that Jefferson has been unjustly castigated by the woke mob, while others see him as an indefensible monster. “I had someone right down the street put his finger in my chest,” Smith told me. “He said, ‘You are America's original sin.' ” Another time, a man stood up in the middle of Smith's performance and yelled, “Why do you hate white people?”

“I think in many ways, our job here is just to provide a place where we can talk about ourselves,” Smith said. As visitors learn America's founding story, he believes, they inevitably make connections to the present, and think about the ways America is moving closer to, or away from, what is laid out in its aspirational documents. “It's safer to talk about them”—colonial Americans—“even though we're actually talking about us.”

Stephen Seals grabbed his wide-brimmed straw hat to stop it from blowing away. He adjusted his glasses and straightened his brown waistcoat. Seals, who has worked at Colonial Williamsburg for 17 years, portrays James Armistead Lafayette, an enslaved man who served in the Continental Army. He estimates that he has performed as James Lafayette more than 1,000 times.

Many Black people would find the idea of playing an enslaved person at a public historical site emotionally taxing or simply humiliating, and Colonial Williamsburg has always had a difficult time finding actors to fill those roles. I myself was uneasy when I realized that Seals would be doing a first-person interpretation of an enslaved man. I worried, in part, that he would try to use an exaggerated 18th-century Black vernacular in a way that can render enslaved people as caricatures and obscure their humanity and intellect.

But Seals doesn't use dialect; he wants the audience to focus less on how he's speaking and more on James Lafayette's story. Born on a Virginia plantation, James was enslaved by William Armistead, an ardent Patriot who allowed him to enlist in the Continental Army. James may have done this hoping his service would be rewarded with freedom. He soon began working for the Marquis de Lafayette as a spy: Pretending to be a runaway slave, he crossed British lines, pledged his allegiance to the redcoats, and became a courier on their behalf. During the remainder of the Revolutionary War, James operated as a double agent, sharing important tactical and operational information with the Americans and feeding British officials false information about American military plans. Many historians credit his espionage with helping American and French forces defeat the British during the siege of Yorktown, which effectively ended the war. In 1787, James was granted his freedom by the Virginia Assembly, in part thanks to Lafayette's personal advocacy. After he was emancipated, he chose to adopt Lafayette as his last name.

Seals is constantly reading new documents that historians have discovered and refining his presentation, and he keeps in touch with James Lafayette's descendants. He finds it particularly gratifying when people tell him that he's helped them understand enslavement, and the revolution itself, in new ways. Growing up in Charleston, West Virginia, and later Richmond, Virginia, Seals attended predominantly white schools that he said mostly overlooked the role of Black Americans in their curriculum, except during February. “I don't want any Black kids coming to a historic site and not seeing themselves reflected in their history like I did,” he told me. “Because it made me worry that maybe there was no place for me in this country.”

We stood together outside the Williamsburg Bray School, one of the first schools in America created to educate Black students. Ann Wager, the founding teacher, opened the school in 1760 with the aim of using it to convince hundreds of Black children between the ages of 3 and 10 that their position at the bottom of the social hierarchy was a natural one, ordained by God, and that, as such, they should be “obedient to their masters.” The school closed in 1774, after Wager died, and is the oldest remaining 18th-century structure in which Black children were educated. After undergoing an extensive renovation and relocation, it was reopened to the public this summer as a new exhibit in Colonial Williamsburg.

To Seals, the site is a moving testament to the creativity, ingenuity, and resilience of Black people in 18th-century Williamsburg. Even though the school's intent was to use education to indoctrinate Black students about their own inferiority, he said, many of them used the education they received, specifically the ability to read, to more fully imagine a future where freedom was possible, and to advocate for it. (This was before white Virginians made it illegal, in 1831, to teach an enslaved person how to read.)

Seals never planned to remain at Colonial Williamsburg for this long, but he hadn't anticipated how fulfilling he would find it to talk about slavery every day. Discussing it made him emotional. “I'm realizing just how powerful what I've been able to do over the last 17 years has been, and how much of an honor it is to give a voice to the ancestors after all this time.”

Not every Black person working at Colonial Williamsburg has had such a straightforwardly positive experience. For Janice Canaday, who has worked at the site in various capacities for 22 years, it's been far more complicated.

Canaday attends and serves on the board of the same nearby church to which her relatives belonged generations ago. It traces its origins to the American Revolution, when a small group of free and enslaved Black worshippers began gathering on plantations near Williamsburg. They were led by an enslaved tavern worker and minister, Gowan Pamphlet, and in the early 19th century, they built the First Baptist Church on land that a local businessman had offered them. The project came with enormous risks: Virginia law prevented Black people from assembling freely, out of fear that such a gathering could lead to revolt.

After the church was destroyed by a tornado, congregants built another, larger structure in 1856. They would continue to worship there for a century, until they relocated again; Colonial Williamsburg bought the second church building in 1956 and subsequently demolished it. This was consistent with how Colonial Williamsburg had approached its relationship to the Black community throughout the early-to-mid-20th century. As Colonial Williamsburg expanded, Black people were bought out, pushed out, and left out.

In September 2020, a few months after nationwide protests erupted following George Floyd's murder, Colonial Williamsburg's archaeology department began to excavate the original church site, in consultation with the local Black community. Below what had become a parking lot, they discovered pieces of the original church building, as well as a cemetery that held the remains of more than 60 of the congregation's members.

I met Canaday, who is 68, at the excavation site this summer. “The history's bubbling up out of the ground,” she said. Colonial Williamsburg is one of the largest employers in the area, and Canaday told me it had been a part of her life for as long as she can remember: “Everybody in my family worked at Colonial Williamsburg.” Her 91-year-old sister worked there for nearly 50 years. Her grandfather worked at Colonial Williamsburg in the 1940s. Each of her six children has worked there; one son started as a junior interpreter when he was 5. Today he drives a carriage bringing visitors around the grounds.

Canaday is the first person to serve as Colonial Williamsburg's engagement manager for the African American community. But as a young person, Canaday did not feel a connection to the site. “I never saw myself in the story,” she said. “I can't tell you how depressing that was.”

When she first applied to work there as a teenager, she told me, she was offered a job as a maid. She refused the job, seeing it as a symptom of what many in the local Black community perceived to be a flattening of their historical contributions. A local Black minister once suggested that Colonial Williamsburg was trying to bring back “slavery times.” Canaday told me that some Black people in Williamsburg still feel this way, and tell her she shouldn't be working there.

But Canaday believes that, today, Colonial Williamsburg does a better job of telling the truth about its whole history, even if some visitors aren't always receptive to what they hear. “It depends on where they come from and how they grew up—what their grandma and granddaddy told them. Because when you tell our story”—she brought her index finger to her chest—“you're really shaking the foundation of other people's stories.”

From the August 2019 issue: Drew Gilpin Faust on race and history in Virginia

The way people react to this foundation-shaking has contributed to the difficulty Colonial Williamsburg has had in hiring and retaining Black interpreters. “You can ask any of the Black interpreters here—every week, somebody is going to remind you of who you are,” she told me. Not long ago, Canaday was taunted by a group of teenage boys wearing MAGA hats. In what seemed like an attempt to goad her, they asked her how she felt about the hats. “It's on your head; it's not on mine,” she responded. When they realized they could not provoke her, the boys lost interest and moved on.

For Canaday, the provocations and insults she's heard from visitors are reminiscent of her experiences being called the N-word while she was growing up in Williamsburg. Her mother would try to comfort her by telling her that eventually these people would all die off and things would get better. But Canaday doesn't see it that way. “People die, but the idea doesn't,” she said.

This notion, of history continuing to reverberate across generations, is central to understanding the fight taking place at historical sites across the country: The Trump administration's attempt to reshape what is taught in museums and classrooms is fundamentally an attempt to obscure the relationship between the past and the present. It is not so much that proponents of “patriotic education” want to end any discussion of slavery because they don't believe it happened, but more that they don't want people to see how slavery continues to shape social inequality in America today.

Clint Smith: The meaning of Trump's attack on the Smithsonian

Colonial Williamsburg's commitment to evidence-based public history helps visitors see the relationship between the past and the present, and discover that the story of America is perhaps more complex than their textbooks had them believe. America's founding history, the site shows, is the story of both the Marquis de Lafayette's fight for American liberty and James Lafayette's petition for his freedom. It is the story of Patrick Henry's Governor's Palace and of Gowan Pamphlet's demolished church. It is the story of enslaved children being taught to read the Bible to make them more subservient, but instead using what they learned to forge a deeper connection to freedom. It is what Jefferson said, and it is what Jefferson did.

Canaday told me about a teacher who brought her students to Williamsburg on a field trip a few years earlier. After Canaday told the group about the experiences of Black people in Colonial Williamsburg, both historically and in the present, the teacher became upset, Canaday said, and began yelling at her, saying she disagreed with Canaday's interpretation. To Canaday, she seemed like an example of someone whose ideas would never change. But two years later, the teacher wrote to Canaday and apologized, admitting that she had been wrong. This is why Canaday believes that it is important to continue pushing Williamsburg to embrace the contradictions of American history.

“We don't always get to see what we plant,” Canaday said, nodding to a large oak to our right. “But that doesn't mean that something doesn't bloom.”

The Trump administration's National Guard deployments are highly inefficient.

One could describe President Donald Trump's existing and planned National Guard deployments in a few different ways. The administration sees them as a necessary protection for federal law enforcement in dangerous times. Many Americans see them as authoritarian overreach.

Taxpayers should see them as incredibly expensive.

The National Guard's mostly quiet walks through Washington, D.C., are expected to cost a little more than $200 million, USA Today reported, and that's the figure just for the D.C. National Guard, not for the eight states that have sent troops. Those likely more than double that cost, because out-of-state troops make up a majority of the D.C. deployment. According to the California National Guard, the deployment to Los Angeles cost another $118 million as of early September, a number that continues to grow as 100 troops remain in the city, long after the precipitating unrest has died down. Tens of millions of dollars—perhaps hundreds of millions in total—will be spent on deployments to Chicago, Portland, and Memphis, if Trump's plans for those cities proceed. Based on the known spending so far, the deployments could wind up costing Americans roughly two-thirds of a billion dollars.

These expenses would seem to undermine an administration that has claimed to go after “waste, fraud, and abuse” wherever possible. The funds for the Guardsmen's wages, food, and travel come from the Defense Department. There, Secretary Pete Hegseth has said that he intends to lead the department into a new era of waste-free clarity. “For too long,” he recently told a meeting of generals and admirals flown in from around the world to hear him speak, “the military has been forced by foolish and reckless politicians to focus on the wrong things.” One of the right things, apparently, must be deploying troops to American cities, which the White House has presented, in large part, as an effort to reduce crime. But if that's the goal, the method the administration has settled on is highly inefficient.

It's true that, at least in Washington, D.C., the deployment of the National Guard alongside hundreds of federal law-enforcement officers has been accompanied by a sharp decline in violent crime. Isolating the effect of the federal surge is impossible this early on, but during the first month of the deployment, homicides were down 53 percent and carjackings were down 75 percent relative to the same month last year. (Both categories were already declining.) Homicides have gone down even more in the second month of the deployment.

These positive trends are hardly surprising, however. America is underpoliced relative to other Western countries, and in general, adding more law-enforcement officers reduces crime. Cops are effective not merely through big busts or high-profile investigations, Adam Gelb, the president of the Council of Criminal Justice, told me. The presence of law enforcement also deters would-be criminals who'd prefer not to be caught and who know that's all the more likely if a government agent is nearby. That might explain how the National Guard could have an effect on crime without even making any arrests, which they are instructed to avoid. Cleaning up public parks—a more mundane task that the Guard has taken on—doesn't hurt either, signaling that the city is a well-run place with rules. For short-term crime reduction, increasing the certainty of being caught for a crime and reducing blight “would be on the top-five list of almost any criminologist,” Gelb said.

Of course, the Guardsmen have not necessarily been deployed where they could be most effective. In D.C., they are usually stationed in heavily touristed areas rather than in the city's more violent Wards 7 and 8. A good crime-reduction strategy, Gelb said, would focus on “high-risk people in high-risk places.” And although D.C. and Memphis rank high for homicide rates among American cities, neither is No. 1; Chicago isn't in the top 20, and Portland isn't even close. Jeffrey Butts, a professor at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice, in New York City, told me, “If you wanted to go after cities that were in trouble and experiencing increases in homicide, for example, you would go to Little Rock,” where homicides are up a horrifying 39 percent in the first half of 2025, amid a downward national trend.

And even if re-mulching the District's trees has a positive effect on crime rates, making the military do it is exceedingly expensive and inefficient, beyond any questions of appropriateness. Washington, D.C., has a police-officer shortage of about 800 cops. Filling every one of those positions would cost significantly less than $200 million; the total police budget is only $573 million. Memphis, a similarly sized city with dozens more homicides annually, has a smaller police-officer shortage that the White House could help them fill. Portland and Chicago are short on cops too.

Read: Why is the National Guard in D.C.? Even they don't know

The administration has tools available to do just that, in the Justice Department's Office of Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS), which gives grants to departments across the country for staffing up. Since its establishment as part of the 1994 crime bill, the COPS office has funded well over 100,000 additional police hirings, and research on the program has concluded that it's been effective at reducing violent crime. Yet, in its latest DOJ budget request, the Trump administration proposed cutting the program's budget by $73 million (roughly 17 percent of the total COPS budget)—a fraction of the cost of the National Guard deployments.

One frequent critique of the COPS program has been that it cannot address more structural determinants of crime. That was evidently not the Trump administration's concern in suggesting the funding cut: In April, the administration unilaterally cut more than $800 million in grants given out by the DOJ's Office of Justice Programs to organizations involved in community violence intervention, juvenile-justice and -protective services, substance-abuse and mental-health programs, research, and even law enforcement. Many of these programs tried to interrupt cycles of violence, rather than just deter or lock up people. Butts, who directs a crime-research center, told me, “They are worth the money we spend on them.” They're defunded now. A tiny fraction of the grants was restored after the DOJ was informed by the media which programs it had actually cut, including pet-friendly domestic-violence shelters and victim hotlines.

The Trump administration says a primary goal of its National Guard deployments is to reduce crime. Taking that claim at face value—a dubious proposition—it is hard to think of a less efficient way of doing so than shifting funds away from violence prevention and local law enforcement and toward troops who stand in low-crime areas and don't make arrests. So much for eliminating “waste.”

﻿Our reality could have a mirror image — and it has some serious risks and benefits.

It could revolutionize human health — or it could spell our doom. It really depends on who you ask. I'm not talking about potentially risky biodefense lab research, but something that doesn't yet exist: mirror life.

Here's a refresher on normal biology: the cells in our bodies are composed of the building blocks of life. Nucleotides and sugars make up our DNA, which provides the blueprint for cells and codes for proteins that carry out key biological functions. In all of life, these biomolecules have a specific “handedness.” (Bear with me here.)

A mirror image is possible, the way your left and right hands are mirror images of each other. But mirror life can't evolve from existing life in nature. If it eventually emerges, it's because we've created it.

Sign up here to explore the big, complicated problems the world faces and the most efficient ways to solve them. Sent twice a week.

Think of life as we know it as a vinyl record. We listen to the A-side, with genetic material made from right-handed nucleotides and proteins composed of left-handed amino acids. Natural life has evolved to only use this configuration. These biomolecules are chiral: they can't be superimposed on their mirror images. All life uses the same chirality. The hope, and fear, is that the opposite — synthetic life based on left-handed genes and right-handed proteins — exists on the bonus B-side of the record.

As my former colleague Kelsey Piper explained back in January, mirror life could represent a whole new way that the world could end.

We're at least decades away from being able to create entire mirror cells — that includes bacteria. The technologies that would allow us to do so aren't yet up to the task. But we've encountered mirror biomolecules like right-handed amino acids in nature, and scientists have synthesized mirror enzymes capable of reading mirror genes. With the power of chemistry, researchers have created mirror proteins.

These mirror biomolecules are the building blocks of mirror life, but they are not mirror life itself. This distinction is really important, and not only because I'm being pedantic.

A paper published in Science last year made dramatic headlines after its authors laid out potential catastrophic risks of mirror life. Such risks include the possibility that mirror bacteria would evade our immune systems and lack natural predators, replicating to the point that they threaten to outcompete normal life. The authors concluded that “in the absence of compelling evidence for reassurance, our view is that mirror bacteria and other mirror organisms should not be created.”

So if those are the risks, then we definitely shouldn't pursue the creation of mirror life. Right?

Well, only if we accept that those are the risks.

Something that's gotten a bit lost in the noise of media coverage is that the 35+ authors — who hail from fields as diverse as ecology, immunology, and synthetic biology — want mirror biomolecule research to continue. Nearly everyone agrees on that, because mirror biomolecules can offer immense benefits for developing new therapeutics, diagnostics, and studying the biochemistry of life without making new life itself.

But first, let's get into why the idea of mirror life is so frightening.

Kate Adamala, a biochemist building synthetic cells at the University of Minnesota and the lead author of the Science paper, received a 2019 grant to develop and deploy mirror cells. Upon looking into it further, she decided that the risks far outweighed the benefits, and called for the work to be halted.

“Mirror molecules are safe to make, because unlike mirror bacteria, the molecules don't replicate, so they don't pose any risks of spreading uncontrollably,” Adamala told me over email. One of her chief concerns is that normal cells may be unable to recognize mirror cells, because many of our immune mechanisms are based on chirality, or handedness. This could allow mirror cells to “grow unrestrained by the immune system and environmental predators” that keep normal cells in check.

Other risks include:

Fun stuff!

“It's hard to overstate how severe these risks could be,” Ruslan Medzhitov, an immunologist at Yale University and one of the paper's co-authors, told Science News. “If mirror bacteria were to spread through infected animals and plants, much of the planet's many environments could be contaminated. …Any exposure to contaminated dust or soil could be fatal.”

We could see a mass extinction event, an existential threat to multicellular life as we know it. Effective biocontainment, the researchers argue, would be incredibly difficult. If you have the time, it's worth reading the 299-page technical report that explains how the study authors came to their conclusions.

That said, mirror life could offer real benefits. Mirror therapeutics, which wouldn't be recognized by our digestive enzymes, have the potential to last a lot longer in our bodies, opening up new possibilities for the treatment of chronic disease. Right now, we create mirror therapeutics chemically, putting them together atom by atom. Mirror bacteria could do this for us, and at a much greater speed, allowing us to produce mirror therapeutics en masse.

Synthetic biology and synthetic chemistry are relatively small fields, and mirror biology is even smaller. The declarations of a scientific consensus around mirror life may be premature, but a growing number of voices are getting involved in discussions on the possibility.

I want to make it very clear that right now, mirror life is only a possibility. And it might be more distant than we think. David Perrin, a synthetic chemist at the University of British Columbia, told me over email that science is nowhere close to creating a living mirror cell.

He is also skeptical that mirror bacteria would be toxic to normal life, and believes our immune systems would likely be able to neutralize them after all. Immune responses are complex, and not all rely on handedness.

The scale of the threat is unclear, because mirror organisms might be hopelessly outcompeted by regular life. By creating a second tree of life, we might create a second evolutionary arms race, with mirror life on the losing side. Mirror organisms might struggle to find food they need to proliferate. Or not — evolution is a funny thing — but at this point there's no way to know for sure.

“The more I think about this, the more I realize that the real concern ought to be with creating life on this side of the mirror,” Perrin told me. Trying to shut down work on creating mirror life “makes no sense. …What would have happened if we put a total moratorium on researching radioactivity? We wouldn't know anything about RNA. And we wouldn't have any radioactive treatments for cancer.”

He thinks that red lines can be drawn — when people come closer to actually generating mirror life.

Gigi Gronvall, an immunologist and senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, and biosecurity expert at Johns Hopkins University, told Science News that the paper's concerns were very theoretical. While she strongly supports the authors' advocacy for discussion around the issue, she thinks that any proposed funding and research ban “puts the cart before the horse” and could impede research leading to surprising scientific advances.

We don't fully understand the risks of mirror life, and we won't without more research. But this research could be purely computational, allowing us to assess the nature of potential threats without posing real biological risks.

Creating mirror life could help us understand the origins of life and why it evolved in the direction that it did. I'd be lying if I didn't say that the idea of a second tree of life, side B of the biological recording, is really cool. That's not to say that we shouldn't be worried about potential risks here. This is completely new territory, and it might not remain the stuff of science fiction forever. But there is a debate to be had, and more evidence may emerge.

And we really do need these discussions. I'm glad that the Mirror Biology Dialogues Fund is hosting events to facilitate them. It's unusual to have the opportunity to proactively shape biotech governance well before the technology becomes a real possibility. Certainly, there's more to come.

﻿They're bringing weak cases that will likely fail — again, and again, and again.

The Trump Justice Department's indictment of former FBI director James Comey has been received with widespread incredulity, both because of the shady circumstances around its filing and the extraordinary weakness of the case.

Yet Lindsay Halligan, the US attorney who brought that indictment, seems unbothered. Indeed, she very quickly moved on to the next task at hand: getting New York Attorney General Letitia James indicted for similarly dubious charges, which she accomplished Thursday.

Meanwhile, White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller is heading a sweeping effort that he hopes will get leading Democratic groups and donors indicted for supporting purported “left-wing terrorism.” This seems similarly unlikely to stick in court.

Watching all this unfold — the weaponization of the US Justice Department, in efforts that mostly seem groundless or doomed — I've recalled a phrase Steve Bannon coined during President Donald Trump's first term. Describing how the right could push back against the mainstream media, Bannon said they had to “flood the zone with shit.”

Trump and Miller, it seems, are trying to target the opposition by flooding the zone with shit. They are going to bring one bogus investigation and prosecution after another. If one flops, they'll swiftly move on to the next — often, perhaps, against the same people already indicted. (There is already talk in MAGA-land of what else Comey could be charged with, and a separate US attorney's office is looking into James on other topics.)

The main point is not really to win convictions. Trump's team would of course love that, but if they wanted to build cases that would actually hold up in court, they'd be going about things very differently.

Instead, the goal is to put Trump's enemies, and the Democratic opposition more broadly, through the wringer — again, and again, and again until January 2029. Or perhaps even after that.

There's a notable contrast between who the president and his most powerful adviser seem most focused on targeting.

For President Trump, everything is personal, and he's been keenly interested in bringing vindictive prosecutions against particular individuals he's feuded with.

Often, these targets have been people who were involved in investigations of Trump, like Comey and James — the first two indicted. Sen. Adam Schiff (D-CA) has been targeted with a mortgage investigation. Former CIA director John Brennan and former FBI director Chris Wray are also targets, as is Fulton County district attorney Fani Willis.

To go after these targets, Trump's allies have rummaged through their mortgage records or past congressional testimony in hopes of finding something that prosecutors can argue was a false statement or crime.

Trump's justification would be: “They did it to me first.” He'd say this is simply what he and his allies have gone through for the past decade: repeated investigations during his first term, and eventually, four prosecutions during the Biden years, a legal saga that only came to an end when he won in 2024.

Some of Trump's complaints are specious — he was prosecuted for trying to steal the 2020 election, something he really did do — but others have at least a grain of truth to them. Elected Democratic prosecutors in New York state did indeed spend years digging through his business history in search of any charges that could stick to him or his family.

Miller, on the other hand, apparently wants to target the political opposition more broadly and strategically — by going after key Democratic and progressive organizations and donors.

Miller has been furious for months about protests of the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents who are carrying out the mass deportation campaign that is his brainchild. But after Charlie Kirk's killing last month, he began putting together a multi-agency effort to go after the funding and organization of the left.

According to a report from Reuters, Miller's effort is looking at protests where violence or vandalism occurred in hopes of accusing groups that supported or encouraged these protests of fomenting left-wing terrorism in some illegal way or another.

“We need to use our anti-terrorism laws, our RICO [racketeering] statutes, our conspiracy statutes — we need to use every tool in our law enforcement arsenal to crush these left-wing terrorists legally, financially, and politically, and to cut off their funding sources, and throw them in prison,” Mike Davis, a legal activist close to the Trump administration, told Rolling Stone.

One major target of this push so far is the Open Society Foundations, the grantmaking network funded by billionaire George Soros. A high-level Department of Justice official reportedly instructed US attorney's offices to investigate the network late last month. One White House official was quite frank about the political aim, telling Reuters: “The goal is to destabilize Soros's network.”

Other potential targets that came up in Reuters's reporting included ActBlue — the major online fundraising platform for Democratic candidates that Trump ordered the DOJ to investigate in April — and Indivisible — the progressive organizing group.

“Trump is going after boilerplate liberal nonprofits,” the leftist commentator Adam Johnson posted on X. “This isn't even a war on the left, it's a war on the left AND mainline democrats because republicans want to run without meaningful opposition in 2026 and 2028.”

The problem for both Trump and Miller, and the silver lining for their targets, is that, so far, these cases seem extremely weak.

The Comey and James indictments appear deeply flawed, and it will be quite a reach to link progressive groups or donors to actual violence, particularly without running afoul of the First Amendment.

Most of these prosecutions appear likely to collapse, either at trial or before. (Though it's not necessarily clear that all of them will. Perhaps some could be brought in red jurisdictions and draw MAGA-aligned judges like Aileen Cannon.)

And yet, if one prosecution flops, the Trump administration can simply bring another — perhaps even against the same person.

Over the past decade, MAGA enforcers and foot soldiers have gotten quite good at concocting creative logical chains and legal theories to argue that their enemies are guilty of crimes.

That is to say: A quick defeat of the charges in court might not — probably won't, in fact — be the end of the story for Comey, James, or other Trump targets. Trump's appointees can simply bring bogus charges against them on other topics, ensuring their legal nightmare won't end, at least until he leaves office.

And many top Democratic, and progressive groups, and donors may be headed for the same fate.

Free speech is endangered; unbiased and trustworthy news is elusive. In a time of noise, confusion, and spin, we're committed to clarity, truth, and depth — even when it's hard.

We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?

The NYC mayoral candidate's new proposal spotlights a flaw in progressive thought.

Last week, Zohran Mamdani revealed that, if he wins the mayorship this fall, he will end New York City's “gifted and talented” program for kindergartners.

This triggered a minor firestorm. Mamdani's chief mayoral rival, Andrew Cuomo, decried the socialist sensation's proposal as “destructive.” In Cuomo's account, when a city eliminates separate classes for its most intellectually sophisticated 5-year-olds, “the one possibility that your child might get a really first-class education in public schools goes with it.”

The Washington Post's editorial board denounced Mamdani's position in similar terms, deriding it as a scheme to “hold back gifted students in the name of equity.”

These criticisms are overheated. It is extremely unusual for schools to sort students by ability at the kindergarten level. In abandoning that practice, New York City would not be embracing a novel, communistic approach. To the contrary, Mamdani's current education plan — which would retain gifted classes beginning in third grade, as well as the city's selective high schools — entails far more advanced programming than is seen in a typical American school district.

That said, the adamance of Mamdani's critics is understandable. His announcement came in the context of a much broader — and more consequential — debate within the Democratic Party about education policy.

For decades, some progressives have fought to restrict gifted programs, even at higher grade levels. This movement contends that “tracking” — the practice of sorting students into separate classrooms or schools, on the basis of their academic abilities — deepens racial inequities, while providing little to no benefit to high achievers. These arguments have led some blue states and cities to pare back advanced programming in recent years.

Yet “detracking” efforts have proven controversial. And many Democrats have called on their party to abandon such policies and unequivocally endorse tracking, at least in some grade levels.

On this broader question, I think the Cuomos of the world are largely correct. The Democratic Party can likely advance better educational outcomes for all children — as well as its own political interests — by championing some forms of ability grouping.

Opposition to tracking — both in New York City and beyond — has often centered on the concern that it perpetuates racial injustice. Gifted programs and advanced classes tend to overrepresent white and Asian students, while underrepresenting Black and Hispanic ones.

Sign up here for more stories on the lessons liberals should take away from their election defeat — and a closer look at where they should go next. From senior correspondent Eric Levitz.

In New York City, for example, 42 percent of public school students are Hispanic, 20 percent are Black, 19 percent are Asian, and 16 percent white. Yet white and Asian students account for 75 percent of students in the city's gifted and talented programs. Meanwhile, at New York's elite high schools — which screen applicants by standardized test — just 10 percent of admission offers this year went to Black and Hispanic students.

To some critics of tracking, any policy that generates such statistics is inherently illegitimate: Large racial disparities, they argue, are dispositive evidence of bias.

This view is understandable. The disparities in New York City's selective programs are stark and concerning. And it is reasonable to worry that they may reflect biases in selection processes. In theory, the wording of standardized tests could confer an advantage on students from certain cultural backgrounds, irrespective of their academic abilities. And racial prejudices could influence whom teachers choose to nominate for gifted programs.

Further, there is evidence that advanced education programs in other jurisdictions have under-identified gifted students from disadvantaged backgrounds, in part by relying on tests that parents must opt into. It's therefore vital to scrutinize the fairness and accessibility of any tracking program's selection process.

Still, there is no reason to expect that a perfectly impartial measure of student ability would avoid racially disparate outcomes. On the contrary, the opposite expectation follows from two of the left's own premises, namely that:

Both these ideas are sound. Of course, a child's academic performance is not dictated by their household's income. Parents can abet their kids' scholarly achievement through non-financial means. And good schools can foster the abilities of impoverished students. But there is both theoretical and empirical cause to believe that material privilege aids intellectual development. In other contexts, some organizations critical of tracking emphasize this point.

Meanwhile, it is unquestionably true that America's white and Asian populations have higher median incomes and net worths than its Black and Hispanic ones. The median household income among Asian households in 2023 was $112,800 a year; among non-Hispanic white households, it was $89,050; among Hispanic households, it was $65,540; and among Black families, it was $56,490.

Racial gaps in wealth follow the same rank order but are even more profound:

Thus, the fact that a gifted program or selective high school underrepresents Black and Hispanic students does not necessarily mean that its admissions process is racially biased. So long as economic privilege is conducive to student achievement — and Black and Hispanic households' remain economically underprivileged — sorting students by ability is going to produce racial disparities.

In fairness, one could reasonably oppose tracking on precisely these grounds. After all, racial integration is desirable. The fact that sorting by ability makes classrooms less racially diverse is a point against such sorting.

Nonetheless, it is difficult to argue that schools should prioritize the racial diversity of their classrooms above the educational attainment of their students. If tracking academically benefits both those admitted into accelerated programs — and those who aren't — then it would be hard to oppose it in the name of racial justice. In that case, there would surely be better ways to promote integration than detracking — approaches that would not undermine all students' intellectual development. For one thing, we could try distributing wealth and income in a less wildly unequal manner.

Ultimately, then, the case against tracking hinges on its implications for student performance, rather than its consequences for classroom demographics.

There are legitimate reasons to fear that those implications could be negative, particularly for lower performers. Children who are not selected for “gifted” programming may suffer a loss in self-esteem. Isolating them from more academically advanced students could rob them of opportunities to learn from their peers. What's more, since high achievers are disproportionately economically privileged, concentrating them in separate classrooms or schools could theoretically lead to an inequitable distribution of resources: Through their outsize political influence or direct giving, high-achievers' parents might secure better equipment, funding or teachers for their kids' learning environments.

These risks would be worrisome in any context. In a world where less advanced students disproportionately suffer from racial and economic disadvantage, they are particularly concerning.

And some studies suggest that tracking provides little benefit to high achievers while harming less advanced students.

Nevertheless, we have more reason to believe that separating students by ability works for all students – when done right – than we do to doubt that notion.

To start, there is a strong theoretical basis for thinking that tracking would benefit students in general and high achievers in particular. American classrooms tend to feature pupils with vastly different abilities. One recent study suggests that a typical fifth-grade class includes students who have yet to master second-grade math and those who've already mastered the eighth-grade variety.

It's hard to see how this could be academically optimal. Providing instruction that simultaneously challenges advanced students — and aids struggling ones — seems inherently more difficult than doing either of those things in isolation.

And a substantial body of research affirms this intuition. A 2016 review of 100 years of research on ability grouping found that gifted programs and various other forms of tracking conferred benefits on high achievers, medium achievers, and low achievers alike. Many (though not all) previous meta-analyses — which are analyses of analyses, in other words — have produced similar results.

Further, there is evidence that advanced education programs can specifically help academically gifted Black and Hispanic students realize their potential. A 2016 study of one large urban school district's gifted or high-achieving program found that it significantly increased math and reading scores for high-achieving Black and Hispanic fourth-graders. These gains came at no discernible cost to students who remained in non-advanced classrooms.

Meanwhile, an experiment conducted in over 100 primary schools in Kenya found that tracking benefited lower-achieving students by enabling teachers to tailor curricula to their level.

It remains true that not all studies of ability-grouping show substantial benefits. But this may reflect the highly variable quality of advanced education programs. Merely separating students by ability will have little impact if instruction isn't adjusted to meet the particular needs of sorted classrooms. Tracking programs in which curricula are heavily modified tend to show positive results, while those with less customization have little benefit.

Beyond its direct impacts on learning, tracking offers one other substantive benefit: It can prevent affluent families from abandoning your public school system.

Oddly, critics of tracking have sometimes criticized the practice for serving this function. The Century Foundation's Eishika Ahmed writes that, “By not solving for equity,” New York City's gifted and talented program “essentially continues to function as originally intended: as a way to keep [w]hite middle-class families in the public school system.”

Obviously, this should not be the sole objective of any educational program. But if Democratic policymakers in New York — or any other major city — want to maximize the resources available to disadvantaged students, then they need to satisfy the educational demands of affluent parents.

After all, when a high-income family leaves Brooklyn for a more class-segregated suburb, that reduces revenue for the city's government — and therefore, the funds available to its public schools. More indirectly, middle-class families sending their kids to private academies can reduce political support for school funding. And in either case, socioeconomic integration declines.

In theory, tracking can help avert these outcomes, since it provides affluent families with a way to access accelerated learning opportunities for their more gifted children — without needing to abandon public schools or move to a rich suburban district. And this does seem to hold up in practice: A recent study of Texas public schools found that districts with higher levels of tracking have a lower share of students enrolled in private schools.

The case for Democrats to embrace tracking is not only substantive but political.

The Democratic Party has historically boasted a strong advantage on the issue of public education. But this edge has declined significantly in recent years, disappearing entirely in some polls. In 2024, the Democratic data firm Blue Rose Research found voters narrowly favoring the Republican Party on education. Two years earlier, two separate polls of voters in battleground areas — one by a pro-education reform group, one by the American Federation of teachers — each found a slim plurality of voters leaning towards the GOP on the issue.

Democrats appear to have regained the upper hand in more recent surveys, although even these show the party's advantage is much smaller than it once was.

There are surely multiple explanations for this. Republican governments were generally faster to reopen schools after Covid. And some red states have recently posted impressive gains in student performance, with Mississippi fourth-graders now demonstrating greater literacy than their peers in California.

But opposition to Democrat-led detracking efforts may be part of the story.

In New York, a 2022 NY1/Siena College poll found voters opposed the elimination of the city's gifted and talented programs by a 67 percent to 28 percent margin. In San Francisco, policymakers barred algebra instruction in middle schools in 2014, so as to delay tracking in math instruction. A ballot referendum to reverse this decision passed last year with 81.75 percent of the vote.

It is difficult to find national polling on tracking from disinterested parties. But a 2024 poll from Morning Consult and the education reform organization EdChoice found nearly 60 percent of parents opposing the elimination of academically advanced classes.

Of course, the best way for Democrats to restore their reputation on education policy is to deliver better outcomes, not take dictation from opinion polling. At present, blue states do not consistently boast higher test scores than red states, despite typically charging parents higher taxes. Changing that will principally require the universal adoption of evidence-based teaching techniques (such as phonics) along with measures to hold school and students accountable for their performance.

But expanding the most effective forms of tracking could also help substantively, while combating the politically harmful perception that Democrats would rather promote a tendentious conception of “equity” than academic excellence.

Free speech is endangered; unbiased and trustworthy news is elusive. In a time of noise, confusion, and spin, we're committed to clarity, truth, and depth — even when it's hard.

We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?

And five other questions about the deal, answered.

After more than two years, Israel and Hamas have finally reached a ceasefire deal to free all remaining Israeli hostages and allow aid to flow into Gaza again. I spoke with my colleague Zack Beauchamp about the deal, what it could mean for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and what comes next for Vox's daily newsletter, Today, Explained. Our conversation is below, and you can sign up for the newsletter here for more conversations like this.

Understand the world with a daily explainer, plus the most compelling stories of the day.

Israel and Hamas have a deal. What's been agreed upon?

Both Israel and Hamas have agreed to a staged process, but only phase one is fully agreed upon. The top line here is that you have the release of Israeli hostages and the bodies of those hostages that have died or been killed, in exchange for a release of Palestinian prisoners and an end to the fighting. Israel will withdraw from large chunks of the Gaza Strip, but it will retain a presence on the ground, at least during phase one. The most important thing is that they will stop fighting. There will be no more attacks happening inside Gaza, and aid will be allowed to flow into Gaza.

A month ago, Israel was bombing Hamas negotiators. How are we, a month later, at a deal?

Right now, based on the limited information we have, the key factor seems to be political will, specifically political will from the Trump administration. They had not been making a priority out of Israel-Palestine peace, to put it mildly, after the first ceasefire they brokered foundered in March.

Israel imposed the aid cutoff on Gaza, and the Trump administration basically said, Go ahead. We're not going to do anything about it. And that led to the worst humanitarian crisis of war, including the outbreak of what appeared to be famine in Gaza.

Recently, the Trump administration decided that it wants to get back involved in trying to make an end to the Gaza war. It's not clear exactly what the timeline was going to be, but that timeline changed when Israel attacked Doha, Qatar. The Trump administration has very strong ties to the Gulf Arab states, so they accelerated their timeline and started to put immense pressure on all of the different parties in lots of different ways to try to force a ceasefire.

How much credit do Trump and his administration deserve for getting this done?

Honestly, a lot — at least, if the early evidence continues to be borne out. Trump had a unique relationship with many of the key people involved. Trump has very strong ties not only to Netanyahu and his political fortunes — Trump is very popular on the Israeli right, and so he had a lot of leverage politically over Netanyahu — but relationships with the Gulf monarchies, as well as the leaders of Egypt and Turkey.

One of these dictatorships, Qatar, was a really important international partner of Hamas. So Trump worked with Qatar, Egypt, and Turkey to push Hamas from their end to accept the deal, and Trump uses his leverage over Netanyahu to try to force the Israelis into a deal. So you end up getting a situation where the stars have aligned for there to be at least a temporary ceasefire.

One of the dynamics here is that none of the leadership on either side really wanted an end to the war on terms the other would accept. They had to be forced into it. There were multiple points where it looked like each side wanted the talks to fail to be able to credibly blame the other one. And in each case, negotiators on either side, especially the US, said, No, we're just going to keep going forward.

One example is that when Hamas gave its answer to the deal, it was a partial yes. Netanyahu rushed to declare that Hamas had rejected the deal, and Trump said no, and then berated him in private. Trump wanted the fighting to stop in the immediate term, and so treating the Hamas answer as a yes turned it into, at least for now, a real yes, even though that's not how Netanyahu saw it.

The Israeli hostages are going home. What impact do you think that's going to have on Israel, politically, societally, on how they feel about the conflict with Gaza?

An overwhelming majority of Israelis wanted this deal. They wanted the hostages in exchange for a permanent ceasefire agreement. They didn't think the war was producing anything for them. This wasn't really out of concern for Gazan civilians. They were worried about hostages suffering and dying. They worried about soldiers being killed and the psychological damage of soldiers being called up all the time.

There was also very little belief that the war was accomplishing much in practical terms. You might hear from some Netanyahu-supporting Israelis that everybody thought they were beating Hamas, but if you look at the polling in Israel, the majority view was that this war was being continued for Netanyahu's personal political ends. He was doing it to help prop up and maintain his coalition, and that there wasn't really any strong military rationale for keeping the war going. So they wanted a deal.

With the hostages returned, it does seem like that's going to happen. We can't be certain that it will, but it seems like it would be very difficult, politically, for Netanyahu to restart the war. It would be an extremely unpopular position. Now, he does unpopular things all the time, so that doesn't mean it's not going to happen, you know, but it would also cross the United States, which is a much bigger problem for him. And I think if Netanyahu were to do it, it would guarantee a significant defeat in next year's elections. The dynamics of Israeli public opinion here will play a constraining role in a return to war after this. But I think the more significant one is crossing the United States. That is something Netanyahu will not do lightly at this point.

Does that not put Netanyahu in a jam? He's going to be pressured by the right flank of his coalition, Ministers Itamar Ben-Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich, on backing down on the war and the annexations. Is he going to be stuck between them and the US? 

Netanyahu is in a lot of trouble. There are signs of his coalition fraying right now. I don't know whether it will actually collapse and force early elections. That is an open question. But it certainly could if enough of the right-wing partners bolt and depends on how they perceive their electoral logic. There's a lot of specific stuff that we can't predict right now, but I do think it puts Netanyahu in a very difficult position.

The war, in and of itself, was the glue that cemented this coalition together: The far-right parties wanted Netanyahu to conquer Gaza permanently and rebuild settlements there. And now it seems like that's not happening, at least if the deal continues, which is more of an if that will. As long as this deal is in place, that will not happen, and they're going to be unhappy. The risks of a coalition rupture become larger. There's also the still-unresolved issue about conscripting the ultra-Orthodox, which, when there's not a war on, the ultra-Orthodox might be more likely to fold over and destabilize the government, because there's been no ability to resolve that question, and they're very angry about it.

There's a lot of complicated stuff swirling there, but I think that Netanyahu is really between a rock and a hard place, and has been for a while. One should never count him out — he's the longest-serving prime minister of Israel and has extraordinary political instincts, even though he is an authoritarian leader who was also on trial for corruption charges. So you can never count him out, but you wouldn't want to be in his shoes, politically.

What are you keeping an eye on as we hopefully see this phase one agreement take effect?

The first thing to look for is whether the terms of phase one are implemented as planned. I predict that they will be. But you have to watch carefully: are the hostages returned, does Israel withdraw to the agreed-upon points, what about the Palestinian prisoners? Keep an eye on all the details, because there's a lot of them.

The second question is very obvious, but it's worth repeating: What happens with the negotiations on phase two? Because right now, they're not agreed upon. And this is how the last ceasefire fell apart. Trump had set up a two-phase agreement. The first phase was a time-limited ceasefire, and then that led to an indefinite agreement, and then phase two was never agreed upon. The difference this time around is this is not a time-limited ceasefire, right? There's nothing that says this deal expires after a certain point.

Phase two also involves some more permanent issues. I don't know if phase one is going to hold, but phase two is really important, because it determines whether or not there will be durable change on the ground that could prevent this kind of thing from happening again. Because even if the ceasefire lasts for a year, two years, three years, four years — as long as Hamas is in charge of the Gaza Strip, this fighting is going to happen again.

There's going to be something, either on the Israeli side or the Palestinian side, that provokes the other and leads to violence that escalates and that leads to full-scale war. This has been by far the most devastating war in this pattern, but the pattern has been going on since Hamas took over the Gaza Strip 20 years ago. This is not a new thing. It's predictable. Israel even had a strategic term for it, “mowing the grass.” It was a horrible equilibrium that led to a disaster for the people inside Gaza and poor prospects for any kind of long-term peace agreement that could make everybody safer.

So are you going to do something about the hawkish Israeli posture that led to that fighting over and over again? Are you to do something about Hamas being in charge of Gaza? Are you going to link it to a broader political negotiating situation that can provide an actual peace agreement and create a Palestinian state? These are the big existential questions that will determine whether or not this is a ceasefire that's ultimately temporary, even for a longer time horizon than previous ones, or whether it's the beginnings of a durable base agreement. No pessimist has been wrong in betting on the Middle East recently, so I'm not sure that I would say we're likely in for one of the better scenarios, but it's possible. It's more possible than it was a few days ago. That's encouraging.

Doing three loads of laundry on a Sunday morning isn't fun. But what if you could get paid for it?

The startups that help train AI chatbots, such as Encord and Micro1, say they're seeing a surge in demand from robotics companies hungry for high-quality training data — and creating it often requires paying people to film themselves performing tasks like folding laundry, loading dishwashers, or making espresso.

Robotics has become one of the hottest fields in AI, with prominent investors like Vinod Khosla betting that the sector will soon experience its own ChatGPT moment as the technology continues to advance. Venture capital investment in robotics is surging, reaching $12.1 billion so far this year, according to PitchBook data.

At the same time, the robotics industry has a data problem. Companies like OpenAI, which build large language models (LLMs), can train on massive troves of data from the internet. Robots require different kinds of data, though, to learn basic dexterity so they can ultimately join a factory line or mop your kitchen floor.

""Unlike LLMs, robotics doesn't have the internet as a ready-made dataset — you have to generate training data from scratch in the real world, which is far harder,"" Ulrik Hansen, cofounder of data labeling startup Encord, told Business Insider.

Hansen says his startup is seeing four times as much volume for this kind of data compared to last year.

For humans, the money isn't half-bad — as long as you're willing to wear a pair of Meta's Ray-Ban glasses to record yourself doing things like folding clothes on a table.

That's something Ali Ansari, the CEO of AI training startup Micro1, says his company pays ""incredibly well"" for, citing rates of $25 to $50 an hour.

Hansen, the Encord cofounder, says rates can reach up to $150 an hour for videos of highly technical tasks, like handling surgical equipment.

Other AI training startups are also entering the market.

Scale AI, for example, says that it's rapidly expanding into robotics and has established a dedicated lab at its San Francisco headquarters, which has produced over 100,000 hours of training footage to date, the company wrote in a blog post published last month.

The demand comes from companies like Physical Intelligence, a humanoid robotics firm backed by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, which the Information reported is in talks to raise at a $5 billion valuation, and Boston Dynamics, the company best-known for its robot dogs. Encord cited both as customers; Scale AI says Physical Intelligence is a customer, too.

It's still early days, and finding suitable training data for robots remains a challenge.

One robotics startup resorted to posting an ad on Craigslist, promising to pay people $10 to $20 an hour to film themselves using their iPhones while doing chores, such as cooking dinner.

The startup's founder, who requested anonymity as the company is still in stealth mode, told Business Insider that finding good training data remains a major hurdle.

""There are no major datasets you can buy,"" the founder said. ""The biggest ones are around 5,000 hours, which is not nearly enough.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","Why Investors Are Flocking to Silver and Platinum, Not Just Gold","https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/commodities/gold-silver-platinum-price-record-rally-forecast-precious-metals-investing-2025-10","Fri, 10 Oct 2025 02:37:00 GMT","

Gold's rally has turned heads this year, but silver and platinum are leading a broader rush into hard assets.

Spot silver is trading around $50 per ounce, up about 70% year to date after touching its record high above $51 per ounce on Thursday, according to LSEG data.

Meanwhile, spot platinum is trading near $1,620 per ounce, up a staggering 80% year-to-date and around 13-year highs.

The rush into silver reflects how the white metal — alongside assets like bitcoin — is now seen as ""easy-access global inflation havens,"" wrote Thierry Wizman, a global foreign exchange and rates strategist at Macquarie Group, on Wednesday.

Gold's performance — while impressive — slightly trails silver and platinum.

Spot gold prices are up 52% this year, having smashed through the $4,000 per ounce level on Tuesday. The yellow metal was trading around $3,978 per ounce at 10:11 p.m. ET on Thursday.

The synchronized rally across gold, silver, and platinum isn't just about inflation hedging or interest rate expectations — it reflects something deeper, wrote Ole Hansen, the head of commodity strategy at Saxo Bank, on Wednesday.

The powerful gains ""point to a broader trend of a rotation into 'tangible stores of value' across the precious metals complex,"" Hansen wrote.

""In an increasingly fragmented world, the West's weaponization of markets, payment systems, and reserve assets has eroded confidence in traditional safe havens such as the US dollar and Treasuries,"" Hansen added, highlighting the West's sanctions against Russia for its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.

That erosion of trust, Hansen argues, is driving both institutional and sovereign investors to seek security outside the traditional financial system.

The shift has fueled an unprecedented wave of gold buying by global central banks — a signal that the appetite for real, unencumbered assets is now structural, not speculative.

""The result is a market no longer dominated by short-term speculative money reacting to real-rate moves, but by a persistent structural bid for security,"" Hansen wrote.

Beyond long-term structural flows, geopolitics have added fresh fuel to gold's ascent this year.

Analysts point to President Donald Trump's new trade tariffs, which could stoke inflation, as well as concerns about the Federal Reserve's independence and the US government's debt load.

""The US now spends more on interest payments than on defense — a statistic that underpins the appeal of holding assets that carry no counterparty risk,"" wrote Hansen.

Gold's rally, he wrote, has become ""a mirror of waning confidence in the old financial order.""

""For decades, investors treated US Treasuries as the global risk-free benchmark. Today, the market's message is subtler: 'risk-free' and 'trust-free' are no longer synonymous,"" he added.

While questions are building over how long gold's record rally can last, top forecasters are bullish over the yellow metal's outlook.

Earlier this week, Goldman Sachs lifted its December 2026 gold price forecast to $4,900 per ounce from $4,300, citing strong inflows into Western gold ETFs and central bank demand.

""If investors increasingly see political and financial systems as intertwined — and potentially vulnerable — the argument for holding unencumbered tangible assets strengthens,"" wrote Hansen.

""It may represent a collective reappraisal of trust, sovereignty, and what it truly means to be 'safe.' In that sense, the market is not just questioning the old order — it may already be pricing in the next one,"" he wrote.

Gen Z is looking for little luxuries. But those splurges look a little different compared to previous generations.

For years, retail leaders and economists have talked about the ""lipstick index,"" which is the idea that consumers forgo large purchases in favor of small luxuries like lipstick during economic downturns. The phenomenon is generally attributed to Leonard Lauder, one of the billionaire heirs to the Estée Lauder cosmetics fortune.

Gen Z has its own version of the lipstick index, according to a new PwC report that analyzed nearly a million customer transactions, including credit card and debit card transactions. Young consumers are treating themselves with items like matcha and fancy kicks, more so than lipstick, the report said.

""Micro luxuries like a pricey matcha, a resale sneaker drop, or cosmetics that double as skincare can telegraph cultural relevance without breaking the bank,"" the report reads.

Lipstick, as the theory goes, is a luxury that could cost as little as a few dollars, but has an outsize effect on how the purchaser feels about themselves. Gen Z, however, is looking for ""affordable affluence,"" PwC wrote. That includes products that make them feel good, but also represent good value and an opportunity to improve themselves, Ali Furman, a partner at PwC, told Business Insider.

""For this generation in particular, self-improvement outcomes are very high on their interests list,"" Furman said.

Take Matcha, for example. In the last few years, the drink has become more popular in the US and other markets outside Japan, thanks to its rise on TikTok. Some users also point to the beverage's high levels of antioxidants and claim it can help reduce stress levels, among other health benefits.

""Years ago, it was in the tea aisle on a shelf,"" Furman said. ""Now, it has evolved into a calm energy ritual, and that is much more appealing to a Gen Z consumer.""

Gen Z's holiday spending plans reveal the pressure they're under this year. PwC's holiday forecast shows that the generation plans to cut holiday spending by 23% this year. Millennials, by comparison, plan to reduce spending by 1%, while shoppers who identify as Gen X and baby boomers plan to increase holiday spending modestly.

PwC surveyed 4,000 consumers — 1,000 from each generation highlighted — between June and July.

Gen Z's tight spending relative to other generations might not be temporary, though. PwC's report says that Gen Z's habits represent ""a generational shift in how value is defined and where money feels worth spending.""

Many Gen Z shoppers wait for products to go on sale before they buy them, for instance, and many don't mind turning to dupes or private-label versions of name-brand products to save money, according to the survey.

While many Gen Zers are navigating a challenging entry-level job market and paying off student debt, they are also reaching critical life milestones, such as getting married and having children — both of which can be expensive endeavors, Furman said.

All that financial pressure means that Gen Z's hunt for little luxuries and good deals might be more of a long-term trend than the lipstick index traditionally implies.

""It's that coming-of-age issue combined with the economic climate,"" Furman said.

Microsoft plans to ward off competition from AI coding tools by overhauling its GitHub service, according to audio from an internal meeting reviewed by Business Insider.

The transformation has its roots in something that used to frustrate cofounder Bill Gates.

""Bill used to always say that there's only one category: It's called Information Management,"" CEO Satya Nadella said in the meeting. ""In fact, the thing he used to get frustrated by is, why the heck do I have a different app for writing a document, a different app for a website, and a different (development software) for writing an app?""

AI is finally erasing those boundaries, and Microsoft wants to restructure its GitHub software development platform to provide its tools wherever developers work.

""What's the difference between an app and a document and a website?"" Nadella said. In the AI world, ""there is none.""

GitHub, which Microsoft acquired in 2018, had an early lead because of its popularity as a place to store code along with a partnership with OpenAI. Lately, though, GitHub has faced more competition from AI tools such as Cursor and Anthropic's Claude Code.

Microsoft's AI coding assistant, GitHub Copilot, was the top tool of choice in a recent survey by Jellyfish. But the tool recently lost share in a key part of the developer market to Cursor, according to data cited in a recent note from Barclays.

A Microsoft engineer in the internal meeting asked executives to explain how the company is addressing competition from these tools, particularly Cursor or Claude Code, which they characterized as ""moving quickly and capturing a lot of mindshare.""

""GitHub is just not the place anymore where developers are storing code,"" Microsoft executive Jay Parikh said. ""We want it to be the center of gravity for all of AI-powered software development."" 

GitHub's CEO left in August. And earlier this year, Nadella tapped Parikh to lead a new AI unit called CoreAI that oversees GitHub. 

Microsoft wants GitHub's AI tools to be available wherever developers work, not just inside one app, whether that's in the command line interface, in a web browser, inside different coding apps like VS Code, or even within other Microsoft products. Microsoft also envisions GitHub becoming a kind of dashboard for managing multiple AI agents.

The company is also investing in improving the basic parts of GitHub, Parikh said, like its GitHub Actions tool that automates building, testing, and deploying code, analytics and insights tools so teams can see how their code is performing, security for keeping the code safe, and making sure the company can meet local data storage rules to offer GitHub in new countries.

""The team is shipping faster than it's ever been shipping before, shipping updates to our users every day, if not multiple times a day,"" Parikh said. ""We're gearing up for what should be the best GitHub universe ever.""

Parikh also echoed recent comments from Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman that the company should work with and build more large language models rather than depending on its relationship with OpenAI.

""As new models come, as models go, we want to stay the place where developers have that choice of both surfaces that they work in, also modes that they work in, and the models that they work with,"" Parikh said.

Microsoft earlier this year started working on a major upgrade of its flagship software-development product Visual Studio, a sign the tech giant is responding to intense competition from new AI coding tools, according to an internal memo viewed by Business Insider.

The company also asked some managers to evaluate employees based on how much they use AI internally, and the software giant is considering adding a metric related to this in its review process, according to another memo Business Insider viewed.

This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Hayet Yasmine Chebbi, a 26-year-old content creator and podcaster based in Montreal. It's been edited for length and clarity.

I lived in New York City for the first 24 years of my life. It was all I'd ever known, and as a kid, I thought I'd never leave.

When the pandemic hit, my college went remote, I got laid off from my contract fashion job at Chanel, and I felt like the US's response to the pandemic was inconsistent. People dream of coming to New York, but I wanted to dream somewhere else.

In 2023, I left my corporate marketing job and moved to Montreal to live with my husband and start my own business. Although my income has been unsteady and there have been some culture shocks, I feel a lot less on edge, and my nervous system appreciates the change of pace.

After graduating from college in 2021, I went to Dubai for a month to get out of the city, and I absolutely loved it. I remember thinking, ""This is the place I want to build my career in."" The city was efficient, organized, and clean, while still having the sensational sense of opportunity that I felt in New York.

On that trip, I met a friend who introduced me to my now-husband, who was living in Montreal. We started dating right away, and I spent the next two years traveling between New York City and Montreal. However, I was still determined to move to Dubai and was looking for job opportunities. My husband was supportive of me pursuing whatever path was best for my career.

In the meantime, I got a job at Christian Dior in NYC as an e-commerce client advisor and later transitioned into my marketing role at a media company.

I was doing the whole ""climbing the corporate ladder"" — working long hours, sacrificing sleep, working through lunch breaks, and carrying the mental workload home on weekends — all in an effort to prove myself. I prioritized my career and placed my physical and mental health second.

Over time, that lifestyle caught up with me. Despite my dedication and strong performance, I began to feel drained, disconnected, and unfulfilled. In time, I realized that no amount of career success was worth sacrificing my well-being. The ""survival of the fittest"" lifestyle was all too much for me, and I felt deeply unfulfilled.

I realized living in Dubai would be very expensive, and the entry-level jobs I found didn't pay enough to offset that cost, but I still wanted to live in a place that could offer me an affordable, well-balanced lifestyle. Montreal checked all those boxes.

In late 2023, I married my husband and officially moved to Montreal by applying for a work permit under his name. I created my own LLC, which is technically registered in the US, to do content creation and a podcast. I haven't made an income from it yet.

Babysitting has allowed me to earn an income while maintaining flexibility in my schedule, but to be transparent, my income has been unsteady. I've been relying on my husband for the majority of our bills, but I've been seeing some slow growth for my business.

Still, Montreal is the perfect place for me as someone working in the creative space. There's a deep cultural appreciation for modern and contemporary art, and the music scene is amazing. I've built a circle of artists and musicians who've helped me see a whole new life outside corporate, and they've motivated me to create.

The language barrier has been an adjustment. My husband and his friends are more French-speaking, so there are times I just can't keep up, and my husband will have to translate for me.

I took an amazing three-month, government-funded class to learn the language and integrate with Quebec culture, and I can now comfortably navigate day-to-day interactions.

In Montreal, about six months of the year are winter, so I've really had to adapt to the weather. In New York, a snow day was a miracle; it meant schools would close, and you were going to meet up with your friends to make snow angels. The snow would have to be insane in Montreal for something to be canceled.

Montreal has a good balance between the European way of life — long lunches, calm days, sitting at the coffee shop for hours — and the energy of New York City.

People seem to be a lot more present here. For example, people in Montreal stand still on the escalator, while people in New York City walk on it.

One time, I was jogging on the street in Montreal to get to a hair appointment, and I felt like people were staring at me like there was something wrong with me. That moment was small but made me realize that I'm not in New York City anymore. I don't need to run, I'm going to get there.

When I first moved to Montreal, I thought I'd never leave; however, my husband and I have decided to relocate to Toronto in 2026 to allow for a smoother immigration process

New York will always hold a special place in my heart and will always feel like home. If the right opportunities open up and it feels like the best decision for my family and my career, I'd consider moving back.

I sacrificed myself in corporate America to make my bank account happy, but now I'm making my soul happy. I've always been ambitious, but since moving, I've realized that success isn't only made through hustle. It can be made through slowness, steadiness, and even rest.

The Trump administration began laying off federal workers on Friday, the 10th day of the U.S. government shutdown, administration budget chief Russell Vought said in a social media post.

""The RIFs have begun,"" Vought wrote on X, using the acronym for ""Reductions in Force.""

The Office of Management and Budget, which Vought leads, soon after confirmed that ""RIFs have begun and are substantial."" 

No other details of the layoffs were immediately released.

The announcement comes four days after National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett warned in a CNBC interview that President Donald Trump could ""start taking sharp measures"" if the shutdown continued due to the lack of a stopgap funding deal approved by Congress.

Hassett said that ""any government worker who loses their job"" will have Democrats to blame for their layoff.

While many federal workers have been furloughed because of the shutdown, it is not the normal practice in shutdowns to permanently lay off government employees.

A spokesman for the Health and Human Services Department, in a statement to CNBC, said, ""HHS employees across multiple divisions have received reduction-in-force notices as a direct consequence of the Democrat-led government shutdown.""

""HHS under the Biden administration became a bloated bureaucracy, growing its budget by 38% and its workforce by 17%,"" department spokesman Andrew Nixon said. "" All HHS employees receiving reduction-in-force notices were designated non-essential by their respective divisions. HHS continues to close wasteful and duplicative entities, including those that are at odds with the Trump administration's Make America Healthy Again agenda.""

A number of Treasury Department employees also have received RIF notices.

A union representing federal workers, the American Federation of Government Employees, quickly replied to Vought's tweet, writing, ""The lawsuit has been filed."" AFGE, the largest federal employee union, represents 820,000 workers, some of whom work for the District of Columbia.

""America's unions will see you in court,"" the AFL-CIO said in its own tweet.

Since the shutdown began last week, Vought has announced in tweets decisions by the Trump administration to freeze and cut billions of dollars in federal funding for projects in states and cities controlled by Democratic elected officials.

The Trump administration and Republicans in Congress have repeatedly sought to blame Democrats for the government shutdown and any negative fallout from it.

Democratic senators have largely refused to vote for a Republican stopgap funding plan that would reopen the government, saying that any such resolution must include an agreement to extend enhanced Affordable Care Act tax credits.

Those tax credits lower the cost of Obamacare health insurance plans purchased by millions of Americans from government-run ACA marketplaces.

Dueling Republican and Democratic funding resolutions failed to pass in the Senate for the seventh time on Thursday.

The shutdown is expected to continue until at least early next week because the Senate is not due to resume business until Tuesday.

President Donald Trump on Friday threatened to slap a ""massive increase of Tariffs"" on Chinese products imported into the United States to ""financially counter"" new export controls that China imposed on rare earths from that country.

Trump also threatened in a social media post to cancel his upcoming meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping because of the dispute.

Stock markets dropped after Trump's bellicose Truth Social post about China, in which he said that ""there is no way that"" country ""should be allowed to hold the World 'captive'"" with its rare earth policy.

China controls about 70% of the global supply of rare earths minerals, which are critical for high-tech industries, including automobiles, defense and semiconductors.

""One of the Policies that we are calculating at this moment is a massive increase of Tariffs on Chinese products coming into the United States of America,"" Trump wrote. ""There are many other countermeasures that are, likewise, under serious consideration. Thank you for your attention to this matter!""

China's Ministry of Commerce on Thursday said that foreign entities must now obtain a license to export products that contain more than 0.1% of rare earth sourced from that country, or that are manufactured using Chinese extraction, refining, magnet-making or recycling technology.

The new rules in rare earths exports are set to take effect on Dec. 1.

""Some very strange things are happening in China!"" Trump wrote in his Truth Social post. 

""They are becoming very hostile, and sending letters to Countries throughout the World, that they want to impose Export Controls on each and every element of production having to do with Rare Earths, and virtually anything else they can think of, even if it's not manufactured in China,"" Trump wrote.

The president said he had not spoken to Xi about the issue ""because there was no reason to do so.""

""This was a real surprise, not only to me, but to all the Leaders of the Free World. I was to meet President Xi in two weeks, at APEC, in South Korea, but now there seems to be no reason to do so,"" Trump wrote, referring to the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit.

Trump claimed that the United States has been contacted by other countries that are ""extremely angry at this great Trade hostility, which came out of nowhere.""

""Our relationship with China over the past six months has been a very good one, thereby making this move on Trade an even more surprising one,"" he wrote.

The Labor Department will bring back staff to work on a key consumer inflation report despite the ongoing federal government shutdown, CNBC has learned.

The department's Bureau of Labor Statistics will ""promptly resume"" work on September's consumer price index data, a White House official said. The report will come out at 8:30 a.m. ET on Oct. 24, nine days after it was originally scheduled, according to the BLS.

The department had originally paused work on the CPI report – which tracks a broad basket of goods and services for price changes over time — because of its shutdown plan, the official said. But the Social Security Administration needs third-quarter CPI data for calculating and publishing annual cost-of-living adjustments before Nov. 1.

Other BLS data releases including the nonfarm payroll report haven't been published as originally intended since the federal government shutdown due to a lapse in funding. The Senate on Thursday failed to pass funding bills for the seventh time that would have ended the closure, which began last week.

Bloomberg News first reported that the BLS was calling employees back to work on the CPI data.

In this article

Morgan Stanley on Friday told its financial advisors that the firm was broadening access to crypto investments to all clients and allowing such investments in any type of account, including retirement accounts, CNBC has learned.

Starting Oct. 15, advisors will be able to pitch crypto funds to any client. Previously, the option was limited to those with an aggressive risk tolerance and at least $1.5 million in assets who wanted crypto in a taxable brokerage account.  

The move marks the latest expansion of access to crypto at the world's largest wealth management firm after the U.S. government's stance toward the nascent asset class flipped with the election of President Donald Trump. Last month, Morgan Stanley said it would soon enable trading of bitcoin, ether and solana at its E-Trade subsidiary.

Over the past two decades, Morgan Stanley has become an industry juggernaut, amassing $8.2 trillion in client assets across its wealth and investment management operations. In recent years, the bank has repeatedly shown it is keen to defend its position amid the rise of platforms including Coinbase and Robinhood.

As Morgan Stanley drops its eligibility requirements for crypto funds, it will rely on an automated monitoring process to make sure that clients aren't overly concentrated in the volatile asset class, said people familiar with the matter, who declined to be identified speaking about internal policy.

The bank's global investment committee recently issued a model that recommended a maximum initial allocation to crypto of up to 4%, depending on goals ranging from ""wealth conservation"" to ""opportunistic growth.""

The committee ""considers cryptocurrency as a speculative and increasingly popular asset class that many investors, but not all, will seek to explore,"" Lisa Shalett, chief investment officer for wealth management at the firm, said in the Oct. 1 report.

As of now, advisors are still limited to pitching bitcoin funds from BlackRock and Fidelity, but Morgan Stanley is watching the industry for possible additions to those offerings, including other types of crypto, according to the people familiar.

Clients can ask to be placed into any listed crypto exchange-traded product, they added.

Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller said Friday that he continues to support lowering interest rates but said the central bank needs to be careful amid conflicting economic signals.

""I'm still in the belief we need to cut rates, but we need to kind of be cautious about it,"" Waller said during an interview on CNBC's ""Squawk Box.""

On one hand, he said, the U.S. labor market appears to be losing jobs, potentially signaling a broader economic slowdown. On the other, gross domestic product growth remains strong and there remain concerns over inflation, which is still running considerably higher than the Fed's 2% goal.

""Something's got to give. Either the labor market rebounds to match the GDP growth, or that GDP growth is going to pull back. So whichever way that goes, it's got to affect what you do with policy,"" Waller said. ""I want to move towards cutting rates, but you're not going to do it aggressively and fast, in case you make a big mistake on which way that things go.""

At its September meeting, the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee approved its first quarter percentage point reduction since December 2024. In addition, committee members signaled in their quarterly ""dot plot"" update of individual members' expectations that two more cuts were likely before the end of the year.

Waller said he's comfortable with that pace but doesn't think the Fed should move faster than that. His new colleague, Governor Stephen Miran, appointed by President Donald Trump, pushed for a bigger half-point reduction and wants to see the Fed lop another 1.25 percentage points off the federal funds rate by the end of the year.

""You can always adjust as you go as the data comes in,"" Waller said. ""I mean, if you went 75 [basis points] tomorrow, then you have a bit of a problem.""

The monetary policy comments came shortly after a CNBC report that Waller is one of five finalists to replace Fed Chair Jerome Powell when his term expires in May 2026. Waller recently interviewed with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who in turn is sending a list to Trump of the best candidates to lead the central bank.

As part of the process, Waller sat down for what were reportedly lengthy interviews as Trump looks for a central bank more in his liking for lower interest rates. However, Waller said the discussion with Bessent focused squarely on policy.

""It was actually a great interview. I mean, it was a lot of discussion about various aspects of the Fed, talking about various speeches I've given my points of view,"" Waller said. ""I just thought it was great. I mean, really there was nothing political about it. It was all serious economic discussion.""

Waller's cautious views on policy extend to the economy.

On the labor market, he said the past few months probably saw a loss of jobs. On inflation, Waller said he continues to think the impact from Trump's tariffs will be temporary.

BEIJING — China on Friday announced that starting Oct. 14, the country will start charging U.S. ships for docking at Chinese ports — a direct response to Washington for imposing fees on Chinese vessels arriving at U.S. ports, set to take effect the same day.

The U.S. fees ""seriously violate"" international trading principles and ""seriously damages"" China-U.S. maritime trade, the Chinese Ministry of Transport said in the announcement, translated by CNBC.

China will charge 400 yuan ($56) per net ton for the U.S. vessels, essentially the same as the $50 per net ton that the U.S. is imposing on Chinese ships. Beijing also matched the U.S. with plans to increase the fees over time through April 17, 2028, with the same effective dates.

In the ""short term, this will result in an increase in costs for U.S. consumers, a decrease in profits for shippers, and a small decline in demand for exports to the U.S. in certain categories,"" said Michael Hart, president of the American Chamber of Commerce in China.

In the longer term, he said there could be more demand for non-Chinese ships. But he didn't expect an increase in demand for U.S.-made ships due to their high costs and low shipbuilding capacity. 

The U.S. only accounts for 0.1% of global shipbuilding, versus 53.3% for China, according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies.

That outsized Chinese market share prompted the U.S. to develop a policy, beginning under the Biden administration, to charge Chinese-made ships when arriving at U.S. ports.

The Chinese Ministry of Transport said the fees would apply to vessels owned by U.S. businesses, organizations, individuals and entities holding a 25% or greater stake. Ships flying the U.S. flag or made in Washington would also be charged, the ministry said.

This is ""just more tit-for-tat negotiating tactics. The U.S. placed similar fees on Chinese bound vessels and now China is doing the same,"" said Peter Alexander, managing director of Z-Ben Advisors in Shanghai.

""The Trump administration continues to underestimate China and this needs to stop,"" Alexander said. ""There seems to be little consideration given to second and third-order effects of policy choices.""

He added: ""China can give as good as it gets and has demonstrated a willingness to take direct action. Have there been any lessons learned by the Americans over the past six months?  It certainly doesn't seem so.""

The Chinese port fee announcement comes after China doubled down on its export restrictions and broadened its ""unreliable entities"" blacklist to include chip consulting firm TechInsights, in the last two days.

U.S.-China tensions have remained elevated despite a call between U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping last month, and expectations of a meeting between the two leaders in South Korea in coming weeks. 

While Trump has played up progress on a deal for Beijing-based ByteDance to sell the U.S. operations of its TikTok app, China has been less conclusive.

In this article

Qualcomm shares fell 4% on Friday after Chinese regulators said they would investigate the American tech giant's acquisition of chip firm Autotalks, ramping up tensions between the U.S. and China ahead of key meetings between the country's leaders this month.

China's State Administration of Market Regulation (SAMR) said that Qualcomm is suspected of violating the country's anti-monopoly law in regards to its acquisition of Israeli firm Autotalks. The acquisition officially closed in June, just over two years after it was first announced.

In a short statement, the SAMR said it would initiate an investigation into Qualcomm.

The U.S. chipmaker said in a statement that it is fully cooperating with SAMR and ""is committed to supporting the development and growth of our customers and partners.""

Qualcomm sells its smartphone chips to some of the biggest players in China, such as Xiaomi.

U.S. tech companies have recently been in the crosshairs of Chinese regulators, ramping up tensions between Beijing and Washington ahead of key talks.

In September, the SAMR alleged that Nvidia had violated the country's anti-monopoly law in relation to its acquisition of Mellanox and some agreements made during the acquisition. Meanwhile, Beijing has reportedly been discouraging local firms from buying Nvidia chips.

This week, China also tightened export controls on rare earths and related technologies. Rare earths are critical to high-tech industries, including automobiles, defense and semiconductors.

U.S. President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping are expected to meet in person on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum during the last week of October in Gyeongju, South Korea.

After a series of rigorous interviews, some lasting as long as two hours, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has winnowed down the list of candidates for Federal Reserve chair to five from 11, and that person could be nominated to the Fed — though not necessarily as chair — by January.

According to senior Treasury officials, the remaining list of candidates includes two sitting Fed officials — Vice Chair for Supervision Michelle Bowman and Governor Christopher Waller — along with Kevin Hassett, the director of the National Economic Council, former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh and BlackRock Fixed Income CIO Rick Rieder.

The Treasury plans to hold another round of interviews with all five candidates in the coming weeks and months. The interviews will be led by Bessent and include two senior Treasury officials and two senior White House officials.

With Bessent focused on the World Bank/IMF meetings in Washington next week and then traveling to Asia with President Donald Trump on an extended trip, the officials said the interview process might not be wrapped up until after Thanksgiving.

The secretary then intends to send a smaller list to Trump, who will make the final decision. It is likely, however, that this person will first be nominated to be a Fed governor and then nominated later to be Fed chair.

The reason is outgoing Fed Chair Jerome Powell, whose term ends in May, sits in a governor's seat that has only two years remaining. The seat of former Fed Governor Adriana Kugler, now occupied by Stephen Miran, has a term that ends in January and would allow the new Fed chair to be nominated to a seat with a full 14-year governor's term.

But the officials said that strategy was not decided and there were other possibilities.

The president has already named Warsh, Hassett and Waller as finalists for the job, so only Rieder and Bowman would be new recommendations to the White House.

Compared with previous administrations, the Trump administration has been running a more open process for the next Fed chair, announcing candidates as the list grows and, now, shrinks.

At the same time, the administration, led by the president himself, has been highly critical of Fed policy, repeatedly urging it to lower rates sharply. The president had threatened to remove Powell and actually fired Fed Governor Lisa Cook for alleged mortgage fraud, accusations she denies.

Cook's firing has been blocked by lower courts, and the case will be heard in January by the Supreme Court. The attempts to oust Cook have raised concerns about the administration's commitment to Fed independence, raising the stakes for the new chair appointment and making it a closely followed decision.

The Treasury officials also for the first time provided some insight into Bessent's thinking about the criteria used to decide who to pick for the job.

Bessent is said to be seeking someone who is open to new ideas about how to run the Fed and monetary policy, and has experience in economics, monetary policy, banking regulation and management.

The secretary recently penned an essay sharply critical of the Fed and called for reviews of the central bank's policy, structure and mission.

Among his critiques was that the Fed had grown too big and experienced mission creep. That suggests he would prefer a candidate willing to pare down both the Fed's size and roll back its use of some tools, especially quantitative easing.

The officials said no candidate was leading the pack, but they confirmed recent reports that Rieder had impressed Bessent.

Rieder, a frequent guest on CNBC, has been a well-known fixture on Wall Street for years. His analysis of the fixed income market and the Fed are widely read. He also manages a large department at BlackRock. While not decisive, the officials suggested it could be a plus that Rieder, alone among the five remaining candidates, has never worked at the Fed.

Campus, a college startup backed by Sam Altman, has hired Meta's former AI Vice President Jerome Pesenti as its technology head, the company announced Friday.

As part of the deal, Campus will buy Pesenti's artificial intelligence learning platform Sizzle AI for an undisclosed amount and integrate its personalized AI-generated educational content already used by 1.7 million people.

The acquisition advances the company's ""roadmap"" by two to three years and helps the platform cater learning toward individual student needs, said Tade Oyerinde, Campus founder and chancellor.

""This is a game changer,"" he told CNBC.

Campus was founded to disrupt the community college system by ""maximizing access to world-class education,"" according to its website. It offers accredited associate degrees taught by adjunct professors from the likes of Stanford, Princeton and New York University.

The platform has over 3,000 enrolled students, charges $7,320 per academic year and accepts Pell Grants, according to its website. It also provides attendees with a laptop, mobile Wi-Fi pack, personal success coach and 24/7 tutoring access. Professors make upwards of $8,000 per course.

Campus has raised over $100 million from the likes of Peter Thiel's Founders Fund, General Catalyst, NBA star Shaquille O'Neal, venture capitalist and Palantir co-founder Joe Lonsdale and Figma CEO Dylan Field.

Japan's Komeito political party is reportedly quitting the country's ruling coalition led by the Liberal Democratic Party, a move that could derail Sanae Takaichi's path to becoming the country's first female prime minister.

Komeito Chief Representative Tetsuo Saito said that the LDP ""failed to provide sufficient answers regarding political funding issues,"" after meeting with LDP President Sanae Takaichi, public broadcaster NHK said Friday.

If confirmed, the split would end a political alliance that has existed since 1999. It comes just days before an Oct. 15 parliamentary vote to select Japan's next prime minister.

Nikkei reported earlier Friday that Komeito had reservations about the alliance, and that the appointment of Takaichi as Japan's next prime minister would be delayed to at least Oct. 20.

Jesper Koll, expert director at Monex Group, said Komeito has ""outlived its purpose"" for the LDP, pointing out that the party has been losing supporters steadily for the past decade.

""Any political strategist agrees that in 3-5 years time, the Komeito will likely be de facto irrelevant,"" Koll said. ""Takaichi is forcing the issue, and thereby actually laying the direction for a new LDP.""

Takaichi won the LDP leadership race on Oct. 4, defeating farm minister Shinjiro Koizumi to become the first woman to lead the party — and potentially Japan's first female prime minister.

Her victory follows Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's resignation announcement on Sept. 7, after the LDP lost its majority in both houses of parliament in 2024 and 2025, leaving it to govern as a minority.

The hardline conservative has been widely labeled as an apostle of ""Abenomics,"" the economic strategy of the late prime minister Shinzo Abe, which espoused loose monetary policy, fiscal spending and structural reforms.

Following the news, the yen strengthened to 152.64 against the dollar, partially unwinding the so-called ""Takaichi trade"" that had driven the yen past the 150 mark and sent Japanese equities to record highs. The announcement came after markets closed in Japan.

While the withdrawal of Komeito from the political alliance may appear to be damaging for Takaichi and the LDP, she remains on course to be Japan's first female prime minister, Naka Matsuzawa, Chief Strategist at Nomura Securities, said.

The opposition parties are not united to vote for someone else, Matsuzawa added. ""For the time being, her government will have to shop for different partners depending on [the] bills it wants to pass.""

The LDP and Komeito currently hold 215 seats in the 465-seat chamber, short of the 233 seats needed for a majority.

Komeito's exit would leave the LDP with 191 seats, though the LDP is still the largest party in the Lower House.

Saito said Komeito would not back Takaichi in the parliamentary vote on the next prime minister, according to a report by Reuters.

Her rise comes at a time of economic strain at home and tense relations abroad — and tests whether Japan doubles down on the conservative, pro-Abenomics agenda that defined the past decade.

Takaichi has called for a hardline stance towards China and is also in favor of revising Japan's pacifist constitution, especially Article 9, which renounced Japan's right to wage war.

Her previous visits to the controversial Yasukuni Shrine, which honors Japan's war dead, including war criminals, have drawn criticism from China and South Korea, which see the site as a symbol of Tokyo's wartime aggression.

LONDON — Britain's competition regulator on Friday activated new powers to regulate Google's search activities, putting the U.S. tech giant in the firing line for further regulatory action.

The Competition and Markets Authority confirmed it is designating Google with ""strategic market status"" for its general search and search advertising services. It follows a near nine-month investigation in which the watchdog concluded that the tech giant has ""substantial and entrenched market power.""

The watchdog said that Google's Gemini AI assistant was not within the scope of the designation, although other AI-based search features were included.

""We have found that Google maintains a strategic position in the search and search advertising sector – with more than 90% of searches in the UK taking place on its platform,"" Will Hayter, executive director for digital markets at the CMA, said in a statement.

""Having taken into account the feedback received following our proposed decision, we have today designated Google's search services with strategic market status.""

The designation is not a ""finding of wrongdoing,"" according to the CMA, but it does mean that Google may have to make changes to how search works in the U.K.

It's currently unclear what such measures will look like, as consultation on possible interventions is expected to start later this year, the CMA stated.

However, according to a roadmap published in June, it could require the tech giant to implement fairer search rankings and give publishers greater control over how their content is used, including in AI-generated responses, among other things.

Google said its search product contributes billions of pounds to the U.K. economy, and the country has so far been able to avoid costly restrictions on some of its popular services.

""Many of the ideas for interventions that have been raised in this process would inhibit UK innovation and growth, potentially slowing product launches at a time of profound AI-based innovation,"" said Oliver Bethell, senior director of competition at Google.

He added that Google hopes to see ""outcomes that reflect such ambitions in the crucial months ahead.""

Indeed, the firm's parent company Alphabet last month announced a £5 billion ($6.8 billion at the time) investment in the U.K. as part of the country's AI development, which includes the build-out of a state-of-the-art data center just north of London.

British Finance Minister Rachel Reeves described the move as ""a powerful vote of confidence in the U.K. economy and the strength of our partnership with the U.S.,"" CNBC previously reported.

""To date, U.K. businesses and consumers have been amongst the first to benefit from Google's innovations, often months before their European counterparts,"" Google's Bethell said amid the CMA designation. In a LinkedIn post a couple of months ago, Debbie Weinstein, president of Google in Europe, said this was due to ""regulatory uncertainty"" in Europe.

For it to continue to benefit in this way, the U.K. should focus on ""avoiding unduly onerous regulations and learning from the negative results seen in other jurisdictions,"" Bethell added.

The strategic market status designation is a flex of the CMA's new powers, designed to ""improve competition in digital markets, helping to drive innovation, investment and growth across the U.K. economy,"" which came into force earlier this year.

The CMA is also investigating Google's mobile operations in a separate case.

With its recent political turmoil and instability, France has been compared to Italy, replacing it as the new ""bad boy"" of Europe.

Should France, then, take a page out of Italy's book and consider a technocratic government?

President Emmanuel Macron is expected to pick his new prime minister by Friday evening, after outgoing PM Sebastien Lecornu led last-ditch talks for two days with political parties to try and unlock the current political deadlock.

Lecornu on Wednesday evening declared that ""a majority of deputies oppose dissolution (of parliament), a platform for stability exists, a path is possible to adopt a budget by December 31st"". He concluded that ""on this basis, the president of the republic will appoint a prime minister within the next 48 hours.""

But the most unexpected part came after. 

While Lecornu didn't unveil details on the potential makeup of the new government, he made a suggestion: ""Whoever it is,"" they should be ""completely disconnected from the presidential ambitions for 2027.""

""The situation is already difficult enough. We need to have a team that ultimately decides to roll up its sleeves and solve the country's problems until the presidential election,"" he added.

Already on Monday, shortly after his resignation, Lecornu had deplored the ""resurgence of partisan appetites, sometimes not unrelated to the upcoming presidential election.""

Would a technocratic government — selected on the basis of technical expertise, rather than a popular vote — perhaps fill the brief? 

This scenario could help pause the political crisis, which has seen France go through five prime ministers in less than two years.

It may also reassure investors and gain time until the 2027 presidential election — or at least until March 2026 when some suggest a parliamentary snap election could be held alongside an already scheduled nationwide mayoral election, in an attempt to solve the current deadlock in the National Assembly.

In Italy since the 1990s, central bankers have led multiple technocratic governments, Mario Draghi being the latest example.

In France, the name of François Villeroy de Galhau, the governor of the Banque de France since 2015, keeps resurfacing as a rumored option for the most recent PM nominations.

But although, on paper, a technocratic government might tick a lot of boxes, there's a key reason it's unlikely to work in France: public opinion.

The French are known for being deeply, and at times passionately, political. And with tough decisions needed to pass the 2026 budget and bring the country's deficit closer to 3% of GDP, this is perhaps one of the most political moments for the country in recent times.

In this article

A major trading platform in the U.K. has issued a stark warning to investors hoping to cash in on relaxed crypto rules: cryptocurrencies should not be in your portfolio.

A longstanding U.K. ban on retail investors being able to access crypto exchange-traded notes (ETNs) was lifted on Oct. 8. Exchange-traded notes are debt instruments linked to one or more specified assets. In this case, they give traders exposure to digital tokens through the use of a regulated exchange.

The new rules sparked a warning from Hargreaves Lansdowne — the U.K.'s biggest retail investment platform — which urged British retail investors to be cautious.

""The HL Investment view is that bitcoin is not an asset class, and we do not think cryptocurrency has characteristics that mean it should be included in portfolios for growth or income and shouldn't be relied upon to help clients meet their financial goals,"" Hargreaves Lansdowne said in a statement.

""Performance assumptions are not possible to analyse for crypto, and unlike other alternative asset classes it has no intrinsic value.""

When U.K. officials announced earlier this year that the ETN ban would be overturned, they argued the move would support ""the growth and competitiveness of the U.K.'s crypto industry."" It was hailed by crypto firms as a major breakthrough for the sector in Britain.

The government also ruled on Wednesday that investors will be able to hold crypto ETNs in stocks and shares ISA accounts, an account where up to £20,000 ($26,753) a year can be invested tax-free.

Cryptocurrencies, which are decentralized and therefore not regulated by central authorities like governments, have their critics and prices are notoriously volatile. In 2022, a so-called ""crypto winter"" saw investors lose $2 trillion. Bitcoin — the most commonly traded cryptocurrency — has led to major returns for early investors, however, and was last seen trading around $121,508.

Still, Hargreaves Lansdowne urged investors to consider the risks attached to all cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin.

""While longer-term returns of bitcoin have been positive, bitcoin has experienced several periods of extreme losses and is a highly volatile investment — much riskier than stocks or bonds,"" the company said in its statement this week.

The firm said, however, that it recognized that some traders wished to ""speculate with cryptocurrency ETNs,"" and that it would therefore offer ""appropriate clients"" the opportunity to do so from early 2026.

Cryptocurrencies have long divided market watchers, with some major institutions piling into digital assets while others have warned against them.

Last month, Morgan Stanley said it was close to offering crypto trading to retail investors through its E-Trade division. The bank was the first major U.S. bank to offer wealthy clients access to bitcoin funds — a move that others have since followed.

JPMorgan, meanwhile, plans to get involved in the stablecoin space, despite CEO Jamie Dimon being vocal in his criticism of crypto. Billionaire investor Warren Buffett has also openly lashed out at cryptocurrencies.

Chris Mellor, head of EMEA ETF equity product management at Invesco, told CNBC on Thursday that he believes digital assets can offer investors a hedge against volatility in more traditional asset classes.

""Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are sometimes considered 'digital gold' and questions have been raised around whether bitcoin might one day replace gold as the non-fiat asset of choice,"" he said via email. ""In our opinion, there is room for both in portfolios. With the caveat that correlations can change, in recent months we have observed that bitcoin has displayed a very low correlation with stocks, U.S. Treasuries and gold.""

Meanwhile, Nigel Green, CEO of financial consultancy DeVere Group, argued that bitcoin's recent climb past the $125,000 mark was a signal that digital assets have entered the financial mainstream.

""Investors are no longer treating bitcoin as a curiosity at the edge of the market,"" he told CNBC. ""Volatility still exists, but it is now productive volatility, the kind that accompanies price discovery in a maturing market. Short-term swings are inevitable when capital rotates at this scale.""

Green labeled this ""a structural realignment, not a temporary rally"" for bitcoin, and pointed to the Trump administration's favorable policy mix as offering further support for its credibility.

""The hands holding bitcoin have become stronger, more institutional, and more patient,"" he added. ""Bitcoin, for investors who take a strategic view, remains a solid, enduring investment.""

ByDan Alexander,

Forbes Staff.

Looking at Donald Trump's finances, it's easy to miss one of his most important assets: bitcoin. The cryptocurrency appears nowhere on the financial disclosure the president files with the government. It is not listed among the holdings identified on the Trump Organization's website. And it does not show up in other reports of his assets. But make no mistake, Trump holds a major position in the digital currency, amounting to an estimated $870 million, enough to make him one of the largest bitcoin investors on the planet.

The reason Trump's investment is so hidden: He holds it indirectly, through his stake in the business that operates Truth Social, the Trump Media and Technology Group (which does appear on his balance sheet). Trump Media attracted a multibillion-dollar valuation trading on the Nasdaq despite generating less than $4 million of annual revenue, then pivoted to crypto earlier this year. In May, it raised $2.3 billion by taking on a pile of debt and selling its overvalued stock. Then, in July, it snatched $2 billion of bitcoin. The stock sales diluted Trump's stake in the company from 52% to 41%. The price of bitcoin has increased about 6% since Trump Media's big bet. That leaves the president with 41% of an estimated $2.1 billion stockpile, enough to make his personal share roughly $870 million.

There are only a handful of other billionaires who appear to own more. The Winklevoss twins could have over $8 billion, if they haven't sold off any in recent years. Michael Saylor, who pioneered the bitcoin treasury strategy Trump Media is now copying, has about $5 billion through his 7% stake in his company, Strategy—as well as an estimated $2.2 billion on the side. Tim Draper won an auction in 2014 for coins the U.S. government seized when taking down the Silk Road, an illicit marketplace, that are now worth $3.6 billion. Investor Matthew Roszak may hold more than $1 billion. Right behind them: Donald Trump, who wanted little to do with bitcoin during his first term.

“I am not a fan of Bitcoin and other Cryptocurrencies, which are not money, and whose value is highly volatile and based on thin air,” the president tweeted in 2019. “Unregulated Crypto Assets can facilitate unlawful behavior, including drug trade and other illegal activity.”

Trump's transformation from crypto skeptic to bitcoin bull captures his approach to business. An opportunist with a mind for marketing, he started to dabble in crypto during his years out of the White House. First, Trump sold nonfungible-token trading cards, including ones of himself stylized as a superhero, generating a few million dollars of easy money. Then, as the 2024 election drew closer, he launched a crypto project with his three sons named World Liberty Financial. It pretty much went nowhere, until Trump won the election. That's when crypto community, highly vulnerable to government regulation, piled into World Liberty tokens, ultimately adding more than $1 billion to Trump's net worth, according to Forbes estimates. With D.C. buzzing before the inauguration, the president-elect also launched a memecoin, boosting his fortune by nearly a billion more.

The dawn of a second Trump presidency lifted asset values across the industry. The price of bitcoin jumped 60% from Election Day in November to May of this year. Trump Media announced its plan to start stockpiling bitcoin. It relied on its sky-high trading price to raise money, selling $1 billion of convertible bonds and another $1.4 billion of stock. Trump's share of the debt—equal to about $400 million—now represents the largest loan in his portfolio, bigger than any of his real estate mortgages.

The White House is unbothered by the ethical concerns all of this creates. “Neither the president nor his family have ever engaged, or ever will ever engage, in conflicts of interest,” says Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt, immediately undermining herself by pointing to clear conflicts of interest. “Through executive actions, supporting legislation like the GENIUS Act and other common-sense policies, the administration is fulfilling the president's promise to make the United States the crypto capital of the world.”

Investors who bought the shares and bonds that funded Trump Media's bitcoin bet were apparently hoping for a meme-stock surge, which seemed plausible. After all, shares of Trump Media had soared on little more than a money-losing social media app, so maybe they would rocket again when tethered to one of the buzziest assets in the world? Adding a level of security, the bonds are structured to allow investors to walk away with a 4% return after a year and half if a stock surge did not materialize.

But mania tends to taper off eventually. Despite having a stronger balance sheet, which now features a couple billion dollars of bitcoin and a billion in debt, the market cap of Trump Media is $1.2 billion less today than it was before the company shifted to bitcoin. Set the bitcoin play aside, and investors are now implying the original media business is worth just 60% of what they thought it amounted to in May.

That's not to say Trump Media is doomed, especially with three more years left in Trump's second term. If bitcoin prices continue to climb, perhaps aided by the ally in the White House, the president's most faithful followers may start bidding up shares again, potentially adding hundreds of millions, or even billions, to Trump's fortune.","{'href': 'https://www.forbes.com', 'title': 'Forbes'}","cryptocurrency"

SAN FRANCISCO (KGO) -- Bitcoin ATM machines that convert cash into cryptocurrency have become the favorite tool of scammers, many operating from overseas. The I-Team has been working with ABC News on this investigation.

It's the same old scams with a new twist. You've heard of people being drawn into a phony romance or being convinced there's a problem with their computer or bank account - all a ruse to get their money. But now, the bad guys are convincing victims to feed their life savings into these Bitcoin ATMs.

RELATED: 7 On Your Side report on $50K crypto scam catches CA officials' attention

San Jose's Jim Meduri got a phone call early one morning from someone who sounded like his son, crying that he had been arrested for a DUI accident involving a pregnant woman.

""It was a male voice,"" said Meduri. ""I mean, anybody that is emotional and their voice starts cracking, obviously it changes the voice a little bit, but it was close enough to let me think it was my son.""

He told Meduri to contact a defense attorney, who said the bail was $15,000. The attorney's supposed staff directed him to pay the court through a Bitcoin ATM at a nearby bakery.

Meduri told the I-Team, ""I went in there and we put, my wife and I put money into this ATM, you know, $100 bill at a time, you know? That was basically what it took.""

Meduri had placed the money into a Bitcoin account or ""wallet"" as it's called, straight to the scammers; he didn't know that at the time. Then, the lawyer and his staff went silent, so Meduri tried his son's cell phone and when his son answered, he knew it was all a scam.

Meduri's next call was to the Santa Clara County DA's Fraud Unit, where attorney Erin West worked.

""The thing about cryptocurrency is it's on a blockchain, which is a ledger,"" West said. ""We can see every transaction that happens. So, when we were able to see where he sent his money, we were able to send them an email that day and get them to freeze it until we sent a warrant, and then we were able to get that money back for him.""

Getting money back in these cases is extremely rare, according to West. She has started a nonprofit called ""Shamrock"" to investigate and expose the worldwide scams that are now using these Bitcoin ATMs. West has traveled to Southeast Asia several times to see massive compounds built with scam money, to house human trafficked workers who target American victims.

On the scene, Meduri said, ""It's more than 35 buildings and was designed and built for the sole purpose of scamming.""

""Their primary industries in Cambodia prior to this were tourism and garments,"" she added. ""Today, their primary industry is scamming. It makes up more than half of their GDP and they're coming for us.""

Case in point: police in Brooklyn Park, Minnesota stopped an 82-year-old woman who was about to send $27,000 to scammers. They convinced the victim her computer had been hacked so she had to send the money through a Bitcoin ATM.

The woman told police, ""And she says you gotta get $27,000 out of your savings and set up a dummy account and then we'll put cancel on something so they can't get it.""

Last month, the DC attorney general sued Athena Bitcoin, one of the largest Bitcoin ATM purveyors in the country; they have locations in the Bay Area. The complaint includes screen captures of victims with their grey hair and phones to the ear as they take directions from the scammers. The lawsuit claims:





Athena forcefully denied those allegations in a statement to ABC News, asserting in part that it maintains ""strong safeguards against fraud including transparent instructions, prominent warnings and consumer education."" They continue, ""Just as a bank isn't held responsible if someone willingly sends funds to someone else, Athena does not control users' decisions.""

The I-Team spoke with ATM Industry Association Executive Director David Tente and wanted to know if there's a serious problem with Bitcoin ATMs.

""No, I wouldn't say there's a serious problem, and I think the data, supports that,"" said Tente.

Tente says the rate of Bitcoin ATM fraud is slightly less than credit card fraud, and that we shouldn't blame the technology. ""We can't control human behavior with mechanical devices to a great extent. A lot of the scams that are going on have been around for decades and just using a different method of payment.""

The FBI says scams perpetrated using Bitcoin ATMs cost Americans nearly $250 million in 2024, more than double the previous year. AARP is warning its 38 million members that Bitcoin ATMs are becoming the preferred method for criminals.

Amy Nofziger, Director of AARP Fraud Watch Network, said, ""We want them to have similar consumer protections like every other financial instrument out there. Daily transition limits, so maybe a new customer can only put $1,000 into it.""

It's deja vu all over again for bitcoin bulls as Monday's rally to an all-time high triggered not FOMO, but instead fast retreat. That retreat sped up in a big way in late-morning U.S. action on Friday after trade war tensions between the U.S. and China ratcheted higher.

U.S. President Donald Trump said in a Truth Social post minutes ago that he's preparing a ""massive increase"" in tariffs on Chinese goods in response to China earlier imposing export controls on rare earth metals.

Following the post, bitcoin BTC$118,187.63 plunged below $119,000 from $122,000. Ether ETH$4,109.99, solana SOL$201.48 and XRP each joined in the swift decline.

The drop in crypto prices also weighed on stocks tied to the sector. Circle (CRCL) fell over 6%. Robinhood (HOOD), which gets a large portion of its trading activity from crypto, declined 5%.

Coinbase (COIN) also shed 5%, while MicroStrategy (MSTR) slipped about 3%.

The news rippled across traditional markets, too. WTI crude oil dropped nearly 4% below $60, its weakest price since early May. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq were 1.6% and 1.3% lower, respectively.

Gold? It rallied more than 1% to back over $4,000 per ounce as the yellow metal once again showed itself, not bitcoin, to be the risk-off asset of choice for investors.

At the current $118,800, bitcoin is lower by about 2% over the past 24 hours and about 6% since hitting a new record above $126,000 just four days ago.

 AI-focused Polkadot project Phala is set to fully migrate to its Ethereum L2, betting on its ecosystem for confidential AI and GPU compute growth. 

Polkadot parachain Phala is set to become an Ethereum layer 2 after the community voted in favor of a recent proposal aimed at ramping computation offerings to enterprise client.

“Proposal Passed: Phala is Migrating to Ethereum L2!” a Phala X post from Wednesday reads, adding that it marks the next chapter for the project as it pushes for “greater scalability and enterprise-grade security.”

The post adds that Phala (PHA) tokenholders will receive the new ERC-20 variant at a 1:1 ratio, the “migration” will start before Nov. 20, and that “staking, rewards, and governance” will continue seamlessly on the new layer 2 (L2). 

This isn't an abrupt move by Phala, as it already has a “live and functional” Ethereum L2 that was launched in January. As the proposal explains, the project aims to fully migrate and focus solely on Ethereum to maximize potential upside. 

Phala is a decentralized cloud computing network that is designed to provide private, secure and scalable computation for AI-integrated Web3 applications. It was one of the first projects to secure a parachain slot as part of the auctions held by Polkadot in late 2021. 

The proposal was initially submitted on Sept. 27, with the leader of Phala Network ecosystem success “doylegxd,” recommending the move to consolidate staking, governance and confidential compute in a “stronger” Ethereum Virtual Machine-aligned ecosystem.

The proposal also argued that renewing the parachain slot on Polkadot would lock the project into “infrastructure with limited scalability” that would require significant resources to maintain. While working in Ethereum would also enable it to utilize next-gen computation tech. 

“L2 offers lower operational overhead and direct integration with Ethereum liquidity and tooling. It is also the natural home for deploying TDX and GPU-based confidential compute workloads, where we already see early-stage commercial traction,” the proposal reads. 

Phala appears to be one of the few that have decided to completely move from Polkadot to Ethereum.

Other projects, such as Astar and the KILT Protocol, opted to expand their integration to Ethereum in a multichain approach instead of abandoning Polkadot. Phala's proposal suggests the move was aimed at capitalizing very niche tech that it needs to spur further growth. 

The PHALA token is the 11th largest AI-agent-related crypto-asset by market capitalization at $80.6 million and is among the top 50 largest AI tokens by market cap, according to data from CoinGecko.

Crypto prices plunged alongside stock market indices early Friday after President Donald Trump threatened to ratchet up tariffs on China.

Bitcoin dove below $119,000 for the first time since October 2, and was recently trading for $119,028—down 1.7% on the day. But other leading cryptocurrencies saw sharper dips, with Ethereum and Solana both down almost 5% in the last hour alone, to prices of $4,107 and $211 respectively.

Crypto market liquidations have skyrocketed amid the plunge, with CoinGlass showing $459 million worth of liquidations in the last hour alone—the vast majority of them being long positions. Over the last 24 hours, nearly $773 million worth of positions have been liquidated.

The Nasdaq is down 1.77% so far Friday, with the S&P 500 down 1.25% and the Dow dipping by 0.83%.

""Ultimately, though potentially painful, it will be a very good thing, in the end, for the U.S.A."" Trump wrote on Truth Social. ""One of the policies that we are calculating at this moment is a massive increase of tariffs on Chinese products coming into the United States of America. There are many other countermeasures that are, likewise, under serious consideration.""

This isn't the first time that Trump's tariff war has impacted the markets. Back in April, Trump's sweeping “Liberation Day” tariffs on 185 countries prompted Bitcoin to drop 1.1% in an hour while the S&P 500 lost more than $2 trillion in market capitalization in just 15 minutes.

Since then, the president has had a hot and cold relationship with tariffs as he has regularly eased and hiked tariffs against several nations and economic groups—including China.

Trump's most recent tariff move happens as the U.S. government is in the midst of an ongoing shutdown. During this period, most federal agencies are partially closed, with only essential employees permitted to keep working.

That said, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics has confirmed that it will release its September 2025 Consumer Price Index, which measures the rate of inflation in the U.S., on October 24. However, no further releases will be produced until the government resumes.

Despite the increased tariff tensions, a price drop, and an ongoing government shutdown, 45% of predictors on Myriad Markets are bullish that Bitcoin will pump to $140,000 before it drops to $110,000. (Disclosure: Myriad Markets is developed by Decrypt's parent company DASTAN.)

Ethereum price started a fresh decline below $4,600 and $4,500. ETH is now moving lower and might extend losses below $4,250 in the short term.

Ethereum Price Dips Further

Ethereum price failed to stay above $4,550 and started a fresh decline, like Bitcoin. ETH price dipped below the $4,500 and $4,450 levels to enter a bearish zone.

The price tested the $4,270 zone. A low was formed at $4,270 and the price is now consolidating losses. There was a minor recovery wave toward the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $4,760 swing high to the $4,270 low.

However, the bears are active near the $4,380 level. Besides, there is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $4,385 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD.

Ethereum price is now trading below $4,450 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price could face resistance near the $4,385 level and the trend line. The next key resistance is near the $4,450 level.

The first major resistance is near the $4,510 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $4,760 swing high to the $4,270 low. A clear move above the $4,510 resistance might send the price toward the $4,570 resistance. An upside break above the $4,570 region might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $4,640 resistance zone or even $4,720 in the near term.

More Losses In ETH?

If Ethereum fails to clear the $4,450 resistance, it could start a fresh decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $4,320 level. The first major support sits near the $4,270 zone.

A clear move below the $4,270 support might push the price toward the $4,250 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $4,150 region in the near term. The next key support sits at $4,120.

Ethereum's bullish structure has started to show early signs of exhaustion as the price retraces from the $4,400 resistance zone. Despite maintaining a strong mid-term uptrend, short-term momentum has weakened after a local bearish divergence and a recent market structure shift.

The next few days will be key to determining whether this is just a healthy correction or the start of a deeper pullback.

By Shayan

On the daily timeframe, ETH remains inside a long-term ascending channel but has once again failed to break through the $4,800 resistance area. The asset is now dropping toward the channel's lower trendline and the 100-day moving average at $4,000.

The RSI has also cooled to 49, indicating that bullish momentum has faded for now but hasn't turned bearish yet. As long as the structure holds above $4,000, the broader trend remains intact. However, losing that level could open the door for a deeper move toward $3,400, where the next significant demand zone lies.



In the 4-hour view, ETH has confirmed a Market Structure Shift (MSS) after failing to sustain higher highs near $4,800. A clear bearish divergence on RSI supported this move, showing momentum loss before the drop. The price has now entered a short-term corrective phase and could revisit the $4,200–$4,100 zone, which aligns with previous demand.

For buyers to regain control, ETH needs to reclaim $4,500 and invalidate the recent lower-high formation. Until then, short-term bias remains slightly bearish within the context of the broader bullish channel.



Open interest across all exchanges remains elevated at around $28.5 billion, showing that derivatives traders are still heavily positioned despite the recent pullback. This suggests strong speculative interest, but it also means the market is vulnerable to liquidations if volatility increases.

If open interest continues to stay high while price trends lower, it could trigger a cascade of forced long liquidations before a proper bottom forms. On the flip side, a gradual cooling of open interest during this correction would signal healthy resetting of leverage, potentially setting the stage for ETH's next leg higher.

Oops, something went wrong

Institutional investors are showing strong interest in cryptocurrencies, but their focus remains firmly on the market leaders, bitcoin (BTC-USD) and ethereum (ETH-USD). While smaller altcoins continue to capture headlines in the retail space, their adoption by large investment managers has been slow.

On Yahoo Finance Future Focus, James Butterfill, head of research at CoinShares, explained why most institutional portfolios are still dominated by bitcoin and ethereum, also known as ether, and what might change in the years ahead.

“Not yet, I'd say,” Butterfill told Yahoo Finance UK when asked about institutional exposure to altcoins.

He explained that bitcoin accounts for roughly 90% of all exchange-traded fund (ETF) inflows and assets, with ether taking most of the remainder. Altcoins, by contrast, represent only 2 or 3%

Altcoins are cryptocurrencies other than bitcoin (BTC-USD), including solana (SOL-USD) and XRP (XRP-GBP), and thousands of smaller digital tokens that serve various purposes across the crypto ecosystem.

""At the moment, I think it's a big ask for many institutional investors to start looking at many of these much smaller altcoins,"" Butterfill said. ""They're only just getting used to bitcoin as a store of value and its position in the portfolio, and now they're just starting to divert gaze towards ethereum (ETH-USD), which has been incredibly popular this year.""

This popularity is reflected in inflows — ethereum (ETH-USD) has attracted $12bn so far this year, compared to $5bn last year, Butterfill noted.

The surge in ethereum interest is partly due to its technical evolution. ""There was some scepticism of ethereum about three or four years ago, when we had the merge,"" Butterfill said, referring to the Ethereum blockchain's shift from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake validation.

Investors initially questioned whether the transition would succeed, and concerns over staking yields and transaction speed lingered for years. But with recent upgrades and clearer roadmaps, Butterfill said confidence is growing.

""The roadmap for Ethereum upgrades is a lot better now, and they're much better at marketing, like solana (SOL-USD),"" he explained.

""Plus, you have that backing of the stablecoin and the GENIUS Act in the US now; most of stablecoins operate around 60% or 70% on Ethereum. That's why we've seen all this hype and the price appreciation.""

When asked about solana, Butterfill acknowledged its strong price performance but questioned its sustainability.

""Eight per cent of volumes are on memecoins in solana, so that is very quick to transact and very cheap,"" he said. But Ethereum, he argued, offers a more mature decentralised finance ecosystem, including stablecoins and real-world assets.

The numbers tell a similar story — Ethereum has 7,000 active developers, compared to just 1,000 for solana, giving it a clear edge in potential innovation and complex applications, Butterfill added.

Looking ahead, Butterfill sees stablecoins and real-world assets on-chain as the areas with the most growth potential for institutional adoption.

US treasury secretary Scott Bessent said he believes stablecoins would be a $7tn business in five years. So it's currently a $280bn business,"" he said. While that forecast might be optimistic, it highlights the growth potential.

Real-world assets, such as tokenised US treasuries and other debt instruments on-chain, have also seen a rapid rise, from $8bn at the start of the year to $30bn today. Big players like BlackRock (BLK) are leading the charge, creating digital equivalents of traditional assets that can settle instantly.

Decentralised finance (DeFi) is also gaining traction, particularly on Ethereum, though Butterfill cautions that regulatory and ""know your customer"" (KYC) hurdles remain a barrier for institutional investors.

""You don't know who you're lending to, and that is a challenge for institutions,"" he said. Still, he added that complex strategies on DeFi platforms can sometimes generate annualised yields up to 50%, making the space increasingly hard to ignore.

For now, bitcoin (BTC-USD) and ethereum (ETH-USD) dominate institutional portfolios. But as infrastructure, regulation, and technical upgrades improve, Butterfill expects stablecoins, real-world assets, and DeFi platforms to become the next frontier for major investors.

""It's very much a bitcoin and ethereum story for now,"" he concluded, ""but the next wave could be much more interesting.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=altcoins","Best Altcoins to Buy as Coinbase & Mastercard Compete in Billion Dollar Stablecoin Deal","https://bitcoinist.com/best-altcoins-coinbase-mastercard-stablecoin-deal/","Fri, 10 Oct 2025 16:11:56 GMT","

Coinbase and Mastercard are reportedly competing to acquire BVNK, a UK-based stablecoin company.

Depending on which deal wins, Coinbase would reinforce its position in the stablecoin market.

And what does this mean for Mastercard? The TradFi giant may update its payment infrastructure to keep pace with the demand for fiat-pegged digital money.

Both outcomes represent a significant step in bringing mainstream users into the crypto space. Thus, there may not be a better time to scoop up the best altcoins to buy ahead of the next season.

Since going live in 2021, BVNK has been well-known for seamlessly integrating stablecoins into payments, cross-border transfers, and treasury operations.

The firm hit its stride in December of last year, raising $50M in a Series B round that valued it at $750 million.

According to sources like Fortune, it'll cost around $1.5B–$2.5B for Coinbase or Mastercard to acquire BVNK.

Suppose Mastercard does get its way, it wouldn't be the first major bank to back BVNK. Visa invested in the company back in May, but the exact amount was never officially disclosed.

Visa's investment was likely strategic, considering it occurred just before President Trump signed the GENIUS Act in July. As a result, there's now an established federal framework for stablecoin issuers in the US, helping the market hit a sizable $309.5B market cap to date.

US dollar-backed stablecoins lead the race – $USDT with a $177.9B market cap, followed by $USDC at $75.4B.

But it's not only stablecoins that benefit from this renewed institutional adoption and regulatory clarity.

Increased market liquidity and accessibility often spill over into the broader crypto market. It may potentially fuel the growth of altcoins, such as those with competitive edges, like Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER), INFINIT ($IN), and Snorter Token ($SNORT).

Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) sets out to solve Bitcoin's biggest pain points, including speed, cost, and scalability.

It aims to achieve this by launching a Layer-2 (L2) network that'll leverage the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM).

As a result of Bitcoin's limited ability to handle Transactions Per Second (TPS), users compete for block space. Not only does this slow down Bitcoin's transaction speeds, but it drives up the network's fees, which currently average $1.258 – roughly 46,500% higher than Solana's $0.0027.

So, Hyper taking advantage of the SVM's capabilities makes the utmost sense to create a cost-friendly alternative chain.

Unlocking Bitcoin's full potential, however, is a Canonical Bridge. By bridging the original network with the L2, you'll be able to access DeFi, NFTs, dApps, and even check out the next crypto to explode on launchpads.

However, to fully leverage the Hyper ecosystem's suite of benefits, you'll want to acquire some $HYPER during the presale. Right now, the token's available for just $0.013095.

$HYPER has already raised a whopping $23M in presales, offering exclusive benefits to token holders, including governance rights, lower gas fees, and staking rewards currently at a 51% APY.

There's no better time to join the $HYPER presale; its price will increase tomorrow and is anticipated to break $0.32 this year. (Check out our Bitcoin Hyper price prediction for more information.)

Join Bitcoin Hyper today.

$IN is the native token of INFINIT, a vertical banking platform that's solely built for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).

And it's succeeding at doing precisely that, as evidenced by it operating across 10+ countries, generating $200M+ in finance, and targeting 200K SMEs.

To access INFINITE's full range of features, you need to purchase $IN. The token unlocks advanced AI-agent strategies, fee discounts, premium tools, and higher usage limits.

$IN also thrives on the platform's developments. For instance, the token has increased by over 119% since yesterday, following news that INFINIT launched ‘Agentic DeFi' on the Plasma platform. In doing so, it has integrated over $5B in deep liquidity with instant settlement.

As this new development continues to gain traction, now may be a favorable time to purchase $IN. It's available on some of the best crypto exchanges (including MEXC and Binance) for roughly $0.25.

As the native token of the upcoming Telegram trading bot Snorter Bot, Snorter Token ($SNORT) is making waves on presale, having raised over $4.5M.

The bot will first launch on Solana to leverage its fast speeds, automation, simplicity, and cost-friendly fees. Then, it'll branch out across Ethereum and other EVM-compatible chains so that you can expand your horizons beyond the best Solana meme coins.

To get the most out of the bot, however, you'll want to buy $SNORT on presale. In doing so, you'll also be granted lower trading fees (0.85% vs. up to 2%), 110% APY staking rewards, and exclusive premium tools.

One $SNORT currently costs only $0.1075, but don't wait to buy at this price. Once listed on top exchanges, our Snorter Token price prediction says it could break around $0.94 this year.

Buy $SNORT for possible 774% gains.

After an impressive rally that propelled Bitcoin (BTC) to new heights above $126,000, the cryptocurrency market is now facing a wave of uncertainty. Major cryptocurrencies, including BTC, have seen a retracement to critical support levels, leaving many investors questioning the market's direction. 

Bitcoin And Ethereum Prices Projected To Skyrocket

Market expert Ash Crypto recently shared insights on social media platform X (formerly Twitter), suggesting that this pullback serves to liquidate bullish positions, particularly among retail investors. He predicts a potential rebound in mid-October, expressing optimism that the market will rally significantly by the end of the month.

According to Ash Crypto, the prevailing sentiment among traders is one of fear, leading many to believe that the anticipated “PUMPTober” has been canceled. However, he argues that when market sentiment is at its most pessimistic, a substantial bounce is likely to occur, setting the stage for a parabolic rally in the fourth quarter. 

The expert's projections estimate that Bitcoin could soar to between $150,000 and $180,000, while Ethereum (ETH) might reach between $8,000 and $12,000. This surge, he contends, would ignite a genuine altcoin season, with altcoins potentially experiencing gains of 10 to 50 times their current values within a few months.

Analysts Predict Explosive Altcoin Phase

Supporting this bullish outlook, analysts from The Bull Theory have noted that the cryptocurrency market is on the brink of its most explosive phase for altcoins. They draw parallels to the market behavior of 2020, when altcoins experienced a significant breakout after a lengthy base-building period. 

The analysts point out that the current market structure mirrors that of 2020, with a multi-year base formation and higher lows indicating that buyers are increasingly absorbing supply. 

The total altcoin market cap, excluding Bitcoin and Ethereum (referred to as TOTAL3), currently hovers around $1.14 trillion, just below a key resistance level of approximately $1.2 trillion.

Historically, altseason has not commenced until this resistance is breached. As long as Bitcoin continues to reach new highs, liquidity tends to concentrate in BTC, leaving altcoins in the shadows. 

However, once TOTAL3 breaks through its ceiling, the analysts anticipate a massive upside, potentially pushing the altcoin market cap to between $5 trillion and $7 trillion. 

This potential breakout is occurring alongside favorable conditions, including high Bitcoin dominance, significant inflows into Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs), improving regulatory clarity, and the resumption of global liquidity injections from countries like China and Japan.

The current period of consolidation, rather than indicating weakness, is seen as a necessary phase before a broader expansion. As analysts emphasize, altseason does not begin arbitrarily; it commences when TOTAL3 decisively breaks out of its resistance.

SWIFT is building a blockchain-based payment system that could directly challenge Ripple's dominance in global money transfers.

SWIFT is developing a blockchain ledger designed to handle real-time settlements and support tokenized assets. The project, built in partnership with Consensys, aims to upgrade the decades-old financial network and compete with Ripple's (XRP-USD) fast, low-cost transaction system.





SWIFT's network connects more than 11,000 institutions across 200 countries, handling the bulk of cross-border transactions worldwide. Founded in 1973 in Belgium, it became the global standard for bank-to-bank communication. The system does not move money itself but transmits secure payment messages between banks using unique SWIFT codes.

The new blockchain infrastructure is meant to keep SWIFT relevant as digital currencies and tokenized assets reshape payments. It focuses on interoperability across public and private chains while allowing banks to adopt new technology without replacing their existing systems.

Ripple continues to lead the market for blockchain-based remittances through its XRP token and On-Demand Liquidity network. The technology allows institutions to settle international transfers within seconds while reducing costs and removing the need for pre-funded accounts.

Financial giants such as SBI Remit in Japan and Pyypl in the Middle East and Africa already use XRP for cross-border transfers. Ripple's network has become a preferred solution for markets where speed, liquidity, and lower fees are critical.

XRP's use extends beyond payments. Travel and loyalty firms such as Webus/Wetour plan to integrate XRP into reward programs, allowing users of Air China's PhoenixMiles to redeem blockchain-based points for services like airport transfers. SBI Holdings has also expanded XRP's use across its subsidiaries and maintains one of the largest corporate XRP holdings.

SWIFT's blockchain project is designed to preserve its central role in international banking. The company's reach gives it a major advantage in adoption, as most global institutions already depend on its network.

Ripple's technology remains faster and more efficient, but SWIFT's approach offers flexibility. Its blockchain will support a variety of regulated stablecoins and tokenized assets rather than rely on a single token like XRP. This could appeal to traditional banks that prefer broader compatibility with existing regulatory frameworks.

SWIFT's project also focuses on enhancing liquidity and improving transparency within its network, aiming to match the settlement efficiency of Ripple's On-Demand Liquidity system.

Despite its scale, SWIFT faces significant technical and regulatory obstacles. Integrating blockchain with its legacy infrastructure requires complex coordination with thousands of institutions while ensuring compliance with strict financial regulations.

Different jurisdictions have varying rules for digital assets and tokenized settlements, which could delay implementation. Many banks remain cautious about adopting new blockchain infrastructure until its stability and benefits are proven.

SWIFT must also contend with Ripple's growing foothold. Ripple's partnerships in Asia and the Americas have built a strong base of liquidity and institutional trust. Unless SWIFT can show clear efficiency gains, its blockchain may be seen as a modernization effort rather than a true rival.

SWIFT's blockchain initiative could reshape global payments by offering a regulated digital settlement platform that complements existing systems. Ripple may continue to dominate regions and use cases where speed and liquidity matter most.

Rather than replacing one another, the two systems may coexist. SWIFT's global reach and Ripple's blockchain efficiency represent different sides of the same trend: the modernization of cross-border finance.

In the end, the winner will depend less on technology and more on who earns the confidence of financial institutions and adapts fastest to the new digital economy.

At the time of writing, XRP is sitting at $2.8234.

Over time, Ripple has built its technology and reputation as a faster, more efficient alternative to SWIFT's older, costlier system.

But SWIFT is no longer playing defense. It is developing a shared ledger with Consensys, aiming to compete directly with Ripple. This article looks at how SWIFT's system works, its blockchain plans and the challenges it still needs to overcome.

Understanding SWIFT: The messaging system behind international money transfers

SWIFT sits at the core of global banking communication. It doesn't move funds itself but provides a secure, standardized messaging network that lets banks and payment providers exchange instructions for cross-border transactions.

When a customer sends money overseas, their bank uses the SWIFT network to send a secure payment message to the recipient's bank. This message includes details such as account numbers, amounts and reference codes. Each bank has a unique SWIFT/Bank Identifier Code (BIC) that ensures the message reaches the right destination.

SWIFT serves as a trusted intermediary for global finance, offering encrypted, authenticated and reliable messaging across 200+ countries. By standardizing communication, it reduces errors, accelerates settlements and supports compliance. It has been the backbone of international money transfers for decades.

Did you know? SWIFT was founded in 1973 in Belgium by 239 banks from 15 countries to replace the slow, error-prone Telex system with faster and more secure financial communication.

XRP's diverse impact: Shortening payments, powering loyalty and enabling DeFi

International payments via XRP can reduce or eliminate pre-funding, accelerate settlement and cut costs. SBI Remit in Japan uses XRP for remittances to the Philippines, Vietnam and Indonesia. Similarly, Pyypl has integrated XRP via Ripple's On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) for remittances between parts of Africa and Asia, targeting unbanked users.

Beyond payments, XRP is being integrated into travel and loyalty services. For example, Webus/Wetour plans to use XRP (backed by a proposed $300-million reserve) to support blockchain-based vouchers and loyalty points for Air China's PhoenixMiles members. These members would, in the future, be able to use XRP for overseas services like airport transfers and premium rides.

Institutions now increasingly view XRP as a key operational and treasury asset. SBI Holdings, for instance, not only invests in Ripple but also integrates XRP in its subsidiaries (SBI Remit, SBI VC Trade) and maintains substantial XRP reserves.

The XRP Ledger is a fast, low-cost blockchain used for cross-border payments, tokenized assets and decentralized finance (DeFi) projects. It relies on a consensus protocol rather than mining, which reduces energy use and operational costs compared with proof-of-work networks.

SWIFT's blockchain project: Architecture and ambition

SWIFT's blockchain initiative is being designed for interoperability between public and private chains and for handling regulated stablecoins and tokenized assets, positioning it as a versatile infrastructure for the future.

A key feature of SWIFT's blockchain project is real-time cross-border payments. The system is designed to enhance existing digital infrastructure rather than replace it entirely. This approach allows financial institutions to integrate it more easily with their current systems, reducing one of the biggest barriers to adoption.

By adopting blockchain, SWIFT aims to maintain its central role in global payments as stablecoins and networks like XRP gain traction. The project is intended to keep banks within the SWIFT ecosystem by modernizing its infrastructure and strengthening its position at the core of international finance.

Did you know? Ripple's technology can settle on the XRP Ledger in three to five seconds, whereas SWIFT-based cross-border transfers often take one to five business days.

How SWIFT's blockchain could undercut Ripple's edge

SWIFT's blockchain project builds on its long-standing dominance in global banking and settlements. Its network already connects thousands of banks and financial institutions worldwide, giving it a scale that Ripple may find hard to match. Ripple's ODL system, which uses the XRP token as a bridge currency, still offers faster and cheaper cross-border payments. For SWIFT, the main challenge is improving liquidity to reach the same level of efficiency as Ripple's ODL model.

Network effects will also play a big role. Since most institutions are already linked to SWIFT, banks may find it easier to adopt its new shared ledger instead of moving to Ripple's system. For Ripple, convincing financial institutions to switch networks remains a major challenge. SWIFT's neutral stance on tokens and settlement methods could also help it maintain an advantage over Ripple.

While Ripple's model relies on XRP as a bridge asset, SWIFT's upcoming ledger is designed to support a wider range of regulated tokens, including stablecoins and tokenized assets. This flexibility could weaken XRP's dominance in cross-border settlements, especially if banks move toward multi-asset payment systems.

Did you know? Ripple's On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) has been used by SBI Remit in Japan to send money to countries such as the Philippines and Vietnam.

Challenges confronting SWIFT

SWIFT's blockchain project still faces hurdles that could slow its rollout. One of the biggest challenges is connecting the new system with existing banking infrastructure while keeping everything technically compatible. Since SWIFT runs a long-established global messaging network, making it work smoothly with a distributed ledger without disrupting current services will be a complex task.

Another significant challenge is regulatory compliance across jurisdictions: Varying rules on digital assets, stablecoins and tokenization can complicate cross-border deployment. Additionally, many financial institutions are cautious; they may hesitate to adopt new infrastructure unless its advantages are clear and risks are mitigated.

SWIFT also faces tough competition from Ripple's long-standing partnerships focused on real-time settlement. Unless SWIFT can show clear and measurable advantages, its blockchain project may be seen as a supporting effort instead of a leading solution.

Will SWIFT's blockchain challenge or complement Ripple?

Looking ahead, SWIFT's blockchain ledger could reshape global payments in two ways. It might coexist with Ripple, keeping its dominant position in regulated banking. Ripple, meanwhile, may continue to focus on liquidity and settlement efficiency in emerging markets. Another possibility is that SWIFT uses its massive network to gradually overtake Ripple, reducing the industry's reliance on proprietary tokens.

The outcome of this rivalry will shape the future of cross-border payments. Ripple's response will be crucial. The competition between the two could spark faster innovation and lead to more real-world applications through partnerships with fintechs and regional banks.

Ultimately, the deciding factor won't just be better technology. Other elements, such as network momentum, institutional confidence and alignment with the broader goals of global finance, will also play a major role.

Launched in mid-2022, the game integrates strategic and tycoon gameplay elements, allowing players to develop, manage, and scale NFT projects. The strategic choices made by players, from selecting artwork to setting mint prices, significantly affect their earnings and rankings.

In Founder Simulator, players start by determining their NFT project's characteristics and assembling a dedicated team. Players choose from four specialization classes that impact game mechanics and strategic options:

These choices influence the dynamics of gameplay and the suitability of characters for tasks.

Earning ‘Green Money,' the primary currency, is essential for paying staff and financing expansions. Players can also take loans to accelerate growth, though it comes with risks like progress freezing on accumulating debt. Effective resource management and hiring competent team members are crucial for launching successful projects.

The game's economy hinges on the $FDR token, planned to have a total supply of 1 billion. It is used for upgrading collections, hiring premium staff, and entering exclusive events. Players can also use it to vote on game updates and earn passive rewards through staking.

Founder Simulator offers various earning avenues:

The game encourages community involvement through pre-registration milestones, which offer in-game currency and stat boosts. A referral contest is also in place to reward top referrers with significant $FDR prizes. As the launch approaches, the community eagerly awaits the finalization of what promises to be a ground-breaking economic model in the gaming world.

Umbra, a privacy protocol powered by Arcium, has raised $154.9 million in USDC following the completion of its Initial Coin Offering (ICO) on Friday.

However, because the cap was set to $3 million, an initial price of $0.30 per UMBRA token, participants will get approximately 2% of their allocation, the team explained. Therefore, each person will receive their share according to the USDC they committed, and have the remaining refunded.

The Solana-based project drew participation from 10,518 investors via MetaDAO — one of the most successful raises on the futarchy-powered platform to date. Futarchy refers to a governance or decision-making model that uses prediction markets to guide outcomes.

The project's token sale exceeded its $750,000 minimum target by more than 206x, reflecting growing market interest in privacy-focused blockchain applications and demand for confidential transaction infrastructure in decentralized finance.

""We're genuinely overwhelmed by the support from our community,"" Umbra co-founder ""Kru"" said in a statement shared with The Block. ""This raise is a strong signal that privacy-preserving technology isn't just a niche anymore — it's becoming a fundamental expectation for users. We're excited to keep building and delivering on our vision with Arcium and the Solana ecosystem.""

Umbra joins a range of encryption applications powered by Arcium, such as Dark Pool, Blackjack, and Phantom Fleet. Proceeds from the raise will fund Umbra's development roadmap, including private swaps within the Umbra app, a redesigned interface, and a Zcash–Solana bridge to unlock ZEC liquidity for cross-chain privacy use cases, the team said. The protocol also plans to introduce a tiered fee model and monetize its SDK for integration with wallets, dApps, and financial platforms.

Umbra's launch plans

Umbra plans to launch alongside Arcium's Mainnet Alpha, becoming one of the first privacy protocols on Solana to use its infrastructure. In May 2024, Arcium announced it had raised $5.5 million in a strategic funding round led by Greenfield Capital to develop its confidential computing network, The Block previously reported. 

Arcium, which recently completed the second phase of its public testnet, has now raised over $15 million in total to support an ecosystem of more than 20 projects. Its Multi-Party Computation (MPC) framework enables encrypted, trustless, and scalable data processing. The project previously developed Elusiv, a zero-knowledge privacy protocol based on Solana.

""It's incredible to see Umbra's ICO become a record-breaking success. It's a clear message from users who want greater control and privacy over their onchain activity,"" Arcium CEO Yannik Schrade said on Friday. ""What Umbra is doing for privacy on Solana is just the beginning; Arcium's infrastructure opens access to fast and trustless, encrypted computing power for every use cases that needs it, marking a monumental shift for public blockchains.""

The Crypto space has witnessed increased interest in new initiatives that harmonize practical utility with cutting-edge technology. XRP Price Prediction continues to occupy investors' minds with developments in top blockchain ecosystems, while Chainlink continues to be in the running for its oracle platforms. 

Amidst all this, Remittix (RTX) has quietly been gaining steam as a cross-border payment system. Placed to connect crypto with fiat in an effortless way, Remittix allows for the direct sending of digital money to regular bank accounts in over 30 countries. 

Early movement and robust technical backing are driving interest in this low gas charge crypto project, by way of which it is poised to become one of the best DeFi projects of 2025.

The value of XRP is $2.82, down by 2.76% in the past 24 hours. Its market cap stands at $167.4 billion with daily volumes of $4.79 billion, 33.56% lower day to day. Investors monitoring XRP Price Prediction closely are comparing these figures with broader market trends and the effect of oracle solutions such as Chainlink.

Chainlink still gives decentralized apps important real-time data feeds that help make blockchain operations more open and accurate. The price has dropped 1.95% in the last 24 hours and is now $21.451. The market cap is $14.67 billion, and the trading volume is $779.45 million, which is a 32.07% drop. 

As XRP and other older cryptocurrencies settle down, people are starting to pay more attention to projects that have real-world use and can be measured in terms of adoption.

Remittix now trades at $0.1130 per token with more than 676.8 million tokens sold and over $27 million raised during its presale so far. The project has already achieved important milestones, including the first future centralized exchange (CEX) listing announcement with BitMart due to passing the $20 million presale milestone. A second listing is planned with CEX LBank after passing the $22 million milestone. 

The announcements position RTX for liquidity and exposure, providing early-stage crypto investors with structured access while validating the project's legitimacy as a top crypto under $1 to watch.

Remittix wallet beta is now live, enabling the sending of cryptocurrency to bank accounts in over 30 countries and receiving 40+ cryptos and 30+ fiat currencies. The wallet includes real-time FX conversion with open rates, gas price-optimized, and accommodates use cases for freelancers, remitters, and businesses. 

The Core Pillars of Remittix's Rapid Ascent:

Remittix's focus on real-world adoption and robust presale performance establish it as an emerging contender to watch in 2025's cryptocurrency scene. Early adopters are witnessing a well-planned, utility-driven initiative that sets it apart from hype projects, making RTX one of the most valuable projects to keep an eye on.

ICO's £7.5m Clearview AI Fine Back on Track After Ruling


                                                                                Graham Turner

The decision confirms that companies processing or monitoring UK residents' data are subject to UK data protection law, regardless of where they operate.




                                                                                Graham Turner                                                                                


10 October 2025,
                                                01.21pm


The UK's Upper Tribunal (UT) has ruled in favour of the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) in its appeal against the First-tier Tribunal's (FTT) decision on Clearview AI, strengthening the regulator's case to enforce a £7.5m fine against the US facial recognition company.

In May 2022, the ICO fined Manhattan-based Clearview AI £7.5m and issued an enforcement notice for scraping images of UK residents from websites and social media platforms, then uploading them into a global database used for facial recognition by Clearview's customers. The service enables clients to identify individuals and monitor their behaviour as a commercial offering.

Clearview appealed both the fine and the enforcement notice to the FTT, which initially found in the company's favour. The ICO then appealed that decision to the UT.

Judging in the case, the UT upheld three of the ICO's four grounds of appeal. It found that Clearview's processing of personal information was related to monitoring the behaviour of UK residents, and that the company's activities did not fall outside the reach of UK data protection law simply because it provided services to foreign law enforcement or government agencies.

The Tribunal also concluded that the FTT had applied the law incorrectly in finding that Clearview's processing was outside the material scope of the UK GDPR.

The ICO said the decision clarifies both the material and territorial scope of the UK GDPR, reaffirming that companies monitoring the behaviour of UK residents fall within the remit of UK data protection law, regardless of where they are based.

John Edwards, UK Information Commissioner, said: “The UT's decision has upheld our ability to protect UK residents from having their data, including images, unlawfully scraped and then used in a global online database without their knowledge.

“The ruling also gives greater confidence to people in the UK that we can and will act on their behalf, regardless of where the company handling their personal information is based. It is essential that foreign organisations are held accountable when their technologies impact the information rights and freedoms of individuals in the UK.”

The UT's decision is legally binding and will serve as guidance for future cases involving similar questions of jurisdiction.

The Tribunal has directed that the case be returned to the FTT to determine the substantive appeal, on the basis that the ICO had jurisdiction to issue the monetary penalty and enforcement notice.

Clearview may now seek permission to appeal the UT's ruling.

Psst… you're reading Techpoint Digest

Every day, we handpick the biggest stories, skip the noise, and bring you a fun digest you can trust.

Shalom,

Victoria from Techpoint here,

Here's what I've got for you today:

Uganda has just launched its first Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC), kicking off what could be one of the biggest shake-ups in the country's financial world. Working with Global Settlement Network (GSN) and Diacente Group, the government is rolling out a $5.5 billion tokenised economy with real infrastructure and industries getting digitised, not just financial experiments.

The platform is being piloted on GSN's permissioned blockchain, where every unit of the digital shilling will be backed by treasury bonds. That means the digital currency isn't floating on speculation; it has real assets behind it. Key sectors like mining, agriculture, renewable energy, and logistics are part of the plan.

It's all anchored around Uganda's Karamoja Green Industrial & Special Economic Zone (GISEZ), managed by Diacente. Think solar power plants, agro-processing hubs, smart infrastructure, everything you'd expect in a zone built to symbolise industrial modernisation. The idea is to tokenise not just money, but infrastructure, trade flows, and value across physical and economic systems.

On the inclusion front, this could matter a lot. The permissioned blockchain setup gives the Central Bank and authorised partners control over who's in, ensuring regulation (KYC, AML) is respected. Uganda aims to make the CBDC usable via smartphones and USSD, which helps bridge gaps for people without fancy devices.

There are serious ambitions behind the numbers: more than one million jobs projected, up to $10 billion in annual exports, and alignment with Uganda's long-term plans like Vision 2040 and continental goals under the AU's Agenda 2063. This is being positioned not as a tech fad but as a foundational piece of industrial and financial transformation.

Of course, no rollout is without challenges. Technical capacity, public understanding, ensuring fairness (so people without smartphones aren't left behind), and regulatory clarity will all need attention. But Uganda's pilot provides a real test case for how digital currency + tokenisation can be used for real economic change, not just digital currency hype.

I saw the news this week about a company, dubbed, “Tinder for Jobs,” getting into Y Combinator, and of course, Bolu already has the gist for you. The startup, Sorce, was founded by three Nigerians — Oluwapelumi Dada, David Alade, and Daniel Ajayi — and it's changing the way people find jobs online.

Their big break came when they got an unexpected email from David Lieb, the man behind Google Photos and now a General Partner at YC. On a quick call, Lieb told them they'd just been accepted into the accelerator even though they had applied after the deadline. It was the kind of moment every founder dreams of, but in their case, it wasn't exactly a surprise.

Sorce, which started as Swype in August 2024, had already gone viral online, gaining users in nearly every country in the world except North Korea and three others. The app makes job-hunting as simple as swiping right, powered by AI that auto-fills applications and matches users with companies based on skills and preferences. Dada calls it “Tinder for jobs,” and people seem to love it. The platform has logged over 20 million swipes and nearly 500,000 users.

Before Sorce, Dada built a simpler version called One Click Apply while interning at Tesla and Dell. That caught the attention of Sam Parr, founder of The Hustle, who shared Dada's story with his 1.7 million followers on X. Parr's post went viral, describing Dada as the kind of young founder you bet on early. Soon after, Founders Inc wrote the first cheque that allowed him to chase his dream full-time.

To bring Sorce to life, Dada teamed up with Ajayi, an MIT-trained AI engineer who had interned at Nvidia, and Alade, an iOS developer he met on X. In just seven weeks, they launched Sorce and hit 1.5 million views on their announcement post. The team has since grown to six people, including Matthew, a Canadian intern who joined through the platform and rebuilt their AI search feature, doubling user engagement.

Today, users have landed interviews at over 150 companies, including OpenAI, Visa, Coca-Cola, Samsung, and Nvidia. Not bad for a startup that began as a side project and missed the YC deadline. Bolu gives you more on their journey and what's next for Sorce in his latest for Techpoint Africa.

Flutterwave UK's 2024 numbers are in and they're not pretty. The British arm of Africa's most valuable fintech reported a net loss of £2.27 million, up sharply from £485,000 in 2023, despite growing its turnover by 21% to £6.6 million.

The company's operating profit plunged 89%, falling from £1.25 million to just £142,299. A big part of that slide came from ballooning administrative costs, up from £4.2 million to £6.4 million, as the company expanded its headcount from 22 to 31 people.

Adding to the financial hit, Flutterwave UK also recorded a £2.6 million loss from the disposal of an undisclosed investment. The company hasn't shared details about what was sold, but that one-off event wiped out what could have been a much stronger year.

The filings also show a worrying cash position. Flutterwave UK's reserves dropped from nearly £15 million in 2023 to just £743,000 by the end of 2024. Meanwhile, retained earnings flipped from +£1 million to -£1.25 million, and amounts owed to the company plummeted from £4.5 million to £10,000, hinting at possible internal or customer-side adjustments.

In response, the company told Techpoint Africa that “a one-off item from strategic investment disposals impacted the year-end result but not the underlying strength of the business.” Flutterwave added that its 2025 half-year results show stronger momentum, with margins doubling, enterprise payments up 20% year-on-year, and new regulatory approvals across key markets.

Flutterwave isn't the only Nigerian fintech facing tough early returns in the UK. Moniepoint UK also posted a $1.2 million loss in its first year of operations, generating no revenue between February and December 2024. For both companies, the message seems clear, building a sustainable UK fintech business takes more than just brand strength.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=cbdc","Building the Future of Money: Why Private Innovation and Public Infrastructure Must Converge","https://thefintechtimes.com/building-the-future-of-money-why-private-innovation-and-public-infrastructure-must-converge/","Fri, 10 Oct 2025 09:30:03 GMT","

Here, Faisal Toukan, CEO & Co-Founder of Ziina, explains why the future of money depends on a partnership between private innovation and public infrastructure.

Fintechs thrive by putting the user first. At Ziina, we have merged finance with art and user experience, earning global design recognition, including the Red Dot Award, for an interface built around speed and simplicity. This approach turns a mundane task like splitting a bill or paying for dinner into an intuitive and seamless process.

This is not just about aesthetics. A user-friendly interface, quick setup, and complete transparency reduce the friction that prevents many from embracing digital payments. Today, tens of thousands of SMEs and consumers across the UAE rely on Ziina for hassle-free money movement. As the first venture capital-backed fintech with a Stored Value Facilities (SVF) licence from the UAE Central Bank, we combine this design-led innovation with robust regulatory standards.

Innovation alone is not enough. For digital finance to reach its full potential, it needs a secure and efficient backbone, which is the role of the UAE's Digital Dirham. The Digital Dirham is a central bank digital currency (CBDC)—a digital version of the country's official money, issued and guaranteed by the central bank. Unlike decentralised and volatile cryptocurrencies, a CBDC has the same value and legal standing as physical cash.

Globally, central banks are exploring similar models, with China piloting its e-CNY and the European Central Bank progressing on a digital euro. Against this backdrop, the UAE stands out for the speed and clarity with which it is moving. By embedding security and compliance directly into the financial system, the Digital Dirham creates the rails for fintechs to build upon and scale innovation responsibly.

One without the other falls short. CBDCs offer stability but do not solve for usability or adoption on their own. Fintechs can build sleek experiences, but without trusted infrastructure, they risk fragility. Together, they close the loop: CBDCs deliver the foundation, and fintechs translate that foundation into everyday value for consumers and businesses. In practice, this means instant settlement for SMEs, real-time wages for gig workers, or cross-border payments that clear in seconds instead of days.

Oops, something went wrong

Give me control of a nation's money supply, and I care not who makes its laws. (Mayer Amschel Rothschild, founder of the Rothschild banking dynasty.)

Throughout history, control over money has been one of the most powerful levers of state authority. Rulers have long understood that whoever issues and manages the currency also commands the economy and, by extension, society itself.

In Tudor England, Henry VIII's “Great Debasement” between 1542 and 1551 reduced the silver content of coins from more than 90% to barely one-third, while leaving the king's portrait shining on the surface, of course. The policy financed wars and courtly extravagance, but also fuelled inflation and public distrust in coinage.

Centuries earlier, Roman emperors had resorted to similar tricks with the denarius, steadily reducing its silver content until by the 3rd century AD, it contained little more than trace amounts, undermining its credibility and contributing to economic instability.

Outside Europe, the same pattern held. In 11th-century China, the Song dynasty pioneered paper money, extending state control over taxation and trade. This was a groundbreaking innovation, but later dynasties such as the Ming over-issued notes, sparking inflation and loss of trust in the currency.

Such episodes underline a timeless truth: money is never neutral. It has always been an instrument of governance – whether to project authority, consolidate control or disguise fiscal weakness. The establishment of central banks, from the Bank of England in 1694 to the US Federal Reserve in 1913, formalised that authority.

The Insights section is committed to high-quality longform journalism. Our editors work with academics from many different backgrounds who are tackling a wide range of societal and scientific challenges.

Today, the same story is entering a new digital chapter. As Axel van Trotsenburg, senior managing director of the World Bank, wrote in 2024: “Embracing digitalisation is no longer a choice. It's a necessity.” By this he meant not simply switching to online banking, but making the currencies we use, and the mechanisms for regulating it, entirely digital.

Just as rulers once clipped coins or over-printed notes, governments are now testing how far digital money can extend their reach – both within and beyond national boundaries. Of course, different governments and political systems have very different ideas about how the money of the future should be designed.

In March 2024, then-former President Trump, back on the hustings trail, declared: “As your president, I will never allow the creation of a central bank digital currency.” It was a campaign moment, but also a salvo in a much larger battle – not just over the future of money, but who controls it.

In the US, the issuance of currency – whether in the form of physical cash or digital bank deposits and electronic payments – has traditionally been monopolised by the Federal Reserve (more commonly known as “the Fed”), a technocratic institution designed to operate independently from the elected government and houses. But Trump's hostility toward the Fed is well-documented, and noisy.

During his second term, Trump has publicly berated the Fed's chair, Jerome Powell, calling him “a stubborn MORON” over his interest rate policies, and even floating the idea of replacing him. Trump's discomfort with the Fed's autonomy echoes earlier populist movements such as President Andrew Jackson's 1830s crusade against the Second Bank of the United States, when federal financial elites were portrayed as obstacles to democratic control of money.

In March 2025, when Trump issued an executive order establishing a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, he signalled the opening of a new front in this institutional battle. By incorporating bitcoin into an official US reserve, the world's largest economy is, for the first time, sanctioning its use as part of state financial infrastructure.

For a leader like Trump, who has consistently sought to break, bypass or dominate independent institutions – from the judiciary to intelligence agencies – the idea of replacing the Fed's influence with a state-aligned crypto ecosystem may represent the ultimate act of executive assertion.

Such a step reframes bitcoin as more than an investment fad or criminal fallback; it is being drawn into the formal monetary system – in the US, at least.

Bitcoin is, by a distance, the world's most valuable cryptocurrency (at the time of writing, one coin is worth just shy of US$120,000) having established a record high in August 2025. Like gold, its value is ensured in part by its finite supply, and its security by the blockchain technology that makes it unhackable.

For most who buy bitcoins, its key value is not as a currency but a speculative investment product – a kind of “digital gold” or high-risk stock that investors buy hoping for big returns. Many people have indeed made millions from their purchases.

But now, thanks in particular to Trump's aggressively pro-crypto, anti-central bank approach, bitcoin's potential role as part of a new form of state-controlled digital currency is in the spotlight like never before.

Trump's framing of bitcoin as “freedom money” reflects its traditional sales pitch as being censorship-resistant, unreviewable, and free from state control. At the same time, his blurring of public authority and private financial interest, when it comes to cryptocurrencies, has raised some serious ethical and governance concerns.

But the crucial innovation here is that Trump is not proposing a truly libertarian system. It is a hybrid model: one where the issuance of money may become privatised while control of the US's financial reserve strategy – and associated political and economic narratives – remains firmly in state hands.

This raises provocative questions about the future of the Federal Reserve. Could it be sidelined not through legal abolition, but by the growing relevance of parallel monetary systems blessed by the executive? The possibility is no longer far-fetched.

According to a 2023 paper published by the Bank for International Settlements, a powerful if little-known organisation that coordinates central bank policy globally: “The decentralisation of monetary functions across public and private actors introduces a new era of contestable monetary sovereignty.”

In plain English, this means money is no longer the sole domain of states. Tech firms, decentralised communities and even AI-powered platforms are now building alternative value systems that challenge the monopoly of national currencies.

Calls to diminish the role of central banks in shaping macroeconomic outcomes are closely tied to the rise of what the University of Cambridge's Bennett School of Public Policy calls “crypto populism” – a movement that shifts legitimacy away from unelected technocrats towards “the people”, whether they are retail investors, cryptocurrency miners or politically aligned firms.

Supporters of this agenda argue that central banks have too much unchecked power, from manipulating interest rates to bailing out financial elites, while ordinary savers bear the costs through inflation or higher borrowing charges.

In the US, Trump and his advisers have become the most visible proponents, tying bitcoin and also so-called “stablecoins” (cryptocurrencies designed to maintain a stable value by being pegged to an external asset) to a broader populist narrative about wresting control from elites.

The emergence of this dual monetary system is causing deep unease in traditional financial institutions. Even the economist-activist Yanis Varoufakis – a long-time critic of central banks – has warned of the dangers of Trump's approach, suggesting that US private stablecoin legislation could deliberately weaken the Fed's grip on money, while “depriving it of the means to clean up the inevitable mess” that will follow.

Some rival US nations also feel deep unease about its approach to money – in part because of what analysts call the “weaponisation of the dollar”. This describes how US financial dominance, via Swift and correspondent banking systems, has long enabled sanctions that effectively exclude targeted governments, companies or individuals from global finance.

These tools have been used extensively against Iran, Russia, Venezuela and others – triggering efforts by countries including China, Russia and even some EU states to build alternative payment systems and digital currencies, aimed at reducing dependency on the dollar. As the Atlantic put it in 2023, the US appeared to be “pushing away allies and adversaries alike by turning its currency into a geopolitical bludgeon”.

Spurred on by these concerns and an increasing desire to delink from the dollar as the world's anchor currency, many countries are now moving towards creating their own central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) – government-issued digital currencies backed and regulated by state institutions.

While fully live CBDCs are already in use in countries ranging from the Bahamas and Jamaica to Nigeria, many more are in active pilot phases – including China's digital yuan (e-CNY). Having been trialled in multiple cities since 2019, the e-CNY now has millions of domestic users and, by mid-2024, had processed nearly US$1 trillion in retail transactions.

A key part of Beijing's ambition is to use the digital yuan as a strategic hedge against dollar-based clearance systems, positioning it as part of a wider plan to reduce China's reliance on the US dollar in international trade. Likewise, the European Central Bank has framed its digital euro – which entered its preparation phase in October 2023 – as essential to future European monetary sovereignty, stating that it would reduce reliance on non-European (often US-controlled) digital payment providers such as Visa, Mastercard and PayPal.

In this way, CBDCs are becoming a new front in global competition over who sets the rules of money, trade and financial sovereignty in the digital age. As governments rush to build and test these systems, technologists, civil libertarians and financial institutions are clashing over how best to do this – and whether the world should embrace or fear the rise of central bank digital currencies.

The experience of using a CBDC will be much like today's mobile banking apps: you'll receive your salary directly into a digital wallet, make instant payments in shops or online, and transfer money to friends in seconds. The key difference is all of that money will be a direct claim on the central bank, guaranteed by the state, rather than a private bank.

In many countries, CBDCs are being pitched as more efficient tools for economic inclusion and societal benefit. A 2023 Bank of England consultation paper emphasised that its proposal for a digital pound would be “privacy-respecting by design” and “non-programmable by the state”. It would not replace cash but sit alongside it, the BoE suggested, with each citizen allowed to hold up to a capped limit digital pounds (suggested at £10,000-£20,000) to avoid destabilising commercial bank deposits.

However, some critics see CBDCs as Trojan horses for surveillance. In 2019, a report by the professional services network PWC suggested that CBDCs, if unchecked, could entrench executive power by removing intermediary financial institutions and enabling programmable, direct government control over citizen transactions. According to the report, this could mean stimulus payments that expire if not spent within 30 days, or taxes deducted at the moment of transaction. In other words, CBDCs could be tools of efficiency – but also of unprecedented oversight.

A 2024 CFA Institute paper warned that digital currencies could allow governments to trace, tax or block payments in real time – tools that authoritarian regimes might embrace. The Bank for International Settlements (BIS) has called the advent of this “programmable money” inevitable.

Imagine, for example, a parent transferring 20 digital pounds to their child's CBDC wallet, but with a rule that this money can only be spent on food, not video games. When the child uses it at a supermarket, their payment is programmed so that the retailer's suppliers and the tax authority are paid instantly (£15 to the shop, £3 to wholesalers, £2 straight to the tax office) with no extra steps. In theory, at least, everyone is happy: the parent sees the child spent the money responsibly, the suppliers are paid immediately, and the retailer's tax bill is settled automatically.

In technical terms, programmable payments such as this are straightforward for CBDCs. But such a system raises big questions about privacy and personal freedom. Some critics fear that programmable CBDCs might be used to restrict spending on disapproved categories such as alcohol and fuel, create expiry dates for unemployment benefits, or enforce climate targets through money flow limits. The BIS has warned that CBDCs should be “designed with safeguards” to preserve user privacy, financial inclusion and interoperability across borders.

Even well-intentioned digital systems can create tools of surveillance. CBDC architecture choices, such as default privacy settings, tiered access or transaction expiry can all shape the extent of executive control embedded in the system. If designed without democratic oversight, these infrastructures risk institutional capture.

Some CBDC pilots – including China's e-CNY, the Sand Dollar and the eNaira – have been criticised for omitting clear privacy guarantees, with their respective central banks deferring decisions on privacy protections to future legislation. According to Norbert Michel, director of the Cato Institute's Center for Monetary and Financial Alternatives and one of the most prominent US voices warning about the risks of CBDCs:

A fully implemented CBDC gives the government complete control over the money going into, and coming out of, every person's account. It's not difficult to see that this level of government control is incompatible with both economic and political freedom.

The concerns being raised about central bank digital currencies extend beyond personal payment controls. A recent analysis by Rand Corporation highlighted how law enforcement capabilities could dramatically increase with the introduction of CBDCs. While this could strengthen efforts to stop money laundering and the financing of terrorism, it also raises fears of “mission creep”, whereby the same tools could be used to police ordinary citizens' spending or political activities.

Concerns about mission creep – the idea that a system introduced for limited goals (efficiency, anti-money laundering) gradually expands into broader tools of control – extend into other areas of digital authoritarianism. The Bennett School has cautioned that without legal and political safeguards, CBDCs risk empowering state surveillance and undermining democratic oversight, especially in an interconnected global system.

It is not anti-technology or overly conspiratorial to ask hard questions about the design, governance and safeguards built into our future money. The legitimacy of CBDCs will hinge on public trust, and that trust must be earned. As has been highlighted by the OECD, democratic values like privacy, civic trust and rights protection must all be integral to CBDC design.

Predictably, the public view of what we want our money to look like in future is mixed. The tensions we see between centralised CBDCs and decentralised alternatives reflect fundamentally different philosophies.

In the US, populist rhetoric has found a strong base among cryptocurrency investors and libertarian movements. At the same time, surveys in Europe suggest many people remain sceptical of replacing a central bank's authority, associating it with stability and trustworthiness.

For the US Federal Reserve, the debate over bitcoin, decentralised finance (“DeFi”) and stablecoins goes to the heart of American financial power. Behind closed doors, some US officials worry that both the unchecked use of stablecoins and a widespread adoption of foreign CBDCs like China's e‑CNY will erode the dollar's central role and weaken the US's monetary policy apparatus.

In this context, Trump's push to elevate crypto into a US Strategic Bitcoin Reserve carries serious implications. While US officials generally avoid direct comment on partisan moves, their policy documents make the stakes clear: if crypto expands outside regulatory boundaries, this could undermine financial stability and weaken the very tools – from monetary policy to sanctions – that sustain the dollar's global dominance.

Meanwhile, the Bank of England's governor, Andrew Bailey, writing in the Financial Times this week, sounded more accommodating of a financial future that includes stablecoins, suggesting: “It is possible, at least partially, to separate money from credit provision, with banks and stablecoins coexisting and non-banks carrying out more of the credit provision role.” He has previously stressed that stablecoins must “pass the test of singleness of money”, ensuring that one pound always equals one pound (something that cannot be guaranteed if a currency is backed by risky assets).

This isn't just caution for caution's sake – it's grounded in both history and recent events.

During the US's Free Banking Era in the middle of the 19th century, state-chartered banks could issue their own paper money (banknotes) with little oversight. These “wildcat banks” often issued more notes than they could redeem, especially when economic stress hit – meaning people holding those notes found they weren't worth the paper they were printed on.

A much more recent example is the collapse of TerraUSD (UST) in May 2022. Terra was a so-called stablecoin that was supposed to keep its value pegged 1:1 with the US dollar. In practice, it relied on algorithms and reserves that turned out to be fragile. When confidence cracked, UST lost its peg, dropping from $1 to as low as 10 cents in a matter of days. The crash wiped out over US$40 billion (around £29 billion) in value and shook trust in the whole stablecoin sector.

But Bailey's crypto caution extends to CBDCs too. In his most recent Mansion House speech, the Bank of England governor said he remains unconvinced of the need for a “Britcoin” CBDC, so long as improvements to bank payment systems (such as making bank transfers faster, cheaper and more user-friendly) prove effective.

Ultimately, the form our money takes in future is not a question of technology so much as trust. In its latest guidance, the IMF underscores the necessity of earning public trust, not assuming it, by involving citizens, watchdog groups and independent experts in CBDC design, rather than allowing central banks or big tech to shape it unilaterally.

If done right, digital money could be more inclusive, more transparent, and more efficient than today's systems. But that future is not guaranteed. The code is already being written – the question is: by who, and with what values?

ByDan Alexander,

Forbes Staff.

Looking at Donald Trump's finances, it's easy to miss one of his most important assets: bitcoin. The cryptocurrency appears nowhere on the financial disclosure the president files with the government. It is not listed among the holdings identified on the Trump Organization's website. And it does not show up in other reports of his assets. But make no mistake, Trump holds a major position in the digital currency, amounting to an estimated $870 million, enough to make him one of the largest bitcoin investors on the planet.

The reason Trump's investment is so hidden: He holds it indirectly, through his stake in the business that operates Truth Social, the Trump Media and Technology Group (which does appear on his balance sheet). Trump Media attracted a multibillion-dollar valuation trading on the Nasdaq despite generating less than $4 million of annual revenue, then pivoted to crypto earlier this year. In May, it raised $2.3 billion by taking on a pile of debt and selling its overvalued stock. Then, in July, it snatched $2 billion of bitcoin. The stock sales diluted Trump's stake in the company from 52% to 41%. The price of bitcoin has increased about 6% since Trump Media's big bet. That leaves the president with 41% of an estimated $2.1 billion stockpile, enough to make his personal share roughly $870 million.

There are only a handful of other billionaires who appear to own more. The Winklevoss twins could have over $8 billion, if they haven't sold off any in recent years. Michael Saylor, who pioneered the bitcoin treasury strategy Trump Media is now copying, has about $5 billion through his 7% stake in his company, Strategy—as well as an estimated $2.2 billion on the side. Tim Draper won an auction in 2014 for coins the U.S. government seized when taking down the Silk Road, an illicit marketplace, that are now worth $3.6 billion. Investor Matthew Roszak may hold more than $1 billion. Right behind them: Donald Trump, who wanted little to do with bitcoin during his first term.

“I am not a fan of Bitcoin and other Cryptocurrencies, which are not money, and whose value is highly volatile and based on thin air,” the president tweeted in 2019. “Unregulated Crypto Assets can facilitate unlawful behavior, including drug trade and other illegal activity.”

Trump's transformation from crypto skeptic to bitcoin bull captures his approach to business. An opportunist with a mind for marketing, he started to dabble in crypto during his years out of the White House. First, Trump sold nonfungible-token trading cards, including ones of himself stylized as a superhero, generating a few million dollars of easy money. Then, as the 2024 election drew closer, he launched a crypto project with his three sons named World Liberty Financial. It pretty much went nowhere, until Trump won the election. That's when crypto community, highly vulnerable to government regulation, piled into World Liberty tokens, ultimately adding more than $1 billion to Trump's net worth, according to Forbes estimates. With D.C. buzzing before the inauguration, the president-elect also launched a memecoin, boosting his fortune by nearly a billion more.

The dawn of a second Trump presidency lifted asset values across the industry. The price of bitcoin jumped 60% from Election Day in November to May of this year. Trump Media announced its plan to start stockpiling bitcoin. It relied on its sky-high trading price to raise money, selling $1 billion of convertible bonds and another $1.4 billion of stock. Trump's share of the debt—equal to about $400 million—now represents the largest loan in his portfolio, bigger than any of his real estate mortgages.

The White House is unbothered by the ethical concerns all of this creates. “Neither the president nor his family have ever engaged, or ever will ever engage, in conflicts of interest,” says Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt, immediately undermining herself by pointing to clear conflicts of interest. “Through executive actions, supporting legislation like the GENIUS Act and other common-sense policies, the administration is fulfilling the president's promise to make the United States the crypto capital of the world.”

Investors who bought the shares and bonds that funded Trump Media's bitcoin bet were apparently hoping for a meme-stock surge, which seemed plausible. After all, shares of Trump Media had soared on little more than a money-losing social media app, so maybe they would rocket again when tethered to one of the buzziest assets in the world? Adding a level of security, the bonds are structured to allow investors to walk away with a 4% return after a year and half if a stock surge did not materialize.

But mania tends to taper off eventually. Despite having a stronger balance sheet, which now features a couple billion dollars of bitcoin and a billion in debt, the market cap of Trump Media is $1.2 billion less today than it was before the company shifted to bitcoin. Set the bitcoin play aside, and investors are now implying the original media business is worth just 60% of what they thought it amounted to in May.

That's not to say Trump Media is doomed, especially with three more years left in Trump's second term. If bitcoin prices continue to climb, perhaps aided by the ally in the White House, the president's most faithful followers may start bidding up shares again, potentially adding hundreds of millions, or even billions, to Trump's fortune.","{'href': 'https://www.forbes.com', 'title': 'Forbes'}","cryptocurrency"

Cryptocurrency picked up more momentum in payments Thursday as C1 Fund Inc. bought shares in Ripple Inc. C1, which focuses on digital assets and blockchain technology, did not announce the extent of the investment or other financial terms.



Ripple is well-known in payments for its XRP ledger, a decentralized blockchain aimed at processing payments fast and at low cost. For settlement, Ripple relies on its RLUSD stablecoin. “Ripple's technology and international reach fit directly with our strategy to support core infrastructure and institutional progress in blockchain finance,” said Elliot Han, chief investment officer at C1 Fund Inc., in a statement.
C1, based in Palo Alto, Calif., concentrates on investments in companies involved in increasing adoption of digital assets.




Ripple has been keen to keep crypto transaction processing at a low cost to users. It created the XRP ledger in 2012 with a view toward fast settlement while processing as many as 1,500 transactions per second, with fees in fractions of a penny per transaction.



In related news, BIT Mining Ltd., a company that provides technology for cryptocurrency processing, said it is changing its name to SOLAI Ltd. The change represents a shift in focus at the company from investing in cryptocurrency mining to technology incorporating artificial intelligence for blockchain processing, the company says.



 “We see the next wave of innovation emerging where intelligent systems connect with decentralized infrastructure — enabling faster, safer, and more efficient exchange of information and value,” says Bo Yu, chairman of BIT Mining, in a statement.

Oops, something went wrong

Luxor Technology Corporation, a provider of Bitcoin mining software and financial services, announced the launch of its new energy business, Luxor Energy. The new division aims to provide a full suite of energy management services to Bitcoin mining operations, including a Retail Electricity Provider (REP) business and specialized solutions for grid participation.

The move by Luxor, which already manages over one gigawatt of Bitcoin mining hardware through its LuxOS firmware, positions the company to become a more vertically integrated service provider in the energy-intensive digital asset sector.

Luxor Energy will offer services that include support for Demand Response, Ancillary Services, and Peak Avoidance programs. These services allow power-hungry Bitcoin mines to quickly curtail their energy consumption during periods of high demand on the electric grid, a capability increasingly valued by grid operators like the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT).

Bitcoin mining facilities, due to their flexible and interruptible load, have become significant participants in these programs, helping to stabilize grids that are experiencing growing strain from extreme weather and the transition to renewable energy sources. This development is particularly relevant in markets like Texas, which has seen a boom in crypto mining but also faces persistent grid reliability challenges.

Luxor Energy's retail electricity provider service is designed to accept collateral in Bitcoin and will offer reduced collateral requirements for users of the Luxor Pool. The company is also developing an automated system to pay client energy bills, netting them against their mining pool balance, according to a company press release.

A core offering of the new division is Intelligent Mining, a proprietary system that continuously adjusts mining machine performance for optimal profitability. The system integrates the company's dispatch signal with real-time data on hashrate and power prices, which is then fed into its LuxOS firmware.

The company stated that field results from operations in ERCOT's West Texas region have demonstrated an 8–14 percent improvement in profitability compared to legacy binary mining methods, where machines are either fully on or fully off.

Matt Williams, Luxor's Head of Financial Services, noted the importance of energy procurement in the sector. ""Energy is the most critical component for data centers, and our new Energy business will supercharge mining operations,"" Williams said.

By providing end-to-end energy and software management, Luxor is capitalizing on the ongoing trend where efficient power management and grid participation are as critical to a miner's bottom line as hardware efficiency. This expansion reflects a broader industry focus on mitigating regulatory concerns over high energy use by presenting miners as flexible grid resources.

A subsidiary of Dominari Holdings (DOMH), the investment firm with ties to President Donald Trump's sons, Eric and Donald Jr., is teaming up with Bitcoin programmability project Hemi to progress its digital asset treasury and exchange-traded fund (ETF) plans.

Broker-dealer Dominari Securities and Hemi, which is backed by veteran Bitcoin developer Jeff Garzik, teamed up to develop a digital asset treasury and ETF platform, according to an emailed announcement on Friday.

Dominari Holdings is located in the Trump Tower in New York City and counts Eric and Donald Trump Jr. among its investors. They also sit on its board of advisors. In March, the company took a different twist on the method of adopting bitcoin BTC$118,142.03 as a treasury asset, by committing $2 billion to buy shares in BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), the largest spot bitcoin ETF on the market.

The joint venture between Dominari and Hemi will allow institutions to invest in BTC-centric markets via the HEMI token. 

As part of the joint venture American Ventures LLC, of which Dominari is a member, made an undisclosed investment in the Hemispheres Foundation, the principal stewards of the Hemi project. 

Hemi's goal is to transform the possibilities for decentralized finance (DeFi) on Bitcoin by unifying it with Ethereum into a single ""supernetwork"". It raised $15 million in funding to expand its ecosystem in August. 

Alongside competitors like Lombard, with liquid staking token LBTC, and BOB, a hybrid chain built atop Bitcoin and Ethereum, Hemi is building infrastructure to make Bitcoin more compatible with DeFi, thus harnessing its $2.4 trillion market cap for the betterment of the wider digital asset industry.

Bitcoin's BTC$118,142.03 price swoon is marked by a veteran trader placing a bearish bet worth millions of dollars.

A bitcoin “OG” placed a leveraged short of 3,600 BTC, valued at $438 million, on the decentralized exchange Hyperliquid during overnight trading, as BTC's spot price briefly dipped below $120,000, according to blockchain analyst LookOnChain.

The liquidation price for the short trade is $139,900. In other words, this is the level at which the position will encounter a margin shortage and risk being forcibly closed by the exchange.

The term ""OG"" (Original Gangster) refers to an entity involved in the bitcoin market since its early days, often regarded as a long-term holder.

Notably, this OG sold 3,000 BTC in the spot market earlier this week. A month ago, the entity also sold 35,991 BTC to diversify into ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.

Bitcoin changed hands at $121,700, showing a slight recovery from overnight lows, according to CoinDesk data. While the OG whale shorted BTC, the overall market sentiment remains bullish, as reflected by positive funding rates sourced from Velo.

At the time of writing, the annualized perpetual funding rates for BTC were around 5%, indicating a bullish bias but nothing unusual.

 Democratic senators have been criticized for pitching a counter-proposal to the market structure bill that could effectively “kill DeFi.” 

Despite previously supporting a crypto market structure bill, several Democratic US senators have reportedly introduced a counter-proposal that could see decentralized finance protocols placed on a “restricted list” if deemed too risky. 

This move, among others they proposed, could “kill DeFi” or move it offshore from the US, according to critics. 

The Senate Banking Committee Democrats sent a proposal to the committee's Republicans on Thursday seeking to impose Know Your Customer rules on the frontends of crypto apps — including non-custodial wallets — and to strip protections from crypto developers, Punchbowl News reported on Thursday.

Crypto lawyer Jake Chervinsky said the counter-proposal could kill any chance of establishing a crypto market structure framework, noting that it could undermine the bipartisan support the CLARITY Act had already secured in the House in July, where it passed 294-134. 

“It's so bad. It doesn't regulate crypto, it bans crypto,” Chervinsky said, pointing to a suggested measure permitting the Treasury Department to create a “restricted list” for DeFi protocols it considers too risky. 

Any US national who uses those protocols and makes “recurring revenues” from them may also face punishment, said the founder and president of MetaLeX Labs, Gabriel Shapiro.

Chervinsky said the proposal seemed less like a regulatory framework and more like an “unprecedented, unconstitutional government takeover of an entire industry.”

The Democrats behind the counter-proposal include Mark Warner, Ruben Gallego, Andy Kim, Reverend Raphael Warnock, Angela Alsobrooks and Lisa Blunt Rochester, according to Chervinsky. 

The move, which comes amid a government shutdown, could be seen as reversing regulatory momentum built under the Trump administration, which has pledged to make the United States the “crypto capital of the world.”

It also clashes with aspects of the Senate Banking Committee's Responsible Financial Innovation Act draft on Sept. 9, a bipartisan effort that seeks to assign the Commodity Futures Trading Commission oversight of spot markets and reduce the Securities and Exchange Commission's overreach. 

RFIA also seeks to offer more robust protections to crypto developers to ensure they can build without fear of being prosecuted, amid the Tornado Cash and Samourai Wallet devs in recent months.

Digital Chamber's vice president of government and policy affairs, Zunera Mazhar, described the measures as heavy-handed and ineffective, adding that they risk pushing innovation offshore instead of addressing the real risks involved.

Related: Democrats press bank regulator on Trump stablecoin conflicts

Instead, Mazhar said the Democrats should target the “real chokepoints” where illicit finance occurs with a risk-based approach that doesn't crush innovation and create regulatory uncertainty.

Blockchain Association CEO Summer Mersinger agreed with Mazhar's take, adding that the proposal would make compliance impossible for industry players in the US.

 Monero's “Fluorine Fermi” update enhances privacy by fighting nodes that try to link user IP addresses to their transactions. 

Privacy blockchain Monero has rolled out a new client update to provide users with greater security against “spy nodes” on the network. The “Fluorine Fermi” software update was announced via X on Thursday, with the team stating it is “a highly recommended release.”

The term “spy nodes” is part of the vernacular used in the Monero community. It refers to malicious nodes, groups of nodes, or botnets that have the potential to calculate and match IP addresses to transactions conducted on the network. 

The changes focus on using an improved peer selection algorithm that avoids connecting to the large subnets of IP addresses favored by “spy nodes,” with users instead pushed to connect to what are deemed safer nodes. The update also includes some general reliability and stability fixes.

Fluorine Fermi provides another tool for users to protect their privacy. 

Given that spy nodes threaten the privacy of users in contrast to the main aim of the project, the community has worked hard to find workarounds, establish safety practices, promote self-node operation and utilize software to provide a shield against malicious nodes on Monero. 

Related: Privacy is ‘constant battle' between blockchain stakeholders and state

One such idea, proposed by the Monero Research Lab in late 2024, is to enable node operators to create a ban list of all IP addresses suspected of being spy nodes, thereby avoiding connections to them. However, this is not seen as a foolproof or fully sustainable tactic, as malicious node operators could just go on and set up new spy IP addresses if they need to. 

Another tool the community promotes is the use of Dandelion++, software designed to prevent malicious actors from linking IP addresses to transactions.  

Monero privacy issues were, in part, brought into the spotlight via a leaked Chainalysis video that appeared in September 2024. 

Cointelegraph was supplied with the video by an anonymous source, which claimed that Chainalysis was able to track transactions back to 2021 via its own “malicious” Monero nodes.

How to See the Earth and Moon from Mars

If you pick the right time, our home world and our moon could be easily visible from the Red Planet

By Phil Plait edited by Lee Billings

A view of the Earth-moon system, as captured by the European Space Agency's Mars Express spacecraft from a distance of 8 million kilometers on July 3, 2003.

As an astronomer studying the universe beyond Earth, I'm fond of “outside the box” views almost by default. But one of my favorites is whenever a spacecraft takes a snapshot of our home world and the moon from a great distance. Stuck here on the planet's surface, our mundane perspective is rarely challenged, so seeing both our world and its lone natural satellite side by side is a rare gift, a jolt to our cosmic complacence.

Sometimes the image shows both objects in detail, as the DSCOVR satellite did in 2015. Sometimes the Earth and moon are fuzzy and pixelated, like they were in a shot from 2003 by the European Space Agency's Mars Express mission, giving some sense of distance. More often they're just dots, points of light that are almost lost among the stars, as the Psyche mission saw from 290 million kilometers away in July 2025. The smaller we appear in these images, the easier it is to appreciate just how deep space is and how we are truly afloat on an ocean of black.

Another, even rarer view is to see our planet from the surface of another world—something, in fact, that first occurred only in 2004, when NASA's Spirit rover on Mars snapped an image of Earth in that alien sky. In the black-and-white shot Earth is hanging in the pearly glow of the Martian twilight, the hilly horizon silhouetted at the bottom. It's an image that almost begs us to wonder how it would feel to stand there on the Red Planet and see it for ourselves. What would it look like to our eyes? Could we also see the moon next to our blue world?

Earth appears as a scarcely visible dot in this first-of-its-kind image of our home planet, as seen by NASA's Spirit rover from the surface of Mars on March 8, 2004.

As usual when you're looking at the sky, what you see depends on when you're looking. Earth and Mars both orbit the sun at different rates, and that changes the perspective drastically. At their absolute closest—when they're on the same side of the sun—Mars and Earth are about 55 million km apart. When they're on opposite sides, though, that distance stretches to 400 million km!

This influences two crucial factors in viewing Earth and the moon as a pair in the Martian sky: how far apart they appear, and how bright they are.

You'd think Earth and the moon would be brightest when they're closest to Mars because brightness depends on distance. But this isn't the case! When the two planets are closest together, they're on the same side of the sun, putting Earth between Mars and the sun. This means that, from Mars, you'd be looking at Earth's unilluminated night side. That's dark, obviously, making Earth appear dim.

When Earth is opposite Mars from the sun, it will appear full because you're looking directly on the daylit side. But mitigating this is its far greater distance, plus the fact that Earth appears much smaller in the sky. So, irritatingly, when it's closest to Mars, it's faint, and when it's farthest from Mars, it's also faint!

There is a happy medium, however. As Earth orbits the sun, from Mars, it will appear to go through phases, much like the moon does as seen from Earth. This phasing depends on the viewing geometry: Earth is full on the opposite side of the sun and “new” (like the dark new moon) when it's between Mars and the sun. In between these two extremes our planet will appear as a crescent or half full or gibbous (between half and full) over the course of that orbit. Note that the moon will show the same phase as Earth; because we're looking from Mars, the angle between Earth and the sun is essentially the same as it is for the moon and the sun, so their phases are identical.

Surprisingly, Earth will appear brightest when in its crescent phase. Even though it appears slimmer, this happens when the crescent Earth is closer to Mars, making it appear bigger in the sky. The size on the sky of the illuminated portion you see is actually bigger than when it's full, making it proportionally brighter.

This is exactly the same situation we see from Earth when we look at Venus in the sky. Venus also undergoes phases and appears brightest to us when it's a fat crescent. This means the best time from Mars to see Earth and the moon together is a few weeks after their closest approach. They'll be brighter and still well-separated in the sky.

How bright will they be? From Mars, at this time, Earth will be at a magnitude of about –1 or –2 at best, which is about as bright as Jupiter appears in Earth's night sky. That's not as flashy as Venus but still quite brilliant and easy to spot. The moon will be a “star” nearby at a magnitude of roughly 2 or 3, about the same apparent brightness as the stars in the Big Dipper. (The brighter a celestial object, the lower its magnitude number, in the reverse-logarithmic scale used by astronomers.)

But brightness isn't all there is to consider here. If you want to see both Earth and the moon, they must be separated enough in the sky to be discerned individually. If they're too close together, the human eye will blur them together into a single object. How far apart they appear in the sky depends on their distance from Mars, of course—the closer they are to Mars, the farther apart they'll be—but it also depends on where the moon is in its orbit as seen from Mars; as it circles around Earth, their separation will appear to change as well. But let's assume we have good luck and happen to see them as geometrically far apart as possible.

When the pair is closest to Mars, at maximum, Earth and the moon will be just under half a degree apart in the sky (astronomers measure size on the sky in degrees, where there are 90 degrees from the horizon to the zenith). That's easily enough to see them as two distinct objects, even with the brightness difference. When they're on the opposite side of the sun, they're only an eighth that distance apart, making them much more difficult to distinguish. If we choose the time when they appear brightest, as thick crescents, they'll be separated by about one third of a degree—far enough apart to see individually. There's still one more issue, however.

Earth is about four times wider than the moon and far shinier; our surface and cloudy air reflect sunlight about three times better than the moon's gray surface. Altogether, this means Earth is roughly 50 times brighter than the moon when seen from a distance. This makes contrast a problem; they have to be far enough apart in the sky that the moon isn't lost in Earth's glare!

Putting all this together, if the orbital geometries all align just so, I find that the moon and Earth will indeed be visible in the Martian sky as two separate objects, though you might have to squint a bit to see the much fainter moon. If you have binoculars, you might be able to spot both the moon and Earth sporting the same phase. A telescope would reveal Earth's continents and oceans; in fact, Earth's brightness and even its color might change as the planet rotates or when you see a cloudy versus a clear day.

After all this, I have to wonder: When will one of us actually stand on the dusty surface of Mars and see Earth hanging in the gloaming near the horizon? And even further off: If they've been on Mars long enough, will they look at that gleaming beacon in the sky and still see it as home?

Babies Are Born with High Levels of Alzheimer's-Linked Proteins in Their Brains

Researchers hope the finding could point to new therapeutic approaches for the disease

By Robert Martone edited by Daisy Yuhas

Alzheimer's disease is characterized by certain key changes in the brain. Among them are the development of two kinds of protein deposits: clumps made up of amyloid beta and tangles of tau.

These changes can be identified in a few ways. Medical professionals and scientists can see the extent of these protein deposits in the brain using sophisticated and expensive neuroimaging. Another diagnostic option involves measuring amyloid beta and certain modified forms of tau in the cerebrospinal fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord, but collecting this fluid requires a lumbar puncture, which many people find too invasive.

A newly approved test measures levels of amyloid beta and pTau217, an altered version of tau that is one of the markers of Alzheimer's disease, in a blood sample. From the time this particular marker was identified, researchers realized it could help detect “preclinical Alzheimer's disease,” that is, the presence of amyloid beta brain pathology prior to any symptoms. But in a twist, scientists are finding this protein marker of neurodegeneration in unexpected places.

If you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today.

A new study in the journal Brain Communications reports that pTau217 is elevated among healthy newborns. In fact, these infants had higher levels than people with Alzheimer's disease. This discovery indicates that the protein changes that characterize this devastating disorder are reversible in certain circumstances—hinting at new possibilities for treatment.

Normal tau protein is involved in binding and stabilizing the network of proteins that give a neuron its structure. Tau molecules can attach to phosphate groups (molecules made up of oxygen and phosphorus) through a process called phosphorylation. When that happens, the neuronal structure that tau supports can destabilize in ways that contribute to the formation of tangles. In fact, pTau217 is a tau molecule that has undergone phosphorylation at a position that scientists call 217.

In the new study, an international research team measured levels of pTau217 in blood samples from two groups of healthy newborns and compared them with levels found in teenagers, adults aged 18 to 25 and seniors aged 70 to 77. None of these study participants reported any cognitive difficulties or showed any impairments when tested. Although there were no significant differences in the modified tau levels between the teenage and adult subjects, the newborns had pTau217 levels that were more than five times higher than those of the older groups.

The research team also tested blood samples from “extremely preterm” infants, meaning babies born before 28 weeks of gestation, following up with the infants over the course of 40 weeks. In many cases these children had even higher levels of blood pTau217 than babies born at the expected delivery date. Levels of pTau217 appeared to decrease as both preterm infants grew older and by about 20 weeks after birth reached the levels found among healthy young adults.

To compare infants with people with Alzheimer's disease, the researchers tested an additional cohort for pTau217. Some people in this group had Alzheimer's dementia, others had what is called mild cognitive impairment of the Alzheimer's type (which is sometimes a precursor to the disease) while another group with no evidence of dementia or cognitive decline served as a control. All the diagnoses in this set of participants were confirmed with the invasive lumbar procedure and cognitive testing. The researchers found that people with either mild cognitive impairment or dementia had pTau217 levels that were higher than otherwise healthy adults but were still less than half of what was found among healthy newborns.

In addition, the team discovered that plasma total tau—not just the modified pTau217 form—was elevated in newborns. This is consistent with earlier studies showing high levels of total tau in fetal brains with peak levels at around four to five months of gestation and then decreasing two-foldby the sixth month after birth.

Assessments of other proteins provided nuance. For example, the researchers also found lower levels of amyloid beta in blood samples from healthy newborns than in older study participants. And, curiously, a protein called neurofilament light chain, often linked to brain injury, was elevated in newborns compared with teens and adults—but not as high as what was found in elderly people. That last finding in babies may be explained by developmental processes in the newborn brain and by cranial compression during birth which, especially in the case of vaginal delivery, leads to increased levels of that protein.

These findings are remarkable given the close association between pTau217 and the amyloid beta pathology of Alzheimer's disease. Researchers have also seen elevated pTau217 in people with a few rare neurological diseases, including Creutzfeld-Jakob disease, Niemann-Pick disease type C and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (better known as Lou Gehrig's disease or ALS). In addition, a specific mutation in the tau gene increases pTau217 levels. Although this is the first time elevations of the Alzheimer's disease marker pTau217 have been observed in newborns, extensive phosphorylation of tau has previously been reported in the developing brain. Significantly, there is no evidence that the same tangles arise in a fetus or newborn despite the occurrence of similarly modified tau proteins.

In addition to modifications of the Tau protein such as phosphorylation, there are also several known forms of the molecule (isoforms) which differ from one another by the inclusion or exclusion of specific stretches of protein sequence. The adult brain typically has six isoforms of tau, but the fetus has a distinct fetal isoform that may support important processes during development. It's possible fetal tau is somehow protective or resilient in ways that allow baby brains to avoid the formation of tangles linked to toxic outcomes in older adults.Thisstudy cannot fully determine that point, however, in part because the methods used do not discriminate between fetal tau and other isoforms—more research will be needed to explore that possibility.

And there are still other circumstances where the hyperphosphorylation of tau is reversed. Research with species such as the ground squirrel shows tau hyperphosphorylation occurs in the brain in torpor during hibernation and then reverses when the animals wake up. A more intrepid experiment found similar changes in hibernating black bears. The researchers speculated that phosphorylation in this context may be protective, essentially limiting cellular activity during periods of metabolic stress.

In a separate research avenue, scientists have found that anesthesia in mice can induce tau phosphorylation through mechanisms at least partially related to hypothermia. This brain change is generally reversible unless the mice undergo repeated anesthesia—something that may itself increase the risk for Alzheimer's dementia in humans.

The new research highlights the challenges in understanding Alzheimer's biology. A newborn child and a 60-year-old adult who is noticing forgetfulness or disorientation may both test positive for pTau217, but no one will conclude that the baby has Alzheimer's disease. Yet there is robust debate over whether or not it makes sense to define Alzheimer's disease in ways that emphasize these protein markers in adults, as opposed to leaning principally on clinical evaluation for diagnosis. The new finding doesn't settle this debate, but it does suggest that continued study of tau and the processes that reverse its buildup may reveal insights that Alzheimer's interventions can harness.

New Clues Suggest San Andreas and Cascadia Faults May Produce Synchronized Earthquakes

Samples from the seafloor reveal evidence of several earthquakes along the West Coast's two major fault zones happening in quick succession over the past 3,000 years

The West Coast of North America is a geologically tumultuous zone where tectonic plates collide, subducting under and scraping past one another. Over the eons, this activity has regularly caused major earthquakes. New research reveals that some of these seismic events may have happened in sync along the coast's two major faults: the San Andreas Fault and the Cascadia Subduction Zone.

A team of researchers analyzed a trove of seafloor sediment from the region where the faults meet off the coast of northern California. The researchers' findings, published recently in Geosphere, reveal that the fault systems have produced several synchronized earthquakes over the past 3,000 years.

Chris Goldfinger, an Oregon State University marine geologist and lead author of the new paper, compares the process to tuning an analog radio, in which the device's oscillators are synced up to convert incoming signals. “When you tune an old radio, you're essentially causing one oscillator to vibrate at the same frequency as the other one,” he says. “When these faults synchronize, one fault could tune up the other and cause earthquakes in pairs.”

The Cascadia Subduction Zone, where the Juan de Fuca and Gorda plates slide underneath the North American Plate, stretches all the way from Vancouver Island to northern California to meet the San Andreas Fault. That fault extends south for 750 miles along a boundary where the North American and Pacific plates slide past each other.

Since 1999 Goldfinger and his team have been drilling into the seafloor at this tectonic crossroads, known as the Mendocino Triple Junction, to pull up cores that show a cross section of the sediments that have built up there. For the new study, the researchers examined more than 130 sediment cores that record roughly 3,000 years of geological history. Many of the cores contained layered sediments known as turbidites, which are created by marine landslides that move large amounts of material around the ocean floor. Many of these landslides are caused by earthquakes, making turbidite layers a useful proxy for pinpointing past seismic events.

Most turbidites have coarser sediment layers at the bottom and finer siltlike sediment at the top, similar to what you get when you swirl a bucket of sand at the beach. But the turbidites in samples from the Mendocino Triple Junction “seem to be upside down with all the sand at the top,” Goldfinger says. “And as far as we know, gravity hasn't changed.”

As they investigated the puzzling features, Goldfinger realized the cores contained two turbidites stacked on top of each other. This provides evidence of two separate earthquake events happening in quick succession—as the first earthquake was settling a layer of silt over the ocean floor, a second shock sent another avalanche of sand over top.

Some of the layered turbidites are so closely spaced that these events could have happened anywhere from within minutes to decades of each other. Analysis of the ages of shells in the sediments suggest there were at least eight large earthquakes along the San Andreas Fault over the past 3,000 years that occurred within decades of significant quakes along the Cascadia Subduction Zone.

Meng Wei, a marine geologist and geophysicist at the University of Rhode Island, says the idea that fault systems near each other could synchronize has been floating around for years and has been seen at smaller fault boundaries over short periods. But he says the new paper is impressive for illustrating that the phenomenon is possible with larger fault systems over thousands of years.

Though the Cascadia and San Andreas systems have apparently been linked for millennia, there seems to be some variability when it comes to the timing between successive quakes. Wei, who was not involved in the new study, says it is possible that the two faults could produce shaking within a few years of each other at some point in the future, but more research is needed to gauge how one quake triggers another. “Even if these two faults are synchronized, the time interval between earthquakes can still be decades,” he adds.

The two systems are also not in perfect sync. The team discovered that some temblors, including the 1906 earthquake that devastated San Francisco, were one-off events that were caused exclusively by movements along the northern San Andreas Fault.

But if the two fault systems do end up producing major earthquakes in quick succession, it could cause major disasters all along the West Coast of North America. An initial quake along the Cascadia Subduction Zone would draw recovery resources up to the Pacific Northwest, which would make responding to a subsequent San Andreas earthquake difficult.

Goldfinger hopes the new work will help influence seismic hazard planning for communities near both fault systems. “In the paper we stuck to the geology instead of dwelling on the potential doom and gloom,” he says. “But it's pretty clear that if something like this happened—and we think the evidence for it is strong—we need to be prepared.”

What It's like to Be the President's Doctor

A former White House physician reveals the medical realities of caring for the president of the U.S.

Rachel Feltman: For Scientific American's Science Quickly, I'm Rachel Feltman.

Being a doctor is challenging enough, but imagine having a patient whose health has direct implications for national security and global politics. Presidential physicians face unique medical challenges, from preparing for gunshot wounds to managing the health care of someone with a grueling schedule. And then there's the question of transparency: How much should the public know about a president's health?

Jeffrey Kuhlman served as physician to the president from 2009 to 2013. He also held other medical roles at the White House, like Director of the White House Medical Unit, White House Physician and Senior Medical Officer for the Marine One squadron, for more than a decade before that. His recent book Transforming Presidential Healthcare offers a rare inside look at what it takes to keep commanders in chief healthy. He recently chatted with Scientific American associate editor Lauren Young. Here's their conversation.

If you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today.

Lauren Young: Tell me how you became a physician to the president. How does one find themselves in such an important medical role?

Jeffrey Kuhlman: Like many things in life it's being in the right place at the right time. I would say it probably started a decade earlier or two. I was a high school senior, March 30, 1981, and I heard on the radio, “Shots fired,” for President Reagan—his code sign was “Rawhide,” so: “Rawhide down”—and they had taken him to the hospital, to George Washington [University Hospital]. And that's where they treated him like a trauma patient instead of like a VIP and saved his life.

So that was that installation in the brain of, “Hey, there's actually doctors and nurses that take care of the president.” I didn't think much of that. I went to college, went to medical school—the Navy paid for my way. And I had hardship tours in Pearl Harbor and in London for Naval Forces Europe, and then I found myself being assigned to the president's helicopter squadron in Quantico, Virginia.

And President [Bill] Clinton, his second term, he was in a little trouble at home, so he spent lots of time going overseas, so I did 18 foreign trips that time. We take care of everyone that's on those trips. And that's when the White House physicians at the time were just extremely glad that I was taking care of everyone and said, “You're gonna work here,” so they actually sent me orders. So I was kind of in the right place at the right time with the right education, the right experience and, most importantly, a supportive family.

And one of the toughest things is getting the top-secret Yankee White clearance. And so that's—you have unimpeded access to the president and, with that, their schedule. You can be in a room alone with them with life-and-death medications. And getting that top-secret clearance—luckily, I've lived a pretty boring life, so I didn't get into trouble. I was privileged to take care of five and a half presidents, and about a decade later I wrote a book, recently out, Transforming Presidential Healthcare, and basically, it's ensuring continuity of the presidency to the commander in chief.

Young: Wow, what a journey. You mention that you've served five and a half—I think you said, right—five and a half presidents. Who's the half [laughs]?

Kuhlman: If you read the book Transforming Presidential Healthcare, it goes through the five. So it goes through: President Clinton—I got to the White House at the tail end of his presidency, in his last months. President Clinton, even though I just met with him a couple times for, like, a minute or two, he has a presence about him that, at that moment in time, he makes you feel like you're the most important person in the world, that he's focused on you. And then when I interacted with him 10 years later he remembers your name. He remembers what you talked about. He remembers, like, the family if you brought that up. And so he has that gift of connecting with people personally.

Then I was there for President George W. Bush. So he was president for eight years, and he's the one that gave me the nickname “Leno.” So he just liked to give people nicknames. I don't know if it's my monologues. Some people think it might be just how I'm built—my white hair or my protruding jaw. And it just stuck, that a lot of people wouldn't even know my name. They would just say, you know, “Doc Leno.” And it continued on with President [Barack] Obama.

So President George H. W. Bush, former president, he was around. I took care of him, like, at Camp David, Kennebunkport, Prairie Chapel Ranch, and he was the most gracious person I've ever met. And at Camp David he would come play volleyball with us, which is pretty good as an 80-year-old. And took care of him for a chronic problem, and a week later a handwritten letter came to my home address. So he was the third president.

President Obama, when he came into office he was 47; he was a youngster. Michelle Obama was 44. They had two school-aged kids. And President Obama kind of said, “I don't really need a doctor, but Michelle and the girls do, and so I'm going with you,” which I thought, you know, it's probably the highest compliment a father can give you. And then during that time Vice President [Joe] Biden was around, so that's who I'd call the fifth president.

And then also, when Hillary Clinton was first lady, we would take care of her. And when she was senator from New York, she would be taken care of by [the] Office of [the] Attending Physician of Congress. But then when she was secretary of state, during President Obama's first term; that's when I was around. She had some medical conditions on some of the foreign trips that we went on—she was often present—and so I rendered help to her. So that's who I count as the half president 'cause she came pretty close in the historic election of 2016.

Young: I was reading your book, Transforming Presidential Healthcare, and you give such a fascinating inside look at White House medicine, and you talk about, like, the costs, the considerations that go into the medical care of the president. A really interesting theme that seemed to come out of the book and, you know, your work is how the president's care is not, quote, unquote, “VIP care.” Can you elaborate a little bit on that?

Kuhlman: So what I found in life is, often, those that you think have the best access to care—Michael Jackson, Steve Jobs, you know, celebrities, rock stars, ultrahigh-net-worth individuals—they have horrible access to care. They often think that they're smarter. They don't have the time in their schedule. They have barriers that they put between them and others. And then they tend to be surrounded by sycophant doctors that just wanna please them. So I, I would say I would run away from VIP care, but the care that we tried to provide the president and the first family and the senior staff and, actually, anyone that works on the 18 acres is private, secure, that meets their schedule.

So the doctor's office has been there since about the early 1900s. The first full-time doctor was a Navy doctor, Presley Rixey, and he had taken care of the McKinley family. And he actually wasn't at Buffalo when a president was fatally shot there; he was tending to Mrs. [Ida] McKinley, who was invalid from a seizure disorder. So when Teddy Roosevelt came in he actually made Dr. Rixey full time: “You're gonna be the White House doctor.” And that's when they started calling it the White House, 'cause before that it was the Executive Mansion.

So that's basically what we try to do, is private, secure, and what I told each president is: “For me, no politics, no policy, just trusted medical advice. Luckily, if you are red or blue as a president, luckily, you're all the same inside, so I could take care of the biology.”

Young: So then what would you say are the major differences in serving the general public medically versus serving the president of the U.S.?

Kuhlman: So the major difference is the logistics around it. You know, the number-one threat to an adult is a out-of-hospital cardiac arrest; we know every day in the U.S. [roughly] 1,000 Americans drop dead. So if we can get an AED [automated external defibrillator] on them—it helps to have a trained individual but, more importantly, start defibrillating with equipment that works and that you've trained with. And so that's the number-one threat to a president of the U.S., so that's why the doctor is within two minutes at all times: every minute that you wait their survival drops by 10 percent. The second set of hands is a critical care nurse and he or she with equipment that, like, compliments the AED.

And then the other occupational hazard is gunshot wounds, knife stabbings. So in our history, if we've had, you know, 47 presidents, maybe there's 45 individuals of that 47, but four of them have been assassinated. So we are prepared anywhere in the world—the doctor and the nurse and a tactical medical officer—to basically do what I coined “care under fire,” and so it's: keep the blood in the body, and get to definitive care. So get to that level-one trauma center. Know where it is. Get there by any means possible. And then knowing, with Secret Service, they're gonna get us there, but we're gonna keep the blood in the body, we're gonna get to that trauma center, and then they're gonna save the president's life.

The other big difference: if you're not the president, you just call 911 ...

Young: Right.

Kuhlman: But 911 doesn't really work when you're traveling with the president.

The other thing that we are prepared for is—what I laid out in Transforming Presidential Healthcare is asymmetrical threats, so think about chemical, biologic attacks. So knowing how to prevent them, knowing how to diagnose them, knowing how to treat them.

And then if you get to the kind of the more routine: you know, they're human, so they're gonna have upset stomach or different basketball injuries that—maybe they get their lip cracked open or teeth broken or something.

Young: I know, too—and I'll just chime in for the audience—I know that you mentioned that basketball injury to the lip. I think that was President Obama. Is that right [laughs]?

Kuhlman: That was ...

Young: Yeah [laughs].

Kuhlman: So it was, actually, on Black Friday, the day after Thanksgiving, and I actually happened to be at the White House evaluating other family members of the first family. And at the time the Air Force doctor, Dr. [Jeffrey] Kueter, he was over covering President Obama, and he called me, and he had never called me from a site before, and I said, “Okay, what you got? What's the injury?” And so he told me a, a lacerated lip and wanted to know what he should do with him. And I said, “Bring him back here to the White House.”

And so they came back to the White House. He came right in. We evaluated the injuries and sewed 'em up and gave him the typical ice pack and anti-inflammatory pain medication. And I probably had 100 people contact me that day telling me why they were the experts in the world to sew up somebody's lip.

Young: [Laughs.]

Kuhlman: And luckily, we did it right; he later took his daughters to, I think, a Georgetown basketball game.

Young: I feel like you have to be ready for absolutely anything that gets thrown at you in this position. One thing you mentioned: you brought up age. How much of the public's concern around a political figure's age is actually warranted from a medical perspective?

Kuhlman: Well, I would state the obvious: age is the number-one risk factor for heart disease, it's the number-one risk factor for cancer, and it's the number-one risk factor for neurodegenerative conditions or cognitive decline.

So when I look back at history James Madison was 36 years old when he submitted his final draft of the Constitution; he was the lead author. And, you know, the first president, George Washington, he was considered an elder statesman, and he was president from age 57 to 65. And then when he left office he died a year and a half later. During the late 1700s very few of them lived to age 60. So when the Constitution was written it doesn't list any physical or mental qualifications to be president.

I think that age is important. We have a gerontocracy. We have the oldest person ever elected to be president as the current president, and he'll be 82 when he completes his second term. We have a senator who's 91. New York Times invited me to write an essay about neurocognitive assessment. It is a fact of science, it's not a political attack, that humans past the age of 60, [nearly] every single human starts to have cognitive decline—now, some people faster than others, but every single human past the age of 60 they start to have decline with memory, reasoning, speed of processing, spatial visualization. Those are the four parts of cognitive decline. The fifth one, vocabulary, is interesting; they actually stay the same or some actually increase a little bit 'cause you've just been around longer, so your vocabulary actually expands.

My opinion would be—President George W. Bush, he's probably the fittest president in history. He was in the top 2 percent [in] cardiovascular fitness. He could run three miles in [about] 18 and a half minutes during his first term. And when it was President Biden against former President Trump, he famously said, “I'm younger than both of them, and I'm too old for the job,” so he knows the physically demanding part of the job.

That's where we would benefit from neurocognitive assessment on a periodic basis. And maybe you don't release every result to the public, but you at least give it to the president, their family, the doctors taking care of them, so that you can see over time. The current president, who's 79, he would benefit from a neurocognitive assessment. And that's testing that does memory, reasoning, speed of processing, spatial visualization. So it just needs to be [a] more comprehensive assessment for these senior citizens that are in elected positions of great decision-making in the world.

Young: So when the president shares medical information with the public, what is your role as the physician in that process?

Kuhlman: What I always told each of the presidents is: “I will do my best to respect your personal privacy and your medical privacy.” For example, the annual physical: with President Obama we were at Martha's Vineyard the first year, and I said, “Hey, your physical's coming up. We're gonna do it to take advantage of you getting assessment of the proper medical [condition] of a 48-year-old male.” So we did his first colonoscopy and released that, but he said to me—we were standing by a golf cart, and he said, “I've learned: never lie to the American people; they're gonna find out the truth in the end anyway.”So that was the approach that we took.

Young: Mm-hmm.

Kuhlman: So I laid out, “Here are the things that we like to assess during your physical,” and the report that I wrote up, I did submit it to him and submitted it to the press secretary at the time, and they both read through it, and they did not change one word. And then same thing—I was involved with some of President Bush's, and neither of those presidents changed any words.

Young: Right. When is it beneficial for a president or, you know, any political leader, to be transparent about a medical diagnosis? On the one hand, I'm sure, you know, there's circumstances in which, you know, a leader opens up about a condition, it could bring positive awareness to it. On the flip side, it opens the person up to criticism. I'm curious what your thoughts are on that.

Kuhlman: I think it comes down to: Can you do the job? And so how I would assess that is: if you have an impairment—like you're hard of hearing; you have trouble seeing; maybe one of your body organs don't work; you have trouble walking, ambulating—we've had presidents throughout history that have had all of those things. We can make reasonable accommodation, and so then those don't become a disability to be president or to whatever office they're holding. The only impairment that we cannot compensate for is critical decision-making, so we've had history of people covering that up.

Young: Mm.

Kuhlman: So Woodrow Wilson had a massive stroke, he stayed up in his bedroom for months, and it was covered up by his wife, and it was covered up by his doctor, Cary Grayson, who had introduced the two of them. And so Cary Grayson was that young, dashing lieutenant doctor that all of a sudden became a rear admiral because of his friendship with President Wilson. So if you're the physician to the president and you cross the line into that personal friendship, you have a fiduciary duty not just to the president that you're taking care of but also to the American people. And some historians would say, you know, World War II grew out of some of the problems from that.

Young: And my last question for you: What advice would you give to the current physician to the president?

Kuhlman: I think you have a, a unique patient. There's a famous saying in history that, you know, if you have yourself as your doctor, then you have a fool not only as the doctor, but as the patient. So Dr. [Sean] Barbabella, I think if he sticks to “no politics, no policy, just trusted medical advice,” that will be what's best for the president and best for the American people.

Young: Great, thanks so much for being on the show.

Kuhlman: Good to be with you, Lauren, and good luck.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:popularmechanics.com","Scientists May Have Decoded the Mysterious Language of a Lost City","https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/archaeology/a68912227/mysterious-language-lost-city/","Fri, 10 Oct 2025 12:30:00 GMT","

The mystery of the now-ruined Mesoamerican city of Teotihuacan may rest in a lost language scholars said they've deciphered.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

Today, the ruins of the ancient Mexican city of Teotihuacan are a popular destination for tourists and archaeologists today, but 2,000 years ago, the site was called home by a population over 125,000. However, sifting through the pyramids of the once-great city hasn't brought much in the way of understanding those people who once lived there. 

But thanks to a pair of researchers from the University of Copenhagen, that may have just changed dramatically. Magnus Pharao Hansen and Christopher Helmke believe that the symbols on Teotihuacan's colorful murals and artifacts may be more than pretty pictures—they may be a writing system. Specifically, they might be an early form of the Uto-Aztecan language that eventually birthed the language of the Aztecs. 

“If we are right, it is not only remarkable that we have deciphered a writing system,” Helmke said in a statement. “It could have implications for our entire understanding of Mesoamerican cultures and, of course, point to a solution to the mystery surrounding the inhabitants of Teotihuacan.” 

Founded around 100 B.C.E., Teotihuacan served as a major cultural center in central Mexico for around 700 years, holding great cultural significance in ancient Mesoamerica. “There are many different cultures in Mexico,” Pharao Hansen said. “Some of them can be linked to specific archaeological cultures. But others are more uncertain. Teotihuacan is one of those places. We don't know what language they spoke or what later cultures they were linked to.” 

That link may be about to become more clear, according to a study published by the researchers in the journal Current Anthropology. “We propose that Teotihuacan writing shared basic principles with other Mesoamerican scribal traditions,” the authors wrote, arguing that Teotihuacan culture encoded a specific and identifiable language, “namely, an Uto-Aztecan language immediately ancestral to Nahuatl, Cora, and Huichol.”

That linguistic connection also indicates that the Aztec population arrived in the area northeast of present-day Mexico City much earlier than previously believed (rather than after the decline of Teotihuacan power).

The pair reconstructed an early version of Nahuatl to examine the similarities between the languages. “Otherwise, it would be a bit like trying to decipher the runes on the famous Danish runestone, such as the Jelling Stone, using modern Danish,” Helmke said. “That would be anachronistic. You have to try to read the text using a language that is closer in time and contemporary.”

Doing so certainly wasn't simple. The Teotihuacan written language uses a mix of logograms (where, for example, an image of a coyote directly translates to ‘coyote') and rebus (where the sounds of the objects must be merged to form a word—a more conceptual and difficult-to-decipher approach). To untangle the language, the pair said that they had to know how words would have sounded 2,000 years ago, requiring them to simultaneously reconstruct Nahuatl and the Teotihuacan language. 

“In Teotihuacan, you can still find pottery with text on it, and we know that more murals will turn up,” Pharao Hansen said. “It is clearly a limitation to our research that we do not have more texts. It would be great if we could find the same signs used in the same way in many more contexts. That would further support our hypothesis, but for now we have to work with the texts we have.” 

Making matters even trickier is that this is a first. “No one before us has used a language that fits the time period to decipher this written language,” Pharao Hansen said. “Nor has anyone been able to prove that certain logograms had a phonetic value that could be used in contexts other than the logogram's main meaning. In this way, we have created a method that can serve as a baseline for others to build on in order to expand their understanding of the texts.”

Wolves and dogs don't normally breed in the wild, largely because wolves are so territorial. But an exception has been found.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

There are wolves that look like dogs, and dogs that appear suspiciously like wolves. For most, this is just a symptom of the fact that dogs are descended from wolves, but for one animal recently found in the wild, its part-wolf part-dog nature is very real.

Wolves (canis lupus) and dogs (canis lupus familiaris) are thought to have  diverged sometime between 27,000 and 40,000 years ago, and the ancestor of domestic dogs is likely a long-extinct descendant of gray wolves. The two species are 99.9% genetically identical, and (unlike horses and donkeys) are able to produce fertile offspring if they interbreed because they—along with dogs, wolves, and related canids like dingoes and jackals—have chromosomes that can be divided evenly into pairs. 

Wolf-dog hybrids have been controversially bred, but are rare in the wild. Wolves only breed once a year, and even if they encounter a lost or feral dog during that time, they are so territorial that they are more likely to chase or even kill it than allow it into their domain for mating. Still, the fragments of dog ancestry found in more than half of Eurasian wolf genomes show that interbreeding has occurred on its own. The wild wolf-dog recently found lurking near Thessaloniki, in the north of Greece, is more evidence. 

The hybrid was accidentally discovered by Greek wildlife group Callisto during an effort to trap a rogue wolf in nearby Halkidiki. While there have been claims of wolf-dogs on the prowl in Europe, they (along with similar sightings in the U.S. and Central Asia) have mostly been based on looks alone, so any stray that looks even remotely like a wolf could have been identified as a hybrid. When Callisto conducted DNA tests on 50 wolf samples from the Greek mainland, however, they revealed this one individual to be 55% dog and 45% wolf. 

Callisto has been tracking the wolf population in Greece, which has been flourishing since the Bern Convention (whose purpose is to study and protect endangered large carnivores like wolves and bears) banned hunting wolves in 1983. At least three packs of around 31 wolves each roam the Mount Parnitha range right outside Athens, and after recently concluding a six-year study on the Greek wolf population, Callisto has determined a total population of 2,075 individuals. 

This hybrid creature is not the same phenomenon as Colossal's attempted de-extinction of the dire wolf—a species that has not walked the Earth in 10,000 years. The biotech company extracted DNA from ancient dire wolf samples and merged it with progenitor cells from existing gray wolves, which can differentiate into different types of tissues. Genes were edited to express every dire wolf trait possible, and the pups were born to surrogate domestic hound mothers. 

Some argue that the appearance of a wolf-dog hybrid in the wild is the result of the rising wolf population intermingling with the overflow of stray dogs in Greece. Over 3 million stray dogs and cats are estimated to wander the streets of the country, often relying on restaurant scraps for food. It is possible that one of these dogs ended up in wolf territory, mated with a wolf, and emerged unscathed, with the wolf-dog being the result of that encounter.

A 1.37-inch inscription could upend our understanding of the religion's spread.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

This story is a collaboration with Biography.com.

An 1,800-year-old silver amulet discovered buried in a Frankfurt, Germany grave, still next to the chin of the man who wore it, has 18 lines of text written in Latin on just 1.37 inches of silver foil. That could be enough to rewrite the known history of Christianity in the Roman Empire. 

The amulet—and the inscription—are the oldest evidence of Christianity found north of the Alps.

Every other link to reliable evidence of Christian life in the northern Alpine area of the Roman Empire is at least 50 years younger, all coming from the fourth century A.D. But the amulet, found in a grave dating between 230 and 270 A.D. and now known as “The Frankfurt Inscription,” was made to better decipher the inscription. 

“This extraordinary find affects many areas of research and will keep science busy for a long time,” Ina Hartwig, Frankfurt's head of culture and science, said in a translated statement. “This applies to archaeology as well as to religious studies, philology, and anthropology. Such a significant find here in Frankfurt is truly something extraordinary.”

The amulet was found in what was once the Roman city of Nida at an archaeological site outside of Frankfurt in 2018. During excavation of the area, crews uncovered an entire Roman cemetery wherein the plot designated as “grave 134,” a small silver amulet, known as a phylactery, was located right under the chin of the occupant's skeleton. He likely wore it around his neck and was buried with it.  

Following the find, the Archaeological Museum Frankfurt restored the silver amulet, which included a thin silver foil with an inscription, as seen by microscopic examinations and X-rays in 2019. The wafer-thin silver foil was too brittle to roll out. 

In May 2024, a breakthrough came when using a state-of-the-art computer tomograph at the Leibniz Center for Archaeology in Mainz. “The challenge in the analysis was that the silver sheet was rolled, but of course after around 1,800 years it was also crumpled and pressed,” Ivan Calandra, laboratory manager for imaging procedures at the center, said in a statement. “Using the CT, we were able to scan it in a very high resolution and create a 3D model.” The virtual object was then scanned piece by piece, slowly revealing the words, allowing experts to finally get a look at the inscribed text on the individual fragments from the scan.

But then came the puzzle work. Markus Scholz from Frankfurt's Goethe University was able to piece together the 18 lines. “Sometimes it took weeks, even months, until I had the next idea,” he said in a statement. “I called in experts from the history of theology, among others, and we approached the text together bit by bit and ultimately deciphered it.” Some edges were lost due to damage and some words remain open to discussion. The original inscription is entirely in Latin, unusual for a time that featured amulets written in Greek or Hebrew. 

The Frankfurt Silver Inscription, based on the most updated translation: 

Without a reference to any other faith besides Christianity, rare for amulets of this age, the purely Christian inscription not only shows the rise of Christianity to the north, but also the amulet owner's devotion. 

During the third century A.D., association with Christianity was still dangerous, and identifying as Christian came with great personal risk, especially as Roman emperor Nero punished Christians with death or even a date in the Colosseum. That was no matter for this man in Frankfurt who took his allegiance to Jesus Christ to his grave. 

The scientific study is bolstered by references never found so early, such as mention of Saint Titus, a student of the Apostle Paul, the invocation “holy, holy, holy!” which wasn't more common until the fourth century A.D., and the phrase “bend your knees,” which is a quote from Paul's letter to the Philippians. 

“The ‘Frankfurt Inscription' is a scientific sensation,” said Mike Josef, Frankfurt's mayor, in a statement. “As a result, the history of Christianity in Frankfurt and far beyond will have to be turned back by around 50 to 100 years. The first Christian find north of the Alps comes from our city. We can be proud of this, especially now, so close to Christmas.”

Androgenetic alopecia, also known as male pattern baldness or female pattern hair loss, is one of the most widespread causes of hair thinning in both men and women. While topical minoxidil is an approved therapy, its limited ability to dissolve in water and penetrate the skin reduces its effectiveness. Researchers reporting in Advanced Healthcare Materials have found that stevioside, a natural sweetener extracted from the Stevia plant, can help improve how well the drug is absorbed through the skin.

In tests using a mouse model of alopecia, a dissolvable patch containing both stevioside and minoxidil successfully stimulated hair follicles to re-enter the growth phase, which resulted in the development of new hair.

""Using stevioside to enhance minoxidil delivery represents a promising step toward more effective and natural treatments for hair loss, potentially benefiting millions worldwide,"" said co-corresponding author Lifeng Kang, PhD, of the University of Sydney, in Australia.

Androgenetic alopecia develops gradually over time and is influenced by both genetic and hormonal factors. The condition occurs when hair follicles become increasingly sensitive to dihydrotestosterone (DHT), a hormone derived from testosterone. This sensitivity causes the follicles to shrink, leading to shorter and finer strands of hair until growth eventually stops. Although the pattern and progression differ between men and women, the biological mechanism is similar.Currently, treatment options are limited, with minoxidil being one of the few widely approved topical therapies. Minoxidil works by widening blood vessels and increasing blood flow around hair follicles, which can extend the growth phase of the hair cycle and stimulate new strands to develop. However, because the drug does not easily pass through the outer layer of skin and dissolves poorly in water, its full potential is often not realized. Patients must apply it consistently for several months before seeing results, and even then, the response varies from person to person.This challenge has driven researchers to explore new ways of improving how minoxidil is delivered to the scalp. Enhancing the drug's skin permeability could make treatments more efficient, reduce application frequency, and possibly lower side effects related to overuse. The discovery that stevioside can act as a natural absorption enhancer offers a new direction for scientists seeking to improve both the safety and effectiveness of hair loss therapies.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Scientists discover brain circuit that can switch off chronic pain","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/10/251009033126.htm","Fri, 10 Oct 2025 10:18:12 GMT","

Pain may be unpleasant, but in most cases it plays a vital, even lifesaving, role. Short bursts of pain act as warning signals that protect us from harm. When you touch a hot pan, stub your toe, or bump your head, your nervous system instantly delivers an “Ow!” that prompts you to pull back before more damage occurs. The pain fades, the body heals, and you remember what not to do next time.Chronic pain, however, is an entirely different story. In this condition, the warning signal doesn't stop even after the injury has healed. For about 50 million people in the United States, pain becomes a constant, invisible companion that can persist for years or even decades. ""It's not just an injury that won't heal,"" explains neuroscientist at the University of Pennsylvania J. Nicholas Betley, ""it's a brain input that's become sensitized and hyperactive, and determining how to quiet that input could lead to better treatments.""

Betley, along with collaborators from the University of Pittsburgh and Scripps Research Institute, has discovered an important piece of the chronic pain puzzle. Their research points to a specific group of brainstem cells called Y1 receptor (Y1R)-expressing neurons, located in the lateral parabrachial nucleus (lPBN). These neurons are activated in persistent pain states, but they also process signals related to hunger, fear, and thirst. This suggests that the brain can adjust pain responses when other, more urgent needs demand attention.

The findings, published in Nature, indicate that relief may be possible because, as the researchers write, ""there are circuits in the brain that can reduce the activity of neurons that transmit the signal of pain.""

Tracking pain in the brain

Working with the Taylor lab at the University of Pittsburgh, Betley's team used calcium imaging to visualize neuron activity in real time in animal models of both short-term and long-term pain. They observed that Y1R neurons did not simply react to quick bursts of pain; instead, they kept firing steadily during prolonged pain, a phenomenon known as “tonic activity.”

Betley compares this to an engine left running even after you've parked the car. The pain signals continue to hum in the background even when physical recovery seems complete. This ongoing neural activity may explain why some people continue to feel pain long after an injury or surgery.

The research originated from an unexpected observation Betley made after joining Penn in 2015: hunger seemed to lessen chronic pain.

""From my own experience, I felt that when you're really hungry you'll do almost anything to get food,"" he says. ""When it came to chronic, lingering pain, hunger seemed to be more powerful than Advil at reducing pain.""

That insight inspired further investigation. Former graduate student Nitsan Goldstein found that other critical survival states—such as thirst and fear—can also suppress long-term pain. In collaboration with the Kennedy lab at Scripps, the team showed that the brain's parabrachial nucleus can filter sensory input to quiet pain when immediate survival takes priority.

""That told us the brain must have a built-in way of prioritizing urgent survival needs over pain, and we wanted to find the neurons responsible for that switch,"" says Goldstein.

A key part of that switch is neuropeptide Y (NPY), a signaling molecule that helps the brain juggle competing needs. When hunger or fear takes priority, NPY acts on Y1 receptors in the parabrachial nucleus to dampen ongoing pain signals.

""It's like the brain has this built-in override switch,"" Goldstein explains. ""If you're starving or facing a predator, you can't afford to be overwhelmed by lingering pain. Neurons activated by these other threats release NPY, and NPY quiets the pain signal so that other survival needs take precedence.""

A scattered signal

The researchers also characterized the molecular and anatomical identity of the Y1R neurons in the lPBN. They found that Y1Rneurons didn't form two tidy anatomical or molecular populations. Instead, these neurons were scattered across many other cell types.

""It's like looking at cars in a parking lot,"" Betley says. ""We expected all the Y1R neurons to be a cluster of yellow cars parked together, but here the Y1R neurons are like yellow paint distributed across red cars, blue cars, and green cars. We don't know exactly why, but we think this mosaic distribution may allow the brain to dampen different kinds of painful inputs across multiple circuits.""

Explorations of pain treatment

What excites Betley with this discovery is the further exploration of its potential to ""use Y1 neural activity as a biomarker for chronic pain, something drug developers and clinicians have long lacked,"" he says.

""Right now, patients may go to an orthopedist or a neurologist, and there is no clear injury. But they're still in pain,"" he says. ""What we're showing is that the problem may not be in the nerves at the site of injury, but in the brain circuit itself. If we can target these neurons, that opens up a whole new path for treatment.""

This research also suggests that behavioral interventions such as exercise, meditation, and cognitive behavioral therapy may influence how these brain circuits fire, just as hunger and fear did in the lab.

""We've shown that this circuit is flexible, it can be dialed up or down,"" he says. ""So, the future isn't just about designing a pill. It's also about asking how behavior, training, and lifestyle can change the way these neurons encode pain.""

Scientists at UBC Okanagan have discovered how plants create mitraphylline, a rare natural substance with potential anti-cancer properties.

Mitraphylline is part of a small family of plant-derived molecules known as spirooxindole alkaloids. These compounds feature unique, “twisted” ring-like chemical structures and are recognized for their strong biological effects, including anti-tumor and anti-inflammatory activity.

Until recently, researchers did not understand the precise molecular process plants use to form spirooxindoles. That changed in 2023 when Dr. Thu-Thuy Dang and her team in the Irving K. Barber Faculty of Science identified the first plant enzyme capable of twisting a molecule into the distinctive spiro shape.

Building on that milestone, doctoral student Tuan-Anh Nguyen led the next phase of research and uncovered two enzymes that work together: one determines the molecule's 3D arrangement, and the other completes the final twist that forms mitraphylline.

""This is similar to finding the missing links in an assembly line,"" says Dr. Dang, UBC Okanagan Principal's Research Chair in Natural Products Biotechnology. ""It answers a long-standing question about how nature builds these complex molecules and gives us a new way to replicate that process.""

Because natural compounds often exist in only tiny quantities, they can be difficult and expensive to produce in the laboratory. Mitraphylline is one such compound, found in trace amounts in tropical trees like Mitragyna (kratom) and Uncaria (cat's claw), both members of the coffee family.By identifying the enzymes responsible for assembling and shaping mitraphylline, the researchers have established a framework for producing this and related compounds more efficiently and sustainably.

""With this discovery, we have a green chemistry approach to accessing compounds with enormous pharmaceutical value,"" says Nguyen. ""This is a result of UBC Okanagan's research environment, where students and faculty work closely to solve problems with global reach.""

""Being part of the team that uncovered the enzymes behind spirooxindole compounds has been amazing,"" Nguyen adds. ""UBC Okanagan's mentorship and support made this possible, and I'm excited to keep growing as a researcher here in Canada.""

The project is the result of collaboration between Dr. Dang's lab at UBC Okanagan and Dr. Satya Nadakuduti's team at the University of Florida.

The work was supported by Canada's Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council's Alliance International Collaboration program, the Canada Foundation for Innovation, and the Michael Smith Health Research BC Scholar Program. Support also came from the United States Department of Agriculture's National Institute of Food and Agriculture.

""We are proud of this discovery coming from UBC Okanagan. Plants are fantastic natural chemists,"" she says. ""Our next steps will focus on adapting their molecular tools to create a wider range of therapeutic compounds.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Why GPS fails in cities. And how it was brilliantly fixed","http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/10/251009033124.htm","Fri, 10 Oct 2025 07:24:11 GMT","

Most of us rarely question the accuracy of the GPS dot that shows our location on a map.

Yet when visiting a new city and using our phone to navigate, it can seem as if we are jumping from one spot to another, even though we are walking steadily along the same sidewalk.

""Cities are brutal for satellite navigation,"" explained Ardeshir Mohamadi.

Mohamadi, a doctoral fellow at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU), is researching how to make affordable GPS receivers (like those found in smartphones and fitness watches) much more precise without depending on expensive external correction services.

High accuracy is especially vital for vehicles that drive themselves - autonomous or self-driving cars.

Urban canyons

Mohamadi and his team at NTNU have developed a new system that allows autonomous vehicles to navigate safely through dense city environments.

""In cities, glass and concrete make satellite signals bounce back and forth. Tall buildings block the view, and what works perfectly on an open motorway is not so good when you enter a built-up area,"" said Mohamadi.

When GPS signals reflect off buildings, they take longer to reach the receiver. This delay throws off the calculation of distance to the satellites, which makes the reported position inaccurate.

Such complex urban environments are known as 'urban canyons'. It is similar to being at the bottom of a deep gorge, where signals reach you only after multiple reflections from the walls.

""For autonomous vehicles, this makes the difference between confident, safe behavior and hesitant, unreliable driving. That is why we developed SmartNav, a type of positioning technology designed for 'urban canyons',"" explained Mohamadi.

Almost down to the centimetrt

Not only are the satellite signals disrupted down between the tall buildings, but the signals that are correct do not have sufficient precision.

In order to solve this problem, the researchers have combined several different technologies to correct the signal. The result is a computer program that can be integrated into the navigation system of autonomous vehicles.

To achieve this, they received help from a new Google service, but before we go any further, it might be helpful to know how GPS works:

GPS - the Global Positioning System - comprises many small satellites orbiting the Earth. The satellites send out signals using radio waves, which are received by a GPS receiver. When the receiver receives these signals from at least four satellites, it is able to calculate its position.

The signal consists of a message with a code indicating the satellite's position and the exact time the signal was transmitted - like a text message from the satellite.

Replacing the code with the wave

It is this code that often becomes incorrect when the signal bounces around between buildings in a city. The first solution the NTNU researchers studied was dropping the code altogether. Instead, information about the radio wave can be used.

Is the wave traveling upwards or downwards when it reaches the receiver? This is called the carrier phase of the wave.

""Using only the carrier phase can provide very high accuracy, but it takes time, which is not very practical when the receiver is moving,"" said Mohamadi.

The problem is that you have to stay still until the calculation is good enough - not just a microsecond, but for several minutes.

However, there are other ways to improve a GPS signal. The user can use a service that corrects the signal using base stations called RTK (Real Time Kinetics).

RTK works fine as long as the user is in the vicinity of one of these stations. This solution, however, is expensive and intended for professional users.

An alternative approach is PPP-RTK (Precise Point Positioning - Real-Time Kinematic), which combines precise corrections with satellite signals. The European Galileo system now supports this by broadcasting its corrections free of charge.

But there is even more help available.

Google and the wrong-side-of-the-street problem

While the researchers in Trondheim were working on finding better solutions, Google launched a new service for its Android customers.

Imagine you are planning a holiday to, say, London. You open Google Maps on your tablet. You then enter the address of your hotel and you can immediately zoom in on the street environment, study the hotel's façade and the height of the surrounding buildings.

Google now has these types of 3D models of buildings in almost 4000 cities around the world. The company is using these models to predict how satellite signals will be reflected between the buildings. This is how they will solve the problem of it appearing as if you are walking on the wrong side of the road when using the map app, for example when trying to find your way back to your hotel.

""They combine data from sensors, Wi-Fi, mobile networks and 3D building models to produce smooth position estimates that can withstand errors caused by reflections,"" Mohamadi said.

Precision you can rely on

The researchers were now able to combine all these different correction systems with algorithms they had developed themselves. When they tested it in the streets of Trondheim, they achieved an accuracy that was better than ten centimeters 90 percent of the time.

The researchers say this provides precision that can be relied upon in cities.

The use of PPP-RTK will also make the technology accessible to the general public because it is a relatively affordable service.

""PPP-RTK reduces the need for dense networks of local base stations and expensive subscriptions, enabling cheap, large-scale implementation on mass-market receivers,"" concluded Mohamadi.

A gene-editing approach called prime editing could one day help treat many illnesses by turning faulty genes into healthy ones. However, the technique sometimes introduces small mistakes into DNA, which can occasionally be harmful.

Researchers at MIT have now discovered a way to significantly reduce these errors by altering the key proteins that drive the editing process. They believe this improvement could make gene therapy safer and more practical for treating a wide range of diseases.

""This paper outlines a new approach to doing gene editing that doesn't complicate the delivery system and doesn't add additional steps, but results in a much more precise edit with fewer unwanted mutations,"" says Phillip Sharp, an MIT Institute Professor Emeritus, a member of MIT's Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research, and one of the senior authors of the new study.

Using their refined method, the MIT team lowered the rate of mistakes in prime editing from roughly one in seven edits to about one in 101 for the most common editing type. In a more precise editing mode, the improvement went from one in 122 to one in 543.

""For any drug, what you want is something that is effective, but with as few side effects as possible,"" says Robert Langer, the David H. Koch Institute Professor at MIT, a member of the Koch Institute, and one of the senior authors of the new study. ""For any disease where you might do genome editing, I would think this would ultimately be a safer, better way of doing it.""

Koch Institute research scientist Vikash Chauhan led the study, which was recently published in Nature.

The potential for error

In the 1990s, early gene therapy efforts relied on inserting new genes into cells using modified viruses. Later, scientists developed techniques that used enzymes like zinc finger nucleases to directly repair genes. These enzymes worked but were difficult to reengineer for new DNA targets, making them slow and cumbersome to use.

The discovery of the CRISPR system in bacteria changed everything. CRISPR uses an enzyme called Cas9, guided by a piece of RNA, to cut DNA at a specific location. Researchers adapted it to remove faulty DNA sequences or insert corrected ones using an RNA-based template, making gene editing faster and more flexible.

In 2019, scientists at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard introduced prime editing, a new version of CRISPR that is even more precise and less likely to affect unintended areas of the genome. More recently, prime editing was used successfully to treat a patient with chronic granulomatous disease (CGD), a rare disorder that weakens white blood cells.

""In principle, this technology could eventually be used to address many hundreds of genetic diseases by correcting small mutations directly in cells and tissues,"" Chauhan says.

One of the advantages of prime editing is that it doesn't require making a double-stranded cut in the target DNA. Instead, it uses a modified version of Cas9 that cuts just one of the complementary strands, opening up a flap where a new sequence can be inserted. A guide RNA delivered along with the prime editor serves as the template for the new sequence.

One reason prime editing is considered safer is that it doesn't cut both strands of DNA. Instead, it makes a gentler, single-strand cut using a modified Cas9 enzyme. This opens a small flap in the DNA where a new, corrected sequence can be inserted, guided by an RNA template.

Once the corrected sequence is added, it must replace the original DNA strand. If the old strand reattaches instead, the new fragment can sometimes end up in the wrong spot, leading to unintended errors.

Most of these mistakes are harmless, but in rare cases they could contribute to tumor growth or other health issues. In current prime editing systems, the error rate can vary from about one in seven edits to one in 121, depending on the editing mode.

""The technologies we have now are really a lot better than earlier gene therapy tools, but there's always a chance for these unintended consequences,"" Chauhan says.

Precise editing

To reduce those error rates, the MIT team decided to take advantage of a phenomenon they had observed in a 2023 study. In that paper, they found that while Cas9 usually cuts in the same DNA location every time, some mutated versions of the protein show a relaxation of those constraints. Instead of always cutting the same location, those Cas9 proteins would sometimes make their cut one or two bases further along the DNA sequence.

This relaxation, the researchers discovered, makes the old DNA strands less stable, so they get degraded, making it easier for the new strands to be incorporated without introducing any errors.

In the new study, the researchers were able to identify Cas9 mutations that dropped the error rate to 1/20th its original value. Then, by combining pairs of those mutations, they created a Cas9 editor that lowered the error rate even further, to 1/36th the original amount.

To make the editors even more accurate, the researchers incorporated their new Cas9 proteins into a prime editing system that has an RNA binding protein that stabilizes the ends of the RNA template more efficiently. This final editor, which the researchers call vPE, had an error rate just 1/60th of the original, ranging from one in 101 edits to one in 543 edits for different editing modes. These tests were performed in mouse and human cells.

The MIT team is now working on further improving the efficiency of prime editors, through further modifications of Cas9 and the RNA template. They are also working on ways to deliver the editors to specific tissues of the body, which is a longstanding challenge in gene therapy.

They also hope that other labs will begin using the new prime editing approach in their research studies. Prime editors are commonly used to explore many different questions, including how tissues develop, how populations of cancer cells evolve, and how cells respond to drug treatment.

""Genome editors are used extensively in research labs,"" Chauhan says. ""So the therapeutic aspect is exciting, but we are really excited to see how people start to integrate our editors into their research workflows.""

The research was funded by the Life Sciences Research Foundation, the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering, the National Cancer Institute, and the Koch Institute Support (core) Grant from the National Cancer Institute.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Thousands fall ill as mosquito fever explodes across southern China","http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/10/251009033244.htm","Fri, 10 Oct 2025 13:17:43 GMT","

A recent editorial in Biocontaminant reveals that Guangdong Province is now facing the largest chikungunya fever outbreak ever documented in China, with more than 4,000 confirmed infections reported since late July. Shunde District in Foshan has been hit hardest, accounting for over 3,600 cases, while additional infections have appeared in Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Hong Kong, and Macao.

Chikungunya fever spreads through bites from Aedes mosquitoes, the same insects that transmit dengue and Zika viruses. The illness, which causes fever and intense joint pain, does not pass directly between people, so reducing mosquito populations remains the most effective way to prevent transmission.

""The outbreak reflects both the global spread of chikungunya and the favorable conditions for mosquito-borne diseases in southern China,"" said lead author Guang-Guo Ying of South China Normal University.

In response, local authorities have begun a province-wide effort to encourage residents to eliminate standing water and reduce mosquito breeding grounds. The editorial notes that factors such as climate change, rapid urbanization, and increasing international travel are helping mosquito-borne viruses spread more widely, creating new public health challenges around the world.

To address these growing threats, the World Health Organization has issued new clinical guidelines and strengthened its Global Arbovirus Initiative, which focuses on improving monitoring, prevention, and international coordination. The authors emphasize the need for expanded genomic surveillance, active community participation, and global collaboration to reduce the risk of future outbreaks.Chikungunya fever was first identified in Tanzania in the 1950s and has since spread to more than 110 countries across Africa, Asia, the Americas, and Europe. The name ""chikungunya"" comes from the Kimakonde language, meaning ""that which bends up,"" a reference to the stooped posture caused by the severe joint pain that often accompanies the infection. While the disease rarely causes death, it can result in long-term arthritis-like symptoms, fatigue, and recurring pain that persist for weeks or even months after recovery.Most patients experience a sudden onset of fever, headache, muscle aches, rash, and joint swelling within a few days of being bitten by an infected mosquito. There is currently no specific antiviral treatment or licensed vaccine for chikungunya, so medical care focuses on relieving symptoms through rest, hydration, and pain management. Recovery usually occurs within a week, though some individuals—particularly older adults or those with underlying conditions—may experience prolonged discomfort.The Aedes mosquito, primarily Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus, is responsible for transmitting chikungunya as well as other major viruses like dengue, Zika, and yellow fever. These mosquitoes are highly adapted to urban environments and breed in small containers of stagnant water commonly found around homes, such as flower pots, discarded tires, and buckets. They are active mainly during the day, with peak biting times in the early morning and late afternoon.Scientists note that Aedes mosquitoes are expanding their range due to warmer temperatures, global trade, and increased urbanization, allowing diseases once confined to the tropics to appear in new regions. Their resilience and proximity to human populations make them particularly difficult to control. As a result, public health strategies increasingly emphasize community participation, routine elimination of standing water, and the use of mosquito repellents, screens, and protective clothing to reduce the risk of infection.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","They're smaller than dust, but crucial for Earth's climate","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/10/251010091548.htm","Fri, 10 Oct 2025 13:56:43 GMT","

Smaller than a grain of dust and shaped like minute discs, coccolithophores are microscopic ocean dwellers with an outsized influence on the planet's climate. These tiny algae remove carbon from seawater, release oxygen, and create delicate calcite plates that eventually sink to the ocean floor. Over time, these plates form chalk and limestone layers that record Earth's climate history. Today, five European research institutions announced a new effort to establish October 10 as International Coccolithophore Day, drawing attention to the organisms' vital contributions to carbon regulation, oxygen production, and the health of marine ecosystems that sustain life on Earth.

The initiative is being led by the Ruđer Bošković Institute (Zagreb, Croatia), the Lyell Centre at Heriot-Watt University (Edinburgh, UK), NORCE Norwegian Research Centre (Bergen, Norway), Marine and Environmental Sciences Centre (MARE) at the University of Lisbon (Portugal), and the International Nannoplankton Association (INA).

A Delicate Balance Under Threat

Few people are aware of coccolithophores, yet without them, the planet's oceans and climate would look drastically different. These single-celled algae, which contain chlorophyll, float in the sunlit layers of the sea and are coated with calcium carbonate plates known as coccoliths.Though incredibly small, coccolithophores are among Earth's most effective natural carbon regulators. Every year, they generate more than 1.5 billion tonnes of calcium carbonate, capturing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and storing it in deep-sea sediments. In addition to removing carbon, they produce oxygen, nourish marine food webs, and influence the planet's greenhouse balance.Coccolithophores often dominate vast stretches of the ocean, but climate change is altering the temperature, chemistry, and nutrient makeup of seawater. These shifts pose serious risks to their survival—and to the stability of the ecosystems that depend on them.

Why Coccolithophores?

What makes coccolithophores stand out from other plankton is both their role in the global carbon cycle and the unique record they leave behind. ""Unlike other groups, they build intricate calcium carbonate plates that not only help draw down carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, but also transport it into deep ocean sediments, where it can be locked away for millennia. This biomineralization leaves behind an exceptional geological record, allowing us to study how they've responded to past climate shifts and better predict their future role. In short, their dual role as carbon pumps and climate archives makes them irreplaceable in understanding and tackling climate change,"" says Professor Alex Poulton of the Lyell Centre.

""They are the ocean's invisible architects, crafting the tiny plates that become vast archives of Earth's climate,"" says Dr. Jelena Godrijan, a leading coccolithophore researcher at the Ruđer Bošković Institute. ""By studying their past and current responses to changes in the ocean, we can better understand how marine ecosystems function and explore how natural processes might help us tackle climate change.''

Cutting-Edge Science: From Plankton to Planetary Processes

The launch of International Coccolithophore Day spotlights the tiny ocean plankton that quietly help regulate atmospheric carbon dioxide.

At the Lyell Centre in Scotland, the OceanCANDY team, led by Prof. Alex Poulton, studies how these plankton pull CO2 from the air and store it in the sea, and tests how warmer, more acidic oceans could alter this process. Computer forecasts compare which species do this job best, today and tomorrow.

In Norway, scientists at NORCE Research, led by Dr. Kyle Mayers and his team, track coccolithophore life stories, how they grow, who eats them, and the viruses that infect and ultimately kill them, to show how carbon moves through the ocean. Ancient DNA in seafloor mud adds a long view of past climate shifts. ""Coccolithophore interactions with viruses and grazers matter,"" says Dr. Kyle Mayers of NORCE. ""These links shape food webs and how the ocean stores carbon.""

In Croatia, the Cocco team at the Ruđer Bošković Institute study how they shape the ocean's carbon cycle, from the decay of organic matter to bacterial interactions that influence seawater chemistry and CO2 uptake. ""In understanding coccolithophores, we're really uncovering the living engine of the ocean's carbon balance,"" says Dr. Jelena Godrijan ""Their interactions with bacteria determine how carbon moves and transforms -- processes that connect the microscopic scale of plankton to the stability of our planet's climate.""

At MARE, University of Lisbon, Dr. Catarina V. Guerreiro leads studies to trace how aerosol-driven fertilization shapes the distribution of coccolithophores across the Atlantic into the Southern Ocean, and what that means for the ocean's carbon pumps today and in recent times. Her approach consists of combining aerosol and seawater samples with sediment records, satellite data and lab microcosms to pin down cause and effect. ""We're connecting tiny chalky organisms to planetary carbon flows,"" says Dr. Guerreiro.

At INA, scientists connect living coccolithophores to their fossil record, using their microscopic plates to date rocks and trace Earth's climate history. By refining global biostratigraphic frameworks and calibrating species' evolutionary timelines, INA researchers transform fossils of coccolithophores into precise tools for reconstructing ancient oceans, linking modern plankton ecology with the geological record of climate change.

Why Coccolithophore Day Matters?

Designating a day for Coccolithophores may seem like a small gesture, but its advocates argue it could have a big impact. ""This could contribute to changing the way we see the ocean. ""We most often talk about whales, coral reefs, and ice caps, but coccolithophores are a vital part of the planet's climate system. They remind us that the smallest organisms can have the biggest impact, and that microscopic life plays a crucial role in shaping our planet's future, "" says Dr. Sarah Cryer from the CHALKY project and OceanCANDY team.

The campaign to establish October 10 as International Coccolithophore Day is a call to action. By highlighting the profound, yet often overlooked, role of coccolithophores, scientists want to inspire a new wave of ocean literacy, policy focus, and public engagement.

Of the 202 Nobel laureates in physics, chemistry and medicine this century, less than 70% hail from the country in which they were awarded their prize. The remaining 63 laureates left their country of birth before winning a Nobel prize, sometimes crossing international borders more than once, a Nature analysis shows (see ‘Nobel flows').

Among the Nobel prizewinners who emigrated to other countries are two of three chemistry winners announced on Wednesday. Richard Robson was born in the United Kingdom but now lives in Australia. And Omar Yaghi, who is now a US resident, became the first Jordanian-born Nobel laureate in science. Two of the three physics winners for 2025 are also immigrants: Michel Devoret was born in France and John Clarke in the United Kingdom, but both are US residents.

Immigrants have long played an important part on the Nobel stage, including illustrious scientists such as Albert Einstein, who moved from his birthplace in Germany to Switzerland (and later to the United States), and Marie Curie, who left her native Poland to work in France. That's because the most fruitful scientific opportunities — the best training, equipment and research communities — are scattered across the globe. “Talent can be born anywhere, but opportunities are not,” says Ina Ganguli, an economist at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. “I think that's the reason we see so many foreign Nobel laureates.”

The new analysis comes as the international flow of scientists and students faces growing obstacles. In the United States, for example, rampant grant cuts and stricter immigration policies implemented this year by the administration of President Donald Trump threaten a looming ‘brain drain'. Such restrictions “will slow the rate of highly novel research, period”, says Caroline Wagner, a specialist in science and technology policy at the Ohio State University in Columbus. The White House did not respond to a request for comment about the effects of Trump's policies.

Meanwhile, Australia has capped the number of international students that its institutions can enrol each year, and Japan proposed cutting financial support to graduate students from other countries.

Among those who have already crossed borders is Andre Geim, a physicist at the University of Manchester, UK, and a 2010 physics laureate. Born in Russia to German parents, Geim says he “bounced around like a pinball” throughout his research career, holding positions in Russia, Denmark, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands. “If you stay put your whole life, you miss half the game,” he says.

Of the 63 laureates who won the prize after moving out of their birth countries, 41 lived in the United States when their Nobel was awarded. After the Second World War, the United States became a global hub for science, Ganguli says. International researchers flocked there for its generous grants and top universities (see ‘Nobel laureate stomping grounds'). “What we have in the US is unique. It's a destination for top students and scientists,” says Ganguli. The next most popular landing place was the United Kingdom, which was home to seven of the Nobel prizewinners who had emigrated by the time they got the fateful phone call from Stockholm.

But, the United Kingdom also saw future prizewinners leave. Thirteen Nobel prizewinners who were born there won the prize while living elsewhere (see ‘Points of departure'), perhaps lured by higher salaries and more prestigious positions, Wagner says. Substantial numbers of future Nobel laureates also left Germany, with six expatriate prizewinners, as well as Japan, France and Russia, each with four expatriate laureates.

Among the science categories of the Nobel prizes, physics has the highest proportion of foreign-born laureates so far this century: 37% (see ‘Disciplines differ'). Trailing just behind is chemistry at 33%, and finally, medicine at 23%. Physics probably takes the lead because of its equipment-heavy nature, according to Wagner. The pricey colliders, reactors, lasers, detectors and telescopes that are needed for top-notch physics research reside mainly in a few leading nations. “Thus, the top research talent will likely go to places with top equipment. Medicine is not an equipment-heavy field, so it is easier to stay home,” Wagner says.

The future of immigration's interplay with the Nobels is murky. Australia, Canada and the United Kingdom have all enacted restrictions that have reduced the number of university students from abroad. The Trump administration has slashed billions of dollars in scientific research grants so far this year. And a new US policy charges US$100,000 per application for an H-1B visa, which some foreign-born researchers rely on to work in the United States.

Researchers who study post-war reconstruction have told Nature that the recovery of public health, environment, higher education and research in Gaza will not succeed unless it is led by experts from the Palestinian territory.

Their warning comes amid images of jubilant scenes in Gaza yesterday as negotiators in Egypt sealed the first phase of US President Donald Trump's ceasefire plan, which today was ratified by Israel's cabinet.

Israel's bombardment and ground offensive, which has killed more than 67,000 people, began soon after the Hamas attacks of 7 October 2023, in which 1,200 people were killed and 251 were taken hostage.

Under Trump's plan, Hamas is expected to disarm, release the remaining hostages and play no part in Gaza's governance. Israel's government will suspend military action, withdraw its forces to an agreed position, free a number of Palestinian people it is holding in captivity, allow more aid into Gaza and permit United Nations agencies to operate in the territory. The precise details of how all this will be implemented have not been announced.

“We woke up [yesterday] morning to happy, long-awaited news. There are so many celebrations here in Gaza right now,” says Farid Al-Qeeq, a researcher in urban planning and former president of Gaza University.

The researchers Nature interviewed for this article say it's important that reconstruction is led by Palestinian communities. They are voicing these concerns now because Palestinian organizations have not been named as having a leadership role in Trump's plan.

Since the first attacks, Israel's troops have almost completely destroyed Gaza's physical infrastructure — including hospitals, other health-care facilities and water and sanitation. 

By the end of August, a time when there were severe restrictions to aid getting through, more than half a million people were experiencing famine,  the Famine Review Committee, an independent group of experts, concluded. Nearly 55,000 children below the age of five — are acutely malnourished, according to data published in The Lancet on 8 September1.

More than 2,200 medical and education personnel have been killed, according to data published by the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics based in Ramallah in the West Bank. Almost four-fifths of higher-education campuses have been damaged or destroyed, and 88,000 students at those institutions have been forced to put their studies on hold, according to the UN's science agency UNESCO, based in Paris.

“It's important to understand the enormity of the scale of destruction”, says Savo Heleta, a researcher at Nelson Mandela University in South Africa who studies post-conflict higher education and aid flows to Palestinian universities. In a yet-to-be published paper, Heleta estimates that the war has damaged at least US$222 million worth of higher-education infrastructure. Rebuilding, he says, would need nearly five times that, at around $1 billion, because of the cost of clearing debris and removing unexploded bombs.

Heleta also says that if past trends are a guide to the future, then “countries from the Gulf and Turkey are likely to be the main donors” for reconstruction. He adds that in previous years, aid for universities amounted to a maximum of just $20 million per year.

Amani Al-Mqadma, head of international relations for the Islamic University of Gaza, and a co-author of ‘Resilience in the rubble', a report assessing the needs of higher education in Gaza, says that the territory's priorities extend beyond physical reconstruction. They must also include sustaining online education until physical spaces are rebuilt; mental-health support for students and staff; and reconnecting researchers to the world through conferences, visits and scholarships. Because higher-education institutions in Gaza rely mostly on income from tuition fees, Al-Mqadma calls for aid to cover students' fees to keep universities alive.

Gaza's scientific institutions should be crucial partners in the reconstruction efforts, says Al-Mqadma, who is currently based at the University of Edinburgh, UK. “These academics possess unparalleled local knowledge and a deep understanding of their land.” Moreover, “decisions about the region's future must be informed by extensive input from the communities who will be most affected”, adds Naomi Rintoul-Hynes, a soil scientist at Canterbury Christ Church University in the UK, who is studying the environmental impact on Gaza of the war.

Under Trump's plan, a “technocratic” committee of Palestinian and international experts will be appointed to run public services. It will be under the oversight of an international body of decision makers, likely at the level of heads of government and called the Board of Peace. The board will be chaired by Trump and will include former UK prime minister Tony Blair.

Sultan Barakat, a public policy researcher at Hamad Bin Khalifa University in Qatar, says many respected academics will not participate in the committee if it turns out to be “the management of an occupation”.

“There will be a lot of questioning around this committee”, says Barakat, who is co-author of a report, ‘Gaza: leadership and reconstruction for the day after', published last year.

Researchers who study trends in illicit drug use are concerned that sales of a potent class of synthetic opioids called nitazenes are on the rise globally.

The opioid class of drugs includes heroin and morphine. Unlike those drugs, which are derived from naturally occurring opium, nitazenes are synthesized from scratch in a laboratory. The first nitazenes were developed as painkillers in the 1950s, but were never approved for medical use because they carried a high risk of dangerous side effects such loss of consciousness, coma and death.

But since 2019, there has been a rise in the reported use of nitazenes, according to the World Drug Report 2025, which was released in June. In 2023, the report states, 20 different nitazenes were seized by authorities across 28 countries and reported to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) Early Warning Advisory on New Psychoactive Substances.

Nitazenes can be as much as 500 times more potent than opium-derived drugs. For example, butonitazene is 2.5 times more potent than heroin, whereas isotonitazene and etonitazene are 250 and 500 times more potent, respectively.

This means that just a tiny amount can be deadly. In the United Kingdom, there were 179 confirmed deaths from nitazene overdoses in the year to 31 May 2024. And reports suggest that thousands of people might have died from nitazene overdoses in the United States since 2019. In Australia, researchers note that the unpredictable presence of nitazenes in various drugs is increasing the risk of overdose in the country.

Most nitazene overdoses are unintentional, says Suzanne Nielsen, an addiction researcher at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia. Overdose tends to occur when nitazenes are sold as other drugs, such as heroin, oxycodone and MDMA (also known as ecstasy). Overdoses can be treated with naloxone, a drug that has long been used to treat other opioid overdoses. More awareness of this among drug users and their families could help save lives, Nielsen adds.

Google may have to change the way its search engine works in the UK, including potentially offering users the option to choose rival search services, as part of new regulation from the UK's competition authority.

In a decision handed down on Friday, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has designated Google Search with Strategic Market Status (SMS)—a qualifier given to companies that are considered to have “substantial and entrenched market power”—which would allow the regulator to wield more power over it.

This decision follows a 10-month investigation into Google, and it is the first time that these powers, which come under the UK's new Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers Act, have been used to target a major tech company. Google's SMS will last up to five years under this legislation. The CMA has also identified Apple as potentially having SMS with its mobile platform, but the authority's investigation is still ongoing.

Back in June, the CMA published a roadmap of potential regulatory changes for Google if it decided to designate it with SMS. Alongside requiring “choice screens” on Google that allow people to choose rival search engines, proposed measures include “fair ranking principles,” which will allow companies to raise issues on how they appear in Google Search, and increased data portability, making it easier for people to transfer their data between search engines.

The new measures could also include forcing Google to ask for permission to use publishers' content in its AI Overviews “without affecting if and how they appear in Google Search,” which may positively impact UK publishers. Major UK publishers' visibility in search results dropped by up to 80 percent compared to 2019 correlating to the rise in frequency of the AI results, according to a report from Enders Analysis.

“The decision to formally designate Google with Strategic Market Status is an important step to improving competition in digital markets,” argues Rocio Concha, director of policy and advocacy at UK consumer watchdog Which?. “Online search is evolving as gen AI tools become more widely used, but the CMA must still act to tackle the harmful dominance Google has now and to promote competition between gen AI search tools.”

The CMA claims that Google Search accounts for more than 90 percent of all general search queries in the UK, and that over 200,000 firms in the UK collectively spent more than £10 billion ($13.3 billion) on Google search advertising in 2024.

“Designating Google with SMS enables us to consider proportionate, targeted interventions to ensure that general search services are open to effective competition, and that consumers and businesses that rely on Google can have confidence that they are treated fairly,” the CMA decision report reads.

In a statement shared with WIRED in response to the CMA's decision, Google's senior director of competition Oliver Bethell said that many of the ideas for interventions raised in this process would “inhibit UK innovation and growth, potentially slowing product launches at a time of profound AI-based innovation.” It continued: “Others pose direct harm to businesses, with some warning that they may be forced to raise prices for customers.”

This is not a surprising response, says Greg Dowell, senior competition knowledge lawyer at law firm Macfarlanes. “I think we can expect Google and all the other big tech firms that are being subjected to these new rules to try and defend their practices on the basis that they are pro-consumer,” says Dowell. “Ultimately it is natural that Google and other firms in this position don't want to be constrained in what they can do when it comes to new product development.”

The new regulation will also affect Google Search's “News” tab and its “Top Stories” carousel, as well as Google Discover. Google News, the company's stand-alone news product, and AI chatbot Gemini are not affected, the CMA says.

Dowell claims that implementing this roadmap might take a number of months. “The CMA may go further than the EU has done with the [Digital Markets Act], particularly with regards to restrictions relating to Google's AI services and how they're integrated into Google search,” he explains.

“The CMA essentially has a huge degree of flexibility in the interventions that it can seek to impose, and so it can continually react to developments as they occur. So that's one benefit of the UK digital markets regulation regime, particularly when you compare it to the situation in the EU, where these sorts of rules are fixed in the regulation itself.”

A Meta executive in charge of building the company's metaverse products told employees that they should be using AI to “go 5X faster” according to an internal message obtained by 404 Media.

“Metaverse AI4P: Think 5X, not 5%,” the message, posted by Vishal Shah, Meta's VP of Metaverse, said (AI4P is AI for Productivity). The idea is that programmers should be using AI to work five times more efficiently than they are currently working—not just using it to go 5 percent more efficiently.

This article was created in partnership with 404 Media, a journalist-owned publication covering how technology impacts humans. For more stories like this, sign up here.

“Our goal is simple yet audacious: make Al a habit, not a novelty. This means prioritizing training and adoption for everyone, so that using Al becomes second nature—just like any other tool we rely on,” the message read. “It also means integrating Al into every major codebase and workflow.” Shah added that this doesn't just apply to engineers. “I want to see PMs, designers, and [cross functional] partners rolling up their sleeves and building prototypes, fixing bugs, and pushing the boundaries of what's possible,” he wrote. “I want to see us go 5X faster by eliminating the frictions that slow us down. And 5X faster to get to how our products feel much more quickly. Imagine a world where anyone can rapidly prototype an idea, and feedback loops are measured in hours—not weeks. That's the future we're building.”

Meta's metaverse products, which CEO Mark Zuckerberg renamed the company to highlight, have been a colossal time sink and money pit, with the company spending tens of billions of dollars developing a product that relatively few people use.

Zuckerberg has spoken extensively about how he expects AI agents to write most of Meta's code within the next 12 to 18 months. The company also recently decided that job candidates would be allowed to use AI as part of their coding tests during job interviews. But Shah's message highlights a fear that workers have had for quite some time: That bosses are not just expecting to replace workers with AI, they are expecting those who remain to use AI to become far more efficient. The implicit assumption is that the work that skilled humans do without AI simply isn't good enough.

At this point, most tech giants are pushing AI on their workforces. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy told employees in July that he expects AI to completely transform how the company works—and lead to job loss. ""In the next few years, we expect that this will reduce our total corporate workforce as we get efficiency gains from using AI extensively across the company,"" he said.

Many experienced software engineers feel like AI coding agents are creating a new crisis, where codebases contain bugs and errors that are difficult to fix since humans don't necessarily know how specific code was written or what it does. This means a lot of engineers have become babysitters who have to fix vibe coded messes written by AI coding agents.

In the last few weeks, a handful of blogs written by coders have gone viral, including ones with titles such as: “Vibe coding is creating braindead coders,” “Vibe coding: Because who doesn't love surprise technical debt!?,” “Vibe/No code Tech Debt,” and “Comprehension Debt: The Ticking Time Bomb of LLM-Generated Code.”

In his message, Shah said that “we expect 80 percent of Metaverse employees to have integrated AI into their daily work routines by the end of this year, with rapid growth in engineering usage and a relentless focus on learning from the time and output we gain.” He went on to reference a series of upcoming trainings and internal documents about AI coding, including two “Metaverse day of AI learning” events.

“Dedicate the time. Take the training seriously. Share what you learn, and don't be afraid to experiment,” he added. “The more we push ourselves, the more we'll unlock. A 5X leap in productivity isn't about small incremental improvements, it's about fundamentally rethinking how we work, build, and innovate.” He ended the post with a graphic featuring a futuristic building with the words “Metaverse AI4P Think 5X, not 5%” superimposed on top.

A Meta spokesperson told 404 Media, “It's well-known that this is a priority, and we're focused on using AI to help employees with their day-to-day work.”

The “woosh” of a dildo flying past your face. Tribalistic chants. Men making bets on your bodily functions.

This isn't a cult—this is a day in the life of a modern-day WNBA player.

That last indignity on the list? It's a sports betting strategy that's been getting increasing play over the course of this WNBA season, which is wrapping up as the Las Vegas Aces and Phoenix Mercury face off in the finals. Dozens of dedicated gamblers online are making bets on players' potential performance based on their “predictions” (or, rather, assumptions) about their menstrual cycles. Some actually call it “blood money,” because … of course they do.

One prominent figure making and predicting these wagers, who goes by FadeMeBets online, has garnered thousands of likes and shares on Instagram for his menstrual cycle betting strategy. He claims he's been correct on 11 out of 16 of his period-related predictions, with about 68.75 percent accuracy. “What's kind of good, but also kind of bad, is it brings more people to watch the WNBA, but, on the downside of that, it's usually just all gamblers,” says FadeMeBets, who declined to be named, citing privacy concerns.

This WNBA season has been a record-breaker—more fans in the stands, more eyes on the screen, more viral moments. The league announced that attendance passed a historic 2.5 million earlier this summer. Meanwhile, high-profile players like Angel Reese, Paige Bueckers, and Caitlin Clark have added a boost and become household names.

The newfound interest in the league has more men watching the sport than women, and the overwhelming rise of sports gambling means some of them are betting on the games—and the players' periods—which experts warn isn't just pseudoscientific, but sexist, too.

“Not every woman is the same. Yes, there's the traditional 28-day cycle, but everyone's is different, and it varies person to person, month by month,” says Amy West, a sports medicine physician. “Someone being able to predict that? Someone who's not very close to the menstruating person? It's actually kind of silly.”

FadeMeBets admits that predicting WNBA player performance based on menstrual cycle assumptions is more art than science. His typical menstrual cycle prediction videos all start with the vaguely menacing phrase: “We've got a victim, boys.” (By this, he says the victim is the betting line—the odds set out by sportsbooks that determine a person's payout—not the player herself.) He then shares predictions about whether a specific player is menstruating, ovulating, or in their late luteal phase, which occurs after ovulation and before the period comes. For instance, he said this summer of Clark: “She is on the end of her late luteal phase, meaning a decrease in cardio, decrease in strength, decrease in aerobic system, she's going to be tired more often than in a normal game.”

FadeMeBets told viewers to “bet the under” on Clark that game, projecting that she'd score lower than the number predicted by oddsmakers on sports betting apps, and, in this case, Clark did.

He looks at two major metrics over time: “Field goal %”—which is essentially how efficient a shooter is—and “Plus/minus,” measuring a player's impact on a team when they're on the court vs. when they're off.

From there, FadeMeBets analyzes players' metrics over their history in the WNBA and even in college. He tracks players' stats over the course of a 24- to 38-day menstrual cycle, looking for dips and surges over the monthlong cycle. If someone is missing a lot of baskets at a certain time every month, he might assume they're on their late luteal phase, citing a study that showed menstruating athletes self-reported worse performance during this time. He hasn't asked any players directly about their cycles.

From X to Reddit to gambling forums, his videos and others are gaining a foothold online. The morning radio show The Bert Show called out this strategy earlier this season, with the host Bert Weiss calling the tactic “off-putting,” though, possibly, effective.

Influencer Colin Myers has also spoken online about using this method to make bets, though he used more concrete evidence—a video of Indiana Fever Player Lexie Hull saying she was on her period. Myers saw her video and told his group chat to “hammer the under” for her. On the podcast Stuff Island, comedian James McCann said he had met a gambler who used injury reports, including those of “soreness,” to estimate menstrual cycles.

As a researcher working on a study of how menstrual cycles impact college athletes' injury rates, West says birth control and other factors would make it difficult for a random bystander to predict actual athletes' menstrual cycles. Some menstruators use contraception to skip their periods altogether.

FadeMeBets says he has taken this into account and only makes predictions for players he sees a real pattern with. If he misses, he stops making predictions on the cycle of that player, he adds.

As for the ideas he has based his predictions on—that menstruators are less “strong” and “fast” during certain times of the month—West says this isn't proven and that it isn't true across the board.

Although the study FadeMeBets referenced found that menstruating athletes self-reported their performance was relatively worse during the early follicular and late luteal phases, studies overall haven't shown that this is consistent for all athletes who menstruate.

“Some data actually shows that when women are menstruating, that low progesterone, low estrogen state may actually be a good, from a sports performance perspective,” West notes. But, again, “everyone's so different.”

Nadya Okamoto, founder of the gender-inclusive menstrual product company August and author of Period Power, says that this emerging menstrual cycle betting strategy is adding to the long-standing stigma that menstruators are “emotional” or less efficient on their periods.

Okamoto says this trend also may lead sports bettors who watch these videos to belittle folks on their periods in their own lives. The ol' “Bruh, she's on her period” trope is standing strong.

FadeMeBets, too, acknowledges this. “A lot of gamblers, they aren't the nicest people,” he says. I point to a comment he left on one of his own videos in May about the Chicago Sky's Courtney Vandersloot, in which he claimed she'd be on her period. “I also made sure to play with her feelings and manipulate her on an alt account to mess with her emotions before game time 😊,” he wrote.

This, he admits, was not his finest moment. “I was just lying to see if I could get a little more … more engagement on that post. And I did. But I should definitely not have said that.”

When WIRED asks if he's worried about pushing forward the idea that menstruators can't perform as well on their periods, he says: “I might start making a bunch of disclaimers under my videos.”

WNBA players make pennies compared to their NBA counterparts—top athletes make almost $250,000 per year while the NBA pays 200 times that much. “One of the big issues in women's sports is pay equity, right?” Okamoto says.  “If there's this narrative that 25 percent of the month, women are not gonna be competing at the same level, there are very dangerous repercussions to such a negative stigma.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","Apple Announces $2 Million Bug Bounty Reward for the Most Dangerous Exploits","https://www.wired.com/story/apple-announces-2-million-bug-bounty-reward/","Fri, 10 Oct 2025 09:15:00 GMT","

Since launching its bug bounty program nearly a decade ago, Apple has always touted notable maximum payouts—$200,000 in 2016 and $1 million in 2019. Now the company is upping the stakes again. At the Hexacon offensive security conference in Paris on Friday, Apple vice president of security engineering and architecture Ivan Krstić announced a new maximum payout of $2 million for a chain of software exploits that could be abused for spyware.

The move reflects how valuable exploitable vulnerabilities can be within Apple's highly protected mobile environment—and the lengths the company will go to to keep such discoveries from falling into the wrong hands. In addition to individual payouts, the company's bug bounty also includes a bonus structure, adding additional awards for exploits that can bypass its extra secure Lockdown Mode as well as those discovered while Apple software is still in its beta testing phase. Taken together, the maximum award for what would otherwise be a potentially catastrophic exploit chain will now be $5 million. The changes take effect next month.

“We are lining up to pay many millions of dollars here, and there's a reason,” Krstić tells WIRED. “We want to make sure that for the hardest categories, the hardest problems, the things that most closely mirror the kinds of attacks that we see with mercenary spyware—that the researchers who have those skills and abilities and put in that effort and time can get a tremendous reward.""

Apple says that there are more than 2.35 billion of its devices active around the world. The company's bug bounty was originally an invite-only program for prominent researchers, but since opening to the public in 2020, Apple says that it has awarded more than $35 million to more than 800 security researchers. Top-dollar payouts are very rare, but Krstić says that the company has made multiple $500,000 payouts in recent years.

In addition to higher potential rewards, Apple is also expanding the bug bounty's categories to include certain types of one-click “WebKit” browser infrastructure exploits as well as wireless proximity exploits carried out with any type of radio. And there is even a new offering known as “Target Flags” that puts the concept of capture the flag hacking competitions into real-world testing of Apple's software to help researchers demonstrate the capabilities of their exploits quickly and definitively.

Apple's bug bounty is just one of many long-term investments aimed at reducing the prevalence of dangerous vulnerabilities or blocking their exploitation. For example, after more than five years of work, the company announced a security protection last month in the new iPhone 17 lineup that aims to nullify the most frequently exploited class of iOS bugs. Known as Memory Integrity Enforcement, the feature is a big swing aimed at protecting a small minority of the most vulnerable and highly targeted groups around the world—including activists, journalists, and politicians—while also adding defense for all users of new devices. To that end, the company announced on Friday that it will donate a thousand iPhone 17s to rights groups that work with people at risk of facing targeted digital attacks.

“You can say, well, that seems like a very large effort to protect only that very small number of users that are being targeted by mercenary spyware, but there is just this incontrovertible track record described by journalists, tech companies, and civil society organizations that these technologies are constantly being abused,” Krstić says. “And we feel a great moral obligation to defend those users. Despite the fact that the vast majority of our users will never be targeted by anything like this, this work that we did will end up increasing protection for everyone.”

Ares, named after the Greek god of war, was built to be an AI super-soldier. Then he found out about Frankenstein, started listening to Depeche Mode, and realized the tech bro who made him might be a hack. So he takes matters into his own hands on a quest for freedom from his suicide mission. I wish I were joking, but I'm not. That's the premise of Tron: Ares.

AI bots awakening to the realities of human messiness are a trope almost as old as movies themselves. Even Metropolis' metallic maschinenmensch questioned her creators, and that was 1927. In the decades since, most sci-fi involving AI has reinforced the idea that giving computers people-like intelligence ends poorly for people themselves. Skynet takes over. Scarlett Johansson's disembodied voice never really loved you. I'm sorry, Dave.

Tron: Ares' take is hotter: What if AI-powered machines evolved into benevolent loners? (Be warned: There are spoilers ahead.) Tech CEO Julian Dillinger (Evan Peters), grandson of original Tron villain Ed Dillinger, has created artificially intelligent soldiers (and tanks and such) to secure military contracts. The soldiers are hard to kill, but, as he says, they're “expendable.” He can just build more. Ares (Jared Leto) leads these bots but after a few days of taking orders from his petulant boss decides to go rogue.

There's just one problem: Dillinger's droids aren't perfect. All of his creations fall apart after 29 minutes. What he needs is a MacGuffin called the Permanence Code, which was (surprise!) actually developed by original Tron hero Kevin Flynn forever ago. When Eve Kim (Greta Lee), now the head of Flynn's old company Encon, finds the code on an old floppy disk, Dillinger sends Ares to retrieve it. But when Ares finds her, all Ares really wants is to keep the code for himself so that he can be a normal dude, not destroy things, and maybe make a friend.

Once more, for those unclear on Tron: Ares' message: The AI droid, made specifically to win on the battlefield, has gained sentience and gotten a little sentimental. Like all AI creations in sci-fi, Ares wants to be free. But unlike nearly all of them, Ares doesn't want to end humanity to do it. Maybe he heard Mark Zuckerberg talking about AI filling the gaps in people's social circles and found his calling.

For years sci-fi has been warning that thinking machines will eventually turn on their makers. In 2025, we no longer have to imagine what that technology would look like. Almost anyone can have an AI chatbot in their pocket, and everyone who makes those chatbots is promising they're going to improve life on Earth, despite the environmental, economic, and mental health issues they raise. But Tron: Ares' main takeaway seems to be that fears about AI are unfounded. They'll probably just be super chill.

That's out of step with reality. So far humanity's experience with AI companions has been mixed at best. Even the ones not made for war have proven to be almost too sycophantic, emotionally manipulating people into prolonged engagement. Teens are confiding in ChatGPT with alarming results. Friend, the AI wearable that makes your actual friends feel weird, seems to exist just to snark you. Actual “killer robots,” aka autonomous weapons systems, raise far more ethical concerns than they answer.

By Tron: Ares' end, the titular character has found the Permanence Code. It was—in a way that allows Jeff Bridges to return as Kevin Flynn to bestow some Dude-esque stoner wisdom—on the Grid, which fans will remember from the 1982 film. As the two rhapsodize about life, Flynn mentions Mozart. Ares responds that he prefers Depeche Mode, a sentiment he can't describe with words: “It's just a … feeling.” It's as if the audience is expected to gasp in wonder that the AI thingy has emotions. Did an AI write this?

Not to say that there's no room in sci-fi for benevolent droids—even the Terminator went from trying to kill Sarah Connor to saving her son—but they hit differently when the news is filled with chatbots that allegedly lure retirees out of their homes, distort their users' sense of reality, and convince people they're superheroes. AI is quickly becoming ubiquitous—in schools, in workplaces, in dating—with few signs of pushback, making Leto's goth bot turned hippie feel particularly egregious. Tron: Ares does have a more apropos representation of AI—Ares' second-in-command, Athena, who will do whatever it takes to complete her directive—but she's ultimately overcome. By Ares. If a real-world AI goes off the rails, it's hard to imagine another AI gaining a conscience and stopping it.

As Tron: Ares came to its (anti-)climatic conclusion, I was reminded of Sam Altman. Specifically, I remembered a blog the OpenAI CEO posted around the release of GPT-4o. “It feels like AI from the movies,” he wrote. “It's still a bit surprising to me that it's real.”

This was around the time when OpenAI's chatbot had a conversational voice reminiscent of Johansson's voice in Her. As WIRED executive editor Brian Barrett wrote at the time, tech CEOs taking inspiration from sci-fi would do well to “watch the whole movie.” Using AI to solve problems always looks cool in the first act and generally less cool by the third, and if AI companies want to create the stuff of sci-fi it would be wise for them to understand which “sacred texts are guidebooks and which are cautionary tales.”

Tron: Ares does the inverse, learning nothing from the technologists currently building AI's future, or from the works that inspired them.

Talented North Korean coders and developers have, for years, been getting hired for remote jobs at Western tech firms. Thousands of these so-called IT workers have earned billions for North Korea's authoritarian regime by developing apps, working on cryptocurrency projects, and infiltrating Fortune 500 companies—when they get paid, they send their earnings home. But the scale and scope of these fraudulent job schemes likely extends beyond most people's understanding.

New analysis of exposed online accounts and files linked to suspected Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) digital laborers shows that at least one group has been working in a very different field: architecture and civil engineering. Over recent years, the cluster of workers has been masquerading as freelance structural engineers and architects, according to a report shared with WIRED by cybersecurity firm Kela, which dug into one network it links to North Korea.

Files linked to the alleged North Korean operatives show 2D architectural drawings and some 3D CAD files for properties in the United States, Kela researchers say. In addition to the plans, the scammers were also seen claiming to advertise a range of architectural services and using, or creating, architectural stamps or seals, which can act as legal certification that drawings follow local building regulations.

“These operatives are active not only in technology and cybersecurity but also in industrial design, architecture, and interior design, accessing sensitive infrastructure and client projects under fabricated identities,” Kela writes in a blog post. The United Nations estimates that thousands of IT workers raise between $250 million and $600 million for North Korea each year, with money being used to support the country's nuclear weapons programs and sanctions evasion efforts.

Kela's security researchers focused on a GitHub account linked to one suspected North Korean IT network, before analyzing further accounts and profiles. The GitHub profile, plus some connected personas and some architectural work, was first identified by DPRK researchers on X earlier this year. Github, which is owned by Microsoft, did not respond to WIRED's request for comment about the account or suspected links to North Korea.

The GitHub account publicly listed a series of Google Drive files that could be downloaded by anyone and contained a treasure trove of information linked to the potential scammers. The files included details of work being pursued by the DPRK-linked accounts, duplicate and false CVs, images that could be used as profile pictures, and details of the personas used to find work.

“There were so many emails, data, and profiles that we saw,” says a Kela researcher who asked not to be named due to the sensitivity of the findings. “It was really massive,” they add, saying some spreadsheets appeared to show hundreds of email addresses that may have been used by the scammers. (Google had not responded to a request for comment at the time of writing).

Publicly available files reviewed by WIRED show the breadth—and productivity—of the suspected DPRK scammers and the links to potential architectural work. In most cases, the scammers appear to have been using freelance work websites to solicit potential jobs. Numerous text files within the documents—which sit alongside CVs—advertise the potential architectural services that people could purchase, with documents claiming architects are licensed across multiple (or sometimes all) states across the US. “We can provide you with all construction docs (site plan, structural analysis report, stamp) and we can help you to get permission for construction docs,” one text file says. Some files appear to show correspondence with people potentially seeking the work.

Files seen by WIRED also include floor plans and designs for a deck, a farm house, a custom tree house, swimming pools, and more. One text file appears to include a request asking if existing plans for a restaurant patio could be redrawn. WIRED could not immediately verify whether these plans had physically been drawn up by the alleged North Korean accounts or if any work was completed. However, previous reporting and other researchers indicate this could be possible.

The Kela researchers say that they reported their findings to the FBI and other law enforcement bodies. The FBI did not immediately respond to WIRED's request for comment.

In July, Canadian public broadcaster CBC reported that the seal of one architect in Toronto had likely been altered and impersonated by North Korean IT workers and the details were included on plans not worked on by that architect. The architect told CBC that the signature used did not match his own and the seal contained differences to his official version. One document seen by WIRED in the cache of files listed websites for generating engineer and architect seals.

“The plans are being used and being built,” says Michael “Barni” Barnhart, a leading authority in North Korean hacking and cyber threats, who works for insider threat security firm DTEX. Along with other DPRK researchers, who call themselves a “Misfit” alliance, Barnhart has seen this cluster of workers conducting architectural work and says similar other efforts have been detected. “They will do the CAD renderings, they'll do the drawings,” he says. “It's not like a hypothetical—those physical things do exist out there.”

Barnhart—who previously found North Korean animators appearing to work on Amazon and Max shows—says that he has also seen potential front companies set up to help run the operations and provide a veneer of legitimacy. The findings raise questions about the quality of the structural work and concerns about safety, if structures are created in the physical world. “In some of our investigations, these plans and these products that they're making for these remodels and renderings, they're not getting good reviews,” Barnhart says. “We do have indications that also they're being hired to do critical infrastructure.”

One 24-minute long screen recording seen by WIRED shows how the freelance operation could work. In the video, a person signs up to a freelance work website and sets up a new profile where they write that they are a “licensed structural engineer/architect in the USA.” They pick a profile image from a folder of potentially downloaded files, translate text between English and Korean, and access a Social Security number generator website during the sign-up process.

When their account is created, the video shows them start to message online requests for work, with one message saying: “I can provide you [sic] permit drawing plan set for your residential home design within a few days.”

Other screen recordings show the workers having conversations with potential clients, and in at least one instance there is a recording of an online call discussing possible work. The Kela researcher, who asked not be named for security reasons, says it appeared some prospective customers returned to the scammers after likely having work completed. The researchers say some kinds of work appeared to be priced from a few hundred dollars up to around $1,000 per job.

“This is an opportunistic nation,” DTEX's Barnhart says. While many companies have started to figure out that North Korea's IT workers are often applying for remote tech jobs, using false identities, deepfakes on video calls, and local workers to run their operations, they are consistently changing their approaches. Barnhart says it appears that architectural work has been successful for the alleged DPRK workers and that evidence shows the IT workers program can be more subtle than trying to get hired at companies.

“They're moving to places where we're not looking,” Barnhart says. “They're also doing things like call centers. They're doing HR and payroll and accounting. Things that are just remote roles and not necessarily remote hires.”

                                What happens here matters everywhere.

Have you ever wondered why there's such a strong tie between the Nordic countries (Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Finland, and Iceland) and the Pacific Northwest?

Nordic peoples were the largest group of immigrants to settle this region, including my own Norwegian relatives. Their impact has left an indelible mark on the greater Seattle area and strong ties have persevered through a number of political and societal transitions. Even today Nordic innovators find a warm welcome here. Since 2018, the National Nordic Museum has hosted the Nordic Innovation Summit, connecting thought leaders and innovators from both sides of the Atlantic.

Having studied how innovation happens – at Silicon Valley's Tech Museum of Innovation, Paul G. Allen's Living Computers Museum (RIP), and the Museum of the Future in Dubai- a common thread became clear: innovation thrives when government, academia, and private industry work in partnership. This “triple helix” model, widely embraced across the Nordics, provides a proven framework where research, regulation, and entrepreneurship co-evolve. This “triple helix” model—widely embraced across the Nordics—provides a proven framework where research, regulation, and entrepreneurship co-evolve.

In the United States, universities such as Stanford and the University of Washington have long been vital players in this ecosystem. But recent political and budgetary shifts are threatening public investment in both government research and academic institutions. The Nordic Innovation Summit is a rare American forum where all three strands of the helix—plus non-profits and NGOs—come together to shape bold, future-facing ideas.

In a time of polarization and fragmentation, recommitting to this kind of cross-sector collaboration is not just smart—it's essential.

This year at the National Nordic Museum, we're hosting the Nordic Innovation Summit on October 21st to 22nd to align with One Ocean Week and the 200th Anniversary of organized Norwegian immigration to America. Some may ask why a museum would be the institution to convene these kinds of conversations. Museums bring together artists and engineers, students and CEOs, policymakers and the public, in spaces designed for curiosity and reflection. In doing so, they bridge the gap between information and imagination, past and future. As the venue for the Nordic Innovation Summit, the National Nordic Museum becomes more than a cultural institution—it becomes an incubator for insight and catalyst for discovery.

During a talk at the museum in August with Danish author and politician Pelle Dragsted, the point was made that the world often looks to the Nordics for inspiration. While the Nordics are leading the innovation indexes and rankings for happiest countries, there's no better time for these important dialogs.

The 2025 Nordic Innovation Summit will focus on the theme of Resilience. Resilience is a common Nordic trait exemplified by the Finnish concept of “sisu.” Author Joanna Nylund introduces sisu as “stoic determination, hardiness, courage, bravery, willpower, tenacity and resilience.” Whether it is in hearing stories from early immigrants struggling to make a new life in America, Sámi people in the Nordics fighting for indigenous rights, shipwreck survivors, or modern-day astronauts orbiting the poles, sisu is always on display at the museum.

We look forward to hearing about and learning more inspiring examples of sisu at the Nordic Innovation Summit this month.

                                What happens here matters everywhere.

Most weeklong tech events have opportunities for entrepreneurs to make contacts and trade tips, serious sessions where CEOs and public officials share their visions, and happy hours where future deals are made. But how many “tech weeks” include a show-and-tell featuring a military-grade Jet Gun?

That was one of the bonus attractions during Seattle Space Week, a smorgasbord of events served up by Space Northwest and its partners.

Just as attendees were sitting down for Monday's opening session at the Pioneer Building in the heart of Pioneer Square, team members from Wave Motion Launch Corp. parked a box truck just outside the building and opened up the back to reveal the prototype jet blaster they're testing for the U.S. Army.

Two of the Everett, Wash.-based startup's co-founders, CEO Finn van Donkelaar and chief operating officer James Penna, stood in the truck and explained their project to a crowd that gathered around on the sidewalk.

Wave Motion's Jet Gun uses a concentrated blast of gas and small particles to propel a projectile at hypersonic speeds. Unlike a rocket ship, which has to carry its own propellant, the Jet Gun would blast the projectile (or, say, a satellite) up into the air (or, say, into space) from the ground. Wave Motion says the barrel-less blaster has the potential to be up to 100 times more compact than a rocket or conventional cannon of equivalent power.

The prototype gun is a steampunk-style contraption that's about 10 feet long.

“This is a demonstrator in the same way as SpaceX's Hopper, right?” Penna told the crowd. “It's a proof of concept [to show] that we can use this propulsion concept to at least make a vehicle go up and down, or wherever it wants to go. … Then, as we build larger ones that are more powerful, and we build multiples of them, we'll be able to project the jet.”

The prototype in the back of the truck was designed to blast out a jet at velocities ranging from five to 10 times the speed of sound, Penna said. “In the orbital prototype, it'll be a greater than Mach 20 stream of hellish steel and fire, extending for tens of kilometers through the atmosphere,” he said. “It'll look extremely cool.”

Wave Motion Launch was founded in 2020 and won a $1.35 million award from the U.S. Navy in 2022 to work on the Jet Gun. Last year, the company received a $1.6 million contract from the Army to support continued development. “Our business strategy is that we're doing first demos of the principle, because this is the first propulsion system of its kind that's been built in the world,” Penna said.

It seems reasonable to think that a blaster capable of unleashing a hypersonic stream of hellish steel and fire could be used as a weapon as well as a propulsion system. Van Donkelaar acknowledged that might well be something to consider. “Hopefully we'll pick up some military contracts with this as well,” he said.

Here are a few other highlights from Seattle Space Week:

Seattle Space Week concludes today with “Startup Pitches and Networking: Seattle Space Week Edition” at the Pioneer Building, followed by Space Week Karaoke at Golden Roosters in Pioneer Square. Registration is required for the pitch session (but probably not for the karaoke).

Trevor Noah is worried about where things are headed with controversial AI video generators.

The comedian and former Daily Show host said AI video apps like OpenAI's Sora could be “disastrous” if they continue to use people's likenesses without permission.

“I have to figure out what they're doing and how they're doing it,” he told GeekWire. “But I don't think it'll end well when they're not dealing with permissions.”

We caught up with Noah — Microsoft's “chief questions officer” — on Thursday after his appearance at the company's headquarters in Redmond, where he helped launch a new AI education initiative in Washington state.

OpenAI last week rolled out Sora 2, a new version of its AI video-generation system that creates hyper-realistic clips from text prompts or existing footage. The new version adds a “Cameo” feature that allows users to generate videos featuring human likenesses by uploading or referencing existing photos.

The upgrade has made Sora, available on an invite-only basis, one of the most viral consumer tech products of 2025 — it's the top free app on Apple's App Store.

It's also drawn intense pushback from major Hollywood talent agencies that have criticized the software for enabling the use of a person's image or likeness without explicit consent or compensation.

Meanwhile, AI-generated videos depicting deceased celebrities such as Robin Williams and George Carlin have sparked public outrage from their families.

Noah told GeekWire that “this could end up being the most disastrous thing for anyone and everyone involved.”

He referenced Denmark, which recently introduced legislation that would give individuals ownership of their digital likeness.

“I think the U.S. needs to catch up on that ASAP,” Noah said. 

Legal experts say the next wave of AI video tools — including those from Google and Meta — will test existing publicity and likeness laws. Kraig Baker, a Seattle-based media attorney with Davis Wright Tremaine, said the problem isn't likely to be deliberate misuse by advertisers but rather the flood of casual or careless content that includes people's likenesses, now made possible by AI. 

He added that the issue could be especially thorny for deceased public figures whose estates no longer actively manage image rights.

There are broader potential impacts, as New York Times columnist Brian Chen noted: “The tech could represent the end of visual fact — the idea that video could serve as an objective record of reality — as we know it. Society as a whole will have to treat videos with as much skepticism as people already do words.”

OpenAI published a Sora 2 Safety doc outlining consent-based likeness. “Only you decide who can use your cameo, and you can revoke access at any time,” the company says. “We also take measures to block depictions of public figures (except those using the cameos feature, of course).”

Sora initially launched with an opt-out policy for copyrighted characters. But in an update, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said that the company now plans to give “rightsholders more granular control over generation of characters” and establish a revenue model for copyright holders.

The surge of attention on AI video generators is creating opportunity for startups such as Loti, a Seattle company that helps celebrities, politicians, and other high-profile individuals protect their digital likeness.

“Everyone is concerned about how AI will use their likeness and they are looking for trusted tools and partners to help guide them,” said Loti CEO Luke Arrigoni.

He said Loti's business is “booming right now,” with roughly 30X growth in signups month-over-month. The startup raised $16.2 million earlier this year.

Israeli spyware maker NSO Group has confirmed to TechCrunch that a U.S. investment group has acquired the company.  

NSO spokesperson Oded Hershowitz told TechCrunch on Friday that “an American investment group has invested tens of millions of dollars in the company and has acquired controlling ownership.” 

Confirmation of the deal came soon after Israeli tech news website Calcalist reported Friday that a group led by Hollywood producer Robert Simonds agreed to purchase the surveillance tech maker in a deal valued in the tens of millions of dollars.  

Hershowitz declined to specify the amount invested, as well as who the investors are.  

“This investment does not mean that the company is moving out of Israeli regulatory or operational control,” said Hershowitz. “The company's headquarters and core operations remain in Israel. It continues to be fully supervised and regulated by the relevant Israeli authorities, including the Ministry of Defense and the Israeli regulatory framework.” 

(After sending the messages, Hershowitz declared his comments “off the record,” which requires both parties to agree to the terms in advance. TechCrunch is publishing the responses as there was no agreement made.)

In 2023, The Guardian reported that Simonds and an associate, through their investment firm, were exploring making a bid to take control of NSO. The deal never materialized. 

Calcalist reported that as part of the new deal with Simonds, NSO's co-founder and executive chairman Omri Lavie's involvement with the spyware maker will end. 

Lavie did not immediately comment when contacted by TechCrunch. Neither Simonds nor his Hollywood company STX Entertainment responded to our request for comment, either. 

NSO Group has been mired in controversy since its very beginning. 

Researchers at the digital rights group from the University of Toronto's Citizen Lab, Amnesty International, and others, have for years documented dozens of cases where NSO's government customers targeted and hacked journalists, dissidents, and human rights defenders in Hungary, India, Mexico, Morocco, Poland, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates, among others.  

NSO has long claimed that its spyware is designed to not target U.S. phone numbers, likely to avoid hurting its chances to enter the U.S. market. But the company was caught in 2021 targeting about a dozen U.S. government officials abroad. 

Soon after, the U.S. Commerce Department banned American companies from trading with NSO by putting the spyware maker on the U.S. Entities List. Since then, NSO has tried to get off the U.S. government's blocklist, as recently as May 2025, with the help of a lobbying firm tied to the Trump administration.  

John Scott-Railton, a senior researcher at the Citizen Lab who has helped investigate abuses of NSO's spyware for a decade, told TechCrunch he is concerned about the acquisition. 

“NSO is a company with a long history of going against American interests and supporting the hacking of American officials. In what world can such a person be trusted to properly oversee a company like NSO Group?” said Scott-Railton, referring to Simonds.  

“Going further, my real concern is that NSO has strenuously tried to enter the United States and sell their product to American police forces in U.S. cities. This dictator tech does not belong anywhere near Americans, or our constitutionally protect[ed] rights or freedoms.” 

NSO's ownership has exchanged hands before.  

Originally founded by Niv Karmi, Shalev Hulio, and Omri Lavie, NSO Group was acquired by U.S. private equity firm Francisco Partners in 2014. Lavie and Hulio retook control of the company in 2019 with help from European private equity firm Novalpina. Then, in 2021, the California-based Berkeley Research Group took over management of the fund. In 2023, Lavie retook control of NSO as majority owner.

Instagram head Adam Mosseri said AI will change who can be creative, as the new tools and technology will give people who couldn't be creators before the ability to produce content at a certain quality and scale. However, he also admitted that bad actors will use the technology for “nefarious purposes” and that kids growing up today will have to be taught that you can't believe something just because you saw a video of it.

The Meta executive shared his thoughts on how AI is impacting the creator industry at the Bloomberg Screentime conference this week. At the interview's start, Mosseri was asked to address the recent comments from creator MrBeast (Jimmy Donaldson). On Threads, MrBeast had suggested that AI-generated videos could soon threaten creators' livelihoods and said it was “scary times” for the industry.

Mosseri pushed back a bit at that idea, noting that most creators won't be using AI technology to reproduce what MrBeast has historically done, with his huge sets and elaborate productions; instead, it will allow creators to do more and make better content.

“If you take a big step back, what the internet did, among other things, was allow almost anyone to become a publisher by reducing the cost of distributing content to essentially zero,” Mosseri explained. “And what some of these generative AI models look like they're going to do is they're going to reduce the cost of producing content to basically zero,” he said. (This, of course, does not reflect the true financial, environmental, and human costs of using AI, which are substantial.)

In addition, the exec suggested that there's already a lot of “hybrid” content on today's big social platforms, where creators are using AI in their workflow but not producing fully synthetic content. For instance, they might be using AI tools for color corrections or filters. Going forward, Mosseri said, the line between what's real and what's AI generated will become even more blurred.

“It's going to be a little bit less like, what is organic content and what is AI synthetic content, and what the percentages are. I think there's gonna be actually more in the middle than pure synthetic content for a while,” he said.

As things change, Mosseri said Meta has some responsibility to do more in terms of identifying what content is AI generated. But he also noted that the way the company had gone about this wasn't the “right focus” and was practically “a fool's errand.” He was referring to how Meta had initially tried to label AI content automatically, which led to a situation where it was labeling real content as AI, because AI tools, including those from Adobe, were used as part of the process.

The executive said that the labeling system needs more work but that Meta should also provide more context that helps people make informed decisions.

While he didn't elaborate on what that newly added context would be, he may have been thinking about Meta's Community Notes feature, which is the crowdsourced fact-checking system launched in the U.S. this year, modeled on the one X uses. Instead of turning to third-party fact checkers, Community Notes and similar systems mark content with corrections or additional context when users who often share opposing opinions agree that a fact-check or further explanation is needed. It's likely that Meta could be weighing the use of such a system for flagging when something is AI generated but hasn't been labeled as such.

Rather than saying it was fully the platform's responsibility to label AI content, Mosseri suggested that society itself would have to change. 

“My kids are young. They're nine, seven, and five. I need them to understand, as they grow up and they get exposed to the internet, that just because they're seeing a video of something doesn't mean it actually happened,” he explained. “When I grew up, and I saw a video, I could assume that that was a capture of a moment that happened in the real world,” Mosseri continued. 

“What they're going to … need to think about who is saying it, who's sharing it, in this case, and what are their incentives, and why might they be saying it,” he concluded. (That seems like a heavy mental load for young children, but alas.)

In the discussion, Mosseri also touched on other topics about the future of Instagram beyond AI, including its plans for a dedicated TV app and its newer focus on Reels and DMs as its core features (which Mosseri said just reflected user trends), and how TikTok's changing ownership in the U.S. will impact the competitive landscape.

On the latter, he said that, ultimately, it's better to have competition, as TikTok's U.S. presence has forced Instagram to “do better work.” As for the TikTok deal itself, Mosseri said it's hard to parse, but it seems like how the app has been built will not meaningfully change.” 

“It's the same app, the same ranking system, the same creators that you're following — the same people. It's all sort of seamless,” Mosseri said of the “new” TikTok U.S. operation. “It doesn't seem like it's a major change in terms of incentives,” he added.

Famed roboticist and iRobot founder Rodney Brooks has sounded the alarm on a humanoid robot investment bubble. He's not the only one.

In a recent essay, Brooks calls out the billions of venture dollars being poured into humanoid robot companies like Figure. His take: Despite the amount of money being injected into the industry, humanoids won't be able to learn dexterity — or the fine motor movements with hands — rendering them essentially useless.

His take might surprise some, especially those VCs investing in the sector. But not the multiple robotics-focused VCs and AI scientists who have told TechCrunch in recent months that they don't expect to see wide adoption of humanoid robots for at least a few years — if not more than a decade.

Fady Saad, a general partner at robotics-focused VC Cybernetix Ventures and former co-founder of MassRobotics, told TechCrunch that beyond sending humanoids into space in place of human astronauts, he doesn't see a huge market yet.

“People who probably haven't seen humanoids before, or haven't kind of been closely following what's happening, they are impressed with what's happening now in humanoids, but we continue to be a little bit conservative and skeptical about the actual use case and the actual revenues that will be generated,” Saad said.

Saad is also concerned about safety, especially when humans and humanoid robots share the same space. Safety issues could arise from humanoids and humans working closely on a factory floor, or other industrial sites. Saad says those concerns mount when humanoids enter people's homes — a goal many humanoid companies are working toward.

“If this thing falls on pets or kids, it will hurt them,” Saad said. “This is just one aspect of a big hurdle that no one is paying attention to, or very few people are paying attention to. The other thing is, how many people are comfortable with having a humanoid in their home sitting there? What if it got hacked? What if it went crazy at night and started breaking things?”

The timeline for this technology also isn't clear — a crucial factor for VCs who have fund lifecycles and timelines to return capital to investors.

Sanja Fidler, the vice president of AI research at Nvidia, told TechCrunch in August that while it's hard to pin the development of humanoids to an exact timeline, she compared the current swell of interest to the excitement in the early days of self-driving cars.

“I mean, look at self-driving cars, in 2017 and 2016, I mean it felt tangible, right?” Fidler said at the time. “It still took them quite a few years to really scale and even now, no one really scaled to the entire world, full autonomy. It's hard. It's really hard to go and fully delivery on that technology.”

Nvidia chief scientist Bill Dally agreed in an interview with TechCrunch. Dally and Fidler's comments are especially notable as Nvidia is also pouring money into developing the infrastructure for humanoid companies to follow.

Seth Winterroth, a partner at Eclipse, said while it can be easy to get excited as each new technological development happens, or the latest demo drops, humanoids are incredibly complicated. He added that it will be a while before they reach their full capabilities.

“It's difficult to do software releases to six degrees of freedom systems; what we're talking about with some of these humanoids is 60-plus degrees of freedom systems,” Winterroth said, regarding a robot's ability to move on a 3D axis. “Then you need to be able to have good unit economics around that solution, such that you've got strong gross margin, such that you can be building an enduring business. I think we're pretty early.”

In most cases, humanoid robots aren't ready for the world yet, either.

Tesla is a great example of the struggles companies are running into. The company announced it was building its humanoid, Optimus, back in 2021. The following year, Tesla said the bot would be introduced in 2023.

That didn't happen. When the bot was introduced in 2024 at Tesla's “We, Robot” event, it was revealed later that the bots were largely being controlled by humans off scene. The company claims it will start selling the bots in 2026.

Robotics startup Figure, which was valued at $39 billion in a September fundraise, has also drawn skepticism regarding how many of its humanoids the company has actually deployed, a claim the company staunchly defends.

That doesn't mean humanoids won't have a future market or that the technology is not worth working on.

Brooks himself said he doesn't doubt that we will have humanoids in the future. But instead of what the market pictures when they hear humanoids, a robot with a human form, he predicts they'll likely have wheels and other inhuman features and won't be coming out for more than a decade.

There are startups working on the dexterity technology Brooks is skeptical humanoids will be able to reach, including Y Combinator-backed Proception and Loomia, which built a kit that can help robotics companies start to incorporate touch into their machines.

There are also numerous humanoid companies that are starting to take orders and gather interest in their robots. K-Scale Labs received more than 100 preorders for its humanoid bot in the first five days, surprising even the founders, CEO Benjamin Bolte told TechCrunch.

Hugging Face has also seen strong demand from developers for its two humanoid bots. The company opened up preorders for its smaller desktop version, the Reachy Mini, in July. The reaction was palpable. Just five days after opening orders on its Reachy Mini robots, Hugging Face had logged $1 million worth of sales.

The United Kingdom's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) on Friday designated Google with a special status in the market for online search that would enable the regulator to enforce stricter regulations.

The CMA has designated Google as having “strategic market status” in the search and search advertising markets, which means the company has such “a substantial and entrenched” position that it requires special regulations to ensure fair competition. 

“Google has had an unparalleled position in this digital activity for an extended period. Other traditional general search providers are significantly smaller than Google and have been for many years. Bing is the largest of these providers, but its current shares of queries and search advertising are both less than 5%. No traditional general search providers have materially grown relative to Google for at least fifteen years,” the CMA wrote in a report.

Although the designation does not mean that the CMA has found evidence of wrongdoing and does not introduce any immediate requirements, it does open the gates to launch further assessments and introduce interventions to change how Google runs its search services in the country, the CMA said. 

The designation covers Google's search and online search advertising services; its AI-enabled search features like AI Overviews and AI Mode, and the “Discover” feed and results, as well as the “Top Stories” and News tab. It does not cover the Google News app and website, and search syndication services are also out of scope.

The CMA, however, noted that while Google's Gemini AI assistant isn't covered by the designation at the moment, it will review the scope of the designation given uncertainty over how the AI search market is evolving. 

The regulator said it would launch a consultation on possible interventions later this year.

The move follows a nine-month investigation into the company launched earlier this year after the U.K.'s new digital markets competition regime came into force in January. The CMA was looking to prove if Google is enabling weak competition and “barriers to entry and innovation in search”; whether the company prefers its own services over those offered by third parties; and if it uses consumer data without their explicit consent. 

The CMA's roadmap of possible enforcement actions may include: enabling U.K. residents to choose and switch search engines via choice screens; implementing data portability systems; enforcing fair ranking of search results; ensuring proper attribution of publishers' work in search; and enabling consent mechanisms for Google's AI services.

Google, for its part, says that any interventions following the designation would harm innovation in the U.K. “The UK enjoys access to the latest products and services before other countries because it has so far avoided costly restrictions on popular services, such as Search. Retaining this position means avoiding unduly onerous regulations and learning from the negative results seen in other jurisdictions, which have cost businesses an estimated €114 billion,” the company wrote in a blog post.

“Many of the ideas for interventions that have been raised in this process would inhibit UK innovation and growth, potentially slowing product launches at a time of profound AI-based innovation. Others pose direct harm to businesses, with some warning that they may be forced to raise prices for customers,” it added.

Rishi Sunak, who served as the United Kingdom's prime minister from 2022 to 2024, has taken on senior advisory roles at Microsoft and Anthropic, The Guardian reports.  

Letters from the Parliament's office of the Advisory Committee on Business Appointments (Acoba) disclosing Sunak's appointments revealed concerns that the ex-Conservative PM's privileged information could “grant Microsoft an unfair advantage.”  

Sunak has some history with Microsoft, which has several active contracts with British government departments. In 2023, he unveiled a £2.5 billion deal with Microsoft to invest in new data centers and training in the U.K.

Acoba also noted that “there is a reasonable concern that your appointment could be seen to offer unfair access and influence within the U.K. government…given the ongoing debate about how to best regulate AI, and at a time of intense debate and lobbying around the world on what the approach should be.” 

Sunak said he would steer clear on advising on U.K. policy matters, stick to high-level perspectives on macro-economic and geopolitical trends, and avoid lobbying. He said he would divert his salary to the Richmond Project, a charity he founded with his wife earlier this year. 

The former PM also serves as a senior advisor to investment bank Goldman Sachs and speech writer for firms like Bain Capital and Makena Capital. 

Sunak isn't the first British politician to take on roles helping Silicon Valley tech giants navigate governmental affairs. Sunak's senior political adviser, Liam Booth-Smith, is also on Anthropic's payroll. And former Liberal Democrat Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg served as Meta's president of global affairs until January 2025.   

In the United States, the revolving door between Silicon Valley and the U.S. government is ever-active. At Meta, Clegg was replaced by Joel Kaplan, George W. Bush's former deputy chief of staff, and Dustin Carmack, a former adviser to Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, joined the firm's policy team in 2024. Microsoft's current president of global affairs is Lisa Monaco, former deputy attorney general under Joe Biden.

Posted:

In a development born of the government shutdown, the SEC announced Thursday that companies can proceed with IPOs using an obscure automatic approval process, now with the added bonus of skipping pricing information entirely.

What's happening is that with 90% of SEC staff furloughed, startups can file their paperwork and have it automatically become effective after 20 days. This option always existed; firms just rarely use it because they prefer having SEC reviewers actually look at their disclosures before going public. The difference here is that the SEC won't penalize companies for omitting pricing or “price-dependent information” during the shutdown, making this workaround more palatable.

Put another way, there's still vetting, just the kind that happens after retail investors have already bought a company's shares, which seems . . . not good, but maybe we'll be surprised to learn that investor protection works better after the money changes hands. 

Companies do remain legally liable for their disclosures, and the SEC can demand amendments later.

Then we had Internet2 which is backbone dedicated to research, again, not a tool for coordination or control.If you were online in the 90s, a popular refrain was that the internet sees censorship as damage and routes around it. It was very much operated as a free space for ideas. There was no centralization of platforms, no apps, and anyone could host whatever they wanted.Depending on your age, that is the internet built by your parents.

These alarmist messages only seem to come out only when you think you will be affected. When the people you don't care about are silenced, it's not only business as usual, but gas lighting articles are written about how it's not happening.Ignoring these issues 4 years ago led to what we have today. Many just don't care to fight it any longer because they know this is only about politics and not about freedom. it's the activist way.

This doesn't mean that AMPA receptors are the root cause of post-COVD brain fog, nor does it necessarily mean that drugs modulating AMPA receptors could reverse it. It only shows that this is one of the changes observed in patients reporting post-COVID brain fog. It could be a side effect of some other change or it could be part of a long cascade of changes.It also needs to be replicated further. I've read at least at dozen headlines claiming to have found the underlying cause of COVID brain fog in the past year and all of them pointed to different biomarkers.Consider this another piece of the puzzle, not a discovery of the underlying mechanism.

It doesn't say root cause, or drug target. It doesn't say reverse or cure. It quite specifically doesn't say “the basis”. The word basis doesn't have to refer to one root cause. It could be something foundational, but there can be many elements of a foundation. It certainly isn't the entire structure.I'd argue it's quite tame as academic press releases go.

The study only looked at one marker. It doesn't confirm that increased AMPA receptor density is the cause of decreased cognition. It only suggests that decreased cognition is correlated with increased AMPA receptor density.There are many processes in the body where reduced activation of a receptor system results in an increased number of those receptors. So don't conclude that this is the reason why patients have brain fog. I would guess it's just more of a symptom than a cause until there's more research

Hollywood didn't exist in 1700.

This is the entire goal of transactionalisn - alienating consumers from producers through intermediaries.So if using generative technology genuinely shifts consumer preferences then thats what's going to happen.The only way out of all of these problems is if the plurality of people choose to consume based on the holistic approach to understanding externalities, system dynamics and human community development.Never going to happen.I'll be interested to see what these Indonesians come up with.

Agree. But Hollywood is dying, both in a similar fashion and for a similar reason as the music industry.

The Internet destroyed that limitation.> it's primarily focused on maintaining labor infrastructure for people who join the “entertainment industry.”Draconian IP laws are part of this. Interestingly, if look you at things from the late 90's over the 2000's and 2010's, this factor didn't make the Internet less attractive as an entertainment option, but instead made non-celebrity culture something more people chose and cared about. Hence the rise of YouTube and social media.> History indicates that transactional consumers don't care about any supply chain, value steam etc…or labor share of a market.They don't, but people are tired of Hollywood franchise reboots. There was something on here about how anime is popular because it's actually doing new franchises instead of the same rehashed stuff, and it was absolutely right.GenAI, in the sense of being something used by financed producers, assuming it gets good enough for people to not notice too much, will much more easily fall into that trap.The real future is me, in 2045, signing on to Netflix, providing a couple inputs like talking about the type of movie I want to see, maybe a webcam recording me demonstrating some things in addition to just speaking what I want, and a GenAI generates one for me right then and there. Real people as celebrites won't exist anymore, memes will be the new celebrites: they'll all be characters other people request to see in generated movies, and their lifecycle will be about the same as Tiktok memes today. Theaters by this time will be bulldozed and have become mini nuclear power plants, with big NVIDIA logos on them.

The more we move, the more our muscle cells begin to make a memory of that exercise.

MIT Technology Review Explains: Let our writers untangle the complex, messy world of technology to help you understand what's coming next. You can read more from the series here.

“Like riding a bike” is shorthand for the remarkable way that our bodies remember how to move. Most of the time when we talk about muscle memory, we're not talking about the muscles themselves but about the memory of a coordinated movement pattern that lives in the motor neurons, which control our muscles. 

Yet in recent years, scientists have discovered that our muscles themselves have a memory for movement and exercise.

When we move a muscle, the movement may appear to begin and end, but all these little changes are actually continuing to happen inside our muscle cells. And the more we move, as with riding a bike or other kinds of exercise, the more those cells begin to make a memory of that exercise.

When we move a muscle, the movement may appear to begin and end, but all these little changes are actually continuing to happen inside our muscle cells.

We all know from experience that a muscle gets bigger and stronger with repeated work. As the pioneering muscle scientist Adam Sharples—a professor at the Norwegian School of Sport Sciences in Oslo and a former professional rugby player in the UK—explained to me, skeletal muscle cells are unique in the human body: They're long and skinny, like fibers, and have multiple nuclei. The fibers grow larger not by dividing but by recruiting muscle satellite cells—stem cells specific to muscle that are dormant until activated in response to stress or injury—to contribute their own nuclei and support muscle growth and regeneration. Those nuclei often stick around for a while in the muscle fibers, even after periods of inactivity, and there is evidence that they may help accelerate the return to growth once you start training again. 

Sharples's research focuses on what's called epigenetic muscle memory. “Epigenetic” refers to changes in gene expression that are caused by behavior and environment—the genes themselves don't change, but the way they work does. In general, exercise switches on genes that help make muscles grow more easily. When you lift weights, for example, small molecules called methyl groups detach from the outside of certain genes, making them more likely to turn on and produce proteins that affect muscle growth (also known as hypertrophy). Those changes persist; if you start lifting weights again, you'll add muscle mass more quickly than before.

In 2018, Sharples's muscle lab was the first to show that human skeletal muscle has an epigenetic memory of muscle growth after exercise: Muscle cells are primed to respond more rapidly to exercise in the future, even after a monthslong (and maybe even yearslong) pause. In other words: Your muscles remember how to do it.

A mind-controlled prosthetic feels more like a part of the wearer's body and promises to make walking easier.

Subsequent studies from Sharples and others have replicated similar findings in mice and older humans, offering further supporting evidence of epigenetic muscle memory across species and into later life. Even aging muscles have the capacity to remember when you work out.

At the same time, Sharples points to intriguing new evidence that muscles also remember periods of atrophy—and that young and old muscles remember this differently. While young human muscle seems to have what he calls a “positive” memory of wasting—“in that it recovers well after a first period of atrophy and doesn't experience greater loss in a repeated atrophy period,” he explains—aged muscle in rats seems to have a more pronounced “negative” memory of atrophy, in which it appears “more susceptible to greater loss and a more exaggerated molecular response when muscle wasting is repeated.” Basically, young muscle tends to bounce back from periods of muscle loss—“ignoring” it, in a sense—while older muscle is more sensitive to it and might be more susceptible to further loss in the future. 

Illness can also lead to this kind of “negative” muscle memory; in a study of breast cancer survivors more than a decade after diagnosis and treatment, participants showed an epigenetic muscle profile of people much older than their chronological age. But get this: After five months of aerobic exercise training, participants were able to reset the epigenetic profile of their muscle back toward that of muscle seen in an age-matched control group of healthy women.  

What this shows is that “positive” muscle memories can help counteract “negative” ones. The takeaway? Your muscles have their own kind of intelligence. The more you use them, the more they can harness it to become a lasting beneficial resource for your body in the future.

The idea of turning the drudgery of everyday cleaning chores into hands-free duties delegated to intelligent robots was the stuff of science fiction or cartoons until very, very recently. Now there are robot vacuums and mops seemingly everywhere, so the new challenge is finding the right one for you and your home. Dreame has quickly become one of the worldwide leaders in the field, renowned for their innovation and performance.

As another Amazon Prime Day pops up on the calendar, Dreame is offering huge discounts on five of their most advanced home cleaning machines from October 7-12, with even bigger savings available through Amazon promo codes. There's a Dreame machine for everyone, from robot vacuums that can climb stairs and heated wet/dry vacuum/mop combos to air purifiers that use advanced sensors and radar (yes, radar) to optimize the air quality in your home. Let's take a look at the five amazing machines that should be at the top of your Prime Day shopping lists.



The X50 Ultra (Complete) was the superstar of CES 2025, and this amazing vacuum/mop combo has lived up to the hype and then some. Where to begin with the massive technological steps forward taken with the X50 Ultra? The ProLeap System that allows the robot to scale steps and thresholds up to 2.3 inches high? The MopExtend RoboSwing tech that allows the X50 Ultra to reach over 1.57 inches into corners and edges to attack hidden dirt?

So many choices, and all good ones. The X50 Ultra uses Dreame's VersaLift Navigation — advanced LiDAR and AI combining to map your home in real time, including the best paths under furniture and around obstacles. That optimizes the area cleaned and prevents the robot from getting stuck — the bane of any robot vacuum owner.

Pet owners should take notice of the X50 Ultra's HyperStream™ Detangling DuoBrush, an ingenious combination of conical shape, rubber, and bristles that traps hair and dust better than the competition. It also keeps the rollers clear to prevent clogs, but Dreame doubles down on that with their AceClean™ DryBoard self-cleaning system that hits the mop pads with 20 high-temperature spray nozzles and then dries them automatically. No dampness, no bad smells, just a clean robot that's ready to tackle the next mess.

The Amazon deal on the X50 Ultra (Complete) cuts the price from $1,700 to $1,200, and when you use the code DMGMPD5OFF at checkout, you get another 5% off to bring your final price to just $1,140.

See X50 Ultra Complete at Amazon



The L50 Ultra is another of the newest elite-level Dreame models, loaded with the latest technology and smart features while packing a powerful 19,500Pa punch of Vormax suction to extract the smallest, deepest dirt from hard and carpeted surfaces.

Many of the world-class features of the X50 Ultra can also be found on the L50 Ultra — the retractable ProLeap legs that thwart obstacles up to 2.3 inches high, the HyperStream™ Detangling DuoBrush that's custom-made for pet owners (shaggy dogs and longhaired cats included), and the AceClean™ DryBoard docking system that cleans the mop with hot water and dries it with hot air.

The L50 Ultra also uses DualFlex Arm Technology to extend the robot's side brushes and mop pads into corners and other hard-to-reach areas, and it has TripleUp Tech to automatically lift the mop pads when the robot is vacuuming your carpets — that saves the mop pads from undue wear and prevents dirty mop pads from being dragged across your clean carpets. When your “lesser” features include AI-driven obstacle avoidance, LED path lighting, and app control with the Dreamehome app, you're dealing with a serious powerhouse robot cleaner.

From October 7-12 you can go to Amazon and buy the Dreame L50 Ultra for just $1,000 — a $400 price break from its regular retail rate, and the code DMGMPD5OFF at checkout drops that price by another 5% to just $950.

See L50 Ultra at Amazon



Hands-free robotic cleaning isn't just for your floors. Dreame's AirPursue PM20 extends thorough, intelligently adaptive cleaning to the air in your home. Rather than just run constantly at full blast, the AirPursue PM20 uses Enviro Detect Tech radar to sense when a person enters its cleaning zone — just over 16 feet — and automatically adjusts the airflow to give you the cleanest air when you're in range.

That range is generous — up to 1,883 square feet — and the AirPursue PM20 not only uses its four-layer filtration system to remove pollutants, allergens, and even bacteria, it also circulates the air with a refreshing breeze to provide comfort in hot climates and ventilated spaces, and can also act as a space heater when the temperature drops.

The comprehensive and powerful (400 m³/h of clean air) filtration provided by the AirPursue PM20 tackles 14 air pollutants and 9 types of common bacteria and viruses, which is a boon to allergy sufferers in particular. The LCD screen shows you the precise level of allergens and other contaminants and its progress in reducing them, and like Dreame's other top-level products, the PM20 has app control and voice assistance so you can adjust its settings and set or edit its schedule from anywhere.

The Amazon deal on the AirPursue PM20 running from October 7-12 drops its price from $900 to $720.

See AirPursue PM20 at Amazon



The H15 Pro Heat is the next level of wet/dry floor cleaning, fusing the vacuum and mop combo powers of the H12 Pro with cleansing heat. The H15 Pro Heat uses ThermoRinse tech to hit your floors with a grime-busting burst of 185°F hot water, with the brush reaching 131°F, for deep and comprehensive sanitizing.

That level of cleaning is quickly undone if you go back over it with a dirty mop, of course, so the H15 Pro Heat's cleaning duties extend to its base station, where the brush is cleaned in boiling 212°F water, and then automatically dried so your next mess gets tackled with a clean, dry machine. It's as hygienic a performance as you'll find in a wet/dry vac at this price point.

That price point gets a $300 drop at Amazon from Oct. 7-12, from $900 to $600.

See H15 Pro Heat at Amazon



Is it possible that buying a robot vacuum would make you miss pushing a cleaning machine yourself? We've heard crazier things. But the Dreame H12 Pro isn't an old-school manual push vacuum — it's a wet and dry cleaning machine that does the work of a standard vacuum and a wet vac, allowing you to replace two bulky machines with this one sleek, lightweight one.

The H12 Pro uses a dual-edged brush to get into corners and along baseboards far better than standard vacuums so no dirt can hide, and it also intelligently detects the amount of mess and adjusts the suction accordingly. As a wet-dry vac, the H12 Pro has a 900mL water tank and up to 35 minutes of runtime before it needs to recharge. (Yes, it's cordless.) It's also self-cleaning, able to wash and dry its brush in just an hour — there's little to no chance you'll find a hand-operated wet or dry vac capable of tackling that chore.

The Amazon deal running on the H12 Pro might be the best of the bunch, dropping the price from $450 to $230.

Today's PCs cost more than they ever did. While you can thank President Donald Trump's obsession with tariffs for the most recent price spikes, there are even more headaches on the way. The next wave of PCs coming in 2026 may be even more expensive as countries shoulder-check each other for AI and compute dominance. As always, shit rolls downhill, and all of us sitting at the bottom can't help but get sullied.

Trump's nonsensical tariffs have only intensified the budding trade war between China and the U.S. The PC market is caught in the middle. China could be making moves to restrain the export of rare-earth elements. The Financial Times reported China's commerce ministry is requiring foreign companies to get approval to export magnets or other technologies containing small amounts of rare-earth elements mined in the country. These would include elements used in magnets necessary for creating HDDs. Other elements used when creating the LED backlights in LCD panels could also be restricted. China is responding to similar rules set by the U.S. to block semiconductors, especially AI training chips, from going to other countries.

According to the U.S. Geological Survey, most of the world's rare earth elements come from Chinese mines. The U.S. can only claim 11.5% of global output. We already have an idea of what chips Intel and Qualcomm are bringing to the table for the next generation of personal computers slated to arrive in 2026. While Intel has been talking up its plans for the U.S.-based chip manufacturing, acquiring the materials for making those chips is an international endeavor. Analysts have said that the restrictions on some rare earth materials will certainly impact the production of memory chips.

That's a bad sign, as memory is already experiencing price hikes. Last week, Tom's Hardware reported how SSDs, DRAM, and HDDs were being swallowed up by the ballooning demand for AI data centers. This memory shortage has the potential to spike prices for PC parts in the near future. It won't just impact those planning to build their new desktop, it could push prices of all consumer-end PCs even higher than they are now. Tom's Hardware points to data center operations like OpenAI's Stargate demanding hundreds of thousands more DRAM wafers per month, equalling 40% of global DRAM output. And that's just one project. Meta, Microsoft, and many other major tech companies are building up AI data centers all over the U.S. and the world. Small town communities are desperately trying to fight back against these companies leeching off their electrical grid and water infrastructure.

It's the smaller companies that will see the impact first. This month, Raspberry Pi—which makes small single-board computers—pointed to rising memory prices for its $5 to $10 increase on 4GB and 8GB products. Now, imagine those $50 to $100 SBCs scaled up to the cost of modern PCs demanding 16 to 32GB of RAM on the low end. Modern laptops have been increasing the amount of both RAM and storage in response to AI's computing demands. Apple, for instance, finally made 16GB of RAM standard in its M4 MacBook Air models, mostly to help it process current and future Apple Intelligence features.

If you're looking for a similar situation, cast your gaze back a few years during the height of the covid-19 pandemic, when crypto mining became such a big industry, it led to a mass shortage of graphics cards the world over. Prices for PC parts spiked, and scalpers made the reseller market a living hell. The big daddy of GPUs, Nvidia, went as far as to rerelease older graphics cards to board partners just so they could launch new PCs. Country after country started cracking down on crypto miners' hoarding of electricity and water to fuel their hunt for Bitcoin. But now, in the age of AI, similar shortages may be coming for more than just GPUs.

Will PC makers explain to consumers why their laptops and computers cost more than they did in 2025? Not likely, no. The arrival of Trump's tariffs in April this year left companies scrambling. Laptop makers like Asus and Lenovo quietly raised prices on multiple new products, including their Lenovo Legion Go S and ROG Ally X, so they now cost $50 to $100 more than their original proposed price point. Handhelds with current higher-end chips, the $1,350 Legion Go 2 and $1,000 ROG Xbox Ally X, are now far more expensive than their past models. Buying anything now means accepting higher prices. Waiting on your hands could mean you end up paying even more.

Nvidia says the firm was legit.

A Singaporean company with clear Chinese connections spent roughly $2 billion on Nvidia AI processors — and allegedly made them available for Chinese companies or re-exported them to China, according to a recent New York Times investigation. Companies from Singapore have long been suspected of procuring restricted AI accelerators from Nvidia to ship to China, bypassing U.S. sanctions. Although a few smuggling networks have been found, establishing a direct link has been tenuous until now.

In 2024, Singapore-based company Megaspeed was led by Alice Huang (no relation to Jensen Huang, chief executive of Nvidia), who was a little-known player in the AI or hardware industries, but who attended a party with the CEO of Nvidia at Computex 2024 after committing to buy $2 billion worth of Nvidia GPUs over the next year. Megaspeed emerged in 2023 when 7Road, a Chinese gaming and cloud-computing firm backed by state investors, created an offshore unit in Singapore. The new entity began purchasing massive quantities of restricted Nvidia AI GPUs, such as H100 and H800, which are officially not accessible to buyers from China.

A curious wrinkle is that Megaspeed did not purchase Nvidia hardware directly, but its procurements originated from Aivres Systems, a California-based arm of Inspur, a major Chinese technology company previously sanctioned by the U.S. for supplying the Chinese military with supercomputing hardware. Because Aivres operates as a U.S. company, it could lawfully purchase Nvidia products and resell them as long as they met U.S. export rules (which it did), exploiting a regulatory loophole that separated Inspur's American entity from its blacklisted parent.

Megaspeed allegedly routed these acquisitions to facilities in Indonesia and Malaysia, which belong to Speedmatrix, its subsidiary. These facilities allegedly enabled cloud access to restricted AI GPUs to entities from China, or simply re-exported them to the People's Republic, according to the NYT, citing U.S. officials, though no definitive proof has been made public. Singaporean police reportedly told NYT that Megaspeed is being investigated for breaching local laws, but didn't say which ones.

An inspection by the U.S. Bureau of Industry and Security at Megaspeed's Malaysian data center in late 2024 raised further suspicion. Inspectors reportedly found Nvidia servers and GPUs still sealed in their crates, an unusual practice for AI data centers, suggesting the technology might be awaiting re-export. Following that visit, American officials raised concerns with Megaspeed's Singaporean and Malaysian counterparts and began coordinating enforcement actions. Meanwhile, reporters found Megaspeed's offices nearly empty: two staff in Singapore who did not know what their company was doing, a tiny Malaysian storefront with no engineers, and neighbors unaware of its purpose. Records still traced ownership to shell firms run from Shanghai.

By mid-2025, Megaspeed halted all hardware orders from Nvidia after regional crackdowns on AI-hardware exports. Once planning another $3.2 billion in Nvidia systems, it stopped buying in July when probes expanded and its executive, Alice Huang, quietly departed.

Nvidia said its checks found Megaspeed legally qualified and showed no signs of diversion. It added that Megaspeed was wholly owned and operated by a company based outside China and had no shareholders in China. However, former U.S. officials questioned by the NYT argued its links to China and sanctioned firms should have barred sales of restricted hardware to the company. Still, considering the fact that Aivres managed to procure AI GPUs from Nvidia in the U.S., it could have used a different shell company to ship the hardware outside of America to a gray zone in Asia.

Port inspections mark an escalation in the battle over compute.

Chinese customs authorities have launched a sweeping crackdown on Nvidia chip shipments, according to reporting by The Financial Times published October 9. The report says enforcement teams have been deployed at major ports to inspect data-center hardware, with a specific focus on Nvidia's H20 and RTX 6000D — chips designed to comply with U.S. export controls but now under fresh scrutiny from Beijing.

The inspections, which began in recent weeks, are reportedly being coordinated by the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC), with assistance from customs officials. The campaign initially targeted the H20 and RTX 6000D, but has since broadened to include “all advanced semiconductor products.” The FT says that officials are focused on stopping smuggled U.S. chips from reaching domestic data centers. Nvidia declined to comment when contacted by Tom's Hardware.

China's pressure on the H20 is especially notable. Announced last year as a tailored workaround to avoid falling afoul of Washington's updated export rules, the H20 had only recently begun shipping in volume to Chinese server OEMs. Given that the likes of ByteDance and Alibaba were reportedly told in mid-September to halt further H20 orders, some or all of those shipments will now undoubtedly be held up or blocked indefinitely.

These inspections are likely to hit China's gray and refurbishment market, which has leaned on repurposed A100 and H100 boards as H20 access tightened, with underground repair shops servicing hundreds of accelerators each month. The Financial Times previously reported at least a billion dollars' worth of high-end Nvidia processors entering the country in the three months after tighter U.S. rules, often through indirect routes. A customs sweep could directly target that pipeline.

At the same time, China's homegrown roadmap is real but uneven. China's decision to begin cracking down on imports might reflect a growing confidence in its domestic hardware, but while domestic accelerators are ramping up at Chinese fabs, bottlenecks exist in HBM supply and overall fab capacity. This suggests near-term friction for data-center operators with more delays for inbound H20 RTX 6000D shipments on one side — that may well never reach them — and slower-than-hoped rollouts of homegrown silicon on the other.

The H20's own status also remains unsettled. Nvidia has told some suppliers to pause H20-related work amid changing rules, while exploring a successor that would comply with U.S. controls. If that successor slips or ships in limited volume, the practical effect of China's crackdown will be felt twice over, with fewer legal Nvidia pathways and a harder environment for gray-market cards.

Microsoft's biggest project in the state is still going ahead

Microsoft has cancelled its initial plan of building a data center in Caledonia, Wisconsin, after residents and elected officials objected to the plan. According to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, Redmond is cancelling its application for the current site, although it's still looking at building one in a different location in Caledonia or in another part of Racine County.

“Based on the community feedback we heard, we have chosen not to move forward with this site,” Microsoft said to the publication. “We remain committed to investing in Southeast Wisconsin and look forward to working with the Village of Caledonia and Racine County leaders to identify a site that aligns with community priorities and our long-term development goals.”

Microsoft's plan for the original Caledonia site, called Project Nova, was to build a 244-acre facility containing three data center structures and a 15-acre electrical substation. Data Center Dynamics reports that the company planned to construct it a little over a mile west of the We Energies Oak Creek Power Plant. This makes it a convenient location, especially as data centers consume a ton of electricity.

The residents' complaints were not listed in the news report, but it's not hard to imagine their concerns. Data centers are notorious for causing spikes in power bills. Even if the affected community can afford to pay more in electricity bills, they're also known to reduce the power quality in the area, affecting the lifespan of appliances and other electrical equipment in surrounding homes.

“I commend Microsoft for listening to the community,” Village Trustee Fran Martin told Data Center Dynamics. “And for also addressing the concerns that the community had and that I had about that particular site.” While Redmond is no longer pushing forward with the current location, it seems to still be looking to build Project Nova in Southeast Wisconsin, particularly within the general area of Racine County.

Microsoft is already moving forward with another data center project just south of Caledonia in Mount Pleasant. The company dubbed it the “world's most powerful” AI data center, set to go online next year. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said that it will have more performance than the current fastest supercomputer, which is likely a dig at Musk's Colossus. Given that the xAI site in Memphis, Tennessee, already uses 300 MW of power, with plans to hit 1 GW in the near future, it's safe to say that Microsoft's Wisconsin data centers could use even more electricity.

That's a lot of AI FLOPS

Microsoft has just upgraded its Azure cloud platform with Nvidia's Blackwell Ultra, deploying what it calls the world's first large-scale GB300 NVL72 supercomputing cluster. This cluster includes several racks housing exactly 4,608 GB300 GPUs connected by NVLink 5 switch fabric, which is then interconnected via Nvidia's Quantum-X800 InfiniBand networking fabric across the entire cluster. This allows a single NVL72 rack to have a total memory bandwidth of 130 TB/s, with each rack providing 800 Gb/s of interconnect bandwidth per GPU.

The world's first large-scale @nvidia GB300 NVL72 supercomputing cluster for AI workloads is now live on Microsoft Azure. The deployment connects 4,600+ NVIDIA Blackwell Ultra GPUs using next-gen InfiniBand network—built to train and deploy advanced AI models faster than… pic.twitter.com/CmmDtcrlwnOctober 9, 2025

The 4,608 number, specified by Nvidia, denotes 64x GB300 NVL72 systems at play here, considering each rack has 72 Blackwell GPUs and 36 Grace CPUs (totaling 2,592 Arm cores). That would technically put it way behind a full hyperscale expansion, but this still marks a significant milestone for Nvidia's Grace Blackwell GB300, which recently set new benchmark records in inference performance. Microsoft says this cluster will be dedicated to OpenAI workloads, allowing for advanced reasoning models to run even faster and enable model training in “weeks instead of months.”

At rack level, each NVL72 system is said to deliver 1,440 petaflops of FP4 Tensor performance, powered by 37 terabytes of unified “fast memory,” which breaks down to 20 TB HBM3E for the GPU, and 17 TB LPDDR5X for the Grace CPU. As mentioned earlier, this memory is pooled together using NVLink 5 to make each rack work as a single, unified accelerator capable of 130 TB/s of direct bandwidth. The memory throughput is one of the most impressive parts of the GB300 NVL72, so it's important to understand how it works.

The Quantum-X800 InfiniBand platform enables each of the 4,608 intra-connected GPUs to have a bandwidth of 800 Gb/s at the rack-to-rack level. In the end, every single GPU becomes connected, across racks and within.

 




The GB300 NVL72 cluster is liquid-cooled, using standalone heat exchangers and facility loops designed to minimize water usage under intense workloads. Nvidia says Microsoft needed to reimagine every layer of its data center for this deployment, and Microsoft happily points out how this is just the first of many clusters to come that will spread GB300 across the globe, taking it to full hyperscale potential. OpenAI and Microsoft already use GB200 clusters for training models, so this serves as a natural extension of their exclusive partnership.

Nvidia itself is heavily invested in OpenAI, with both recently signing a Letter of Intent (LoI) for a major strategic partnership that will see the chipmaker pour $100 billion into OpenAI, progressively. On the other hand, OpenAI will use Nvidia GPUs for its next-gen AI infrastructure, deploying at least 10 gigawatts (GW) worth of accelerators, starting with Vera Rubin next year. So, this GB300 NVL72 supercluster can be looked at as a precursor, almost materializing that investment since Microsoft is the one deploying the cluster for OpenAI, using Nvidia hardware.

Did TechInsights get banned for looking too deeply into Huawei?


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


The Ministry of Commerce of the People's Republic of China just added several prominent Western companies to its Unreliable Entity List, including the research firm TechInsights. This Canada-based company was one of the institutions that revealed Huawei used TSMC to build the Ascend 910B chip despite American sanctions, resulting in a possible $1-billion fine for the Taiwanese chip maker. According to the announcement by the Ministry of Commerce [machine translated] (via Bloomberg), TechInsights and all the other companies in its list organizations and individuals within China are prohibited “from engaging in transactions, cooperation, and other activities with the aforementioned entities, especially transmitting data or providing sensitive information to these entities.”

TechInsights and all its subsidiaries across the globe are included in the ban. But what's interesting is that the research firm has been specifically mentioned in the government announcement, and that most of the other companies on the list are defense contractors and aerospace companies like Elbit Systems of America and BAE Systems. There's also a smattering of anti-drone companies, like Dedrone and Epirus, which developed the Leonidas microwave system that can take down drone swarms.

“Foreign entities such as Dedrone by Axon and TechInsights and their affiliates have defied China's strong objections to engage in activities such as so-called military-technical cooperation with Taiwan, made malicious remarks concerning China, and assisted foreign governments in suppressing Chinese companies,” China said in another statement.

It's understandable for China to add all the other companies to its Unreliable Entity List, especially given that most of them have defense projects and work with the military forces of the nation's rivals, like the U.S. and Taiwan. However, TechInsights isn't a military or defense contractor — it's primarily a semiconductor intelligence firm that specializes in reverse engineering and teardowns, plus market analysis.

The primary reason why it may have been added to the list is that it investigated Huawei, which is one of China's crown jewels when it comes to tech companies. Although the country's semiconductor industry has taken strides in recent years, TechInsight's investigations in 2023 and 2024 revealed Huawei's reliance on technologies and chips from TSMC, Samsung, and SK hynix, which might've contradicted Beijing's strategic push for semiconductor self-reliance.

Because it's located outside of China, TechInsights will likely still be able to make teardowns of Chinese tech it can acquire and publish its findings. Still, we're unsure how China's announcement will affect its business operations, especially as the company has not released any statement at the time of writing.

 October 10, 2025  

Clinicians and researchers continue to address unproven and debunked claims about the origins of autism — most notably that vaccines and prenatal acetaminophen use may increase the risk for the disorder.

After the Trump administration released a controversial report on autism spectrum disorder (ASD) last month, many autism experts and medical societies pointed out that the rise in autism prevalence and its potential causes are not yet fully understood.

Recent research has revealed new information on genetic, environmental, and other factors that influence risk, and projects funded through the recently announced National Institute of Health's Autism Data Science Initiative (ASDI) could further clarify the disorder's complex origins.

Meanwhile, clinicians, patients, and caregivers are asking: What is currently known — and unknown — about the prevalence and causes of autism? 

The CDC regularly compiles data on ASD prevalence through the Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring (ADDM) Network. The findings are considered to be among the most reliable snapshots of autism rates in children.

The CDC's most recent data from the 2022 ADDM surveillance cycle are based on 393,353 8-year-olds across 16 US sites. The report showed that ASD affected 1 in 31 children (32.2 per 1000) in 2022, up from 1 in 36 in 2020 and 1 in 150 in 2000. ASD continues to be more common in boys than girls (ratio 3.4:1).

ASD prevalence was higher among Asian or Pacific Islander, Black, and Hispanic children than White children, continuing a pattern first observed in 2020.

Children born in 2018 were more likely to be diagnosed by age 48 months compared with those born in 2014, suggesting increased early identification consistent with historical patterns.

CDC investigators noted several factors that may be driving the increase, including broader diagnostic criteria, increased screening, greater awareness among parents and pediatricians, reduced stigma and increase acceptance, and improved access to specialized services.

Together, these shifts mean children who may have been overlooked in previous decades are now being identified.

Other potential drivers include increasing paternal age (and to a lesser extent maternal age), which is a known risk factor: older fathers tend to accumulate more de novo mutations in sperm.

In addition, more preterm or low-birth-weight infants are surviving now than decades ago; prematurity is itself a risk factor for neurodevelopmental differences.

The autism report released by the Trump administration claimed that prenatal use of acetaminophen causes autism, but experts say a causal link between the two isn't supported by evidence.

Studies suggest that acetaminophen can cross the placenta and may influence pathways involved in fetal brain development, including prostaglandin and endocannabinoid signaling. Oxidative stress and hormonal effects have also been proposed as potential mechanism, but none of these hypotheses have been proven.

One study cited in the Trump administration's report was a comprehensive review of 46 studies that showed that the overall body of evidence is consistent with an association between prenatal acetaminophen exposure and increased neurodevelopmental diagnoses, including ASD. However, the researchers noted that “observational limitations preclude definitive causation.”

The report also pointed to results from a Johns Hopkins or NIH-funded study that measured cord-blood acetaminophen metabolites, which is an objective exposure marker. Researchers found higher metabolite levels were associated with an increased likelihood of subsequent attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or autism diagnoses but noted that the pattern was dose-dependent and highlighted that only one measurement of cord-blood acetaminophen levels, taken at birth, was used in the analysis.

“Given that the half-life of acetaminophen in adults is < 3 hours, the cord plasma measurement may at most reflect maternal use of acetaminophen during the peripartum period,” the researchers wrote.

Meanwhile, the largest, most rigorous epidemiological study to date showed no effect of prenatal acetaminophen exposure and ASD risk after accounting for family confounding — factors shared within families, such as genetics and environment, that could potentially influence neurodevelopmental outcomes.

This 2024 Swedish study of 2.4 million children (1995-2019) included sibling data to control for genetic and environmental factors. The researchers found no relationship between in utero exposure to acetaminophen and subsequent diagnoses of autism, ADHD, or intellectual disability. This suggests there is no causal link between acetaminophen and autism, they wrote.

Methodological concerns also exist in studies that do report a link. In a practice advisory published in late September, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists highlighted recurring issues, including reliance on self-reported use (recall bias), inconsistent outcome measures, limited data on dose or timing, failure to fully control genetic or familial factors, and potential confounding by the indications for acetaminophen use, such as fever, infection, or pain — which themselves can influence neurodevelopment.

“Pregnant women have few safe, over-the-counter options available to them to treat pain and inflammation. Acetaminophen is one. Not using it judiciously and when needed may actually increase risks to pregnant women and their babies,” David Mandell, ScD, with the Coalition of Autism Scientists and Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, told Medscape Medical News.

Decades of high-quality evidence has shown that vaccines do not cause autism.

A large Danish cohort of 657,461 children showed no increased autism risk after measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine (fully adjusted hazard ratio, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.85-1.02), and no signal in children with autistic siblings and other high-risk subgroups or specific postvaccine time windows.

A US claims-based cohort of roughly 95,000 children showed that even among children who have an older sibling with autism, MMR was not associated with ASD risk.

Pooled data from cohort and case-control studies showed no association between vaccines, including MMR, vaccine components, or multiple vaccines and autism.

After thimerosal was removed from nearly all US childhood vaccines, a study from California showed that autism diagnoses continued to rise in the state — contradicting the hypothesis that thimerosal was a contributing factor.

So why does the vaccine-autism myth persist? Experts cite timing coincidence as one reason. Early symptoms of autism often emerge around the same age routine vaccines are administered.

This claim was further fueled by a study from the 1990s which sparked widespread concern and eroded trust in vaccines. That study was formally retracted and exposed as fraudulent, but its narrative lingers.

A robust body of evidence dating back to the 1970s points to a substantial genetic component in autism etiology.

Recent research has identified four biologically and clinically distinct subtypes of autism, each with associated genetic signals. The subtypes are: Social and Behavioral Challenges, Mixed ASD with Developmental Delay, Moderate Challenges, and Broadly Affected.

Children in all four classes had a significant burden of common and rare genetic variants, but researchers found differing signals that defined each autism subtype. These four subtypes also differed in terms of the genetic variants' effects on brain development.

Other recent research indicates that autism diagnosed in early childhood differs genetically and developmentally from autism identified later, challenging the view that autism is a single, uniform disorder.

Children diagnosed early are more likely to have social and behavioral challenges in infancy and early childhood, while those diagnosed later have higher rates of comorbid conditions such as ADHD and depression. The two subtypes also exhibit distinct genetic profiles.

“With advances in genetic technology and analytic methods, hundreds of specific genetic changes have now been identified and are commonly accepted to cause autism,” Alexander Kolevzon, MD, clinical director of the Seaver Autism Center at Mount Sinai in New York City, told Medscape Medical News.

Yet twin studies have shown that if one identical twin has autism, the other may not about 10% of the time, “leaving room for some environmental influence,” Kolevzon said.

“Environmental effects may be acting through epigenetic mechanisms where certain factors, as of yet unidentified, influence the expression of genes. However, despite being an active area of study, no widespread environmental effects have been reliably established to date,” he added.

Maternal metabolic conditions may also play a role. In April 2025, a meta-analysis of 202 studies including more than 56 million mother-child pairs showed that children born to mothers with gestational diabetes were 25% more likely to be diagnosed with autism. Researchers have also linked autism risk to preterm birth and advanced parental age.

It's thought that these exposures likely act as modifiers — influencing gene expression, immune activation, or neuronal development — rather than standalone causes.

An emerging area of research focuses on the gut microbiome and whether gut dysbiosis may contribute to autism risk.

“There have been several studies showing that there is gut dysbiosis in autism, and that it correlates with autism symptoms,” Lisa Aziz-Zadeh, PhD, professor, Department of Psychology, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, told Medscape Medical News. “However, we know that any behavioral differences must be via gut microbiome or metabolite interactions with the human nervous system,” she said.

In a study published earlier this year, Aziz-Zadeh's team was the first to identify links between gut microbial tryptophan metabolites, autism symptoms, and brain activity in individuals with ASD, particularly in brain regions associated with interoceptive processing. This points to a “mechanistic model by which gut metabolites may impact autism,” she said.

Interventions targeting gut imbalances — such as dietary changes, probiotics, prebiotics, or fecal transplants — could potentially be beneficial, said Aziz-Zadeh. However, it remains unclear whether there is a critical window for such interventions, such as during prenatal development or early childhood. More research must be done to answer this question, she added.

In another recent study, microbiota transfer therapy led to significant improvements in gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, autism-related symptoms, and gut microbiota in children with autism. The effects of the initial treatment on both gut microbiota and GI symptoms were maintained at 2-year follow-up, with continued improvement in autism-like behaviors, the researchers reported.

As the recipients of ADSI grants begin their work, the initiative's $50 million investment holds promise for uncovering new insights into autism's causes and mechanisms. By supporting these diverse research projects, ADSI aims to deepen understanding of ASD and ultimately guide more effective strategies for diagnosis, intervention, and care.

It also aims to leverage large-scale data to identify and investigate potential contributors to autism's causes and rising prevalence and the efficacy of existing treatments.

Among the 13 funded projects is one examining how causal inference – the use of data to examine causal relationships – can be used to study early-life factors that may cause autism, influence prevalence, or explain variations in traits and functioning among individuals with autism.

“We are bringing in newer techniques from causal inference that do a better job of teasing apart cause from association,” principal investigator Amy Cochran, PhD, assistant professor, Departments of Population Health Sciences and Mathematics, University of Wisconsin-Madison, told Medscape Medical News.

“We want to generate stronger evidence about the early-life factors that may — or may not — be contributing to autism, and how they shape the diverse experiences of autistic people, so we can better prioritize public health resources and interventions,” Cochran added.

Another ASDI project will use large-scale data on genes and environmental exposures to examine the link between autism and environmental factors and identify specific genetic variants that may interact with those factors.

“If long-term clinical outcome of a genetic disorder is influenced by an environmental factor, that represents a condition that could be modified to improve outcomes,” principal investigator Jonathan Sebat, PhD, professor of psychiatry and cellular and molecular medicine, University of California San Diego (UCSD), told Medscape Medical News.

Sebat's lab at UCSD has pioneered genetic approaches to identify autism genes.

“We were one of two groups that first showed how a father's age causes mutations in sperm and we have since unraveled a variety of genetic factors that explain the effect of parental age on autism risk,” Sebat said. “So this grant gives us an opportunity to expand this work to rigorously determine which environmental factors have real causal effects, and what are the mechanisms.”

The US FDA has granted a De Novo Classification for the Biolinq Shine, a novel real-time glucose sensor for people with type 2 diabetes (T2D) not on insulin.

The new classification allows the company to market the product in the US as a medical device, requiring a prescription. This new category of biosensors operates autonomously, working right out of the box with or without a phone or mobile app, using an integrated glucose display on the wearable device. Further data for other metrics, such as activity and sleep, are available with a mobile app.

The glucose data is displayed via a primary color-coded LED display, with blue for 70-180 mg/dL (ie, time in range), yellow for more than 180 mg/dL, and red for less than 70 mg/dL. Rather than an introducer needle, it uses a shallow microsensor embedded just below the skin surface. The device is worn on the forearm for 5 days.

Diabetes technology expert David T. Ahn, MD, Chief of Diabetes Services for Hoag Hospital, Newport Beach, California, told Medscape Medical News that the Biolinq Shine “represents a novel category in glucose monitoring that I feel works as a wellness-oriented device incorporating elements of continuous glucose sensing rather than a medical [continuous glucose monitor] adapted for wellness. Compared to a CGM, it might seem lacking with a 5-day wear period and no specific glucose values, but compared to an Apple Watch or Oura Ring or as a complement to them, it starts to make sense.”

Ahn added, “by focusing on time-in-range rather than precise glucose numbers, Biolinq is encouraging a paradigm shift — simplifying metabolic feedback for a broader audience while still offering meaningful insight. I see this as an early but important step toward smaller, simpler, more affordable, and more integrated metabolic sensors in the future.”

The Biolinq Shine is expected to be available in 2026.

Ahn has received speaker's and/or consulting fees from Abbott, Ascensia, Lilly, Mannkind, Insulet, Novo, Sequel, and Xeris. He has received consulting and advisory fees from Lilly, Ascensia, and Mannkind.

Hi, everyone. Dr Chandrasekaran here. Today, we're going to talk about lung cancer screening. 

Lung cancer screening can save a life. Lung cancer is the second most common cause of cancer in the US between women and men. Lung cancer screening should be offered to patients who are between the ages of 50 and 80 years, have a 20 pack-year smoking history or more, and have quit within the last 15 years.

It is important to remember to continue screening them annually with a low-dose CT scan unless they turn 81, they have a new diagnosis that makes them unamenable to any type of surgery, or they have stopped smoking for 15 years within that timeframe. 

It's important to also encourage them to stop smoking, to work with them to make sure they receive the vaccinations that are needed, and to monitor for any other types of constitutional symptoms when they do come into the clinic.

Nearly everyone who went on to suffer a heart attack, stroke, or heart failure already had at least one traditional cardiovascular risk factor above the optimal threshold before the event, according to a large study of people in South Korea and the US.

This finding contradicts some recent studies indicating the number of people with cardiovascular disease who did not have any of the standard modifiable risk factors (SMuRFs) was rising. Those data also suggested these “SMuRF-less” patients tend to have worse outcomes than those with traditional risk factors.

This seemed unlikely to Philip Greenland, MD, a cardiologist at Northwestern University in Chicago, given how prevalent these risk factors are in the population.

“It was incomprehensible to us that we could have people without at least some exposure to nonoptimal risk factors,” he told Medscape Medical News.

Greenland and his colleagues looked at the four SMuRFs — blood pressure, cholesterol, glucose levels, and smoking status — and focused on risk factor levels shy of the thresholds for diagnosis but above ideal levels, such as cholesterol above 200 mg/dL vs the clinical threshold of 240 mg/dL for hypercholesterolemia.

The researchers evaluated the health records of more than 9 million people in South Korea and nearly 7000 in the US. They included 601,025 cardiovascular events from the Korean database and 1188 events from the US database in their analysis.

Results showed more than 99% of patients who were diagnosed with coronary heart disease, heart failure, or stroke had evidence of at least one nonoptimal risk factor before the event, with more than 93% having two or more nonoptimal risk factors. The finding was consistent across both countries, types of cardiovascular events, and age subgroups, and was largely consistent between men and women. The presence of clinically elevated risk factors was also high, hovering between 90% and 95%, according to the data. The study was published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology.

Greenland said much of the discrepancy between this study and the previous ones looking at SMuRF-less patients is attributable to their focus on patients with a clinical diagnosis of risk factors, like hypertension or hypercholesterolemia, and ignoring those in the gap between optimal and diagnosable. By the time patients receive a diagnosis, they will have had considerably nonoptimal levels for some time, he said.

“Anything above that optimal level is associated with an increasing level of risk,” he said. “There might be some people with a little elevation of blood pressure, cholesterol, or blood sugar, but those little elevations are not trivial.”

Gemma Figtree, MD, a cardiologist at The University of Sydney in Sydney, Australia, who worked on some of the SMuRF-less studies, said the debate largely comes down to definitions, noting that the lower thresholds in the new study, while relevant, are not likely to change how patients are treated.

“The authors have dropped the bar to a level that is currently not pragmatic in the real world and would not lead to widespread pharmacotherapy,” she said.

Rather than focus on risk factors, Figtree said her group's work looks at variation in susceptibility and resilience, and the fact that those who experienced cardiac events despite having a lower risk factor burden have a 50% higher early mortality rate after a heart attack. She said finding better ways of detecting and treating subclinical cardiovascular disease would provide a more intelligent approach than only relying on population-level risk.

“In cancer, if we only focused on risk factors, we would miss the fact that some patients get cancer without those risk factors. Looking for the disease itself is one way we are interested in helping move beyond the debate,” she said.

But Greenland said it is still important for providers to pay attention to the major modifiable risk factors, not least because they are something that patients can do something about.

“We have a tendency to overlook levels that are not quite at the range where drugs will be used,” he said. “But even if you're not going to write a prescription for someone with a blood pressure of 130 mm Hg, they still qualify for attention. Diet, exercise, and weight management shouldn't be ignored.”

In an accompanying editorial, Neha J. Pagidipati, MD, MPH, of the Duke Clinical Research Institute in Durham, North Carolina, also highlighted the high prevalence of traditional risk factors in the study as particularly interesting.

“That 90%-95% of individuals with any type of cardiovascular disease had at least one clinically elevated risk factor in two very different national cohorts suggests that prior estimates of SMuRF-less-ness, which relied on clinically diagnosed risk factors, may have underestimated the prevalence of traditional risk factors and consequently overestimated the prevalence of cardiovascular disease without traditional risk factors,” she wrote.

Even so, Pagidipati noted clinicians should not just rely on these factors when focusing on prevention.

“[T]he debate around the presence of risk factors before CVD [cardiovascular disease] highlights the fundamental inadequacy of estimating cardiovascular risk and assigning preventive therapies based on risk factors alone. In our current paradigm, we assess risk with calculators that heavily weight age (leaving most younger adults untreated), rely on traditional risk factors that are routinely underdiagnosed, and ignore nontraditional factors that can increase risk,” she wrote.

Greenland reported no relevant conflicts of interest. Figtree reported receiving personal fees from Amgen, AstraZeneca, Bayer, CSL, and Janssen. Pagidipati reported serving as a consultant or on advisory panels or steering committees for Amgen, Bayer, Boehringer Ingelheim, Corcept, Corsera, Eli Lilly, Esperion, AstraZeneca, Merck, New Amsterdam, Novartis, and Novo Nordisk, and has been on the data and safety monitoring board for trials sponsored by J+J and Novartis.

Does pulling all-nighters actually work? Yes. In the short term, it can help you cram in a few more extra topics before exam day; however, there are several downsides. 

The biggest and most important is memory. When we are sleeping, that is when our memory is formed. If we are sacrificing sleep before exam days, then this can strongly impact your performance on exams.

Another big thing about pulling all-nighters is it can affect your stress levels and your mood. When you are not sleeping, you are going to be more irritable, have higher anxiety, and overall be in a worse mood. This can all impact your test day as well.

Oral induction therapy with obefazimod (Abivax) for 8 weeks led to clinically meaningful improvements across all efficacy endpoints in a highly refractory population of patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis (UC).

The findings, from the ABTECT-1 and ABTECT-2 phase 3 induction trials, were presented in two separate late-breaking presentations at United European Gastroenterology (UEG) Week 2025 in Berlin, Germany.

“These trials enrolled a broad spectrum of participants, including one of the most severe and refractory populations evaluated to date in a phase 3 UC trial, with about 60% of patients across the pooled dataset having a Mayo endoscopic subscore of 3 — the highest level of UC endoscopic disease activity,” study investigator Marla Dubinsky, MD, gastroenterologist and co-director of the IBD Center at Mount Sinai in New York City, told Medscape Medical News.

“Even within this challenging population, obefazimod achieved the primary endpoint of clinical remission and all key secondary endpoints, including endoscopic improvement, after just 8 weeks of therapy,” Dubinsky said.

This suggests that obefazimod may serve as both an early advanced therapy option and a much-needed alternative for patients with moderately to severely active UC who have failed multiple biologics and JAK inhibitors, with few choices left short of colectomy, she added.

Obefazimod is an investigational oral, potentially first-in-class drug that enhances expression of microRNA-124, resulting in regulation of the inflammatory response and restoring mucosal homeostasis in UC.

The ABTECT-1 and ABTECT-2 were identically designed induction trials enrolling a total of 1272 patients with moderately to severely active UC who had inadequate response, loss of response, or intolerance to at least one prior therapy (with no upper limit), including corticosteroids, immunosuppressants, biologics, S1P receptor modulators, and/or JAK inhibitors. Participants were randomly assigned in a 2:1:1 ratio to receive obefazimod 50 mg or 25 mg or placebo once daily for 8 weeks.

In ABTECT-1, obefazimod 50 mg and 25 mg met the primary endpoint of clinical remission, with 22% of patients in the 50-mg group and 24% in the 25-mg group achieving clinical remission at 8 weeks compared with 2.5% of the placebo group.

The effect sizes for clinical remission were 21% for the 25-mg dose and 19% for the 50-mg dose, reported Bruce E. Sands, MD, MS, professor of medicine at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai and chief in the Division of Gastroenterology at Mount Sinai Health System in New York City.

In ABTECT-2, the 50-mg dose met the primary endpoint of clinical remission, with 20% of patients achieving remission compared with 11% in the 25-mg group and 6.3% in the placebo group.

The effect sizes for clinical remission in ABTECT-2 were “a bit smaller” (13% for the 50-mg dose and 5% for the 25-mg dose) “because the absolute efficacy of 50 mg in this study was a little bit lower, and the placebo response rate was a little bit higher at 6.3%, and so accordingly, the 25-mg dose did not achieve statistical significance,” Sands explained.

Both doses of obefazimod met all secondary endpoints in ABTECT-1 and the 50-mg dose achieved all secondary endpoints in ABTECT-2. Secondary endpoints included clinical response, endoscopic improvement, symptomatic remission, and histo-endoscopic mucosal improvement.

Pooled data across the two studies showed that both doses achieved “clinically meaningful improvements across all efficacy points,” Sands noted.

Notably, obefazimod 50 mg once daily achieved “consistent and clinically meaningful improvements” regardless of prior failure of advanced therapy, and both doses performed similarly well in the subgroup with no prior failure of advanced therapy, Silvio Danese, MD, PhD, with Vita-Salute San Raffaele University, Milan, Italy, reported in a separate presentation.

Pooled data across the two studies showed no signal for serious, severe, or opportunistic infections or malignancies.

The most commonly reported treatment-emergent adverse event was headache, reported in 24% and 16% of patients taking obefazimod 50 mg and 25 mg, respectively, vs 6% of those taking placebo. Headaches were mild, transient, and short-lasting and “not a barrier to treatment, as evidenced by the low discontinuation (< 1%),” Sands noted.

“Because this is a safe agent and it's an oral agent and convenient, I think the drug could be used early in the course of the disease, before advanced therapy or after failure of advanced therapies, even multiple advanced therapies,” Sands said.

“Of course, we'll have to see what the maintenance data show. But we have a long experience from the phase 2a and 2b long-term extension treatments, and the durability seems to be quite good,” Sands cautioned.

Abivax CEO Marc de Garidel, MBA, told Medscape Medical News that the company will share “top-line data” from the 44-week maintenance study evaluating obefazimod in UC in the second quarter of 2026.

“If positive, the data will support a potential NDA [New Drug Application] submission in the second half of 2026,” de Garidel said.

Ashwin Ananthakrishnan, MBBS, associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and a gastroenterologist at Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, who wasn't involved in the study, was impressed.

“I think this is very promising data from an important study. This is an entirely novel mechanism of action in ulcerative colitis,” Ananthakrishnan told Medscape Medical News.

“While we have many treatments available, there are still a large number of patients who do not respond to existing treatment mechanisms,” he said. These trials “consisted of a large number of very refractory patients (severe endoscopic disease or multiple prior mechanism failures). That it works well in this population is very promising (and clinically impactful).”

It would be a “welcome addition to the armamentarium,” he added.

The study was funded by Abivax. Several study authors disclosed having financial relationships with the company. Ananthakrishnan reported having no disclosures.

Hi. I'm Dr Joanna Scoon. I'm a pulmonologist at CLS Health. Today, I'm going to talk to you about chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which is a common disorder that I typically manage and treat in the clinic and in the hospital.

I want to do a little bit of education about COPD and how to manage it in the clinic so that we can prevent our patients from ending up in the hospital, because that's our number-one goal.Then we want to focus on symptoms and symptom control for our patients as well. 

Typically, when I see a patient in the clinic, for all of my patients with COPD or somebody who I'm suspecting has COPD, I will always do pulmonary function testing to see what their lung function is like and whether there are airflow limitations that suggest what grade or severity of COPD they may have.

It's also very important to get a walk test or pulmonary stress test to see what the oxygen levels do when they exercise and if they become hypoxemic. Treating patients who have low oxygen levels is extremely important in COPD. 

Typically, if I do make the diagnosis of COPD, getting them on inhalers, bronchodilators, and sometimes inhaled corticosteroids, depending on their phenotype, is very important for these patients for symptom benefit as well as to preserve their lung function. 

I always tackle smoking cessation if they're still active smokers. How do I also manage them? I make sure that they go to pulmonary rehab to strengthen their lung function, improve their exercise tolerance, and improve their symptoms.

Education about inhaler use is also very important to make sure that they're using it correctly and to prevent any exacerbations in the future.

More than a decade after the World Health Organization (WHO) declared Australia free of measles, the country is facing a spike in cases. Many experts blame the international anti-vaccination movement, which is most prominent in the US.

As of October 7, there have been 133 cases of measles in Australia this year. By way of comparison, there were 57 cases in 2024, 26 in 2023, 7 in 2022, and none in 2021. Numerous cases have been imported from overseas, some of which have affected children too young to be vaccinated.

The current number of cases “doesn't sound big by itself, but in context, it is part of a worrying pattern,” Josh Davis, MBBS, PhD, professor of medicine and public health at the University of Newcastle and infectious disease physician at John Hunter Hospital, Newcastle, told Medscape Medical News.

“It is concerning because measles virus is the most contagious known human pathogen. In an unvaccinated population, an average person with measles will infect 13-18 others. It spreads like wildfire.”

For this reason, the WHO recommends that at least 95% of a country's total population receive two doses of the measles vaccine in childhood to create herd immunity. But while Australia has historically had high vaccination coverage, vaccination rates have been declining since the COVID-19 pandemic began. Some experts are now worried that Australia is at risk of losing its herd immunity.

Immunization coverage overall has declined across the country by 2%-3% since the pandemic began, said Frank Beard, MBChB, associate professor of public health at the University of Sydney, Sydney, and associate director of surveillance, coverage, evaluation and social science at the National Centre for Immunisation Research and Surveillance.

The two-dose coverage of the measles vaccine was 94% at 2 years of age before the pandemic and decreased to 92.5% in 2023. Some Australian regions have rates as low as 70%-75%. Moreover, the timeliness of measles vaccination has declined. In 2024, 1 in 3 children received the first dose of the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine late, putting children at risk of catching measles at a younger age.

“Any decline in childhood coverage is a concern, even if overall population immunity remains above the herd immunity threshold, as it will increase the risk of outbreaks, particularly as immunity gaps are much greater in some parts of Australia such as the north coast of New South Wales and the Gold Coast in Queensland,” Beard told Medscape Medical News.

He and his colleagues conducted a national survey of parents of young children last year. “Parents reported a range of access barriers, including difficulty getting appointments, costs associated with vaccination appointments, and difficulty prioritizing vaccination, along with concerns around vaccine safety and effectiveness and trust in information,” said Beard.

“There is certainly a lot of misinformation online, exacerbated by events in the US, which are likely contributing to parental concerns and questions, though it is difficult to quantify the contribution,” he added.

Research from 2024 found a large increase between 2017 and 2023 in the proportions of parents in Australia who believed that children receive too many vaccines, that vaccines cause autism, and that vaccine ingredients cause harm.

Other experts place more blame on the anti-vaccination movement than on health system shortcomings. Earlier this year, President Donald Trump picked anti-vaccine activist Robert F. Kennedy, Jr, as the US Secretary of Health and Human Services. The department has since faced budget cuts and mass firings. The US childhood vaccine schedule is also facing changes.

Davis considers the anti-vaccination movement, both in the US and Australia, to be the single most important factor in the increase in measles cases.

The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices in the US recently voted to no longer recommend that children younger than 4 years receive the first dose of the combined measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella (MMRV) vaccine. Instead, the committee recommended that children aged 1 year through 3 years receive two shots: one for MMR and a second for varicella. The MMRV shot will be recommended as an option for a child's second dose, which is given at around 4-6 years of age.

Social media, too, is affecting vaccine uptake, Ramya Raman, MBBS, vice president of The Royal Australian College of General Practitioners and general practitioner in Piara Waters, Western Australia, told Medscape Medical News.

Social media provide platforms for spreading myths about vaccines, which may reduce uptake. “This is a global phenomenon affecting Australia. We've witnessed a doubling of measles cases over the last 2 years in Australia….Falling vaccination rates have created a perfect storm for the spread of measles,” said Raman.

Some regions in Australia are of particular concern, said Raman, such as the Northern Rivers region, as well as parts of inner city Melbourne and Sydney, where vaccination coverage has fallen to what she described as alarming levels.

“The number one thing you can do to help keep yourself, your family, and your community as safe possible is to get vaccinated,” said Raman. “Unfortunately, not enough patients are heeding that message. With elimination achieved a decade ago, some families underestimate risk — yet imported cases via international travel are now seeding local exposures.”

The National Immunisation Strategy for Australia 2025-2030 stresses the importance of engaging with communities to build trust and understanding in the value of immunization and to combat misinformation. These initiatives are crucial if Australia is to avoid losing its herd immunity, said Davis.

“Government agencies need to get on the front foot to counter and anticipate anti-vaccination rhetoric, and they should be vocally supported by academics and clinicians,” he said. “Catch-up vaccination programs should continue for those with delayed or missed vaccinations, and immigrants and refugees should be offered free vaccinations if they are not already vaccinated.”

Davis, Beard, and Raman reported having no relevant financial relationships.

A large real-world study found that fewer than half of adults who started colorectal cancer (CRC) screening with an at-home stool test completed the recommended repeat test, creating gaps in protection and potentially diminishing their benefits.

Among those who did repeat the test, the average delay was 3 months before COVID and increased to 5 months during the pandemic, the authors reported in BMJ Public Health.

“Stool tests are relatively easy to complete at home and mailed for testing, and they are inexpensive, but they must be completed annually. In contrast, colonoscopies are more invasive and require more time away from work but only need to be repeated every 5-10 years,” Staci J Wendt, PhD, director, health research accelerator, Providence Research Network, Providence, Rhode Island, told Medscape Medical News.

In the end, “the best colorectal cancer screening test is the one that gets done,” Wendt said.

“This is why we stress the importance of patients and their doctor having these discussions together and deciding which screening is the most preferred method for the individual patient,” she added.

Adults are increasingly turning to at-home stool tests for CRC screening — a trend that accelerated during the pandemic. Yet, there is limited data on whether patients undergo repeat stool tests following initial negative test results.

Wendt and her colleagues documented rates of repeat preventative stool tests by analyzing electronic medical records from Providence St Joseph Health, a large health system with 51 hospitals and over 1000 clinics across seven western US states.

They divided their analysis into two periods based on the onset of the pandemic. The pre-COVID onset period spanned January 2018 to February 2020 and the post-COVID period spanned March 2020 to February 2022.

“The pandemic is a salient time to conduct this study because it resulted in a dramatic decrease in colonoscopies, which were partially replaced by stool tests. This partial replacement of colonoscopies by stool tests has led other studies to conclude that stool tests mitigated gaps in CRC screening during the pandemic. But gaps may persist if patients do not undergo repeat testing,” the study team explained.

Their sample included 403,085 patients. Among those with an initial negative stool test, the share who obtained a timely repeat screening ranged from 38% to 49% across the study years, confirming that “most patients do not undergo the recommended repeat screening after their initial stool test,” the researchers said.

Among adults who do a repeat test, delays were common. The average lag to the follow-up test was 3 months on average, increasing to about 5 months amid COVID — almost half as long as the preventative screening period of stool tests (12 months).

“These gaps could delay detection of CRC and subsequent treatment, potentially resulting in higher mortality. These gaps are particularly important as more and more patients use stool tests instead of colonoscopes for CRC screening,” the researchers wrote.

Screening patterns shifted markedly during the pandemic.

Not surprisingly, the volume of colonoscopies declined substantially after the onset of the pandemic and stayed low through the study's end. In contrast, the volume of at-home stool tests was increasing before the pandemic and accelerated during the pandemic.

“Given this increase in stool tests, it will be increasingly important to focus on improving long-term adherence to screening through outreach, policies and programs,” the researchers said.

Wendt said health systems that are incorporating proactive measures like sending stool kits to patients who are eligible for screening, should ensure that these screening kits and information are sent annually and that it is stressed that the screening must happen every year.

Reached for comment, Aasma Shaukat, MD, MPH, director of outcomes research, Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, NYU Langone Health, New York City, who wasn't involved in the study, said the poor adherence to repeat stool tests for CRC screening seen in this study is “not surprising.”

“We know that adherence goes down with each consecutive screening round and what is really needed is an organized program to keep the level of adherence up,” Shaukat told Medscape Medical News.

Shaukat agreed that boosting adherence to stool tests requires a “multilevel approach.”

She cited the success of the CRC screening program implemented across Kaiser Permanente Northern California. The program includes proactive and targeted outreach to members who are overdue for screening and mailed fecal immunochemical test kits for at-home use.

As reported previously by Medscape Medical News, the program has made a huge difference in CRC incidence, deaths, and racial disparities.

The program has doubled the proportion of people up to date with screening. And, within about 10 years, cancer rates were cut by a third, deaths were halved and largely eliminated long-standing differences by race and ethnicity.

The study had no commercial funding. Wendt and Shaukat declared having no relevant disclosures.

Ultrasound demonstrated a strong correlation and agreement with CT in assessing the diameter of the ascending aorta in patients with giant cell arteritis (GCA), supporting its use as an effective first-line tool for routine screening for thoracic aneurysms in this population.

""Ultrasound yields results comparable to CT's in assessing the ascending aorta in patients with GCA,"" the authors wrote. ""Given ultrasound's accessibility, cost-effectiveness, and lack of radiation, it could be a reasonable first-line tool for routine screening and monitoring of aortic aneurysms in this patient group,"" they suggested.

This study was led by Anne C. Bull Haaversen, MD, Martina Hansens Hospital, Bærum, Norway. It was published online on September 30, 2025, in Arthritis Care & Research.

The real-life setting of the study may have introduced methodological variability, with ultrasound measurements subject to operator-dependent factors and CT data potentially influenced by differences in scan quality, phase of acquisition, contrast use, and measurement technique. This study was also limited by the fact that one ultrasonographer was not blinded to some CT scan results, potentially introducing bias. Additionally, varying imaging intervals and modalities in the prospective study, along with a relatively small patient cohort, affected the robustness of the findings.

This study did not receive any specific funding from any public, commercial, or not-for-profit bodies. The authors declared having no relevant conflicts of interest.

Despite declining melanoma mortality among non-Hispanic White individuals, survival disparities persist for Latino populations. A recently published qualitative study examined interviews with Latino patients and found that systemic barriers — especially insurance approvals, referral bottlenecks, low disease awareness, and lack of linguistic interpretation — can slow diagnosis and treatment of melanoma in this community.

“The most important takeaway from my perspective is the recognition of numerous barriers within the US healthcare system that contribute to delays in timely diagnosis and treatment of melanoma for Latino populations, particularly among those covered by public health insurance,” lead author Kimberly A. Miller, PhD, MPH, associate professor of the Department of Population and Public Health Sciences at Keck School of Medicine of the University of Southern California, Los Angeles, told Medscape Dermatology.

“Consequently, there is a critical need to expedite care on multiple fronts — by raising awareness of melanoma risk among Latino individuals and their clinicians, establishing stronger and more direct referral pathways, and empowering patients to communicate confidently during medical encounters,” she commented.

The study was published on October 1 in JAMA Dermatology.

Latino individuals have a lower overall incidence of melanoma than non-Hispanic White patients but are more often diagnosed at thicker stages, which contributes to worse outcomes, the study authors noted. For the study, they interviewed 20 Latino patients with melanoma in Los Angeles County, California, between May and November 2023. Using reflexive thematic analysis, they identified two facilitators — patient self-advocacy and linguistically appropriate care — as well as four barriers: insurance-related delays, referral delays, low awareness of melanoma, and lack of linguistically appropriate care.

Eligible participants were Latino adults with cutaneous melanoma identified through the Los Angeles County Cancer Surveillance Program, Los Angeles. Interviews explored patient pathways to diagnosis, barriers and facilitators to obtaining care, referral experiences, and knowledge of melanoma. Half of the interviews were conducted in Spanish. Most participants were diagnosed at an early stage (in situ or localized).

Among the key findings was that many patients relied on family members to translate medical information. Miller told Medscape Medical News she was most surprised by how common this was, even in Southern California. “I was most surprised by how frequently patients reported relying on a family member to translate into Spanish for them, especially given the study was conducted in Southern California, a majority Latino region,” she said. 

“The lack of professional translation services creates significant barriers to effective care and can undermine patient-provider communication, often resulting in poorer care quality, delayed diagnosis, and worse health outcomes.”

In addition, patients with public or managed care plans described prolonged approval timelines and long waits to see dermatologists. Some reported that switching to coverage with a preferred provider organization expedited referrals and treatment.

The study also found that several participants had little prior knowledge of melanoma and did not perceive themselves at risk because of their skin color. The authors noted that targeted risk communication and clinician education about melanoma in diverse skin types are needed.

Patients who “self-advocated” for their healthcare were identified as facilitators of timely diagnosis and treatment. Individuals who insisted on evaluation, biopsy, or referral, the authors reported, moved more quickly through the healthcare system.

According to the study authors, interventions are needed at the patient, provider, and system levels. Their suggested strategies include:

“Delays in melanoma diagnosis and treatment have multifactorial causes, and there is no simple solution,” Miller said. “To improve outcomes, and specifically to increase survival rates for Latino patients, comprehensive, multilevel strategies are needed. These include culturally relevant patient education, provider training in equitable melanoma care, and healthcare system improvements that strengthen navigation support and streamline timely referrals to specialty care.”

The authors acknowledged that their small sample from Los Angeles County may not reflect the diversity of the broader US Latino population. Recruitment challenges and potential selection bias were also noted. Nevertheless, they emphasized that the narratives provide critical patient-centered insights into modifiable barriers, including language access, insurance, and referral speed.

“To ensure timely diagnosis and treatment of melanoma, it is imperative that we provide culturally congruent and respectful care for Latino patients,” Miller said.

The study was supported by the National Cancer Institute. Miller reported having no disclosures. One author reported receiving personal fees from Otsuka Pharmaceutical outside the submitted work; no other author disclosures were reported.

 October 10, 2025  

Almost three quarters of UK GPs say workload pressures are putting patient safety at risk, according to a new Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) survey.

The college's annual GP Voice survey, conducted with market research consultancy Savanta between 28 July and 20 August 2025, gathered responses from 2316 GPs. Results were released to coincide with the opening of the RCGP annual conference.

Among respondents:

In an opening address to the conference in Newport, Wales, outgoing RCGP chair Professor Kamila Hawthorne said the results showed that “more than half reported that their own mental health had declined in the last year” and that it was “hard to find a GP who doesn't feel they have to cut corners.”

The poll findings are consistent with last year's results, when 76%, 60%, and 62% of GPs, respectively, gave similar responses.

A 2024 General Medical Council report also found that workload pressures were draining morale and that higher workforce numbers had not improved doctors' experiences. It warned that quality patient care is “impossible without a motivated workforce.”

Workplace stress continues to be widespread across the NHS.

The national NHS staff survey published in March found that one third of staff believed their organisation was understaffed. It also reported that 30% of staff found work emotionally exhausting, 42% said they felt worn out by the end of their shift, and 30% felt burnt out. 

At the time, Dr Billy Palmer, PhD, a senior fellow at the Nuffield Trust, said stress levels remained “worryingly high” and warned of the danger of such pressures “being normalised.”

A separate Medscape UK survey of more than 900 doctors, published in June, found that 28% were unhappy with their professional life, 27% reported burnout, and 13% rated their mental health as poor or very poor.

The RCGP said the latest survey results were “stark” and highlighted the depth of the ongoing workload crisis in general practice.

It said that fewer than 30% of GPs felt they had enough time during consultations to provide high-quality patient care, and more than half reported a decline in their own mental health over the past year.

“Perhaps it is no surprise that so many GPs plan to leave the profession and that the biggest cause is stress,” said Hawthorne. “It is such a waste to lose experienced GPs.”

Concerns were also raised about the government's proposed neighbourhood health services, with 68% of respondents worried about their potential impact on GP workload and the lack of sufficient staffing to deliver them effectively.

The college reiterated its calls for a sustained increase in core funding for general practice, including mandated annual rises, ring-fenced funding for recruitment, and new retention initiatives. It also renewed its call for “thousands more GPs” to ease the growing strain on primary care.

Raw milk (untreated milk) enjoys a certain popularity, but poses health risks. To avoid food poisoning, it should be boiled before drinking. But how well is raw milk actually known among the population? How do people perceive its health risk? Two-thirds of those surveyed had already heard of raw milk. Only ten percent expressed concern, making raw milk the topic of least concern of the risks surveyed. This is according to the BfR Consumer Monitor, a regularly conducted representative survey by the German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR). ""The health risks of raw milk are underestimated,"" explains BfR President Professor Andreas Hensel. ""It can transmit pathogens. Particularly sensitive population groups such as children, pregnant women, the elderly and sick people should generally avoid unboiled raw milk."" However, even healthy adults face an increased risk of mild to severe food poisoning when consuming unboiled raw milk, depending on the pathogen. Like approved food dyes and mercury in fish, raw milk was a topic covered by the BfR Consumer Monitor for the first time. 

""In your opinion, what are the greatest health risks in everyday life, for example in relation to food, personal care products, clothing or toys?"" Public opinion is consistent on this open-ended question. The most frequently mentioned are usually undesirable substances (such as ""chemicals"" or ""pollutants"", accounting for 41 percent of responses). These are followed by plastics (17 percent), food additives (10 percent), certain nutrients such as fat, sugar or salt (10 percent), and unhealthy diet and lifestyles (10 percent).

""How concerned are you personally about the following consumer health issues?"" Among the predefined response options, the topic of ""microplastics in food"" leads the way (67 percent very concerned, 15 percent moderately concerned), followed by ""antibiotic resistance"" (63 percent and 15 percent, respectively) and ""pesticide residues in food"" (50 percent and 20 percent, respectively). Here, too, the views of those surveyed remain largely unchanged. 

In addition, for the first time, the current survey asked about overconsumption rather than insufficient intake of vitamins and minerals. The latest data shows that 26 percent feel well informed about excessive intake of vitamins and minerals, while in the previous survey 37 percent of respondents felt well informed about insufficient intake.

Researchers have uncovered a surprising link between everyday soft drink habits and mental health, revealing that even moderate soda consumption could alter gut microbes in ways that heighten depression risk, especially among women.

Study: Soft Drink Consumption and Depression Mediated by Gut Microbiome Alterations. Image credit: Kmpzzz/Shutterstock.com

Consumption of soft drinks is linked to obesity, diabetes, heart disease, stroke, and cancer. They are also associated with increased rates of depression. A recent study published in JAMA Psychiatry examined how soft drinks were related to depression.

Soft drinks are wildly popular worldwide, especially among children and teenagers. They are loaded with empty calories, mostly simple sugars like glucose and fructose, which push up blood glucose levels.

In addition, soft drinks present too much sugar for the intestine to absorb. Unabsorbed sugar promotes the proliferation of specific bacterial genera. These bacteria typically cause inflammation and reduce the integrity of the gut epithelium barrier. This weakens the mucosal immune system, keeping bacteria and bacterial products within the gut lumen.  

The increased abundance of pro-inflammatory bacteria promotes systemic inflammation and neuroinflammation, which is linked to anxiety and learning deficits, especially among teenagers. Conversely, a diet that promotes the production of anti-inflammatory short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) by ‘good' gut bacteria protects the gut barrier and counters inflammation.

A higher soft drink intake is linked to an increased risk of depression, as shown by prior studies. Surprisingly, this is not true of high-sugar solid foods.

Research also shows that the gut microbiome is key to the development of major depression. Fecal microbiota transplants from depressed people can induce depressive-like symptoms in rodents. Several bacteria, like Atopium, Eggerthella, and Bifidobacterium, have been reported to be more abundant in major depression than healthy controls.

Further analysis has narrowed down the culprits to Eggerthella and Hungatella. Increased sugar in the gut may benefit Eggerthella by providing additional food. Eggerthella is a gram-positive anaerobic bacterium usually found at low levels in the healthy gut and associated with major depression. Its metabolic byproducts include acetate and arginine, and depressive symptoms are linked to higher acetate levels.

In mice, Eggerthella reduces the levels of the SCFA butyrate, causes immunosenescence (the age-related weakening of immunity), and reduces the levels of tryptophan, the precursor of the mood-regulating neurotransmitter serotonin.

The German study included a group of 405 patients diagnosed with major depressive disorder (MDD) and 527 healthy controls. The patients were drawn from the Marburg-Münster Affective Cohort, representing the general population. Both patients and controls were mostly female.

Multivariable regression and analysis of variance (ANOVA) models were used to identify associations between major depression, symptom severity, and soft drinks. Mediation analyses also explored the link between the gut microbes Eggerthella and Hungatella and soft drink consumption.

Soft drink consumption predicted a higher rate of diagnosis of major depression. The odds of major depression were about 8% higher per unit increase in soft drink intake. People who drank more soft drinks were also more likely to have more severe depression.

These associations were driven by women participants, who had ~16% higher odds of major depression. In contrast, men failed to show any association.

Patients with depression had a higher mean body mass index (BMI) compared to controls. However, the observed pattern remained consistent even after adjusting for the BMI and for antidepressant use.

Interestingly, women who drank more soft drinks had a higher abundance of Eggerthella. An increase in Eggerthella abundance in female patients and controls partly mediated the association of depression with soft drink intake. About 4% and 5% of the association with depression diagnosis and severity, respectively, was caused by increased Eggerthella abundance.

BMI did not affect this association, which was not found in males. Moreover, the gut microbiome in women with depression was less diverse overall and showed less evenness of species distribution, with some species dominating the others. This was not seen with men.

This study is important in that it used a clinically diagnosed group of patients with depression, rather than including individuals who self-reported themselves as depressed. The authors noted that the observed effects were statistically small but may still be meaningful given how widely soft drinks are consumed. The effects attributable to soft drink consumption may be small but are easy to manipulate and wide-ranging in their reach.

These findings emphasize the need to educate consumers about the dangers of soft drinks to mental health. They also support policies restricting the marketing and availability of soft drinks since physical activity alone cannot compensate for soft drink intake.

Notably, moderate consumption, one or two soft drinks daily, has been associated with poorer health outcomes. These drinks should not be advertised to children, but support policies limiting soft drink availability. Taxation has reduced soft drink consumption and obesity rates in the UK. However, it has driven up the sales of artificially sweetened drinks, which were not separately analyzed in this study and may also warrant further research.

The reason for the predominantly female adverse effect of soft drinks remains unclear. Still, these findings highlight the need to interrupt the cycle of soft drink consumption and depression, especially since both impair normal metabolism. It is cautioned that the relationship might be bidirectional; people with depression could consume more soft drinks, so causality cannot be confirmed from this observational study.

“Education, prevention strategies, and policies aiming to reduce soft drink consumption are urgently required to mitigate depressive symptoms.”

Further interventions that alter the gut microbiome should also be tested. However, the authors emphasize that more research, including randomized trials, is needed to establish whether reducing soft drink intake can directly lower depression risk.

Researchers at Cleveland Clinic Children's have helped identify a previously unknown gene that increases the risk of developing osteosarcoma, the most common type of malignant bone tumor in children and young adults.

Recently published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology, researchers analyzed genetic information from nearly 6,000 children with cancer and compared it to more than 14,000 adults without cancer. Utilizing databases and prediction tools, the study authors focused on 189 genes that participate in several DNA repair pathways.

The results showed that some children with cancer had inherited changes in certain DNA repair genes, that may raise their risk of developing particular cancers. One gene in particular, SMARCAL1 was flagged as a significant risk factor for osteosarcoma. Approximately 2.6% of children with osteosarcoma carry these inherited mutations in SMARCAL1, which may weaken DNA repair and promote tumor growth.

These findings not only deepen our biological understanding of osteosarcoma, but allows for earlier detection, and the potential for developing targeted treatments for this rare but aggressive cancer. With little progress in osteosarcoma treatment over the past 40 years, this discovery could pave the way for significant advancements in care for patients with this condition."" 

Richa Sharma, MD, senior study author, pediatric hematologist and oncologist at Cleveland Clinic Children's

Osteosarcoma is the most common type of bone cancer, and typically develops in the arms or legs. Symptoms can include bone pain, a lump or swelling, and a bone that breaks easily. Experts estimate that fewer than 1,000 people in the U.S. develop osteosarcoma each year. Around 7 in 10 people survive if the disease doesn't spread to other parts of the body, but only 2 in 10 children survive if the disease does spread outside the original bone site.

The study was done in collaboration with researchers from St. Jude's Children's Research Hospital, Mayo Clinic, and Kitz Hopp Children's Cancer Center Heidelberg in Germany.

A research team at CiQUS (University of Santiago de Compostela, Spain) has unveiled an innovative molecular approach that enables anticancer drugs to reach the nucleus of tumor cells, where they can exert their therapeutic effect. The study focused on doxorubicin, a widely used chemotherapy agent. Prolonged exposure to this drug often leads to the emergence of resistant cells, a major clinical challenge that this strategy successfully overcomes while preserving the drug's antitumor activity.

The approach builds on a simple but powerful concept: the ability of cyclic peptides -small amino acid rings- to stack and self-assemble into hollow cylindrical structures (nanotubes) on the surface of cancer cell membranes. The system, developed by the team led by Juan R. Granja, couples doxorubicin to these peptides and directs it to the cell nucleus through a delivery pathway that differs from the drug's usual mechanism. This allows the drug to bypass the cellular resistance mechanisms that would normally deactivate it.

Compared with healthy cells, cancer cell membranes contain higher levels of negatively charged lipids. The cyclic peptides used in this study display a strong affinity for these anionic surfaces, facilitating their interaction with tumor cells. As a result, the peptide–drug conjugates enter resistant cells and travel towards the nucleus, where doxorubicin intercalates with DNA to trigger its cytotoxic effect.

Experimental studies confirmed that the chemical structure of the cyclic peptide is key to the formation of stable nanotubes, which in turn enhances their ability to penetrate malignant cells. The work, published in ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces, was carried out at CiQUS, a research centre recognised as a CIGUS by the Xunta de Galicia and supported by the European Union through the Galicia FEDER Programme 2021–2027.

Drug resistance remains one of the main obstacles in cancer therapy. Many tumors develop mechanisms to actively expel drugs, greatly limiting the efficacy of available treatments. In this context, cyclic peptides act as highly efficient delivery vehicles, capable of introducing doxorubicin into cells that would normally reject it.

By combining selectivity, efficient transport, and controlled drug release, this strategy paves the way for new combination chemotherapies in which peptide-based nanotechnology could become a powerful ally against cancer. The authors hope this approach will inspire the development of new therapeutic strategies targeting hard-to-treat tumors.

Researchers explore the human immune system by looking at the active components, namely the various genes and cells involved. But there is a broad range of these, and observations necessarily produce vast amounts of data. For the first time, researchers including those from the University of Tokyo built a software tool which leverages artificial intelligence to not only offer a more consistent analysis of these cells at speed but also categorizes them and aims to spot novel patterns people have not yet seen.

Our immune system is important - it's impossible to imagine complex life existing without it. This system, comprising different kinds of cells, each playing a different role, helps to identify things that threaten our health, and take actions to defend us. They are both very effective, but also far from perfect; hence, the existence of diseases such as the notorious acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, or AIDS. And recent earth-shattering issues, such as the coronavirus pandemic, serve to highlight the importance of research around this intricate yet powerful system.

One key branch of research in immunology involves the identification of immune system components and ascertaining their function. Doing this through manual observation would be impossible due to the time it would take, and some automated tools exist, but have limitations around accuracy, consistency or flexibility. To this end, a team of researchers led by Professor Tatsuhiko Tsunoda from the University of Tokyo's Department of Biological Sciences rose to the challenge and developed a system to boost immunology research.

We present scHDeepInsight, an AI-based framework for rapidly and consistently identifying immune cells from the RNA of cells. Instead of viewing all cell types as unrelated, the system reflects the natural hierarchy of the immune system. By turning cellular genetic profiles into images and applying a hierarchy-aware AI, known as a convolutional neural network, or CNN, it can distinguish both broad immune cell types and finer subtypes, and it can do so more consistently than previous attempts. In our benchmark, labeling about 10,000 cells only took a few minutes, whereas manual marker-based annotation can take many hours to days. In comparison with other automated methods, run time is in a similar range. The main advantages are the consistency of predictions across the hierarchy and the improved accuracy gained from incorporating hierarchical labels, rather than raw speed alone.""

Shangru Jia, lead researcher 

There are three main aspects to scHDeepInsight. Hierarchical learning, whereby the model mirrors the immune system's 'family tree,' can distinguish both broad immune categories and finer subtypes. Image-based representation transforms gene data into 2D images so the CNN can capture subtle relationships between genes more effectively than by looking at tables of raw data. And analytics built into the system can highlight which genes contribute most to a behavior, and these can be checked against known markers to see how they align with past observations.

""A spreadsheet of gene numbers misses how genes relate to each other. When we map genes to pixels in an image so that related genes are placed nearby, the result is an image with meaningful structure. Image-recognition models such as CNNs are very good at detecting such patterns, allowing them to capture complex relationships between genes that are hard to learn from raw tables,"" said Jia. ""The main challenge was balancing performance across both broad cell types and detailed subtypes, especially for rare cell populations. We addressed this by adapting the training process, so the model paid more attention to the categories that were harder to distinguish, reducing the risk of overlooking small but important subtypes.""

scHDeepInsight is primarily a research tool rather than a full diagnostic system, partly due to its infancy, but mainly as the model is only trained on healthy cells. By applying it to patients' samples, researchers can see where they deviate from a healthy baseline. Such deviations may provide clues for further study, but medical interpretation requires additional validation. So this development will aid in fundamental research throughout the field of immunology, but it might take time before descendants of scHDeepInsight find their way into diagnostic systems.

""Studies where immune changes are important, including cancer immunology, infections and autoimmune conditions, can benefit from more reliable cell labels. Since our model is trained on healthy immune cells, its immediate value is in providing a consistent healthy baseline for comparison. Disease-related shifts can then be measured relative to this baseline, but clinical interpretation requires validation in each context,"" said Jia. ""Generalization and validation are key. Clinical samples are diverse, so the model must be tested across varied trials and protocols. Integration into clinical workflows, regulatory requirements for transparency and reproducibility are also essential before routine use. For research use today, scHDeepInsight is already available as a downloadable package - researchers can readily apply it in their own analyses. Broader validation and clinical integration remain goals for the future.""

Work on scHDeepInsight has not finished. The team aims to improve its abilities and features, taking it beyond immune system-related cellular identification and into other biological domains. Ultimately, they hope to validate the system for use as a tool for clinical research by using precise immune system profiling to support studies of disease. And there's also the matter of its capacity to spot novel cell types.

""For each cell, the model outputs probabilities at both the broad type and subtype levels. If confidence is high for the broad lineage but low for all known subtypes within that lineage, the cell may represent a potentially novel state. In test analyses of brain immune datasets, this probability pattern helped highlight regions that were rich in specialized microglia cells residing in the central nervous system,"" said Jia. ""AI models reflect their training data. If a reference atlas is incomplete, some rare or context-specific populations can be misclassified or underrepresented. Predictions must therefore be interpreted with caution and validated experimentally. Our design emphasizes transparency to support careful, evidence-based use.""

The secret to the naked mole-rats' extraordinarily long life may lie in subtle changes to just four amino acids, researchers report. According to a new study, evolutionary mutations in cGAS – an enzyme in the innate immune system that senses DNA to trigger immune responses – may enhance the animal's ability to repair aging-related genetic damage, whereas in other species, such as mice and humans, cGAS can suppress DNA repair.

Wrinkled and unassuming though they appear, the naked mole-rat (Heterocephalus glaber) is an exceptionally long-lived rodent, with a maximum life span of nearly 40 years – roughly 10 times longer than similarly sized species. Moreover, the creatures' genetic makeup is surprisingly closer to humans than to mice, which makes it a valuable model for studying the molecular mechanisms underlying the species' longevity.

One key aspect of long life is genome stability. However, the ways naked mole-rats maintain DNA integrity, particularly through repair mechanisms, remain poorly understood. Homologous recombination (HR) is a critical DNA repair pathway, and defects in HR are linked to premature aging. In humans and mice, the DNA sensor cGAS (cyclic guanosine monophosphate–adenosine monophosphate synthase) can suppress HR repair, potentially promoting cancer and shortening lifespan.

Yu Chen and colleagues investigated whether cGAS similarly inhibits HR in long-lived naked mole-rats. Chen et al. found that, in naked mole-rats, four specific amino acid substitutions in mole-rat cGAS reduce ubiquitination and degradation, allowing the protein to persist for longer and at higher levels after DNA damage. This increased abundance strengthens interactions with key repair factors, FANCI and RAD50, thereby boosting HR repair.

When cGAS was depleted from naked mole-rat cells, DNA damage accumulated. The authors further showed that fruit flies engineered to express human cGAS containing the four naked mole-rat–specific mutations lived longer than flies expressing unaltered human cGAS. The findings suggest that these specific evolutionary amino acid mutations in naked mole-rat cGAS not only enhance DNA repair but may also contribute directly to the extraordinary longevity of the species.

""The findings from Chen et al. describe an unexpected role for naked mole-rat cGAS in the nucleus that influences longevity, write John Martinez and colleagues in a related Perspective. ""Further research will be required to establish the roles that cGAS may play in the nucleus in other organisms, both short- and long-lived, but the answer may be substantially more complex than originally predicted.""

Everywhere you go, you carry a population of microbes in your gastrointestinal tract that outnumber the human cells making up your body.

This microbiome has important connections to health in your gut, brain and immune system. Some resident bugs produce vitamins, antioxidants, nutrients and other helpful compounds. Even those whose direct effects seem neutral take up space that makes it harder for harmful microbes to move in.

There is still much to be understood about the gut microbiome, but its connections to health suggest the potential for curating this community to address disease. New discoveries from a research team at the California NanoSystems Institute at UCLA, or CNSI, offer a promising step in that direction.

The scientists investigated a known mechanism that changes genes in microbes, driven by what are called diversity-generating retroelements. DGRs carry collections of genes that function together to create random mutations in specific hotspots in bacterial genomes. Effectively, they accelerate evolution in their hosts, enabling microbes to change and adapt.

DGRs are more common in the gut microbiome than any other environment on Earth where they've been measured. However, their role in the gut has not been investigated until now.

In a study published in the journal Science, the team explored bacteria commonly seen in the healthy digestive tract. They found that about one-quarter of those microbes' DGRs target genes vital for latching on to grow colonies in new surroundings. The researchers also demonstrated that DGRs travel well: They can transfer from one strain of bacterium to others nearby, and infants inherit DGRs from their mothers that seem to aid in starting up the gut microbiome.

""One of the real mysteries in the microbiome is exactly how bacteria colonize us,"" said senior author Jeff F. Miller, director of CNSI, holder of the Fred Kavli Chair in NanoSystems Science and a professor of microbiology, immunology and molecular genetics at UCLA.

It's a highly dynamic system intimately connected with human physiology, and this knowledge about DGRs could one day be applied for engineering beneficial microbiomes that promote good health.""

Jeff F. Miller, Professor, Microbiology, Immunology and Molecular Genetics, UCLA

Changes in the gut microbiome have been linked to inflammatory bowel disease, Crohn's disease, metabolic syndrome, colon cancer and - more distantly - conditions such as anxiety, depression and autism. An increase in disease-causing bacteria in children is associated with higher long-term risk for chronic autoimmune illness.

""The developing microbiome is connected to our developing immune system, and that primes us for the rest of our lives,"" said first and co-corresponding author Ben Macadangdang, a UCLA Health neonatologist and an assistant professor of pediatrics at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA. ""When the microbiome is disrupted, we see higher rates of chronic disease later in life. This presents a strong opportunity to engineer the infant gut microbiome to prevent these risks.""

DGRs were first discovered in Miller's lab. In a single spot in the genome, which varies from case to case, DGRs replace the letter A from the four-letter alphabet that makes up DNA, adding a C, G or T in that spot.

Many DGRs target genes that determine the shape of binding proteins - that is, proteins that fit with other molecules like a pair of puzzle pieces. This type of binding is the fundamental mechanism by which cells interact with the world around them. Changes to binding proteins can expand their repertoire for interaction, so DGRs accelerate evolution in a way that expand microbes' capabilities.

This system can be compared to a more-familiar method through which biology remixes proteins: the production of new antibodies by the human immune system to expand the roster of invaders it can recognize. But by contrast, each immune cell that recombines antibodies does so only once, while DGRs can introduce mutations over and over in the same cell.

DGRs are also a far more powerful engine for broadening variety. If each unique antibody made by the immune system were a grain of sand, those grains would fill less than a quarter of 1% of the Empire State Building. By contrast, it would take 270 million Empire State Buildings to hold grains of sand equal to the unique variations of DGR-mutated proteins.

Miller and his colleagues examined the genome of bacteria frequently seen in the gut microbiome, from the genus Bacteroides. In this population, DGRs were plentiful, with an average of one per strain and some strains carrying up to five. They were also varied, with more than 1,100 unique DGRs identified.

The researchers focused on a subset of DGRs targeting genes for the hairlike appendages that protrude from Bacteroides, called pili. Pili act together like the fibers in Velcro, enabling the bacteria to anchor themselves to other microbes or onto surfaces. The DGRs worked primarily to diversify the proteins that help pili to adhere. This suggests DGRs have an important role in Bacteroides' adapting to new locations, including the unique environment of each person's gut microbiome.

""We think DGRs allow the bacteria to rapidly change what their pili can adhere to,"" Macadangdang said. ""A bacterium may be optimized for one person's gut, but if it goes out and tries to colonize someone else, it encounters a very different environment. Finding something new to bind to gives the bacteria an advantage, and we think that's why we see so many DGRs within the microbiome.""

The study also found that DGRs can hop from one strain of bacteria to another through a process called horizontal transfer. In that way, microbes seem to share their adaptive superpower within the larger community surrounding them.

To examine how DGRs affect the development of the newborn gut microbiome, the team analyzed microbiomes from mothers and their children over the first year of life. Certain DGRs were transferred from mother to infant. In offspring, the researchers pinpointed changes to DNA for Bacteriodes' pili proteins, indicating that DGRs altered the bugs to help set up shop in their new home. This finding suggests DGRs are one mechanism important for establishing the developing microbiome.

The researchers plan to dig deeper into DGRs and the gut microbiome with lab models and observational studies in humans. They believe that the insights in the current study may be a jumping-off point for future discoveries that improve human health, or even yield new methods for genetic engineering.

""We're at this really early stage,"" Miller said. ""There are so many questions that this raises, we're just realizing how much we don't know about DGRs in the microbiome, or what exploiting them for applications could yield. I've never been more excited about what's going to come next.""

Umesh Ahuja, a UCLA research associate, is co-corresponding author of the study. Other co-authors are Yanling Wang, Cora Woodward, Jessica Revilla, Bennett Shaw, Kayvan Sasaninia, Gillian Varnum and Sara Makanani, all of UCLA; and Chiara Berruto of Caltech.

The study was supported by the National Institutes of Health and the Fred Kavli Endowment Fund.

A simple two-week routine of jotting down daily work wins on a smartphone app gave Japanese employees a measurable boost in energy and enthusiasm.

Study: Effects of a Smartphone-Based Positive Reflection Diary on Work Engagement Among Japanese Workers: Randomized Controlled Trial. Image credit: insta_photos/Shuttrstock.com

A recent study in JMIR mHealth and uHealth evaluated the effect of a newly developed smartphone-based positive reflection diary, WEDiary, on improving work engagement among Japanese workers, using a randomized controlled design.

Work engagement refers to an employee's strengths and positive attitude, such as vigor, dedication, and absorption in their work. In a positive psychological state, employees feel that time passes quickly and may have trouble leaving work. Work engagement positively correlates with job satisfaction, performance, and organizational commitment.  It is beneficial for both the organization and employees.

The job demands-resources (JD-R) model suggests that job resources facilitate work engagement through a positive motivational process. Elevated job resources lead to increased work engagement and positive health and organizational outcomes. However, higher job demands or stressors increase the risk of burnout and negative health and organizational outcomes.

Positive work reflection is considered a personal resource in the JD-R model, crucial for increasing engagement. Previous studies have highlighted that employees' engagement improves when employees reflect on their work achievements and growth. Therefore, strategies that involve increasing personal resources and focusing on workers' achievements, rather than dwelling on negativities, may improve work engagement.

Positive work reflection focuses on the positive aspects of one's job, such as successful task performance and supportive work relationships. A recent meta-analysis found that off-job positive work-related thoughts positively impact work engagement.

Smartphone apps for tracking work engagement offer several advantages, including being easy to start and complete quickly, requiring minimal explanation, and being accessible at any time and place. There are two types of smartphone apps: web browser apps (web apps) and those that run as native apps. Compared to web apps, native apps are more effective in memory usage. However, not many native smartphone apps are available that are explicitly designed to improve worker well-being.

A two-group parallel-group, nonblinded, randomized controlled trial (RCT) was conducted to assess the impact of WEDiary on work engagement among Japanese employees. The intervention period lasted for two weeks, followed by a three-week follow-up.

The current study recruited registered participants in a web survey company, Macromill Inc., Japan. All participants were between 20 and 59 years of age, had two consecutive days off in a week, had no inclination to resign from their job within the next three months, and used iOS 10.0 or later or Android 5.1 or later smartphones.

After completing the baseline survey (between October 31, 2019, and November 5, 2019), participants were randomly allocated at a 1:1 ratio either to the intervention group or the wait-list control group. Each group contained 300 participants.

Participants in the intervention group downloaded WEDiary, which was designed to incorporate a post-work experience. This app encouraged participants to write what they could do at work that day. In contrast, participants from the wait-list control group were advised to carry on their usual activities until completion of the survey, 3 weeks after the intervention. Work engagement was evaluated at pre-intervention (T1), post-intervention (T2), and 3 weeks after the intervention (T3) in both groups.

Participants completed questionnaires at T2 and at T3. In the intervention group, approximately 85.7% of the participants responded to the questionnaires at T2 and 83% at T3. Similarly, 94.7% of participants from the wait-list control group responded to the questionnaires at T2 and 93.7% at T3.

No significant demographic differences were observed among participants in both study groups, except for education level. In contrast to the wait-list control group, most participants in the intervention group had completed high school (19.7%), and some attended graduate school (8.3%). Additionally, the majority of participants were male and married.

The effect of the WEDiary on work engagement was assessed using intention-to-treat (ITT) analyses, which revealed a significant effect between the two groups. In the intervention group, participants exhibited significant vigor and dedication. However, no significant difference was observed between the two groups.

A total of 124 participants from the intervention group and 277 from the wait-list control group were included in the per-protocol analyses, which revealed a significant effect on work engagement, particularly in terms of vigor and dedication. A mixed model analysis indicated that the WEDiary had significantly improved work engagement among females, university graduates or higher, white-collar workers, and regular employees.

Out of the 80.3% of the participants in the intervention group who installed the WEDiary on their smartphones, 63.7% used it at least once. A gradual decrease in the number of daily users was observed over the study period. Although these results were statistically significant, the effect sizes were small (Cohen's d ≈ 0.11 – 0.12), suggesting that while the app had a measurable impact, the magnitude of improvement was modest.

The current RCT revealed that the newly developed WEDiary effectively improved work engagement among Japanese workers. Effect sizes were small but consistent across measurement points, indicating gradual accumulation of positive emotions over time.

In the future, more research is required to investigate the long-term effects and the mechanisms underlying the beneficial effects.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Harvard researchers augment LLM to create expert diagnostic system","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20251010/Harvard-researchers-augment-LLM-to-create-expert-diagnostic-system.aspx","Fri, 10 Oct 2025 04:51:00 GMT","

Except for one key aspect, the setup is a familiar one in medicine: An expert diagnostician presents a particularly challenging case to a roomful of colleagues, carefully walking them through the patient's symptoms and initial test results. The physician explains her reasoning in detail as she breaks down the case and every possibility she considered, aided by a slide deck. At the end of the five-minute talk, she reveals her diagnosis and the next steps she would recommend.

The twist? This time, the physician in question is an artificial intelligence system called Dr. CaBot.

Researchers at Harvard Medical School are developing Dr. CaBot as a medical education tool. The system, which operates in both presentation and written formats, shows how it reasons through a case, offering what's called a differential diagnosis - a comprehensive list of possible conditions that explain what's going on - and narrowing down the possibilities until it reaches a final diagnosis.

Dr. CaBot's ability to spell out its ""thought process"" rather than focusing solely on reaching an accurate answer distinguishes it from other AI diagnostic tools. It is also one of only a few models designed to tackle more complex medical cases.

""We wanted to create an AI system that could generate a differential diagnosis and explain its detailed, nuanced reasoning at the level of an expert diagnostician,"" said Arjun (Raj) Manrai, assistant professor of biomedical informatics in the Blavatnik Institute at HMS. Manrai created Dr. CaBot with Thomas Buckley, a Harvard Kenneth C. Griffin School of Arts and Sciences doctoral student and a member of the Manrai lab.

Although the system is not yet ready for use in the clinic, Manrai and his team have been providing demonstrations of Dr. CaBot at Boston-area hospitals. Now, Dr. CaBot has a chance to prove itself by going head-to-head with an expert diagnostician in The New England Journal of Medicine's famed Case Records of the Massachusetts General Hospital, also known as clinicopathological conferences, or CPCs. It marks the first time the journal is publishing an AI-generated diagnosis.

The resulting medical case discussion, published Oct. 8 in NEJM, offers a window into Dr. CaBot's capabilities, showcasing its usefulness for medical educators and students - and hinting at its potential for physicians in the clinic. As the researchers continue to improve Dr. CaBot, they hope that it will serve as a useful model for other medical-AI teams around the world.

The concept of CPCs dates back to the late 1800s, when physicians at Massachusetts General Hospital began using patient case studies for medical education. In 1900, Mass General pathologist Richard Cabot - for whom Dr. CaBot is named - formalized these as part of the curriculum for HMS doctors-in-training. Since 1923, NEJM has been continuously publishing the cases as CPCs to teach physicians how other physicians reason through complex cases.

The cases are pretty legendary. They're known to be extremely challenging, filled with distractions and red herrings.""

Arjun (Raj) Manrai, Assistant Professor, Biomedical Informatics, Blavatnik Institute, HMS

Each CPC consists of a detailed presentation of the case from the patient's doctors. Then, an expert not involved in the case is invited to give a presentation to colleagues at Mass General explaining their reasoning, step-by-step, and providing a differential diagnosis before homing in on the most likely possibility. After that, the patient's doctors reveal the actual diagnosis. The diagnostician's write-up is published in NEJM along with the case presentation. 

The Oct. 8 NEJM article includes a typical case presentation along with a carefully reasoned differential diagnosis from expert diagnostician Gurpreet Dhaliwal of San Francisco Veterans Affairs Medical Center and the University of California, San Francisco, whom Manrai describes as ""a real, modern Dr. House."" After that, Dr. CaBot's differential diagnosis appears.

Manrai and Buckley were encouraged to see that although Dr. CaBot reasoned through the case differently than Dhaliwal, it reached a comparable final diagnosis.

During graduate school, Manrai became fascinated by how CPCs demystify the process that physicians use to arrive at a diagnosis. They reminded him of the mystery novels he enjoyed growing up.

More recently, his lab and others have studied the accuracy of AI models for providing patient diagnoses. Manrai wondered whether it was possible to design a system that could go further.

The core of Dr. CaBot is OpenAI's o3 large language reasoning model. In building the system, Buckley, who is a Dunleavy Fellow in HMS' AI in Medicine track, needed to augment o3 with new abilities.

One is Dr. CaBot's ability to efficiently search millions of clinical abstracts from high-impact journals, which helps it properly cite its work and avoid factual hallucinations. Dr. CaBot can also search its ""brain"" of several thousand CPCs and use these examples to replicate the style of an expert diagnostician in NEJM. The team is working closely with clinician collaborators at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and other Harvard-affiliated hospitals to continue refining the system.

Dr. CaBot delivers two main products.

The first is a roughly five-minute, narrated, slide-based video presentation of a case, in which the system explains how it reasoned through the possibilities to come to a diagnosis. The presentations are ""surprisingly lifelike,"" Buckley said, complete with filler words like ""um,"" ""uh,"" and ""you know"" as well as colloquial phrases.

During the team's demonstrations, ""the realness of the narrated presentation seems to connect with physicians,"" Manrai said.

The other is a detailed written version of Dr. CaBot's reasoning and diagnosis.

The researchers are eager for physicians to engage with Dr. CaBot and provide expert feedback. To this end, they are planning more demonstrations at local hospitals, and they published a paper describing the system on a preprint server. They see the NEJM CPC as another opportunity for input.

""Dr. CaBot's AI-generated discussion has not been analyzed for correctness; any factual errors present have been retained so that the reader can observe the strengths and limitations of the system,"" the editor's note on the CPC reads, concluding, ""whether AI has a legitimate use in clinical decision making is up to the reader to determine.""

 Dr. CaBot is also available online, where users can test the system on new cases for educational and research purposes, and review presentations and write-ups for 15 existing cases ranging from ""A Newborn Girl With Skin Lesions"" to ""An 89-Year-Old Man With Progressive Dyspnea.""

""We're really trying to stick our necks out,"" Manrai said. ""There's great potential to be embarrassed, but you learn a lot by playing a video for actual clinicians for five minutes. We're getting so much feedback that way.""

Although the primary use case for Dr. CaBot is as an educational tool, its ability to rapidly sift through millions of clinical abstracts could also make it a valuable research aid.

According to Manrai and Buckley, the tool would need further improvement, validation, and the addition of patient privacy protections before it could be considered for implementation in real-world settings. However, the team noted that physicians are already expressing interest. 

The advantages of an AI system are that it is always available, doesn't get tired, isn't juggling responsibilities, and can quickly search vast quantities of medical literature, they said.

Manrai added that there's evidence physicians are using AI tools ""in amounts that I think would surprise a lot of folks,"" including ChatGPT and a physician-specific platform called OpenEvidence.

""We're very nascent in human-AI collaboration,"" Manrai said, but the field is evolving rapidly. Eventually, Dr. CaBot might join the AI toolbox that physicians are already exploring as they determine how to best help their patients.

Scientists have discovered that mental health patients who have skin conditions may be more at risk of worse outcomes, including suicidality and depression. This work, which may aid in identifying at-risk patients and personalising psychiatric treatment, is presented at the ECNP meeting in Amsterdam.

The researchers looked at 481 patients with a first episode of psychosis (which is the first time an individual experiences a psychotic episode, such as loss of contact with reality, hallucinations and delusions). On testing, 14.5% were found to have dermatological symptoms (24% female, 9.8% male) such as rash, itching, photosensitivity, etc. All patients were given 4 weeks treatment with an antipsychotic and then checked for a range of mental health parameters.Lead researcher, Dr Joaquín Galvañ (Instituto de Investigación Sanitaria Gregorio Marañón, Madrid) said:""After 4 weeks of follow-up, patients with a first episode of psychosis presenting with skin conditions experienced higher levels of depression and risk of suicide. We found that just 7% of the patients without the initial skin conditions had suicidal thoughts or attempts, in contrast, around 25% of the patients with initial skin conditions had suicidal thoughts or attempts. Initial skin conditions are also linked to greater depression and poorer well-being at follow-up. This discovery suggests that the presence of skin conditions indicates that these patients are more at risk for worse outcomes than patients who do not have skin conditions after a first episode of psychosis"".The researchers note that, if confirmed, this finding has the potential to act as an advance marker for mental health risk, similar to the way, a blood test might indicate a greater risk of cancer or heart disease.The brain and the skin both derive from the same embryonic origin - the ectoderm - prompting the researchers to investigate the relation between the skin and mental health.Dr Galvañ continued:""It was already known that between 30% and 60% of people with skin conditions show psychiatric symptoms. What we have done is look at things from the opposite direction; do people with mental health problems have skin conditions, and if so, can this tell us anything useful? Our findings suggest that dermatological symptoms may represent a marker of illness severity and poor short-term outcomes in the early stages of psychosis, potentially identifying a subgroup of patients with a poorer clinical prognosis who may benefit from early tailored interventions. The reason for the connection is still unclear, but our working hypothesis is that this may be due to the skin and neurological systems having common developmental origins and inflammatory pathways; but this needs to be confirmed. As far as we know this is the first study to show this link in patients with psychosis, so we need follow-up studies to confirm the finding. We also need to understand if this link applies also to a range of other psychiatric conditions, such as bipolar disorder, ADHD, anxiety or depression"".Commenting, Professor Eric Ruhe (Professor of Difficult-to-Treat Depression at Radboud University, the Netherlands) said:""This is an interesting association between skin problems and a first episode of psychosis. These results need replication in different cohorts but might indeed show a new link between skin and psychopathology. As the skin and the brain derive from the same embryonic origin, this would worth pursuing further, both diagnostically and mechanistically (which may be more interesting). For example, this association might be used to culture skin cells to begin to understand which treatment is appropriate"".This is an independent comment, Professor Ruhe was not involved in this work.

Ahead of the 2026 FIFA World Cup, there's plenty of soccer for avid fans to watch—specifically those in the United States.

Tonight, the U.S. Men's National Team takes on Ecuador at 8:30 p.m. ET in an international friendly match.

Aside from their bout with Ecuador, the USMNT also has one additional game this month, while the U.S. Women's National Team faces Portugal on October 23 ahead of two more games to cap off October.

All of those matches air on TNT, which for many, is difficult to access unless you fork out hundreds on cable. However, if you're a cable cutter (like many) and want a short-term option to enjoy the games, a Sling Pass is the perfect option.

With Sling's recent introduction of three short-term passes, soccer fans can enjoy soccer in the form of a day, weekend or week-long pass to eliminate those pesky monthly costs or locked in contracts.

RANCAGUA, Chile – The U.S. U-20 Men's National Team utilized a 15th minute goal from captain Benjamin Cremaschi, a 79th minute free kick from Niko Tsakris and another goal from Cremaschi in the third minute of second-half stoppage time to claim a well-earned 3-0 win against Italy in the 2025 FIFA U-20 World Cup Round of 16 match at Estadio El Teniente. (HIGHLIGHTS)

With the result, the USA has beaten both France and Italy by 3-0 scores in this tournament and advanced to its fifth-straight FIFA U-20 World Cup Quarterfinal where it will face the winner of Thursday's other match between Morocco-Korea Republic at Estadio Teniente in Rancagua on Sunday, Oct. 12 at 4 p.m. ET (FOX Soccer Plus, Universo, Peacock).

Primed to bounce back after the 2-1 defeat to South Africa, U.S. head coach Marko Mitrović made seven changes to the lineup that started Sunday's group finale and the teams played relatively even through the early part of the match.

The stalemate nearly broke in the eighth minute as the first dangerous chances came from Italy. Attacker Mattia Mosconi earned some space on the right flank and swung in a cross that swerved with the wind before it clanged off the left post and was cleared away for a corner kick. On the ensuing take, the ball found its way to Christian Corradi whose snap header was well-saved by U.S. ‘keeper Adam Beaudry.

The USA staved off that early danger and then built up to the first goal. In the 14th minute, a cross from the left found Zavier Gozo at the far post. He settled and touched the ball to the top of the penalty box for Cremaschi and the U.S. captain fired a first time effort that was turned out for a corner kick by Italy ‘keeper Jacopo Seghetti. On the ensuring corner kick, Tsakiris hit a service from the right that was headed down by Nolan Norris, forcing another save from Seghetti, but Cremaschi was there on the doorstep to poke home the rebound and claim his fourth goal of the tournament.

Italy came close in the 35th minute as Mattia Mannini did well to break through the U.S. midfield before sliding a ball to Cristian Cama on the left. His first-time cross was nodded up in the air, before falling for Jamal Iddrissou whose effort from the ground was well-held by Beaudry.

Italy pressed hard on the U.S. back line in the 42nd minute and nearly unlocked the defense before Beaudry's low clearance made it to midfield where the U.S. found it had numbers in transition. Tsakiris possessed the ball in the center circle and sent Cole Campbell in one-on-one with an Italy defender. The winger drove toward the end line before attempting a chip that sailed just wide of the left post in the 42nd minute and the U.S. went into the locker room holding on to a 1-0 halftime lead.

The first 15 minutes of the second half was mostly devoid of opportunities, but Italy provided the first danger on the hour mark as Mannini picked up a loose ball from 25 yards out and fired a bouncing effort that Beaudry gobbled up. Italy continued to threaten and in the 73rd minute Javison Idele drove in a dangerous cross from the right that Beaudry stretched out at full extension to claim at the back post.

The USA bit back in the 75th minute as substitute Luke Brennan chased down a through ball on the right and stretched to send in low cross into the box. An Italy defender deflected it out of the area, but it eventually fell for Tsakiris who unleashed a knuckling blast that forced Seghetti to make a diving save to his right and push the ball out for a corner kick.

After threatening just moments before, Tsakiris bagged the USA's second. The U.S. midfielder earned the dead ball after being fouled just outside the penalty area on the left in the 78th minute. Both he and Cremaschi stood over the ball and the U.S. captain looked like he would take it, but instead Tsakiris stepped up and hit a curling left-footed effort that bent around the left side of Italy wall and tucked inside the left post to make it 2-0. It was a brilliant set play finish.

Italy pushed hard to get back in the game and requested not one but two plays to be reviewed by the Video Support System for penalty kicks, but both were correctly denied by the center ref.

The young Americans ended any Italian hope in the third minute of stoppage time when Brennan unlocked the Italian defense with a square ball from the right and then sent Cremaschi in on goal. He lifted the ball over the onrushing goalkeeper and into the center of the goal from about 11 yards out to seal the match and the berth in the tournament's final eight nations.

The United States men's national team will be back in action on Friday night, hosting Ecuador in Austin, Texas. It's a chance for the USMNT to begin their next winning streak while building on the good energy from defeating Japan during the September international window. Entering this match, there are slight concerns as Pochettino announced that Christian Pulisic didn't train on Thursday before the match. While the issue doesn't seem to be serious, this isn't the time to take risks with the Milan man. 

He'll be looked at and will have a chance to go for this match against Ecuador, but if he can't Haji Wright could get a chance on the left wing. Called back in due to his strong form for Coventry City, Wright is looking to make his second consecutive World Cup squad, and this will be a critical camp for that. Antonee Robinson has also returned to the USMNT setup and may not be fit to go 90 minutes. He acknowledged that he's not 100%, but if Robinson is good to go 60 minutes or so, it'd be a good time for Pochettino to get him into the XI in order to see what the side looks like with their starting left back.

It's especially important for Robinson to feature if the back three that helped lead to the defeat of Japan comes back. Pochettino has called in center backs who are strong in a back three, and with him stating that no player is a lock for the World Cup squad, being able to see players like Mark McKenzie in a back three will show how sustainable this formation can be. 

Call it What You Want: A weekly podcast where Jimmy Conrad, Charlie Davies and Tony Meola cover all things USMNT and the state of the beautiful game in the United States. Catch the show YouTube live every Tuesday and Thursday at 10 a.m. ET.

Ecuador sports a strong defense, and while they may not play their first-choice side after qualifying for the World Cup, the 24th-ranked team in the world will be a test for the USMNT. Their physicality can turn the match into a grind, but that's exactly why it's a good test. Some players in Pochettino's squad are used to those kinds of matches, but this provides a chance to give players a group stage style test without the high stakes.

Let's take a look at how Pochettino could line the team up for the occasion:

USA: Matt Freese, Antonee Robinson, Mark McKenzie, Tim Ream, Chris Richards, Alex Freeman, Weston McKennie, Aidan Morris, Tim Weah, Folarin Balogun, Christian Pulisic

Entering the friendly, the U.S. has a win-draw-loss record of 5-5-5 against La Tri all time. The teams have met seven times since 2002, where all five U.S. wins have stemmed from.

The nations most recently faced off on March 21, 2019, where the U.S. won 1-0 in a friendly.

Here's a look at the U.S. squad for the October break:

La Tri has a strong roster of its own, but will be without Chelsea star defensive midfielder Moises Caicedo, while Arsenal left-back/center-back hybrid Piero Hincapie is nursing a groin injury.

Still, the team has veteran striker Enner Valencia, while Willian Pacho, Pervis Estupinian and Joel Ordonez form a robust and underrated backline that will cause the U.S. problems.

AUSTIN, Texas — Whatever happens in Friday night's difficult World Cup preparation game against Ecuador, U.S. coach Mauricio Pochettino is certain of one thing.

""I promise you, no one is sure that he is going to be on the roster of the World Cup 2026,"" Pochettino said Thursday during his pre-match press conference. ""I don't believe before that was the [case]. Today, I promise that all the guys feel they need to fight to be there. And that is priceless.""

Friday's contest at Q2 Stadium comes almost exactly a year to the day of the former Chelsea, Paris Saint-Germain and Tottenham Hotspur manager made his debut on the U.S. sideline. That 2-0 friendly victory over Panama last October somehow seems a lot longer ago than that. Much has changed around the program over the last 12 months, to Pochettino's point.

In short, he has forced the American players out of their comfort zone. It has also been a steep learning curve for Pochettino, who repeated on Friday that the USMNT shocking losses to that same Canaleros squad and fellow World Cup co-hosts Canada served as a ""wake-up call"" for him and his staff.

Now, after leaving Juventus midfielder Weston McKennie off of his September roster and omitting Yunus Musah — another 2022 World Cup starter — from the current one, he feels the proper tone has been set. He has his players' attention.

Whether he has them all at his disposal against Ecuador is another matter.

Pochettino revealed on the eve of the exhibition that star man Christian Pulisic didn't train on Thursday and might not be available. Same for left back Antonee ""Jedi"" Robinson and winger Alex Zendejas, who scored the game-winning goal in the Americans' most recent test, a 2-0 win over Japan last month. All are nursing minor injuries and could be rested for Tuesday's meeting with Australia in Commerce City, Colo., the second of this month's two tune-ups.

Ecuador won't be at full strength, either. After qualifying for the 2026 World Cup with ease, finishing second in South America behind only defending world champs Argentina following that continent's 18-match marathon, La Tricolor boss Sebastián Beccacece left several usual starters with their clubs this month, most notably Chelsea standout Moises Caicedo, possibly the best defensive midfielder on all of planet fútbol.

But other stars, like Pulisic's AC Milan teammate Pervis Estupinan and PSG defender Willian Pacho are here. And Ecuador hasn't lost a game since dropping a World Cup qualifier in Brazil more than a year ago now.

""They have speed,"" said McKennie.

Just facing a South American foe will be different. The full-strength U.S. hasn't done that since being eliminated from the 2024 Copa América by Uruguay, two months before Pochettino was hired to succeed Gregg Berhalter.

""They're also a team that's very aggressive,"" defender Chris Richards said. ""And they like to have a fight.""

An ideal opponent, then, for a U.S. squad with World Cup roster spots on the line, one that hasn't swept a two-match international window since beating Jamaica home and away in the Concacaf Nations League quarterfinals last November.

""I think we're settling in,"" Pulisic said. ""It's about building on good performances, one after the other, after last camp, feeling good. And now it's another great opportunity.""

That goes for both the USMNT and those hoping to be still be on it on the biggest stage of all.

""For sure the players that are going to play"" against Ecuador, Pochettino said, ""Are going to perform.""

Real Madrid forward Gonzalo Garcia recently spoke to El Larguero, sharing his thoughts on his breakthrough during the FIFA Club World Cup, the chance to leave last summer, and life at the Santiago Bernabéu.

The 21-year-old made a big impression during the Club World Cup, finishing as joint-top scorer with four goals. Reflecting on that period, he said,

“I look at it now with a little more perspective, as time has passed and I've come to terms with it a little better. I look back and I'm surprised myself.”

Despite receiving offers from other clubs, Gonzalo chose to remain at Real Madrid, fully aware that he would not be a first-choice starter. 

“My only option was always to stay at Real Madrid. For me, it's a dream to be part of the first team and I'm very happy with the decision I made.”

Competition at Madrid is fierce, with stars like Kylian Mbappe and even Endrick challenging for places. On this, Gonzalo noted,

“We're talking about the best club in the world, and obviously, the competition is intense because the best players are always here, but I've been in the youth academy for many years. 

“I've been a Real Madrid fan since I was a kid, and the truth is, I don't regret the decision I made.”

At the start of the 2025/26 season, there was discussion over who would inherit the vacated number 9 shirt. 

Endrick ultimately received the number, with Gonzalo showing maturity about the decision.

“I knew there was a possibility of keeping the number 9, but I didn't get to choose. 

“The club offers numbers to those who have been there the longest, and Endrick also wanted it, so he kept it. 

“I wasn't going to complain; I'm happy to be part of the squad, no matter what number I wear.”

Gonzalo also addressed the heavy 2-5 defeat against Atletico Madrid. “We didn't know how to read the game properly. It happened the way it did. 

“The manager said it before: joys and disappointments should be short-lived. We're focused on analysing what happened and trying to learn from it.”

Speaking on Xabi Alonso's influence, he added, “He always showed confidence in me during the Club World Cup, giving me advice to keep me as calm as possible. 

“He's very approachable with everyone. He's one of the best coaches in the world.”

Meanwhile, he was also asked about the situation with Federico Valverde and his playing position, which escalated for no apparent reason.

“No player has refused to play in another position. We're all willing to play anywhere to help the team. 

“I'm sure any player is willing to play anywhere for Real Madrid. I would play full-back, centre-back, or goalkeeper if they asked me.”

Finally, looking ahead, the young forward remains focused on the present,

“Right now, my mind is only focused on this season with Madrid, making the most of every minute I'm given. 

“There's no need to waste time thinking about the future because I'm where I want to be now,” he concluded.

Following his stellar performance for Brazil against South Korea earlier today, Real Madrid superstar Vinicius Jr. expressed gratitude towards manager Carlo Ancelotti.

The Brazilian winger was the star of the show, scoring and assisting one goal as the Selecao beat South Korea 5-0 in a friendly. His Real Madrid teammate, Rodrygo Goes, also starred with a brace.

After the team's win in Seoul, Vinicius praised Brazil coach Ancelotti, describing him as ‘the coach who gave me the most confidence.'

“He was always the best coach I've ever had. He was the coach who gave me the most confidence, the one I played my best with,” said Vinicius, as quoted by Mundo Deportivo.

“He's arrived here with the national team. I've played three games with him now, and I've managed to score two goals and provide one assist,” he added.

Vinicius also told reporters that the win over South Korea gives “confidence” to the entire team ahead of the 2026 FIFA World Cup, which begins in eight months in Canada, the United States, and Mexico.

“We have to prepare as quickly as possible because there's very little time left,” he warned.

Vinicius also emphasised that Ancelotti's arrival in the Brazil camp, under whom he enjoyed his best form at Real Madrid, has allowed the team's play to evolve positively. 

“We want to continue like this to have an excellent World Cup,” he stated.

Vinicius' comments come after he endured a difficult start to the campaign with Real Madrid, under Xabi Alonso, who replaced Ancelotti. 

Under the Spanish coach, the 25-year-old superstar player has been a substitute in some matches for technical reasons, although in recent appearances he has shown clear improvement, reclaiming his place in the starting lineup.

Robbie Williams admitted that he delayed the release of his new album Britpop to avoid competition with Taylor Swift's The Life of a Showgirl as he chases a monumental U.K. music charts record.


Britpop was originally slated to arrive today, Oct. 10, but in September (about one month after Swift announced her new album), the singer pushed his 13th studio LP to Feb. 6, 2026, because of “scheduling changes.” At the time, many speculated the change was Swift-related, especially because Williams is positioned to break a tie with the Beatles and score a record-setting 16th Number One on the U.K. Albums Chart. (Both Williams and the Beatles currently have 15 apiece.)


	At an intimate show in London last night (Oct. 9) — originally scheduled to coincide with Britpop's release — Williams confirmed that's exactly what happened. “We're all pretending [the scheduling change] is not about Taylor Swift, but it fucking is,” Williams cracked (per Billboard). “You can't compete with that.”

	











	While Williams admitted he was initially “worried” about making his fans wait several more months for the album, in an endearing display of pop star ego and self-deprecation, he quipped. “But then I was like, ‘Fuck it.' I'm sorry, but I'm fucking being selfish. How many times in your life do you get to have the most Number One albums the U.K. has fucking ever had?”

	Funnily enough, while Williams is now likely to secure that chart record next year, he may not get to hold onto it very long — because of Swift. She currently has 13 Number One albums in the U.K., with The Life of a Showgirl slated to be her 14th. (The U.K. albums chart will refresh with releases from last week later today, Oct. 10.)

	











	Along with potentially being his 16th Number One album, Britpop is also Williams' first proper pop album since 2016's The Heavy Entertainment Show. In 2019, he released a holiday album, The Christmas Present, which contained a handful of seasonal standards but was otherwise filled with Christmas-themed originals.

October 10 – FIFA president Gianni Infantino wants Europe's clubs us to keep an “open mind”, suggesting that the World Cup could be moved from its traditional summer slot to March or October – so football can “be better for everyone”.

The issue here is that football will not be better for everyone and in fact will be significantly worse for 95%+ of Europe's clubs and all of its leagues. It won't be good for its leading players either who are already struggling with increased workload. A total of 608 of the 831 players at the 2022 World Cup play for European clubs.

With Infantino's increased competition sizes, and his move into the club game with the expanded 32-team Club World Cup (which he now wants to increase to 48 teams and hold every two years), the bulk of Europe's professional players who are not competing in these competitions also face potentially disastrous consequences. Fracturing the infrastructure of the European game will inevitably threaten their jobs as clubs and leagues battle to retain sponsors and schedules in the face of an aggressive FIFA who want to hoover up everyone's financial lunch.

Infantino claims that they are calendar is impossible but essentially his message to Europe and its clubs on the sidelines of the European Football Club meeting in Rome is to expect more disruption to your calendars more often.

“In December you cannot play in one part of the world and in July you cannot play in another,” he said. “We have to have an open mind.”

Earlier in the EFC's plenary session his message to the clubs was: “Everywhere in the world there is football. Everywhere in the world they look at European football clubs. You are an example for the entire world. We stick together, we work together, we are united. We will develop [football] here in Europe — coming from Rome to the entire world.”

FIFA's concept of unity, an open mind and transparent debate is different to others, especially Europe's stakeholders where FIFA has refused to engage or invite either players' union FIFPRO or the European Leagues Association to the discussion table – though one suspects there is very little discussion in any case.

The 2034 World Cup will be played in Saudi Arabia which almost guarantees that it will be moved to a winter slot. The full Club World Cup is next scheduled for 2029 and Spain, Portugal and Morocco are favourites to host. If the schedule becomes bi-annual, Qatar are most people's front runners for 2031 which will again necessitate a move from summer.

Last summer, the United States hosted an expanded 32-team Club World Cup during a heatwave that saw temperatures in New York reach 39°C. Players complained, protests piled in from player unions, managers and clubs but the tournament went full-steam ahead with Infantino later calling it “a huge success from every possible angle.”

“Every possible angle,” of course, except the human one.

Infantino points to the Uefa Champions League's growth from €40 million in its early years to a robust and growing €4 billion today as a model. He dreams of the Club World Cup generating €200 billion over the next three decades.

While the next three World Cups in North America, then in the Morocco-Portugal-Spain-South America, and finally back to the Middle East in Saudi Arabia promise record profits, the cost will be borne by the players, whose seasons never end, and the fans, priced out of the spectacle they built.

The wages of those players are paid by the clubs, not FIFA, and the money from the World Cup goes to FIFA with only a disproportionately small amount going to clubs. In essence, the clubs are funding FIFA's World Cup finance fest, something Infantino refuses to acknowledge as he chases more and more money with very little thought for the top players without whom the World Cup would be a nonsense.

Unlike FIFA's Congress where national federations generally sleepwalk their way through Infantino and FIFA's agenda as they count the promises of money made for the next year, the club's are different beasts with leaders who are not so complaint or easily bullied.

However, Infantino knows that in their leader, PSG's Qatari chairman Nasser Al-Khelaifi, he has someone who, as their bromance grows without boundaries, will likely do what it takes to deliver the clubs to accept his calendar requirements. Other stakeholders be damned.

Check out our soccer expert's France vs Azerbaijan predictions, prior to Friday's 2:45 pm ET World Cup Qualifier clash (10/10).

It's hard to see past a heavy French victory here. It's likely to be a case of how many they win by, rather than wondering if they'll triumph or not.

All odds are courtesy of bet365, correct at the time of publishing and subject to change.

The depth of France's attacking options is clear, as they remain formidable even with Bradley Barcola, Marcus Thuram and Ousmane Dembele in the lineup. Michael Olise, Hugo Ekitike and, of course Mbappe, provide further firepower up front.

Aurelien Tchouameni is obviously suspended after his dismissal against Iceland, but again, the French have plenty of depth. Whoever Deschamps selects, they are likely to cause all sorts of problems for the Azeris.

Iceland put five past Aykhan Abbasov's side last month, so France can certainly do at least a similar amount of damage - if not more. Shahrudin Mahammadaliyev is set to have a busy night between the sticks. It's been a while since these teams last met, but when they did - in 1995 - Les Bleus got double figures in a 10-0 victory.

As previously mentioned, France haven't been at their glittering best for a while now, and had to come from behind to beat Iceland. With so many attackers unavailable, Azerbaijan may feel like they can keep the hosts at bay - at least for a while. Most of the goals that Milli komanda have conceded this season have been in the second half of games.

That happens to be where the French often come to life. Teams aim to frustrate them, but in the end, their forward options prove to be too strong. Chasing Mbappe, Olise and company for 90 minutes is no easy task, and more often than not, they break through.

Deschamps' side have scored nine goals after the break in their six games in 2025, and you'd back them to finish strongly again. Patience could be a virtue for them this weekend.

Michael Olise has been shining for Bayern Munich in recent months, and he has scored 16 goals since the start of the Club World Cup. The former Crystal Palace star has also got four G/A in his last five at international level as he continues to step up in the absence of others. At 23, he has immense potential.

Mbappe is obviously seen as the bookies' favourite to find the net, but there's not much value in backing him. Other options include Ekitike and potential debutant Jean-Philippe Mateta, but we expect multiple goalscorers. Olise, with the sort of form that he's in, could easily be among them.

France haven't been at their best, and they have some injury problems, but that hasn't stopped them from having a perfect start to World Cup qualifying. Wins over Ukraine and Iceland have them in the driving seat in Group D, and Kylian Mbappe is in spectacular form. Didier Deschamps' side have only lost twice in 2025 so far.

Therefore, Azerbaijan will face a tough challenge when they visit Paris. They've lost four of their six games this year up to now, and only scored in two of them. Their recent draw with Ukraine offers some hope, but they did benefit from playing at home that day.

France expected lineup: Maignan, Kounde, Saliba, Upamecano, Hernandez, Rabiot, Kone, Coman, Olise, Ekitike, Mbappe

Azerbaijan expected lineup: Mahammadaliyev, Dashdamirov, Badalov, Mustafazada, Krivotsyuk, Aliyev, Khaybulaev, Mahmudov, Nuriiev, Emreli, Dadashov","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

FIFA president Gianni Infantino Frederic J. Brown / AFP via Getty Images

After paying hundreds or thousands of dollars for the “right to buy” 2026 World Cup tickets, some fans now say they feel “ripped off,” “scammed” or “taken advantage of” by FIFA and its digital collectibles platform, FIFA Collect.

Over the past year, FIFA and a crypto partner, Modex, have sold tens of thousands of “Right To Buy” tokens on the platform. Each token cost hundreds of dollars and promised buyers the ability to purchase one or two World Cup tickets at a to-be-determined later date, for a to-be-determined full price.

“Owning an RTB does not include the cost of the ticket(s) itself,” FIFA Collect clarified on an FAQ page.

Still, fans and scalpers flocked to the platform. Many saw the so-called “RTBs” as a clever way to bypass ticket lotteries, and perhaps more cost-effective than buying on the secondary market, where tickets are currently listed for far more than their original price.

But on Tuesday, when FIFA Collect administrators revealed that only Category 1 and 2 tickets — the most expensive tickets, and therefore the least coveted in FIFA's first sales phase — would be available to the vast majority of RTB holders, some of the holders fumed.

“NO WAY,” one wrote incredulously in a Discord channel where users interact with one another and with FIFA Collect admins.

“This is so bad, there's no value in buying a RTB,” another said.

Multiple RTB holders told The Athletic that they and many others had assumed they'd be able to use the tokens to buy more affordable tickets. Early buyers were told by FIFA Collect in a December 2024 email reviewed by The Athletic: “Tickets will be available across different categories, providing options to suit various preferences and needs.”

Jon Heath, one of those buyers, told The Athletic: “The whole point for me was (seemingly) access to face value tickets in cheaper categories.”

Instead, having already spent thousands of dollars apiece on RTBs for the U.S. men's national team's opening match, he'll now have to pay an additional $1,940 per Category 2 ticket or $2,735 per Category 1 ticket.

FIFA Collect administrators said Tuesday that 70 per cent of the tickets that will soon be made available to RTB holders will be in Category 1, the most expensive category; 28 per cent would be in Category 2; and a mere 2 per cent would be in Category 3. None will be available in Category 4.

“If I had known those percentages up front, I wouldn't have bothered with RTBs,” Heath wrote in a text message.

Alann Diaz, a longtime FIFA Collect user and RTB buyer, told The Athletic: “The community is pissed off.”

Many also rushed to sell their RTBs on FIFA Collect's secondary marketplace. Before Tuesday's Discord call with users, dozens of RTBs per day were being resold for profit. In the hours after the call concluded, amid the digital uproar, some market prices nosedived to below the original purchase price.

“The market is crashing,” Diaz said Wednesday night. “Badly.”

The sentiment wasn't unanimous. Some RTB holders pointed out that, in some cases, the price of their RTB plus the price of Category 1 tickets they'll be able to buy is roughly equivalent to or less than the current price of those same tickets on FIFA's resale platform.

But others disputed that math and felt wronged.

“I feel ripped off,” said Weston Binford, who, over the past month, spent thousands on RTBs for several matches in Texas, but now feels “turned off” because the tickets themselves are too expensive. “And I feel stupid.”

Blok, an avid user who spoke on the condition that he be identified only by his online alias, told The Athletic: “We were taken advantage of and we seem to have no voice.”

“We have been scammed for a long time,” Diaz wrote in a WhatsApp message. “Nothing we can do about it.”

For months, some of these same users had been asking FIFA Collect for answers: When would they be able to convert their RTBs into tickets? What type of tickets? And how much would the tickets cost?

Weeks of virtual silence came and went. On Sept. 19, in an attempt to quell frustration, an administrator wrote to Discord users: “Guys, rest assured, you will be content with the outcome. If I reveal any piece of information without authorization, I lose my job. [Smiling emoji].”

But even as FIFA's first 2026 World Cup ticket sales phase opened, answers never came. In fact, FIFA never announced any ticket prices beyond a minimum and maximum. Some RTB holders say they assumed the best points of reference were the prices proposed by North American soccer officials back in 2018, during their bid for the tournament, or the prices at previous World Cups.

When tickets did ultimately go on sale last week, prices were multiple times higher than either point of comparison. And on Tuesday, RTB holders were told they would pay those same prices — or, perhaps, higher ones, subject to FIFA's “variable pricing.”

“I assumed the Right To Buys would get [us] the best pricing,” Binford said. “But it does not appear that that's the case.”

FIFA never actually released World Cup ticket prices. (They were revealed by The Athletic, via screenshots and data from fans.) FIFA Collect did, though, continue to aggressively promote and sell RTBs through last weekend. On Saturday, it went to market with new batches of “City Glory” packs. You could pay $3,999 for the “right to buy” two tickets to Mexico's third group match, or $999 for the USMNT's opener, or $749 for the USMNT's group finale. On the low end, you could pay $299 for the right to buy one or two tickets to a random match in Houston, or $329 for the equivalent in Foxborough, Mass.

Those, it seems, were some of the last sales before a November RTB conversion window, during which, a FIFA Collect administrator said, holders will be able to exchange their tokens for “what we call a digital collectible ticket” — an NFT that will then convert into an actual ticket in May or June, weeks or days before the World Cup begins.

Since it began selling Right To Buys last year, FIFA Collect has accumulated more than $35 million in primary sales, according to spinoff websites, with much of the money connected to RTBs.

After learning details of the RTB conversion process this week, some users ridiculed the FIFA Collect admin's previous assurance that they'd be “content with the outcome.” One wrote: “Please help me understand one thing anyone could rationally think we would be content with. Just one.”

When pressed about the prices Tuesday, another nameless FIFA Collect admin said: “Pricing is set by FIFA Ticketing.”

When asked why there were no Category 4 tickets and hardly any Category 3 tickets available to RTB holders, he said: “We are unfortunately just handling the allocations that we've been provided by FIFA. Cat 4, as far as I understand, is really really a fraction of all the tickets. Cat 3, you do have a point. These are the allocations that we got.”

FIFA, soccer's global governing body, owns FIFA Collect. The platform is operated by Modex, a European-based blockchain provider, but Modex executives appear to work in coordination with multiple departments at FIFA.

A FIFA spokesperson, when asked why it was appropriate to sell tens of millions of dollars worth of RTBs without telling fans what types of tickets the RTBs could yield, or how much they'd have to pay for the tickets, said in an emailed statement: “As per standard practice, FIFA does not disclose specifics on business, financial or commercial strategies. It does, however, continually analyse and assess these strategies on a regular basis to ensure they are working in the interest of the fan and global football.”

When asked why 70 per cent of the tickets being offered were Category 1 tickets, with little to no availability in cheaper categories, the FIFA spokesperson said that category allocations “vary between sales phases and venues, and are reviewed continually to balance demand, venue capacities and fan access. FIFA recognises the passion and feedback from fans and will continue to evaluate and refine the approach to ensure the best possible experience.”

It's unclear what percentage of the revenue from RTB sales has gone directly to FIFA, as opposed to Modex or to charity. In mid-July, new packs began including a note that said “20 per cent of all proceeds” would go to the FIFA Global Citizen Education Fund and “help provide education access to the world's most marginalized children, build safe learning environments, and accelerate progress toward every child's right to quality education across more than 200 countries.” FIFA Collect's website says that $3.1 million has so far been raised for the fund.

A FIFA spokesperson, when asked last month about revenue breakdowns, wrote that the governing body “does not disclose the specifics of commercial and financial agreements or strategies.”

But he did say: “As with all of FIFA's commercial activities, revenues go directly back into football development and social projects worldwide, with Modex taking a commission to scale operations and cover technical costs. FIFA Collect therefore provides life-changing opportunities for fans, new digital ecosystems for stakeholders, and additional revenue to grow the game globally.”

Belgium has revenge in sight as it hosts North Macedonia in the 2026 World Cup qualifying on Friday.

North Macedonia has an opportunity to do something special and move within inches of an automatic qualifying place for the 2026 World Cup when it travels to Belgium on Friday. The top two teams in UEFA qualifying Group J will square off in Ghent, with North Macedonia holding the slimmest of advantages for the time being.

A single point is all that stands between the two teams at the top of the pool, though the Lynxes are at a slight disadvantage considering they've played one game more. That game in hand makes it all the more crucial that North Macedonia gets a result at the Planet Group Arena, having failed to beat Belgium in five previous meetings to date.

Blagoja Milevski's side managed to frustrate the Red Devils when these countries clashed back in June, striking in the 86th minute to secure a 1-1 home draw. That brought an end to North Macedonia's three-loss streak in this rivalry, proof of the progress it has made in recent years.

The Premier League duo of Youri Tielemans and Romeo Lavia aren't among Rudi Garcia's selection as they contend with injuries, while Romelu Lukaku is also sidelined. Meanwhile, the experienced duo of Kevin De Bruyne and Axel Witsel are back in the national team fold, as is Eintracht Frankfurt striker Michy Batshuayi, who hasn't scored for Belgium since 2022.

Every day brings us closer to the 2026 FIFA World Cup, when a tournament-high nine matches will come to North Texas next summer.

On Thursday, officials from the North Central Texas Council of Governments talked through the latest plan to help hundreds of thousands of soccer fans get to AT&T Stadium in time for kickoff.

Watch NBC 5 free wherever you are

Mary Sue's Hot Chicken and Dough in Arlington is about as close as a business can be to AT&T Stadium.

“I may be able to throw a rock and hit it on a good day,” said Kevin Jacobs.

Create a free account with NBC 5 DFW to save articles and videos.

From right across the street, they've had a front row seat to what traffic looks like on a Dallas Cowboys gameday and the impact it can have on people trying to make it to their restaurant.

“It's pretty congested,” said Jacobs. “It can pose some challenges.”

A challenge that's getting taken to a whole other level in summer 2026.

The latest news from around North Texas.

“The challenge we have is having transit to the stadium,” said Natalie Bettger, Senior Program Manager with NCTCOG.

In a meeting on Thursday, North Texas leaders walked through the latest transportation plan for the 2026 FIFA World Cup, which will bring nine Super Bowl-sized matches to DFW from June 14 to July 14.

“In the past, we've developed a plan for one big game,” said Bettger. “Well, we get to develop a plan, but we have nine opportunities to make it better.”

Organizers said they would have to get more than 70,000 fans inside the stadium for each match.

The latest plan relied on multiple tools, including car traffic and a fleet of 120 charter buses traveling back and forth on I-30.

Fans will also be able to take rail lines from Dallas and Fort Worth to the DFW Airport area, where charter buses will also shuttle fans south to AT&T Stadium.

Kevin Jacobs said transit officials have already come by Mary Sue's to warn them to get ready for the incoming flood of humanity.

“I was excited and at the same time, a little bit just more so thinking, okay, how can we capitalize on it, how does this become an opportunity?” said Jacobs.

Jacobs told NBC 5 that Mary Sue's planned to increase staffing to serve the huge crowds of fans walking around the area.

And for their usual customers who may struggle to get into Arlington on match days, they would be bringing on more delivery drivers.

They said with the proper planning, the World Cup could be a chance to get Mary Sue's chicken and “dough babies” to more customers than ever before.

“It's pretty good, if it was me, I might fight through the crowd to get here,” said Jacobs.

Organizers said the final transit plan is due to FIFA in March, and they would run a full test of the plan in the spring.","{'href': 'https://www.nbcdfw.com', 'title': 'NBC 5 Dallas-Fort Worth'}","soccer"

AUSTIN, Texas — Whatever happens in Friday night's difficult World Cup preparation game against Ecuador, U.S. coach Mauricio Pochettino is certain of one thing.

""I promise you, no one is sure that he is going to be on the roster of the World Cup 2026,"" Pochettino said Thursday during his pre-match press conference. ""I don't believe before that was the [case]. Today, I promise that all the guys feel they need to fight to be there. And that is priceless.""

Friday's contest at Q2 Stadium comes almost exactly a year to the day of the former Chelsea, Paris Saint-Germain and Tottenham Hotspur manager made his debut on the U.S. sideline. That 2-0 friendly victory over Panama last October somehow seems a lot longer ago than that. Much has changed around the program over the last 12 months, to Pochettino's point.

In short, he has forced the American players out of their comfort zone. It has also been a steep learning curve for Pochettino, who repeated on Friday that the USMNT shocking losses to that same Canaleros squad and fellow World Cup co-hosts Canada served as a ""wake-up call"" for him and his staff.

Now, after leaving Juventus midfielder Weston McKennie off of his September roster and omitting Yunus Musah — another 2022 World Cup starter — from the current one, he feels the proper tone has been set. He has his players' attention.

Whether he has them all at his disposal against Ecuador is another matter.

Pochettino revealed on the eve of the exhibition that star man Christian Pulisic didn't train on Thursday and might not be available. Same for left back Antonee ""Jedi"" Robinson and winger Alex Zendejas, who scored the game-winning goal in the Americans' most recent test, a 2-0 win over Japan last month. All are nursing minor injuries and could be rested for Tuesday's meeting with Australia in Commerce City, Colo., the second of this month's two tune-ups.

Ecuador won't be at full strength, either. After qualifying for the 2026 World Cup with ease, finishing second in South America behind only defending world champs Argentina following that continent's 18-match marathon, La Tricolor boss Sebastián Beccacece left several usual starters with their clubs this month, most notably Chelsea standout Moises Caicedo, possibly the best defensive midfielder on all of planet fútbol.

But other stars, like Pulisic's AC Milan teammate Pervis Estupinan and PSG defender Willian Pacho are here. And Ecuador hasn't lost a game since dropping a World Cup qualifier in Brazil more than a year ago now.

""They have speed,"" said McKennie.

Just facing a South American foe will be different. The full-strength U.S. hasn't done that since being eliminated from the 2024 Copa América by Uruguay, two months before Pochettino was hired to succeed Gregg Berhalter.

""They're also a team that's very aggressive,"" defender Chris Richards said. ""And they like to have a fight.""

An ideal opponent, then, for a U.S. squad with World Cup roster spots on the line, one that hasn't swept a two-match international window since beating Jamaica home and away in the Concacaf Nations League quarterfinals last November.

""I think we're settling in,"" Pulisic said. ""It's about building on good performances, one after the other, after last camp, feeling good. And now it's another great opportunity.""

That goes for both the USMNT and those hoping to be still be on it on the biggest stage of all.

""For sure the players that are going to play"" against Ecuador, Pochettino said, ""Are going to perform.""

Steve Nicol believes Mo Salah could be facing a crisis in confidence this season as his struggles continued vs Chelsea. (1:35)

Bafana Bafana will look to get back on top of Group C of CAF FIFA World Cup qualifying when they face Zimbabwe at Moses Mabhida Stadium on Friday.

Hugo Broos' side topped the group with 17 points before a three-point deduction for fielding the ineligible Teboho Mokoena in a March clash with Lesotho. They now sit level with Benin on 14 points and behind on goal difference as a result of the forfeit to Likuena.

According to Raymond Hack -- a CAS arbitrator who has previously served as South African Football Association (SAFA) CEO and a FIFA Disciplinary Committee member -- there is no realistic chance that the association's appeal will see Bafana's win over Lesotho reinstated.

However - as Benin head coach Gernot Rohr has pointed out - Bafana still have a ""crazy"" advantage: playing away fixtures against neighbouring countries at home due to a lack of suitable venues in those countries.

The clash with Zimbabwe is technically an away fixture, but it will be played on South African soil in Durban.

Ahead of Bafana Bafana's final match of World Cup qualifiers against Rwanda on October 14, it is vital that they put themselves back in pole position to top the group. The winner will automatically advance to the 2026 World Cup in the USA, Canada and Mexico.

Meanwhile, the four best runners-up across nine groups in CAF qualifying will advance to a four-team knockout tournament to determine Africa's representative at the inter-continental playoffs.

Date: Friday, October 10 at 6:00 PM CAT (4:00 PM GMT)

Venue: Moses Mabhida Stadium, Durban

How to watch: The match is available on SuperSport and SABC.

Notable absentees from the Bafana Bafana squad are Kamogelo Sebelebele (despite his form on the wing for Orlando Pirates) and veteran striker Bradley Grobler (despite his new lease on life at Sekhukhune United).

Additionally, Sipho Mbule appears to have risen above fellow Orlando Pirates teammate Patrick 'Tito' Maswanganyi in the pecking order - having made the squad at his expense. Mbule is capable of playing in a variety of midfield roles, but Broos is likely to utilise him behind the striker.

Khuliso Mudau is likely to slot in at right-back, having returned to action at Mamelodi Sundowns after a standoff with the club amid reported interest from North Africa was resolved.

Sphephelo 'Yaya' Sithole also makes the squad after his return from a long injury layoff and is likely to feature in midfield.

Winger Relebohile Mofokeng is injured, with Mduduzi Shabalala taking his place in the squad.

Iqraam Rayners was another late withdrawal due to medical reasons, with Evidence Makgopa replacing him.

Expected lineups:

South Africa

GK Ronwen Williams

LB Aubrey Modiba | CB Siyabonga Ngezana | CB Mbekezeli Mbokazi | RB Khuliso Mudau

CM Sphephelo 'Yaya' Sithole | CM Teboho Mokoena

LW Oswin Appollis | AM Sipho Mbule | RW Mohau Nkota

Zimbabwe last beat Bafana Bafana in a 2013 friendly. Since then, South Africa have won three and drawn one of the four matches between the sides.

Bradley Grobler misses out on the Bafana Bafana squad despite being the joint-top scorer in the Betway Premiership (6 goals), and the other player with as many strikes - Iqraam Rayners (Mamelodi Sundowns) is out due to medical reasons.","{'href': 'https://africa.espn.com', 'title': 'ESPN'}","soccer"

Daniil Medvedev recorded his 50th Top 10 win on Friday at the Rolex Shanghai Masters, where he defeated Alex de Minaur to reach his second ATP Masters 1000 semi-final of the season.

In a physical encounter, with more than 32 points going beyond nine shots, Medvedev found the edge against De Minaur, who was slightly off his best. The 29-year-old struck 11 more winners than the Australian (27-16), committed two fewer unforced errors (25-27) and won 15 of his 16 first-serve points in the second set to advance after one hour and 53 minutes.

""I was super tired and I knew against Alex, like against Learner, we would have long points. I think in the third or fourth game we had a couple and I thought it was going to be a long day, but I am happy with the way I played,"" Medvedev said. ""I was really clutch in the important moments and hitting the ball great and putting him under pressure. The second set was tight but I found the best at the end. I am really happy with the level.""

Medvedev is chasing his first tour-level title since Rome in May 2023 and he will next meet Arthur Rinderknech in the last four. Earlier this season, Medvedev advanced to the semi-finals in Indian Wells but lost to Holger Rune.

Medvedev, who triumphed in Shanghai in 2019, has reached 50 tour-level semi-finals on hard courts, with 18 of his 20 titles coming on the surface. He has been made to work hard in Shanghai on his quest for title number 21, also surviving a three-set epic against Learner Tien in the fourth round.

De Minaur leaves Shanghai seventh in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin. The 10-time tour-level champion is 640 points clear of 10th-placed Felix Auger-Aliassime, who is the first player outside the Top 8 cut due to ninth-placed Jack Draper being sidelined for the rest of the year with injury. De Minaur, who now trails Medvedev 4-8 in the pair's Lexus ATP Head2Head series, is aiming to compete at the Nitto ATP Finals for the second consecutive season.

Arthur Rinderknech earned the biggest win of his career on Friday at the Rolex Shanghai Masters, where he moved past Felix Auger-Aliassime to reach his first ATP Masters 1000 semi-final.

Rinderknech defeated World No. 3 Alexander Zverev and World No. 19 Jiri Lehecka to advance to his maiden Masters 1000 quarter-final, and ensured his run would not end against World No. 13 Auger-Aliassime. The Frenchman produced a high-quality display of aggressive striking and closed out the match with authority, sealing a dominant 6-3, 6-4 victory on his second match point after 87 minutes.

Following his victory, Rinderknech raised his arms aloft and looked toward his cousin Valentin Vacherot, who is in semi-final action against Novak Djokovic on Saturday. Read more about the cousins' dream tournament.

""It is huge. First of all, I followed my cousin,"" Rinderknech said, referencing qualifier Vacherot, who is set to break the Top 100 after becoming the first Monegasque player to reach a tour-level semi-final. ""He was going through the emotions on Thursday and I am trying to follow and battle and do the same as him. It has been incredible since the start of the tournament.

""The whole family is following from home. We are in our own little world here. It has been incredible and today was a good performance from myself and I am happy it was straight sets, so I am not too tired for tomorrow.""

Rinderknech is up 17 spots to No. 37 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings and is set to rise to a career-high ranking on Monday. The 30-year-old, who has earned three consecutive Top-20 wins, is the third Frenchman to reach the semi-finals in Shanghai, joining Jo-Wilfried Tsonga (2013, '15) and Gilles Simon ('14, 16). Rinderknech will next meet Daniil Medvedev in the last four.

Auger-Aliassime had lost his serve just once all tournament before he played Rinderknech, but lost serve twice against the Frenchman. The Canadian gave Rinderknech an opening on his serve in the first set when he struck two unforced errors off the forehand and hit a double fault. The 30-year-old took his chance with a forehand pass to break and finished off a clean first set, in which he hit nine winners to just three unforced errors, on his first set point.

The 30-year-old continued to play front-foot tennis in the second set and battled hard on serve, crucially saving three break points at 2-1, 0/40 to maintain his break advantage. He struck 20 winners in the match and won 85 per cent of his first-serve points, according to Infosys ATP Stats, to improve to 1-2 in his Lexus ATP Head2Head series against Auger-Aliassime.

Rinderknech is delighted to have joined his cousin Vacherot in the last four and opened up after the match on the week they are having.

""I was stressing so much yesterday during his whole match,"" said Rinderknech, who watched Vacherot's three-set win against Holger Rune courtside. ""I am not used to watching guys play on court and I wanted him to win so much. I was so stressed but I didn't want to show anything. I didn't want to stress him. Today was a lot calmer for me on court.""



Vacherot was in Rinderknech's guest box and afterwards said: ""It's really nice that it's happening here. I was thinking yesterday it will have been special to maybe be a bit closer to home so maybe some family would have get to come or anything. But I think we're just in our little bubble here with my brother, my coach — who is also helping a little bit Arthur — my girlfriend. We're just not many at all, and I think we're in our little bubble doing our thing. So I am really happy that it's happening here, and we're having a lot of fun all together.""

Texas A&M University coach Steve Denton has been getting up in the early hours of the morning back in College Station to watch both of his former players.

""As their college coach I couldn't be more proud of these two,"" said Denton. ""A dream week for both of them and it is a testament of what college tennis can do to young players if they are all in and trust the process of just trying to improve. Clearly they are feeding off each others energy and you can really see the joy they are playing with, much like they did when they were at Texas A&M. I have always believed in both of them that they will eventually put it together. Isn't it ironic that they have done it during the same week?""

For Auger-Aliassime, the Canadian leaves Shanghai 10th in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin. The 25-year-old is 530 points behind eighth-placed Lorenzo Musetti, who is in the final qualification spot for the Nitto ATP Finals.

Jessica Pegula's recent stretch of six three-set wins in seven consecutive three-set matches over the past two weeks has left many wondering how far she can go while sustaining this style of play. While that remains to be seen, a 2-6, 6-0, 6-3 win over qualifier Katerina Siniakova on Friday has carried her to the Wuhan semifinals for the first time, where she'll face Aryna Sabalenka.

Some moments in sports defy explanation.

Wuhan: Scores | Draws | Order of play

Jessica Pegula's recent run in China -- six three-set wins in seven consecutive three-set matches -- may not rival Wilt Chamberlain's 100-point game or Serena Williams' 39 straight Grand Slam victories, but it's impressive, nonetheless.

On Friday at the Dongfeng · Voyah Wuhan Open, Pegula dropped the first set 6-2 to qualifier Katerina Siniakova in just over 30 minutes. After logging more than 15 hours on court over the past 13 days, she looked spent.

Then, it happened again.

Pegula stormed through the second set in just 23 minutes, delivering a bagel to force a decider. She then sealed a 2-6, 6-0, 6-3 victory in 1 hour and 36 minutes to reach her first Wuhan semifinal.

Even she couldn't explain how she's endured the grind.

“I don't know,” Pegula said after the match. “I guess I'm in really good shape. I definitely don't think I need to play anymore matches or work on any physical stuff because I've been able to battle through these matches and play really well. But yeah, I don't know. 

“I'm happy I've been able to figure things out. Obviously, I wish maybe it was more straightforward for my mental and physical sake, but if I win every match for the rest of my life in three sets, I think I'd be pretty happy.”

After the past couple weeks, she might want to be careful what she wishes for -- because at this rate, it just might happen.

For now, she can take solace in becoming the first player with at least seven consecutive completed three-set matches in WTA main draws since Jelena Ostapenko played eight in a row in 2023.

Ostapenko won five of those matches. Pegula has already claimed six.

Here's how she captured her latest win:

Dialing back her serve: Early in the match, Pegula appeared to be pressing more than usual. Fatigue likely played a role, as did the inspired play of Siniakova, but nerves may have crept in as well.

“I think I was just going for too much,” Pegula said. “Maybe I wasn't relaxed enough. I think she came out pressuring me really quickly, and then I just got kind of tense. So, in the second set, I just tried to, honestly, chill out and let my hands and feet and everything just get into timing.”

The shift in approach showed up on the stat sheet, especially in her serving numbers.

In the first set, Pegula dropped only one point on her first serve but landed just 46% of them. In the second set, that number jumped to 80%. She lost only two points on her first serve and didn't face a single break point, compared to three in the opening set.

Clutch play in big moments: While Pegula's serve remained solid in the third set, it wasn't quite as untouchable as it had been in the second. That opened the door for Siniakova, the doubles world No. 1, who was chasing her first WTA 1000 semifinal in singles.

But Pegula wouldn't budge.

Siniakova earned her first pair of break points while leading 1-0 in the final set, but Pegula saved both, rallying from 15-40 down to level the set at 1-all. Pegula then reeled off 11 straight points to go up a break, but Siniakova fought back. Trailing 4-3, she had a prime opportunity to even the score.

Instead, she botched a forehand winner with plenty of open court in front of her. Pegula gave her another look, but Siniakova followed with an unforced error that all but sealed her fate. Pegula backed up the hold by coming from 40-0 down in Siniakova's next service game, winning the final six points of the match to secure victory.

It marked Pegula's 18th consecutive win against qualifiers and lucky losers, having last lost to Taylor Townsend in Rome in 2023.

What's next: Pegula will compete in her third straight semifinal, following final four runs in Beijing last week and at the US Open last month. It's her eighth semifinal of 2025, with a 5-2 record in the previous seven. However, she's dropped her last two after starting the year 5-0.

One of those losses came to Aryna Sabalenka, who defeated her in three sets in New York and will be her opponent again in Saturday's semifinal. Pegula enters the matchup with a 2-8 career record against the singles world No.1, having lost four straight and eight of their last nine meetings.

Still, there's a glimmer of hope.

In three of the last five tournaments where Pegula has faced Siniakova, she's gone on to win the title -- including earlier this year in Bad Homburg.

One thing is certain: if Pegula is to make it four out of six, she'll likely need to survive at least one more three-set battle along the way.

Sabalenka ultimately maintained her perfect Wuhan record, improving to 20-0 at the event after closing out a 6-3, 6-3 win over Rybakina Friday afternoon.“Honestly, that's just crazy,” summed up Sabalenka about her unbeaten run during an on-court interview.“I feel a really great connection with the Chinese fans, I guess. I feel like at home playing in this stadium.”The contest began with seven consecutive holds, before the world No. 1 made her move. On her second break point, Sabalenka set herself up to finish with an explosive inside-in forehand winner to end the Kazakh's streak of 23 consecutive holds.

The 30-year-old did not drop serve against the No. 12 seed, recovering from 0-40 in the fourth game of the second set to deny Auger-Aliassime any hope of digging back into the encounter.

Ella Lloyd reflects on her season so far in F1 Academy

Williams boss James Vowles has opened up about a special moment for the team following Carlos Sainz's podium at the Azerbaijan Grand Prix.

James Vowles has detailed how a special moment at Williams' factory following Carlos Sainz's debut podium for the team at the Azerbaijan Grand Prix “meant the world” to him, with the team boss admitting that the reaction of the squad's staff will “stay with me for the rest of my life”.

After qualifying in an impressive P2 for the race in Baku, Sainz lost a position to Mercedes' George Russell but kept the other Silver Arrows car of Kimi Antonelli at bay to claim P3, marking Williams' first rostrum since the 2021 Belgian Grand Prix.

The result left Vowles – who joined the Grove-based outfit as Team Principal at the start of 2023 – feeling “really proud” of Sainz and the whole team, with the Briton particularly moved to see how much the result meant to the employees back at the factory.

“I'm ecstatic for Carlos,” Vowles said during an appearance on F1's Beyond The Grid podcast. “The pace has been there for a lot of the year, and dare I say he needed a result like this for the world to see that he is still the Carlos that deserves to be there, and that we're fortunate as Williams to have him along by our side.

“And he earned it. He earned it in Qualifying and he earned it in the race as well. I'm really proud of Williams. I'm proud of Williams because it's a team that was in the dark trenches of survival just a few years ago.

“The most it meant to me was when I was back in the factory, we put the trophy in reception, and I just came down randomly every half an hour, hour. And it was just queues of people just wanting the ability to touch it for a few seconds and have a photo with it.

“And that's what meant the world to me; they're individuals who've literally given up their life for Williams and for myself and for our journey, and it's a tiny, tiny reward for them on the way back. It will stay with me for the rest of my life.”

While this achievement meant a great deal to Williams, Vowles' aim is for the result to become the norm in future as the squad look to make their way back to the front of the grid.

“It is just one podium at this stage,” he explained. “And what I want is almost you to be bored by it, such that you're not asking me, ‘How was it being on the podium?' We're not there yet. We've got a long, long way to go before there. It hasn't relinquished any of the pressure going forward.

“My end journey is multiple championships at Williams. This is just a little tiny stepping stone on that journey together.

“The pressure for me is making sure we move forward in 2026, making sure the ‘27 car has significant amounts of developments we can't put in place for ‘26, making sure the infrastructure we're building, the machinery's in place, etc.”

Vowles also reflected on Sainz's reaction to the podium in Baku, saying of the Spaniard: “What I saw more was what I'm used to from Mercedes, which is a driver that was incredibly relaxed. While some may be nervous, for him it was just business as usual in that circumstance.

“I think his calmness very much spread across everyone as the result of it, because frankly, he has been there and done that before. He had belief in the car, belief we're quick enough, and so that was a different Carlos.

“I don't think that's anything to do with the fact it's a good result in what has been a somewhat difficult season for whatever reason. I think that's just more, that is Carlos. He's great when you put him in the position where he has a sniff at something special.”

F1 TV commentator Alex Jacques looks at Alex Dunne's career so far – and what might come next as he tries to plot a route to the Formula 1 grid.

Since Go-karting, 19-year-old Alex Dunne has finished every racing season he's contested with no certainty there would ever be another.

It's a pressure felt by many in motorsport at this time of year, when the remaining races dwindle and thoughts turn to the next year.

In Dunne's case, a collaboration with McLaren changed all that. This year the Irishman, originally from Clonbullogue, has notched up two fine Formula 2 wins and seven podiums, all underpinned by superb pace at different types of circuits.

Mark Hughes and illustrator Giorgio Piola give an insight into the revised front wings brought to the Singapore Grand Prix by Mercedes and Red Bull.

Red Bull and Mercedes were the only two teams to list new development parts at Singapore – including revised front wings for both cars.

The wings of each car are very different, and this applied before and after their respective updates. Each team was simply taking their existing concept further, trying to squeeze further performance from the car with minimal extra development time as resources are concentrated on 2026.

""Wait until you see the Tin Man and the Scarecrow.... There was no room for error,"" said the filmmaker about not using any digital effects on the iconic characters in the upcoming sequel.


							By 

	Lily Ford



Jon M. Chu delighted London Film Festival attendees Friday with a sneak peek at the upcoming Wicked: For Good, and also teased what lies ahead in his next musical-to-screen adaptation.


	The filmmaker pleaded with audience members at BFI Southbank not to record or photograph the short clip before the long-awaited follow-up to Wicked hits theaters Nov. 21. He spoke extensively about filming the saga, detailing the BTS of a 10-time Oscar-nominated film and touching ever so slightly on what's next for Cynthia Erivo's Elphaba and Ariana Grande‘s Glinda in the second installment.

	The American director gave a nod to the first film's infamously emotional press run — when Erivo and Grande, so impacted by the process and their characters, were often brought to tears in interviews — in his talk to festivalgoers in London. It turns out, Chu thinks, that same intensity awaits us.

	“Everyone's like, ‘The girls were so emotional — why are they so emotional?'” he began. “It's because we lived both movies. We lived their meeting, their separation, their death. We lived the whole thing before you ever saw one frame of it…. When you guys catch up and see this movie, we already know what you're gonna feel. I'm excited for everyone to be there and finally share it and you're gonna see these girls are incredible,” he added.

	











	“Wait until you see the Tin Man and the Scarecrow,” Chu also said. “These are not digital effects. These are real, physical makeup and hair. And it is extraordinary. I couldn't show anybody here, but when you see it, when you look at it, know that there was no room for error on it. And the team that did it is just incredible.”


	Chu discussed the casting process around Erivo and Grande, how he came to split the musical in two and his own relationship with musical theater before a glimpse of For Good wrapped up the session. Before it ended, he was asked if there were any other stories he'd find joy in adapting for the stage, just as Lin-Manuel Miranda did with Hamilton.


	“I'm working on one that I feel like is something that I hold dear to my heart, Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat,” said Chu. “It's my favorite show, but it's a hard one to reconceive for now or [work out] how to do it with the tone. But I love it so much, it's so playful. I think we've cracked something in it that's really cool.”


	Chu is set to direct the film adaptation of Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice's 1968 musical for Amazon MGM Studios. He'll reunite with his In the Heights producer Scott Sanders to develop and shoot the story, following the Old Testament tale of Joseph.


	The BFI London Film Festival 2025 runs through Oct. 19.

Santiago Menghini, the filmmaker behind the award-winning horror short 'Milk,' is in the director's chair for New Line's latest horror movie.  


							By 

	Borys Kit


Senior Film Writer


	A sequel to New Line's The Curse of La Llorona is finally underway.


Jay Hernandez, who starred as the titular Magnum P.I., and Monica Raymund, one of the stars of TV's Chicago Fire, are the big names in the feature, titled The Revenge of La Llorona, joining Raymond Cruz, who co-starred in the 2019 movie as a curandero. 




	Rising actors Edy Ganem (9-1-1), Martín Fajardo (Griselda), Acston Luca Porto (Dora and the Search for Sol Dorado), Avie Porto (Bob Hearts Abishola) are also on the call sheet for the feature, which began production this week in Buffalo.

	Also back is the producing team of Emile Gladstone, Gary Dauberman, and James Wan.


	But while the producing team is the same, the director and writer are not. Santiago Menghini, the Canadian filmmaker known for his award-winning short Milk and who made his feature debut with 2021 horror movie No One Gets Out Alive, is sitting in the director's chair.


	Sean Tretta, who worked with Wan on the filmmaker's Creature from the Black Lagoon feature set up at Universal, wrote the script.


	The fact that the movie is now in production is a notable resuscitation of a sequel that had been shelved several times before, at least once even during pre-production. That last shelving occurred in early 2024 and may have been due to budgetary issues. 


La Llorona's tears can't be ignored. A surprise breakout when it was released in 2019, The Curse of La Llorona grossed $123 million worldwide. That movie was led by Linda Cardellini and directed by Michael Chaves, who graduated to the The Conjuring franchise, helming the last two entries, including the most recent one, The Conjuring: Last Rites. Last Rites is a prime example of the enduring strength of the supernatural horror franchise, as it has grossed over $460 million worldwide on a budget of around $55 million.

	











	Latino audiences are among those flocking to the scares, with Revenge of La Llorona hoping to tap that market.  


	Executive producers on the new movie include Mia Maniscalco, Jamie Buckner, Michael Clear, and Judson Scott.


	The story sees the vengeful spirit La Llorona returning, forcing a fractured family to confront their past and join forces with their estranged curandero grandfather to battle ancient evils, before the Weeping Woman claims their children forever.


	Menghini is repped by UTA, Good Fear and Mike Castrillo at McKuin Frankel. Tretta is repped by CAA, Adventure Media, and attorney Jennifer Levy.


	Cruz is repped by Media Artists Group, Raymund is repped by Gersh and Door 24, and Hernandez is repped by CAA, Alchemy Entertainment and Fuller Law.


	Fajardo is repped by Magnitude Entertainment and CESD, siblings Acston Luca Porto and Avie Porto are repped by Coast to Coast Talent Group, D.R. Entertainment, and attorney Carolyn Conrad. Ganem is repped by Prime Talent Media, Allegory Creative Talent and Yorn Levine.

The doctor who perished in the season 22 premiere takes THR behind the scenes of how she found out, what she contributed to her final scenes and shares a message to upset viewers.


							By 

	Max Gao



[This story contains major spoilers from the season 22 premiere of Grey's Anatomy, “Only the Strong Survive.”]


Natalie Morales has just joined a very exclusive club: the dead Grey's Anatomy doctors club.




	Throughout the two-decade run of the venerable ABC medical drama, creator Shonda Rhimes and her showrunning successors have become infamous for killing off doctors in the most devastating ways — so much so that the hospital was once nicknamed “Seattle Grace Mercy Death” before being renamed after two dearly departed characters, Chyler Leigh's Lexie Grey and Eric Dane's Mark Sloan, in season nine.

	In Thursday night's season 22 premiere, which picks up in the immediate aftermath of yet another big explosion that wiped out most of the OR floor, the teaching hospital claimed another casualty: Morales' Dr. Monica Beltran, who died of internal bleeding after the blast caused a heavy operating light to fall on her pelvis.


	Dr. Beltran had recurred for the last two seasons as a top attending pediatric surgeon who had endeared herself to Drs. Amelia Shepherd (Caterina Scorsone) and Winston Ndugu (Anthony Hill), but her exit was built around her protégée, Dr. Jules Millin (Adelaide Kane), who, after surviving the blast herself and being trapped in the OR, managed to successfully complete a pediatric surgery on her own with Dr. Beltran's verbal assistance.

	











	When she sat down with the rest of her writers room to decide which character should die in the premiere, showrunner Meg Marinis told The Hollywood Reporter that she considered “the chain reaction” of “each character's death and what that does for the show, what that does for other characters and what stories can be told from that death.”


	In the end, “I wanted to see someone die selflessly saving someone else's life, and she was not only saving that little kid on the table — she was saving Jules. It really speaks to the kind of character Monica was,” Marinis says. But that doesn't mean she wanted to kill Morales off: “I didn't want to. It was very difficult. It was very painful. I cried on that phone call.”


	Below, Morales opens up to THR about how she worked with Marinis to craft her poignant (but admittedly, expected) Grey's exit, how she thinks Monica's death will affect Jules and Amelia going forward, and what she would say to fans who will inevitably be disappointed that Monica met her demise before she could explore the prospect of a romantic relationship with Amelia.

At what point between seasons did Meg Marinis call you up to inform you that she was going to kill off Beltran in the premiere, and what was your reaction?


	At the end of last season, none of us knew who was going to make it or not. But I was like, “It's probably me [who dies]. I'm the newest one. I'm not a series regular. There's a lot of people in that cast.” Then they called me and asked me to be in this season and to do this episode. And when Meg called me, I was like, “Oh, I thought I for sure I was going to be the one you were going to kill off.” And she was like, “Well …” (Laughs.) So that's how I found out.

	











	I wasn't too surprised, but I was surprised and also excited to have a big, dramatic Grey's death. That seemed fun. I have really enjoyed working with the people on this show, so it's a little bit sad in that sense. Could they have dragged out my death two or three episodes? Sure. But I understand why they did it, and I think Meg is such a talented writer and showrunner, and I understood the storyline. It made sense to me, as somebody who watches the show.


Meg said that once she broke that difficult news to you, the two of you went through all of Monica's scenes leading up to her death and you were able to give her feedback that she incorporated into the episode. What conversations did you have with her about Monica's exit, and what notes did you give?


	Meg is so collaborative. Throughout my time on the show, I didn't really give her a lot of notes, because she is just great. I think “notes” is a strong word, because I'm not the studio. It was more like, “Hey, what do you think about this? Or, how do you want me to play this? And, what's the best way to convey what you want to convey?”


	I knew with this episode that they wanted to do a misdirect with this death [by making audiences believe it was Chris Carmack's Link who was going to die]. I was like, “What's the best way for us to achieve that while also on second watch knowing what's happening and that Monica knows what's happening, what should her final words be?” Not that they needed to be so poignant that they give away what's going to happen, but maybe not something like, “Can you give me a hot dog?” (Laughs.) Not that that's what Meg had written, but you know what I'm saying? So that was part of our conversations.

	











	And this was already in there, but we talked about how to acknowledge the relationship that her and Jules had built over time and where it was going to go after this.


Despite being trapped under the debris, Monica manages to verbally walk Jules through the rest of the pediatric surgery — to the point that Jules saves this kid on her own. There's something poignant about Monica's final words being that Jules didn't need her anymore, because she had effectively completed a solo surgery on her own. When do you think Monica realized she wasn't going to make it?


	We talked about this with the incredible medical team at Grey's. [Medical consultants and producers] Michael [Metzner] and Linda [Klein] were so helpful, and Michael, in particular, was the one I talked to the most about this. There's a point in the middle of this episode where she tries again to push this operating light off of herself, and what's happened medically, as far as I was told, is that she's pinned down by this and the second she moves, it shifts stuff, and then she starts bleeding internally and she starts to feel that because she knows what the symptoms are.


	So after that point is when she knows what's happening. But she also knows she can't tell Jules because she needs Jules to finish, and she probably is hoping [the firefighters] will rescue her in time. She's like, “I can't have this person already predisposed to panic to panic more. I need her to finish the surgery.” She's just trying to keep it together as much as she can, and hopefully someone will rescue her. But if they don't, she's going to try and save that little boy's life until her dying breath, and Jules is as well.

	











Was there something in particular you wanted to capture about Monica in her final moments?


	I haven't seen the episode, so I don't know exactly how it will play, and I hope it plays this way: The important thing, for me, was in those last moments for her to acknowledge the other people she loves in that hospital. The fact that she doesn't know what happened outside those doors, and that she hopes the people she loves — Amelia, Winston, all these people she became very close with outside of this operating room — she hopes they're all OK. That was important because I think Monica is a character written from the beginning very selflessly. She is kind of no-nonsense, and says what she means, but she always puts her patients and the people she cares about before herself, and it was important for her to end that way, too.


How do you think Monica's death will affect Amelia and Jules individually going forward?


	I hope they're miserable. I hope they go crazy and they can't live with themselves. I hope that they talk about Monica for seasons to come. I hope that I haunt them and I can come back and do some weird episodes as a ghost. That's what I hope. (Laughs.)


Unfortunately, Monica's death will likely reignite talks of the infamous “bury your gays” trope, and some viewers who had been rooting for Monica to get together with Amelia will certainly be upset about this outcome. What would you say to fans who will be left heartbroken about your character's untimely demise?












	Well, “I'm sorry,” is my first message. My second message is, “I'm not the writer. I don't have anything to do with it, so don't blame me.” And my third message is that it's totally valid for people to ship characters and want things. But in life, sometimes people have missed connections. There were moments where Monica and Amelia missed each other, and Monica was like, “Hey, are you OK?” And Amelia kind of shot her down, and vice versa. I think the bigger takeaway is that life is short, and you gotta take those moments because someone you love — or potentially could love — could die, or not be around, or could have another thing. That's a very realistic thing that happens.


	I think maybe Amelia or Monica should have taken one of those opportunities, but I also think it's realistic they didn't because they were in different points in their lives and different situations. I also think that, ultimately, a romantic relationship, maybe wasn't the best that they could do. The best that they could do was be really, really great colleagues and friends and doctors in this situation, and they did that really successfully and really well. They saved people's lives — and is there anything better than saving people's lives together? I think there are other parts about their relationship that were successful and that means something.


	But if there's a lesson in that, I think it's to shoot your shot, and don't waste the opportunities you're given. Again, I'm not the writer. I don't know what the intentions were behind how that was framed, and I don't know, obviously in Amelia's history, what is right for her and what's right for her in the future. This wasn't meant for her in a romantic sense. Monica was also just getting out of a divorce. She was not ready for a relationship. No matter what Amelia was ready for, I don't think Monica was in the place for something serious, which is maybe what Amelia wanted. So I understand why they were shipped and why people wanted them together. I totally get that, but I think it's also a realistic thing in life that sometimes it doesn't work out that way.

	











Even though you only recurred on the show for two seasons, what will you miss most about playing Monica?


	Technically three. I was in this season! (Laughs.)


That's true! Let's say you were in two and a bit.


	Yeah. (Laughs.) I will miss getting to look like I know what I'm doing. That was really fun, to be a very well-respected doctor/surgeon that people would be like, “Have you heard about [Beltran]? She's the best pediatric surgeon in the West.” And I'd just stroll in and people would respect me! But, really, I will miss the crew and cast and people I got to work with there a lot. They were all very welcoming and wonderful and really sweet people. I will miss that a lot, and I hope the fans don't take it out on me. I really loved the people I got to interact with. It's a very big fandom, and I try really hard not to ever read the comments. But sometimes they do reach me and sometimes people tag me, and everybody's been so sweet and nice, and I'm thankful for that.


Did you get a chance to take home anything from the set to commemorate your time on Grey's?


	The wardrobe department gave me the bra I wore. (Laughs.) And Monica, who did my makeup — her name is also Monica — gave me some of the makeup she used on me. But I should have kept a stethoscope or something.


	I'm calling it out right now on The Hollywood Reporter that ABC and Grey's and Shondaland should give me a stethoscope or something to commemorate. You know how SNL has the five-timers club? I feel like there should be a dead Grey's Anatomy doctor club, and I wonder if they all have something that they share — some sort of plaque like, “I DIED ON GREY'S ANATOMY.” I need a plaque that says I died on Grey's Anatomy, I guess.

James Gunn played a pretty considerable role himself, of course.


							By 

	Tony Maglio



[This story contains spoilers for the Peacemaker season two finale.] 


Peacemaker season two reached its conclusion last night — actually, it reached beyond its original conclusion, James Gunn says.




	Gunn, who created and writes the John Cena-superhero show for HBO Max, made a pretty big addition to his original ending for the second season's finale episode. Perhaps a better adjective would have been otherworldly.


	On the official Peacemaker companion podcast, Gunn said his original draft of Thursday night's episode ended with the dramatic slow-motion walkout of the 11th Street Kids in their new digs — and with their new friends Judomaster (Nhut Le) and Langston Fleury (Tim Meadows).

	The good guys, all A.R.G.U.S. rejects at this point, started their own org to counter the black ops government agency. Checkmate, funded by Adrian Chase/Vigilante's (Freddie Stroma) seized blood money, is officially formed.


	“We see ‘Checkmate: Making the World Better,'” Gunn recaps the scene, “and we look up and we see Eagly — who last we saw hiding in a corner — flying happily around the sky.”


	Gunn then reveals, ”The first draft ended there.”


	Steve Agee, who plays tech guy/hacker John Economos on the series, was pretty blown away by that. “What?!? Wow! Wow. I can't even …”

	











	“Wild,” Jennifer Holland added, with quite a bit less emotion. To be fair, she may have been less shocked — Holland and Gunn are married.


	Instead, the Peacemaker season two finale goes a few scenes further. Half the credit for the version we saw last night goes to Gunn, of course, as he wrote it. The other half goes to Peter Safran, and not just because he and Gunn are 50/50 partners in this whole revived-DCU thing.


	“I gave [the first draft] to Peter Safran and I said, ‘I had another thing I wrote that I had put on the ending,'” Gunn told his colleagues. “And I told him, and he goes, ‘Oh you've got to put that in there.'”


	The ”another thing” was Chris Smith aka Peacemaker (Cena) being abducted by A.R.G.U.S. and banished to Salvation, a planet the bad guys plan to use as an open-world prison for metahumans and criminals. Smith is being “volunteered” (read: punished) as a human test subject. Peacemaker killed Rick Flag Jr. (Joel Kinnaman) in 2021 film The Suicide Squad; Rick Flag Sr. (Frank Grillo) heads A.R.G.U.S.


	Rick Flag Sr. is a bad enemy to have — especially when he's being influenced by Lex Luthor (Nicholas Hoult).


	Gunn said he and Safran “knew it was a part of the DCU plan” to get to Salvation, a peaceful-looking and scientifically inhabitable planet (so far as we know) that we find out is already inhabited by what Gunn describes as “some sort of beasts.” (We hear their squeals and roars, but don't see anything — yet.) It wasn't entirely clear if the DC Universe plan was to get there through Smith/Peacemaker, but sounds like the plan was not to get there on Peacemaker.

	











	A spokesperson for DC Studios did not immediately respond to The Hollywood Reporter's request for that clarification.


	With no allies, no helmets and no way of getting home, Smith might need Superman himself (David Corenswet) to get back to Earth. Well, that might be the plan.


	In the new DCU, which is fully revived at this point thanks to Gunn and Safran, it is the DC television series that are often used as setup fodder (or bridge material) for the films; Peacemaker is that role player right now. The next Superman movie, Man of Tomorrow, is slated for a July 9, 2027, theatrical release.

The song is the first ever to launch in the Pop Airplay top 10.


													By
												

	Gary Trust



	As Taylor Swift's new album, The Life of a Showgirl, forges an historic first week, its accolades extend to Billboard's radio charts.


	The Republic-released set's lead single promoted to radio, “The Fate of Ophelia,” blasts in as the first song ever to debut in the top 10 of Billboard's Pop Airplay chart, at No. 8 on the list dated Oct 18. It passes two hits — one by Swift — that each started at a prior No. 12 best: her own “Shake It Off” (Sept. 6, 2014) and Mariah Carey's “Dreamlover” (Aug. 14, 1993). Those hits went on to two and eight weeks at No. 1, respectively; Swift holds the record for the most leaders — 13 — in the chart's 33-year history.


	Multiple chains gave “The Fate of Ophelia” concentrated play on its first day of release (Oct. 3), while Swift has made promotional rounds including on iHeartMedia's Elvis Duran and the Morning Show that day. “That one, just as soon as we wrote it, I had a feeling it would be the one that we'd go with first and the one I'd get to make a music video for,” she told Duran of the song.

	











	“The Fate of Ophelia” also makes an unprecedented start on Adult Pop Airplay, at No. 8. It's just the third song — all by Swift — to open in the chart's top 10, outpacing No. 9 bows for “Fortnight,” featuring Post Malone (May 4, 2024), and “Shake It Off” (Sept. 6, 2014).




	Plus, “The Fate of Ophelia” charges onto Adult Contemporary at No. 10, Swift's first top 10 debut on the chart and the best beginning since Adele's “Easy of Me” (No. 6, Oct. 23, 2021, on its way to a 24-week command).


	Given its entrance on Pop Airplay, “The Fate of Ophelia” is, thus, the first song ever to debut in the top 10 of all three pop/adult radio rankings.


	Swift scores her 27th top 10 on Pop Airplay, second only to Rihanna's 30. On Adult Pop Airplay, Swift adds her record-extending 33rd top 10. On Adult Contemporary, she ups her count to a milestone 20 top 10s.


Billboard's Pop Airplay chart ranks songs by weekly plays on more than 150 mainstream top 40 radio stations monitored by Mediabase, with data provided to Billboard by Luminate. Adult Pop Airplay ranks songs by weekly plays on nearly 80 adult top 40 stations and Adult Contemporary ranks songs by weekly plays on more than 80 adult contemporary stations.


	Meanwhile, other songs from The Life of a Showgirl make airplay chart debuts. “Opalite” (No. 34); the title track, featuring Sabrina Carpenter (No. 38); and “Wi$h Li$t” (No. 39) all enter Pop Airplay. On Adult Pop Airplay, they start at Nos. 24, 32 and 33, respectively, along with “Elizabeth Taylor” (No. 39) and “Cancelled!” (No. 40). On Adult Contemporary, “The Life of a Showgirl” debuts at No. 26.


	More cuts from the album are receiving early play, including the frisky “Wood.” Notably, a radio edit of the song changes the line, “His love was the key that opened my thighs,” to the squeaky-clean, “His love was the key that opened my skies.” “It really started out in a very innocent place,” Swift said sheepishly on NBC's The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, on Monday, Oct. 6. “I don't know what happened, man …”

	











Billboard is expected to announce the debut of The Life of a Showgirl on the Oct. 18-dated Billboard 200 albums chart on Sunday (Oct. 12). Highlights of the set's impact on the multimetric Billboard Hot 100 songs chart are scheduled to post Monday (Oct. 13), with all charts dated Oct. 18 updating Tuesday (Oct. 14) on Billboard.com.

Six-show gig will make Gwen Stefani the first woman to headline the iconic arena.


													By
												

	Dave Brooks



Gwen Stefani might dream of a “Simple Kind of Life,” but she recently agreed to a monumentally huge opportunity, which will make her the first woman to headline the MSG-owned Sphere in Las Vegas.


Billboard can confirm that Stefani will reunite with her band No Doubt to play a run of six shows at the iconic arena visible from the famed Las Vegas Strip. First reported by TMZ, the booking will make Stefani the first woman to headline the 17,600-seat arena, which has hosted concerts from U2, Dead & Company, Eagles, Backstreet Boys and more since opening in late 2023.

	











	The concerts are scheduled to take place some time in 2026; the building's event calendar is booked up mostly through mid-April with concerts by Zac Brown Band, Eagles, Backstreet Boys and Illenium.


	No Doubt has only performed twice since breaking up in 2015, most recently at the 2025 FireAid benefit concert in January, when they played a medley of hits from the band's Tragic Kingdom album to help raise funds for victims of the deadly Pacific Palisades fire. Prior to that, the band reunited for two performances at Coachella in 2024, where they delivered an energetic 80-minute set spanning fan favorites like “Just a Girl,” “Don't Speak” and “Hella Good” and including a guest appearance by Olivia Rodrigo on “Bathwater.”

	











	No Doubt emerged from Anaheim, California's ska and punk scene in 1986, eventually becoming one of the defining pop-rock bands of the 1990s. Their breakthrough album, Tragic Kingdom, topped the Billboard 200 for nine consecutive weeks, catapulting the group to global fame. Over the course of six studio albums, No Doubt earned two Grammy Awards and nine nominations, including recognition for Tragic Kingdom in the best rock album category and “Don't Speak” as best pop performance by a duo or group with vocals. After nearly three decades together, the band went on hiatus in the mid-2010s as Stefani pursued a successful solo career, beginning with her 2004 debut album Love. Angel. Music. Baby and the four-week Billboard Hot 100 No. 1 hit “Hollaback Girl.”

At a conference on Wednesday (Oct. 8), Warner CEO Robert Kyncl said ""it makes a lot of sense"" to strike such a partnership, without naming the streaming giant.


													By
												

	Glenn Peoples



	If you thought we were at peak biopic, you may have been wrong — as a new deal suggests you should probably expect many more films and documentaries about music legends in the future.  


	Warner Music Group (WMG) is “close to an agreement” with Netflix to create movies and documentaries based on the company's artists and songs, according to Bloomberg. WMG, which shut down its internal division that produced film and TV shows earlier this year and is looking to outsource that work, the report claimed.   


	Speaking at the Bloomberg Screentime conference on Wednesday (Oct. 8), WMG CEO Robert Kyncl did not confirm a pending partnership but laid out numerous reasons why the company should work with a global streaming platform. “Our company has a tremendous catalog: Prince, Madonna, Fleetwood Mac,” Kyncl said. “It just goes on and on and on. The stories we have are incredible, and they haven't really been told. We're like Marvel [Comics] for music.” 


	Kyncl, who as a Netflix executive helped the company launch its streaming service in 2007, added that “it makes a lot of sense for us to partner with a company that can bring it to life all around the world.” Netflix, which has more than 300 million subscribers in over 190 countries, would provide WMG with a massive audience for video content without the additional costs involved with theatrical releases.  


	Netflix has created numerous music-focused documentaries, including Martin Scorsese's Rolling Thunder Revenue: A Bob Dylan Story; Miss Americana, a look at Taylor Swift's career and personal life; Quincy, a history of celebrated producer and musician Quincy Jones; and Homecoming: A Film by Beyoncé.  


	Music biopics have become an increasingly popular piece of content as companies have invested billions of dollars in artist catalogs and name and likeness rights. The 2018 film Bohemian Rhapsody “turbocharged” demand for Queen's catalog and played a role in its lofty $1.27 billion valuation when it was purchased by Sony Music in 2024. The 2022 film Elvis boosted the value of the late singer's estate from $600 million in 2020 to $1 billion in 2022, a source told Billboard. Likewise, the upcoming Michael Jackson and Bruce Springsteen biopics could help Sony Music improve its return on its investments in those artists' catalogs.  


	But the time required to develop films means the payoff — synch royalties and increased streams and radio play — aren't immediate. As Natalia Nastaskin, chief content officer at Primary Wave, told Billboard in 2024, that lag time could mean the peak of music biopics “may take several years.”

PinkPantheress originally released her sophomore mixtape Fancy That in May, and it was recently included in the 2025 Mercury Prize shortlist. 


													By
												

	Heran Mamo



PinkPantheress packs her Fancy That mixtape with more star power on the remix edition Fancy Some More, which she dropped on Friday (Oct. 10) via Warner Records UK.  


	The 22-track project features multiple remixes of the nine songs originally on Fancy That by Anitta, SEVENTEEN, JADE, JT, Sugababes, Kylie Minogue, Zara Larsson, Ravyn Lenae, Kaytranada and many more. 

	











	“With this remix project, Fancy some more, I wanted to explore how the songs can live in different worlds while still holding onto the emotion of the original,” the British singer-songwriter-producer said in a press release. “Hearing other artists reimagine it has been so inspiring. Each remix brings a new energy and texture, while still keeping the heart of the track intact. It's been so exciting to see Fancy That take on these new, international lives & global perspectives.”


	PinkPantheress originally released Fancy That in May. Her sophomore mixtape was included in Billboard‘s 50 best albums of 2025 (so far) staff list and the 2025 Mercury Prize shortlist, which recognizes outstanding albums by U.K. and Irish artists from the past year. The Mercury Prize is awarded next Thursday, Oct. 16 at the Utilita Arena in Newcastle. Fancy That reached No. 4 on Top Dance Albums and No. 72 on the Billboard 200. The third single “Illegal,” which samples Underworld's “Dark & Long (Dark Train),” became PinkPantheress' second entry on the Billboard Hot 100, following her and Ice Spice's top 10 hit “Boy's a liar Pt. 2,” peaking at No. 96.

					By Anthony D'Alessandro 

Editorial Director/Box Office Editor


Disney is reporting that Tron: Ares previews are coming in at $4.8 million. That includes limited Wednesday early shows and previews that began Thursday at 2 p.m.


	Knock on wood this one opens to its tracking, meaning north of $40M; we don't need any movies underperforming. The fall, though ahead of last year by 2% at around $674M, is OK but not vibrant with myriad starry adult movies like Dwayne Johnson's The Smashing Machine and Margot Robbie and Colin Farrell's A Big Bold Beautiful Journey not working. The male-heavy Tron: Ares faces competition from MLB playoffs this weekend as well as NFL. Good news: Rotten Tomatoes audience score stands at 86%, better than the previous installment, 2010's Tron: Legacy, which did 64% fresh.

	











Tron: Ares previews are certainly ahead of Tron: Legacy‘s preview cash, which was $3.6M, but that was back in the era of the midnight preview. Right now, it's look like Tron: Ares will file under such fanboy reboots as last year's Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes ($6.6M total previews) and Alien: Romulus ($6.5M). It's also under that of Lionsgate's The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes ($5.8M). Advance ticket sales we told you for Tron :Ares were at $7M before opening, on par with Alien: Romulus, which opened to $42M. Songbirds & Snakes bowed to $45M.

	Previews for the Joachim Rønning-directed movie movie are ahead of Equalizer 3m which yielded a $3.8M preview and a $35M three-day opening. The movie, produced by its star Jared Leto and former Disney Head of Production Sean Bailey, cost $180M before P&A.

	











	Miramax and Paramount's Channing Tatum-Kirsten Dunst romance caper Roofman collected $1M from 2,800 locations yesterday. Showtimes started at 7 p.m. Audiences gave the pic 4 out of 5 stars on PostTrak. No audience score yet, but reviews are at 82% on Rotten Tomatoes. The $19M production goes wide today at 3,362 sites. Tatum's Dog did $1.26M in Valentine's Day sneaks and previews before earning a $5M Friday and $14.8M 3-day driven by his female audience. However that movie was PG-13, and Roofman is R. The 3-day on Roofman is around $10M.

The reviews of this movie are absolutely dismal.

I went in with zero expectations and had a fantastic time with it. The visuals were hypnotising and the NIN music perfect. Felt like a kid again.

Well, the premise of this movies sounds a bit daft, so I for one won't see it.  I think Disney needs to take a step back, because they are not good at this movie production thing.

How many movies have you produced?

Why does that matter? Whoever produced Tron: Ares clearly isn't up for the job, there's good chance Lincoln could do better.

They say to see this on the biggest screen possible, but the real star is the soundtrack – see it in the theater with the best speaker setup possible! The movie was decent, but it has a real music-video vibe, and the NIN soundtrack hits.

Political Editor


UPDATED: Democrats are increasing pressure on certain GOP lawmakers in the shutdown messaging war, the latest being a new ad buy from the DNC.


	The five-figure buy will include digital ads on YouTube, Instagram and Facebook, along with billboards and bus shelters in Republican districts.


	At the center of the government shutdown are Democrats' demands that the GOP extend Obamacare premiums, warning of severe price hikes without it that will make health insurance unaffordable for many on the Affordable Care Act plans. As the Senate has continued to vote on a continuing resolution to reopen the government, sans the subsidy extension, Democrats have so far not lost support since the shutdown began last week. They also believe that pressure only will increase on the GOP in the coming weeks, as ACA enrollees get notices of price increases. Per Kaiser Family Foundation, premiums will more than double on average if the subsidies expire.

	The ad campaign is targeting Republicans including Rep. Monica De La Cruz (R-TX), Rep. Tom Kean (R-NJ), and Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick (R-PA), Rep. John James (R-MI) and Rep. Jen Kiggans (R-VA), among others. The DNC campaign also includes texts to voters, including messages on calculating premium hikes.




			Watch on Deadline		







	DNC Chair Ken Martin said in a statement, “Right after the holidays, health care costs for Americans across the country are going to more than double because Republicans are refusing to work with Democrats to fix this crisis. That's why the DNC is going to make sure families everywhere know that Republicans are about to wreck their pocketbooks and price them out of health insurance.”


	Republicans, meanwhile, have highlighted flight delays and the potential for military families to miss paychecks in their messaging efforts to blame the shutdown on Democrats. “Chuck Schumer is playing political games right now for his own political future,” Speaker Mike Johnson told CBS News on Thursday. “He's afraid he's going to get a Marxist challenge from the left in his party, so he has dramatically changed course.” But one high profile Republican, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA), has warned of the premium hikes, even appearing on CNN on Thursday.

	











	The initial days following the shutdown was followed by a blame game battle for social media attention, with Trump posting deepfakes of House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries in a sombrero. Democrats created a cat-starring video to explain what was at stake. As the shutdown has gone into its second week, the ad buy reflects a more traditional approach the messaging.

					By Ted Johnson 

Political Editor


	Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and Sen. Ron Wyden (D-OR) are again pressing Paramount CEO David Ellison on whether there was any “side deal” with Donald Trump in advance of FCC approval of Skydance‘s acquisition of the legacy media company.


	In advance of the FCC's approval, Paramount Global settled Trump's lawsuit against CBS and 60 Minutes over the way that an interview with Kamala Harris was edited. The settlement was for $16 million, to fund Trump's presidential library, as well as attorneys fees and costs.


	But the senators have previously questioned Ellison over Trump's claims that there was an additional sum agreed to, of $16 million or more, to fund public service announcements and advertising commitments. Pre-transaction Paramount Global denied they made such a side deal, while Skydance general counsel Stephanie Kyoko McKinnon wrote to the senators last summer that the company “has fully complied with all applicable laws, including our nation's anti-bribery laws.”

	In their latest letter, sent on Thursday, Warren and the other senators said that they found the responses incomplete. They wrote, “In the inquiry we sent to you, we warned that under the federal bribery statute, it is illegal to corruptly give anything of value to federal officials to influence an official act, and the existence of a side deal with the President to facilitate merger approval may violate anti-bribery laws.




			Watch on Deadline		







	“In your July 31 response, you refused to answer any questions about the existence of a side deal with President Trump, stating only that ‘Skydance executives and its representatives have had routine and customary interactions with government officials, including with the Administration, Congress, and federal regulators.'”

	











	Warren and the other senators want Ellison to answer a series of questions by Oct. 23, including contacts with specific administration officials, and to answer whether there was “any arrangement — either a formal written agreement or an ‘unwritten understanding' — under which you, Skydance, or any entity affiliated with Skydance or the new Paramount will provide compensation, advertising or promotional activities that in any way assist President Trump, his family, his Presidential Library, or other administration officials.”


	Last summer, in the midst of publicity about the Skydance-Paramount deal and its pending regulatory approval, Warren and other congressional Democrats introduced the Presidential Library Anti-Corruption Act, which would require that presidents wait until after they leave office before fundraising or accepting donations. 


	A Paramount spokesperson said they had no comment.

					By Baz Bamigboye 

Columnist/International Editor At Large


EXCLUSIVE: Wagner Moura, star of Kleber Mendonça Filho's acclaimed Cannes Film Festival award-winner, The Secret Agent,  is scared of AI and how to deal with it. “Especially,” he warns, “the idea that the truth as we know it, it's kind of over. That scares the s**t out of me.”


	He worries that when you see someone speaking in a video or a movie, and you hear their voice and see their face and “it's not the person, and this is scary.” Then he asks: “Who can we trust?”


	Brazilian-born, Moura's concerned too, as we all are, about erroneous information that's put out on the darker parts of social media, which folk lap up as truth. “That's scary too,” he sighs, exasperated. “It's as if we're living in different worlds.”

	As if needing momentary respite from talk of AI, Moura gets up from his desk. “I have to brag,” he boasts as he picks up his laptop, moves to a window and shows off the sweeping coastline views, then switches around to show the old Faro da Barra lighthouse out on the Point of Santo Antônio looking out to the Atlantic Ocean.




			Watch on Deadline		







	The actor keeps an apartment in Salvador, Bahia, Brazil, where he was born. “Look at this place, man!” he gloats as he beholds the magnificent scenery, while I look out of my own back window and watch our wild roses being battered by raging gusts of wind.


	Inside the apartment, he points out photographs of Black Brazilians captured by famed French photographer Pierre Vergér that are hung on the wall behind him. There are also monochrome prints that Vergér shot in Africa.


	Vergér, in his last decades, lived a life of simplicity in Vila América, a bairro of Salvador, and photographed his friends and neighbours. “This is the blackest city in the world outside Africa, right?”, Moura says of Salvador.

	











	“And then it became like an Afro-Brazilian thing. It's very African, but of course it's very Brazilian at the same time. And there's an Afro-Brazilian religion here called Candomblé, [established by enslaved Africans in the 19th century].”


	Moura's a huge fan of Vergér's work and is fascinated by the photographer's interest in Afro-Brazilian culture. “He got so involved with Candomblé and Afro-Brazilian culture that he himself, didn't even believe in God, became a very strong personality in this religion.”


	Candomblé was prohibited at the beginning of the 20th century by the white colonizers and Portuguese, and also whatever was left of the Portuguese Empire. “They want everybody in the country to be Catholic. This was also like a movement of resistance of black culture in the country,” says the star, rightly celebrated for his roles in The Elite Squad, Dope Thief, Futuro Beach and for his monstrously captivating portrait of notorious Colombian cocaine czar Pablo Escobar in Narcos on Netflix.


	The fact that Moura and I are allowed to have an open conversation involving politics and culture,  in a way goes to the heart of what Oscar and BAFTA contender, The Secret Agent is about, it being set in Recife, Brazil, at the height of military dictatorship in 1970s Brazil and the curtailing of freedoms and free speech that came with it. 


	The film, a political fable, is about Marcel, a widower, a quiet man seeking refuge in a safe place, and a place of safety to raise his young son, while paranoia reigns around him. It's also compellingly wild, whacky, and absurdly outlandish – a leg, severed from its owner by a shark, goes on the rampage in Recife. 


	And there are equally dangerous, thuggish government figures out there up to no good as well. The film was rapturously received at Cannes, winning Filho Best Director and Moura Best Actor. The Neon release has been lauded at festivals in Telluride, New York, Zurich, and at other festivals. It plays the BFI London Film Festival next week on October 14, 15, and 18.


	Neon opens the film in New York on November 26 and  December 5 in Los Angeles. MUBI releases the picture next year on February 20 in the U.K. and Ireland. It's been on wide release in Brazil since early September. 


	Moura says that he began having conversations with director Filho several years before production on The Secret Agent began.


	They'd met when Moura went to Cannes with Sergio Machado's  Cidabe Baixa (Lower City), with a screenplay by Karim Aïnouz, about passion and obsession. The movie played in Un Certain Regard in 2005. Filho was there as a film critic and he and Moura connected through their cultural backgrounds. When Moura returned home, he ravenously sought out the series of short films that Filho had already made up until that point. ”I went, wow, that critic made these!”


	His admiration was cemented when he watched Filho's 2012 directorial debut feature, Neighbouring Sounds, a searing study of paranoia and menace.


	Moura considers Neighbouring Sounds “one of the greatest Brazilian films ever.” It's “so political, and at the same time so humane…And then I became kind of obsessed to work with him” and, importantly,  their friendship was forged because of a shared passion for politics – and a loathing for Jair Bolsonaro, then president of Brazil.  

	











	The actor's hope then was to work with Filho sooner rather than later, but their schedules kept clashing. When the filmmaker invited him to be in Bacurau [2019 Cannes Jury prize winner], Maura was engaged in directing Marighella, which Filho visited during filming.


	They were linked through what they went through under Bolsonaro “because we were both very vocal against it and we both suffered a lot of the consequences …”, he says.


Marighella was shown in Berlin in 2019, but was censored in Brazil. ”It's not like censorship the way we used to know during the dictatorship; this was more like how he infiltrated all the means that I had,” Moura protests. For instance, Bolsonaro's flunkies penetrated the government agency that handled film distribution. “He just made it impossible to release the movie, so I had to fight a government in order to release a film.”


	Moura made similar comments when he was on the road promoting his work in Alex Garland's Civil War film and people were keen to discuss actual civil wars. “Brazil is a very young democracy, but Brazilians know what a dictatorship is. We know how bad that shit is. Americans don't,” he proffers.


	“Americans take democracy for granted. I think this is changing right now, but the thing that made me a little scared about the state of American democracy was that I felt that people really felt that democracy was a given. And it's not. You have to fight for it every single day,” Moura contends.


	Filho himself had also suffered under the dictatorship and political forces tried to destabilisize the release of his  2016 film Aquarius. “It's crazy because it brings me right to Ibsen's An Enemy of the People,” Moura states, referring to a stage production he's involved in now, of the classic play, which is about “the consequences of telling the truth, of fighting for what you believe. How far would you go?”


	Although Moura knew exactly what The Secret Agent was going to be about, Filho wouldn't show him the script until he deemed it ready. Filho warned the actor that if he read the screenplay and didn't like it, then he was to consider himself “a f***ing idiot. ”Moura smiles and says that when he was eventually allowed to read it: “I was like, 'This is great.'”


	Clearly, Moura's an ardent admirer of Filho's work, both as a critic and as a filmmaker and marvels over the man's deep knowledge of film culture. “You can see, for example, that he loves American films from the 1970s, that he likes anamorphic lenses, he likes zooms and things like that. You can see all that. But he managed to make all that very unique and very Brazilian and he creates these moods…And you feel that, ‘Oh my God, I think that's something terrible is about to happen here.'  He creates this sensation of fear and of that, you don't know exactly where it comes from. And at the same time, one of the things that I love about all of his films, is that he creates a sense of familiarity…You feel that, ‘Oh, I belong to this, I know this, I know this place, I know these people …and every single character that appears in the film is a human being, is someone that has a story. And so I could read all that before I started really working with him. When I read the script, I could see all those references and all those things that I admired in these previous films.”


The Secret Agent opens in stark simplicity. There's a body on a gas station forecourt. Dead. Flies and wild dogs swarm. Cops come. They ignore the rotting corpse and head to Marcelo, played by Moura, as he stands by his yellow Volkswagen Beetle.

	











	Actually, Moura owns a 1964 vintage Beetle. It's blue.


	I wonder about the significance of the car in the film being yellow. Moura's not sure but later on he wonders if it's something to do with the yellow diamond at the center of the Brazilian national flag. “Brazil is yellow. It's our national team's jersey. And when everybody goes to the street, the people wear yellow.” 


	In any event, the yellow pops out of Evgenia Alexandrova's cinematography. Also, I sense that the car signals that Marcelo's a humble man. Size doesn't matter. The vehicle informs a lot about who he is.


	Moura suggests that Filho's also exploring manhood, not so much in the macho sense, but in its connection to values. Certainly, there were such values in Rodelas, a countryside town located in the Bahia region from where his family hails. Moura remembers how his grandfather and his father comported themselves. “There was a code of how a man should behave. Integrity. I think of course it was a very macho environment, but it is something that of course everybody should relate to men and women, everybody to act with integrity and everything,” he insists.


	“But back then, and this film takes place in the seventies, and I have three sons for example. And it's really something today to teach them what it is to be a man and how to be,” Moura says.


	“Just behave with empathy and integrity and stick with your values when things are not going well,” he says, getting to the heart of what  The Secret Agent is about. 


	“When everybody else, including the government, especially the government, or everybody around you is saying the opposite of what you believe, how to stick with what you think is right?” he asks out loud.


	And speaking of Filho's understanding of the history of movies; standing up for what you believe in, once upon a time, represented what American movies in their golden age – the John Ford years, let's say, – and, therefore its citizens, stood for. Americans stood for something, in a way that some observers believe many don't anymore. 


	Moura nods in agreement when I note that The Secret Agent is a powerful repudiation of both Brazilian and U.S. contemporary political culture.


	Moura's grandfather had a small holding in Rodelas. “He farmed to survive. He had a couple of goats and would plant what they ate,” he explains.


	 However, the actor's father was a sergeant in the Brazilian air force and he was transferred to Salvador, where Maura was born, but he was mostly raised in his family's hometown.


	Moura speaks of his grandfather's and father's calmness and he brings that sensibility to his acting in The Secret Agent. His performance, one feels, is at a level that others might want to aim for. Yes, the calmness is external, but look close into his eyes and there's the hint of the fear that Marcelo must not betray. It seems effortless. But, then so was Fred Astaire's dancing. A career of working in the theater, on television and on the big screen has gone into creating the dual roles he plays in The Secret Agent. The art of effortlessness doesn't just happen.


	I'm not going to give away spoilers here about the dual parts. Best to go into the film not knowing. Let it unfold. 


	Did Filho give Moura direction about acting calm, I ask the actor? “Yeah. He did give me,” he responds, ”because my personal reaction would be more heated. I think that I'm more like an explosive person and maybe that transfers to the way I act. Sometimes my tendency would be to go like: “What the f*** is this?” Especially when something is very unfair. My tendency is to break s**t down and to go to the confrontation. And I think that Marcelo has more of Kleber's temperature. He is more stoic and more like, ‘Let's see how this is going to unfold?' But he didn't need to say a lot to me because I quickly understood what temperature that character should have. And I understood also that he wrote that character based on what we were going through, but especially what he was going through himself. So it has a lot of him in it.”

	











	Also, Moura observes, the way the scenes were written informed him of everything that Marcelo was experiencing internally “and that he was someone that was trying to hide, of course. So he had to be a very discreet presence.”


	Plus, there's a child involved. Marcelo's son has to be protected. “I cannot go crazy. I have to breathe and keep going and keep going and fighting and going through this. And to take that kid out of that town.”


	It is primal. ”I think the fact that he's a father, it informs a lot of who that character is too,” he suggests.


	I remember the frenzied cheers that accompanied the announcement by competition juror Hong Sangsoo of Moura's name as Best Actor. Moura hadn't been able to return to Cannes for the closing ceremony due to filming commitments. Later, jury chair, Juliette Binoche presented Moura with his trophy at a surprise reception in Paris.


	Brazilian photojournalists on either side, both women, hugged me in an eruption of ebullience in the Lumière. Don't quite know why they chose me. I didn't complain. It was a sweet moment and it was sad that Moura wasn't able to be there.


	Moura confirms that he and Filho have a plan to collaborate again, and soon.


	“Oh yeah,” he beams. “I foresaw that when I saw Neighbouring Sound, I think I found my soulmate and we were very happy during the shooting of The Secret Agent. I've been in films where everything was great, everything was happy, and the film is bad. And the opposite, like a chaotic [experience], where you're sad that everything was going crazy, and the film was great,” he shrugs.


	“In this case, everything was great. I was so happy, to be finally working with Kleber and to be working in Portuguese,” for the first time in 12 years. ”How did that happen?” he exclaims.


	He'd been away shooting films and television dramas in Spanish and then in English. This time, he was happy to be in Filho's city and to be in Brazil. “We've become very, very good friends. And of course, we want to work again. Of course we do,” he says as he reveals that they are working on a project.


	When I push him about it, he protests that it is for Filho to talk about when he's ready.


	We kept running into each other during the Telluride Film Festival, as you do up in the mountains in Colorado.


	During an interview with Norwegian thespian, Inga Ibsdotter Lilleaas, who stars with Renate Reinsve and Stellan Skarsgård in Joachim Trier's stunning Sentimental Value, she spoke of studying in Brazil for a year and that she learned Portuguese by watching the telenovelas, as the Brazilian soap operas are called,  that Moura starred in.


	“Isn't that crazy? I was like, what?” he cries. “And she speaks very well,” he declares admiringly of Lilleaas's prowess with the Portuguese language.


	Moura starred in 156 episodes of Once in a Blue Moon and shot 167 episodes of  Paraiso Tropical and he considers both were great learning experiences for him alongside his stage work.


	“An actor has to learn so many things. First, if you have a main part in a soap opera here in Brazil, you record 20, 22 scenes per day. And you have to memorize all those lines and you have to show up. Some of those things are going to be okay. Some of those things are going to be not that great. And you have to learn not to suffer. And you have to learn how to find the scene that you're going, ‘Oh, this has potential', and go for that one. So it's a very interesting environment and the response is right away…And these soap operas in Brazil, they're huge. So the interaction with the audience is crazy because sometimes they think that you are the character. It's a crazy thing. And I learned a lot. I don't want to do it again because it's just insane,” he gulps.

	











	In any case, he jokes that he's “too old” to go soapy with telenovelas again. But they were a great opportunity, he says. They are, he recognizes, “part of Brazilian cultures, which are soccer, samba, and soap operas.”


	In Paraiso Tropical, his character, a “very bad, ambiguous businessman” starts to have a relationship with a prostitute. “And that relationship became like a thing in Brazil. People were crazy,” he smiles. To this day, people come up to him and quote phrases his character used to utter.


	He has several films in pre- and post-production status. They include 11817, which he and Greta Lee (Past Lives, The Morning Show) shot for director Louis Leterrier (The Incredible Hulk, the Transporter films), at Shepperton Studios over four months wrapping in June. It's about a family “that gets trapped in a house.”


	Right now, he's in the middle of performing An Enemy of the People in Salvador and Rio, a play that couldn't be, as discussed earlier, more relevant to our times. And that's definitely the case with The Secret Agent.


	And, as a student of the great classics of English-speaking theater, Moura's open to the idea of one day making his debut on the London stage. And, that, my friends, will be the cause of much celebration if he could ever be enticed to perform at, say, the National Theatre, the Royal Court or the Almeida or the Donmar or in the commercial West End. Many Brazilians reside in London. I can picture the excited hugging from theatregoers that will ensue when Moura enters stage left. 


	In fact, the campaign to bring Moura to a theater in London starts here and now. And An Enemy of the People would be a great way to start.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","John Candy: I Like Me unsurprisingly claims that everyone liked John Candy","https://www.avclub.com/john-candy-i-like-me-review","Fri, 10 Oct 2025 12:00:00 GMT","

“That's the problem when you talk about John,” says Bill Murray in the opening of John Candy: I Like Me, “people don't really have a lot of negative things to say about him.” One of the worst pop cultural feelings is reading a biography, watching a behind-the-scenes special, or scrolling a Wikipedia entry and learning something terrible about someone or something you've idolized. So, not to worry: John Candy: I Like Me doesn't contain anything even remotely troubling about the Canadian comedy legend. In fact, it doesn't contain much at all aside from praise. Candy's relatives, childhood pals, and famous comedy coworkers line up to glowingly reminisce about the actor, who died at just 43 years old in 1994. It's a cinematic wake three decades late, as simple and universal and ultimately unsatisfying as a hug at a funeral.

To go back to that Murray line, he follows it by telegraphing an anecdote that might reflect something mildly negative about Candy. Then, as he's about to tell it, John Candy: I Like Me cuts to its ethereal, near-holy opening credits. Director Colin Hanks, whose dad Tom was in Splash with Candy, begins his film in a Catholic church at Candy's funeral, with the literal worship songs preceding the metaphorical ones. 

This set-up is appropriate: Aside from a basic biography and the kinds of personal details so broad as to be perfectly impersonal (His family home was filled with food and laughter? He had to make the hard choice to pursue performing instead of working a typical nine-to-five?), the documentary has little interest in psychological insight or the mechanisms of Candy's approach to his work. It's only worried about his legacy as a kind man and a good dad.

Sure, it's mentioned that Candy's own father died young, and that his older brother had a heart attack in one of his dressing rooms, but this looming hereditary threat is skirted over just like the miniature histories of Second City, SCTV, and a stacked Toronto production of Godspell (which got its own documentary that premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival just two days after I Like Me). The same goes for the film's seesawing view of Candy's weight; the doc alternatively blames his weight for his failing health and shames interviewers for drawing any attention to it. To be fair, it was almost always brought up in an insulting way, as was documented to even greater effect in the Luther Vandross doc Luther: Never Too Much, but this movie handles the topic off-handedly, brushing it away without much consideration to its effect on the psyche or the physique.

What you're left with is a bunch of famous faces sitting in separate rooms giving brief talking-head interviews about an old friend who died 30 years ago—a step down from a group in a bar raising a glass to a lost pal. This has a certain bittersweetness, to be sure, but it's also not much to hang a two-hour documentary on. Despite including plenty of home video footage and a clip show of Candy's comedy career, from his early “Yellowbelly” sketch to Stripes to Uncle Buck and of course Planes, Trains and Automobiles, I Like Me sticks to the surface. Tyler Strickland's shamelessly swelling score and Hanks' simplistic structuring mean that surface also has a slick sheen, moving frictionlessly from birth to fame to death. As nice as it is to see that Tom Hanks thought he was great, or Mel Brooks, or Conan O'Brien, or Catherine O'Hara, that's all it is: nice.

Every so often, a story or a side interest will come up that'll threaten to tug a curious thread in Candy's personality. He was an investor in and avid promoter of Canada's pro football league, and the team he co-owned won the Grey Cup (the Canadian Super Bowl equivalent) the very first year he was involved with them. That's a whole movie right there. But telling that story would entail a lot more legwork than Hanks thumbing through his Rolodex and asking for a few minutes of time to wax nostalgic about Candy.

Because John Candy: I Like Me positions itself as a feature-length eulogy, opening at the actor's funeral and closing with his funeral procession, its merits as a documentary seem secondary to Hanks' intentions. Anyone would be lucky to be remembered this way; most of us will merely get loving slideshows and a few choked-up speeches rather than 120 minutes of Amazon-hosted hagiography. But also like those loving slideshows and speeches, the memories they evoke are more valuable than the stories that evoke them. For those who remember Candy through his work, which is most people, his performances offer far more connection, and far more nuance, than this memorial.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","No Doubt and Gwen Stefani to reunite inside the Sphere","https://www.avclub.com/no-doubt-gwen-stefani-reuniting-las-vegas-sphere","Fri, 10 Oct 2025 06:04:00 GMT","

Answering the immortal question, “What if we reunited (for like the third time) inside the terrifying Las Vegas orb,” Billboard is reporting that No Doubt and Gwen Stefani are getting back together for a six-show residency at the Las Vegas Sphere. The group (which played together for the first time in a decade at Coachella last year, and did a show in support of Los Angeles fire relief earlier in 2025) will be subjecting themselves to the mercies of the very big, very round circle some time in 2026.

Among other things, that'll make Stefani the first female vocalist to headline the Sphere, which opened in 2023, and has previously played host to groups like U2, Dead & Company, Backstreet Boys, and Eagles—i.e., a pretty scientific charting of bands that people with both the money and the inclination to watch a concert in a giant gimmick venue in Vegas might enjoy. Within that very specific context, No Doubt feels like a pretty big get: The group went through a number of ups and downs over the years, many of them largely predicated on the success of Stefani's solo career and her overall schedule. But after a number of stops and starts, the band formally disbanded in 2015, and stayed disbanded until that Coachella show last year, so it's not like there's been an abundance of reunion material for fans to sink their teeth into. A six-show residency could hypothetically scratch that itch, especially since it might let the group do a bit more than just mine the Tragic Kingdom hits.

No word on exactly when the residency will begin; the Sphere's schedule is pretty full for at least the first quarter of 2026 with more pop-ins from Backstreet and Eagles, who apparently have come to crave the light of Sin City's inescapable, massive orb.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","The Onion's Jeffrey Epstein: Bad Pedophile is now available online","https://www.avclub.com/onion-jeffrey-epstein-bad-pedophile-online","Fri, 10 Oct 2025 00:46:00 GMT","

Up until now, fans of both truth and crime were in a tough position when it came to watching The Onion‘s hard-hitting new 20-minute mockumentary Jeffrey Epstein: Bad Pedophile. Unless you could make it out to a handful of showings around the country, you simply had to take the word of critics—like our own film editor, Jacob Oller—that our former colleagues over at the Global Tetrahedron-owned satirical newspaper had managed to crack the true-crime format in an absurd, hilarious way. And isn't that blind acceptance of what you're being told exactly what Epstein's old employers in the Deep State mailroom would want?

﻿

No more, though: This afternoon The Onion posted Bad Pedophile to its YouTube page, presenting it in all the docu-narrative glory that credited executive producers Harvey Weinstein, Woody Allen, and Roman Polanski would have wanted. (Shout-out, meanwhile, to whichever writer got Stunt Coordinator: Larry Nassar into the credits, too. That's a very deep convicted sex offender pull.) Now we can all revel in the very silly, very dark send-up of true-crime tropes, which is happy to remind us that Epstein grew up as “your typical, all-American molester,” before things inevitably took a turn for the worse.

You can read our write-up of Bad Pedophile right here, but honestly, this one feels like a no-brainer: You've got 20 minutes, you like laughing at how fucked the planet is, you like being put on government watch lists for people who still enjoy satire in 2025. You know what to do.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Sorry, folks, James Gunn has no plans for Peacemaker season 3","https://www.avclub.com/peacemaker-season-3-james-gunn-no-plans","Fri, 10 Oct 2025 15:25:51 GMT","

This story contains spoilers for the Peacemaker season two finale.

Peacemaker went out on a high of a critically acclaimed second season and raves for a career-best performance from John Cena. But series creator and DC Studios boss James Gunn has no plans for a third. “This is about the other stories in which this [finale cliffhanger] will play out,” he said at a post-finale press conference (via Variety). He added that he'd “Never say never” about continuing the show, “But right now, this is about the future of the DCU.”

So, while Peacemaker the show may not be returning, Peacemaker the character very likely will. In fact, he could potentially show up in the studio's biggest project, the Superman sequel Man Of Tomorrow. At the end of the finale, Chris was thrown into the alternate universe metahuman prison “Salvation,” and Gunn said Salvation is going to play a central role in Man Of Tomorrow. “It may not seem like it at first, but it is all very connected,” he teased. “That was always pretty instrumental in the overarching story that I'm telling in the DCU. I had mapped out what I thought the general story was, and two important aspects to that were Checkmate and especially Salvation.”

Checkmate, a new crime-fighting organization formed in the finale, is “the real culmination of the 11th Street Kids and their desire to be good,” Gunn explained. The group will stay “separate from the other institutions in the DCU,” presumably meaning the Justice League (or the Justice Gang, as they're known at the moment). Whether that means they'll get their own spin-off show or otherwise appear in one of the other DC projects is unclear, but Gunn spoke about them like they'll be coming back. “I think they're going to be really, really good at what they do,” he said. “When we see them next, their circumstances will be a little bit different than the startup that they're at now.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Thanks, but Human Rights Watch ""cannot accept"" donations from Riyadh Comedy Fest performers","https://www.avclub.com/human-rights-watch-riyadh-comedy-festival-donations","Fri, 10 Oct 2025 00:33:00 GMT","

Despite the namecheck from Aziz Ansari on Jimmy Kimmel Live! the other night, Human Rights Watch “cannot accept” donations from comedians who have performance remorse over their participation in the Riyadh Comedy Festival in Saudi Arabia. Appearing on Kimmel on Tuesday, Ansari said that he would be donating portions of the money he was paid by the Saudi royal family, whose leader, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, ordered the assassination of Washington Post reporter Jamal Khashoggi in 2018 [per the Central Intelligence Agency], to organizations like Reporters Without Borders and Human Rights Watch. Alas, while the latter appreciates the comedians who “generously offered to donate part of their performance fees,” they must decline. Unlike the comedians, Human Rights Watch has some standards regarding who it accepts money from. Along with Ansari, comedian Jessica Kirson, one of the three women who performed at the festival, committed to donating her fee to a human rights organization—though she did not specify a cause.

“But while we cannot accept [the money], it is not too late for them to call for the release of detained Saudi activists,” said Joey Shea, Saudi Arabia researcher at Human Rights Watch, tells Variety. “Human Rights Watch didn't call for comedians to boycott the Riyadh Comedy Festival, but simply asked them to express their support for free speech by urging the release of Saudi activists unjustly imprisoned.”

As of this reporting, none of the comedians have called for the release of the detained activists. Nevertheless, Human Rights Watch did attempt to warn comedians that this whole “accepting money from the Saudi government thing” was a bad idea, and they weren't, as Jim Jeffries put it, going over there to be “freedom-of-speech machines.” (Jeffries was apparently disinvited from the festival after making comments about Khashoggi on a podcast. Even the freedom-of-speech machine has limits.) In a statement released last month, HRW stated that the Riyadh festival was a means of whitewashing human rights abuses, such as the dismemberment of Khashoggi. “The seventh anniversary of Jamal Khashoggi's brutal murder is no laughing matter, and comedians receiving hefty sums from Saudi authorities shouldn't be silent on prohibited topics in Saudi like human rights or free speech,” said Shea. “Everyone performing in Riyadh should use this high-profile opportunity to call for the release of detained Saudi activists.”

Of course, that's not what happened. After making Shane Gillis look virtuous, the Riyadh comedians returned to tell us how much more chill Saudi Arabia is than we might think, pointing out Riyadh's many Pizza Hut and Cheesecake Factory outposts. Now, one might say, “But, Bill Burr, you're not a corporate entity, you're an artist. Shouldn't you hold yourself to a higher standard?” They would respond by calling you a “phony” who can't find Saudi Arabia on a map.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Thriller The Last Frontier is far more silly than chilly","https://www.avclub.com/the-last-frontier-review-apple-tv","Fri, 10 Oct 2025 02:00:00 GMT","

Escapism is a tricky needle to thread. Viewers are willing to engage in incredible amounts of suspension of disbelief if a show is entertaining enough to allow for the leaps in logic to be ignored. There is an entire industry built around carefully calibrating how much people will accept when it comes to unbelievable behavior and ridiculous coincidences (looking at you, 9-1-1). But when a project isn't doing the work to stay engaging enough for its stupid characters and nonsensical plotting to be overlooked, it can be downright draining. Welcome to Apple TV+'s The Last Frontier, a straight-to-series order that looked at the insane twists of its streamer partner Smoke and threw its beer at it.

Much like Smoke, The Last Frontier opens with a bang. Jason Clarke casts an imposing figure as U.S. Marshal Frank Remnick, who lives in a small town on the edge of Alaska, the kind of place where everyone knows your name and you can see Russia from your house. Creators Jon Bokenkamp and Richard D'Ovidio sketch Remnick as an old-fashioned Western guy, the protector of his small-town people against outside enemies from the big city and the evil powers that be. He's a Southern archetype transported to the snow-covered north who mumbles things like “Every day is another day stolen from death. I learnt that the hard way.” 

Remnick has a wife, Sarah (a wasted Simone Kessell, whose character just disappears in the last few episodes), and a son, Luke (Tait Blum), who is still recovering from the death of his sister four years ago. Of course, the Remnicks have trauma related to gun violence, although the way this one is portrayed in a flashback late in the season is pretty gross, both in how it plays into the big-city fears of the day and how manipulatively it's directed.

If the idea is that Remnick flees the dangerous metropolis that helped lead to his daughter's death for the relative safety of the middle of nowhere, everything changes when violence drops into his backyard in the form of a plane crash. The flight that pulls a Lost in this snowy land—and, to be fair, the sequence in which the plane goes down is pretty impressively staged, as is the subsequent fight and shoot-out—happened to be carrying a cargo of some of the most violent criminals in the world like a sort of Con Air: Northern Edition. Dozens of orange-wearing bad guys escape into the wild, giving The Last Frontier something to play with episodically as Remnick and his team chase them down. This lets the writers basically make two shows for a while: the episode-of-the-week hunt for escaped prisoners and one about the larger picture concerning the plane and its precious cargo that Remnick will undoubtedly uncover. The setup allows for a good amount of guest stars, like the always-excellent Clifton Collins Jr., who gets a couple chapters as a conspiracy nut hoping to take down an Alaskan research facility, as well as Rusty Schwimmer and Johnny Knoxville.  



While second-tier bad guys are getting rounded up by Remnick and his team, the main arc of the season is devoted to a mysterious figure code-named Havlock (Dominic Cooper). One of the most wanted men in the world, he was the VIP of the transport, which means it may have been taken down for a reason, either to eliminate him or assist in his escape. The government sends someone close to Havlock to co-lead the efforts with Remnick, the G-woman Sidney (Haley Bennett). Meanwhile, Alfre Woodard and John Slattery's characters (both are too talented for this) skulk around intelligence offices, muttering things about what could happen if the intel that Havlock has is leaked. Havlock is one of those guys who knows where all the government's bodies are buried, and that means he should be the charismatic center around which the rest of this show spins. (Think James Spader's Raymond Reddington in another Bokenkamp creation, The Blacklist.) And yet he vanishes for stretches and is often seen more in flashback than the present, making the Hannibal Lecter of this show a non-factor for too long. 

That is before everything gets turned around in the final few episodes to make us question Havlock, Sidney, and even Remnick's motives. The mystery around Havlock would suit a two-hour thriller, but this 10-hour length demanded by Apple means information about Havlock and his goals are leaked out in drips and drabs. And that just makes him look like the slowest evil genius in the world. (He's got a master plan! That will apparently take weeks!) 

Again, this is the kind of logical gap that no one questions when a show is working. But this program feels like it's going for records in exposition dumps, buried secrets, and inane twists. Every other scene pushes that bullshit meter a bit further into the red. The Last Frontier doesn't necessarily need rich character depth—The Blacklist and 9-1-1 didn't exactly become hits because of that—but audiences have a limit for manipulation that feels cheap and inconsistent.  

The Last Frontier premieres October 10 on Apple TV+

Nine-time Grammy winner Billie Eilish was exiting her Miami show when a scary incident took place. As the pop star walked past a group of fans, one of them forcefully grabbed her and yanked her towards the crowd. See the shocking video below.

A post shared by BILLIE EILISH (@biilleeiilsh)

Eilish appeared to be stunned, but okay as she was helped by security. The singer looked back over her shoulder and frowned, looking uncomfortable after the incident.

Fans swarmed the comments of a Billie Eilish fanpage on Instagram to defend the star. One wrote, “That is so horrible! I hope they got that person that grabbed her!”

Another showed their support by writing, “I love you, Billie Eilish.” 

Another video showed the incident from a higher angle.

A post shared by Daily Hourly (@dailyhourly)

TMZ says they learned from the Miami Police that the person who grabbed Eilish was ejected from the arena. The performance, which took place October 10 at the Kaseya Center, was the first in a planned three-part series of shows during the starlet's Hit Me Hard and Soft Tour. The Miami New Times says the show was sold out, and was the first time Eilish had performed in Miami in five years.

The Times says the crowd “went ballistic” as Eilish appeared in a 69 jersey and baseball cap, opening the show with “Chihiro.”

Back in September 2013 during a stop on her Mrs. Carter Show World Tour in Brazil, Beyoncé was grabbed by a fan while performing “Irreplaceable.” The megastar almost fell into the crowd after the audience member wrapped her into a hug, but she stayed incredibly calm and asked security not to intervene.

“Hey! Calm, calm, calm. It's alright,” said the “Single Ladies” singer. “He just got excited,” she added. A few moments later, Beyoncé shook the fan's hand and asked him his name.

Back in 2019, Eilish spoke to MTV Australia about her fame, saying, “This is weird. I feel like this is a simulation.” She went on to address her fans, saying, “I don't want you to feel like, ‘Oh my god, I'm never gonna get to meet her.' I hate that.” 

Eilish then joked, “I don't mean come to my hotel, or or follow me around the airport. I just mean, I can go like this and you can grab me,” while reaching out her hand. The Miami fan who snatched Eilish clearly took her kindness too far.

Kris Jenner surely knows how to turn heads! The “Keeping Up With the Kardashians” matriarch, 69, just debuted a bold new look — and fans can't stop talking about it. In a new Instagram video shared on Wednesday, October 8, Jenner revealed a stunning platinum blonde transformation courtesy of celebrity hairstylist Chris Appleton. 

The post, captioned “Blondie,” quickly set social media buzzing. In the clip, Jenner appears makeup-free and relaxed in a salon chair, wrapped in a white towel and cozy brown hoodie as Appleton mixes dye beside her. Set to Sabrina Carpenter's hit “When Did You Get Hot?,” the video captures the playful banter between the two before the big reveal.

A post shared by Kris Jenner (@krisjenner)

“Wait, I need a minute,” Jenner mouths, before Appleton joins in with, “Ok? Here it comes!” Seconds later, the reality star turns around, unveiling her sleek new platinum locks — and the internet lost it.

A post shared by Chris Appleton (@chrisappleton1)

Reactions poured in from Kris Jenner's glam squad and fans within minutes of the post.

“Uhhh she looks incredible,” makeup artist Ash K. Holm gushed in the comments, adding, “we did that!!!”

Fans echoed the excitement. “I'll have what she's having,” one follower wrote, while another joked, “She's 30 right now! Stunning work and so much fun — always gorgeous, both of you!”

The clip wrapped with Jenner and Appleton posing together as Sabrina Carpenter's chorus played, and the verdict across social media was unanimous: Kris Jenner can rock any hairdo.

A post shared by Kris Jenner (@krisjenner)

The platinum makeover isn't Jenner's first foray into blonde territory. Back in January 2018, the “Keeping Up With the Kardashians” star kicked off the New Year with an icy pixie cut, and she later stunned at the 2019 Met Gala with a sleek blonde bob that had fans doing a double-take.

Her latest transformation comes as the momager continues to make waves in the fashion world. Earlier this year, Jenner was spotted in Paris attending Lauren Sánchez's star-studded bachelorette party, where fans noticed her fresh, youthful glow.

A post shared by M·A·C Cosmetics (@maccosmetics)

“You have to do what makes you feel good, first of all,” Jenner previously said during a 2015 episode of Good Work. “You can't do something because somebody else wants you to do it, and you have to do great research on the doctor that you choose.”

Appleton, 42, who counts Jennifer Lopez and Kim Kardashian among his celebrity clients, has long praised Jenner's bold style.

Last month, he told People, “My entire TikTok is a Kris Jenner fan account at this point. I'm obsessed with her.”

He added, “I just love that she's having this resurgence and she's living her best life. I'm all for reinventing yourself at any age — and she is the queen of doing that right now.”

So, we can all agree: Kris Jenner is the undisputed queen of makeovers. From her sleek Paris looks to her viral platinum transformation, she's proof that reinvention has no age limit, and that confidence really is the best glam.

Paula Deen is celebrating her comeback with a new photoshoot and a new body. The culinary star posed with her sons, Bobby and Jamie, in September 2025 to take promotional photos for her documentary, “Canceled: The Paula Deen Story.” TIFF (Toronto International Film Festival) says the film was directed by Bill Corben, and premiered at the festival on September 6. A wide release date is yet to be announced.

The 78-year-old looks dramatically more slim and trim since beginning her weight loss journey back in 2009 after a diabetes diagnosis. A 2024 Yahoo report says she detailed her diet on her website, writing, “Y'all, the choice was easy. And it turns out the changes haven't been as hard as I imagined because I've been taking it at a turtle's pace: slow and steady.”

Paula Deen's fitness journey has been years in the making, and the kitchen queen looks better than ever in the September 2025 photoshoot. Below, compare her final look to her appearance on a talk show back in 2011. Although she has always possessed her signature sparkle, Deen looks super different in recent days. 

So how did Paula Deen lose the weight? Yahoo says a source revealed the grandmother of 11 changed her diet, and began consuming a bit less of her own recipes. While she has never strayed away from whipping up indulgent magic in the kitchen, the Georgia native now keeps more of an eye on what she eats. 

“She's dropped a ton of weight, fifty pounds at least, by avoiding the bad carbs, and the butter and grease she's known to cook with. She can still whip up a Southern-comfort meal with biscuits and gravy, desserts like peach cobbler and banana pudding or chocolate pound cake, but she'll only take a small bite to taste and show her fans it's really good,” they say the source revealed.

The story says the source went on to say, “She lives a very calm life, more modest than she was used to before the scandal that got her fired from Food Network. She's humbler, and people have picked up on that. She's gaining followers on her YouTube cooking show, she still has her restaurants and is churning out the cooking books.” 

13 years ago, the “Lady and Sons Savannah Country Cookbook” author opened up to Clinton Kelly on “The Chew” about the beginnings of her health scare, per the Huffington Post. She said, “I think it's been close to three years, Clinton. And it was really something that I had to digest.”

She also touched on the future of her legacy, saying, “When my life is over, and you hear my name, I hope you associate the word ‘hope' with it.”

The same year, she became a spokeswoman for a diabetes drug, and said in an ad campaign video, “I have made simple changes in my life. Like cutting back on one of my favorite things. Sweet tea!”

Paige DeSorbo recently opened up about a key piece of advice she received from Bravo host Andy Cohen!

The “Summer House” alum spoke with The Zoe Report, as she was featured on the cover for the October issue.

She explained how Cohen urged her to think beyond immediate gains and build for long-term sustainability.

A post shared by The Zoe Report (@thezoereport)

“I've always heard Andy be very like, ‘You should have things outside of Bravo,'” she recalled Cohen saying. “In earlier seasons, he'd be like, ‘You're saving your money, right? And you're making good financial decisions and you're building things outside of it?'”

She compared it to having a parent checking on your grades.

“It would be like seeing your dad and him being like, ‘And let me see your report card,'” she added. “So when he was proud of me for Radio City, I was like, ‘I peaked — and now I have to leave.'”

Since then, DeSorbo has expanded her footprint well beyond reality TV.

She co-hosts the popular “Giggly Squad” podcast with “Summer House” alum and comedian Hannah Berner.

The two went on a successful podcast tour and ended up performing at Radio City Music Hall.

DeSorbo told Elle on Thursday, Oct. 9, that she views it as her proudest moment.

“So far, I think when Hannah and I performed at Radio City [Music Hall] back-to-back nights is by far one of the most surreal [highlights],” she stated. “Just to be in the same sentence as so many people that have performed there, it was an honor. It was an amazing way to end [our tour].”

She also co-authored the New York Times bestselling “How to Giggle.” 

On top of everything DeSorbo has going on, she launched a loungewear brand in June after her cat Daphne.

The loungewear's website describes the clothing as “chic yet comfortable, cute yet updated, and, above all, pieces anyone could roll out of bed in and still wear to coffee.”

A post shared by Daphne (@daphne)

She opened up in a June interview with In Style about how she was worried she wasn't going to make the most of her time on the popular reality TV show.

“I would get really down on myself,” she bravely stated. “'What if the show's not on next year? What if I'm not asked back and I haven't put anything out?'”

When the first release of Daphne dropped, it sold out immediately. When speaking with Elle, she added how she has a vision for what's next with the brand.

“Well, I have so many ideas for Daphne. I think it can go in so many different directions, and there's just so much opportunity there,” she proudly said.

Paige is a woman who we should all aspire to emulate.  She is smart, she listens, she knows her own mind, she can make fun of herself, and above all, she takes no shit!  I am 67 years old, so I know if what I speak!

As today's filmmaking production struggles to find a place to land anywhere in the United States, the Trilith Institute is encouraging emerging filmmakers already based in Georgia to make their movies and TV stories there. And with funding, a stipend, and mentorship to boot.

The nonprofit Trilith Institute announced today that applications for its 2026 Emerging Creative Residency (ECR) will open October 10. (Applications on its website are now live here.) Now entering its third year, the flagship program provides filmmakers who live in Georgia with housing in the Town at Trilith, plus $100,000 in production funding, a living stipend, focused mentorship, and access to industry resources. Selected writers and directors working in independent film will be supervised and mentored from development through production and distribution.

The Institute's first two residents have already found success. The 2024 ECR grantee, Ebony Blanding premiered the feature film “A Mess of Memories” at the BronzeLens Film Festival in Georgia, where it won multiple awards. The 2025 recipient, Christian Noél, is currently in production on an original half-hour comedy pilot developed through the program. The series, billed as “Caddyshack” meets “Parks and Recreation,” is Trilith Institute's first TV project.

“With our first feature film and now a television pilot, we are truly realizing the mission of Trilith Institute: to foster and retain the next generation of storytellers here in Georgia,” said Jeffrey Stepakoff, president and CEO of Trilith Institute, in a press statement shared with IndieWire. “By empowering emerging writers and directors like Ebony and Christian with meaningful resources, mentorship, and industry access, we are building a sustainable creative pipeline that keeps talent rooted in our state while contributing fresh voices to the global storytelling landscape.”

Applications for the 2026 ECR are open now through November 7, 2025, at trilithinstitute.org. The selected resident will receive a year-long immersive experience, both living and working at Trilith while developing their original project with the guidance of industry professionals.

The nonprofit Trilith Institute is focused on building up a robust entertainment landscape in Georgia, through education and workforce development. The brand also includes Trilith Studios, located in Fayette County, which has hosted Marvel productions from “Loki” on TV to multiple “Avengers” films. Most recently, out of the DCU, James Gunn's “Superman” shot at Trilith as well, plus “Agatha All Along” and “Thunderbolts.”

Genre:

Electronic

Label:

Ternesc / XL

Spirals of blaring noise echo as though chained to the bottom of some long-forgotten cistern. A voice, far removed from normal diction, barks syllables in a harsh, lurching cadence. What remains of regular meter exists only as a log of controlled chaos—fetid, cavernous rhythms that batter a crumbling foundation. It all sounds ready to break apart. British producer Blawan holds it together on “The GL Lights,” the opening track of SickElixir. He extracts techno from within dense strata of mechanized grit, maneuvering through sharp edges and switchbacks until the mangled frame contorts into a new picture. The aesthetic is startling; his corroded dance music, steeped in hellish glossolalia, conjures a vast, violent, and unknowable world.

It hasn't always been like this. When charting his development, the artist born Jamie Roberts recalls feverish after-school drum practice and a fascination with the metallic shrieks of an industrial mincer that soundtracked work as a maggot farmer in South Yorkshire. In his earliest releases, tidy post-dubstep singles for labels like the legendary Hessle Audio, this fascination manifested as mechanistic perfection: skeletal grooves dominated by surgically arranged percussion. As his experience grew, his work underwent a sea change. The beats became noisier, grittier, more organic, without compromising the slick arrangements. By the time of his first album, 2018's Wet Will Always Dry, many of Roberts' now-perennial fascinations were beginning to calcify: “Tasser,” for instance, propelled its eroded techno pulse forward with a throaty digital rasp. A new poetics of distortion was taking shape.

Seven years on, the leering, all-encompassing grime of SickElixir melds dozens of Roberts' subsequent discoveries and revelations into a brutish, unhinged gestalt; its clamorous swagger makes “Tasser” look like a curio. Tracks groan and caterwaul as though wounded, cataloging a vast library of scabbed-over synth leads and guttural vocal hooks. The sound rides an uncanny middle between the scratchy, live-wire jam sessions of Syclops and the kitschy throat-singing augments of Ummet Ozcan. Roberts operates with finesse, finding a distinct place in the mix for each element in his tapestry. The yo-yoing volume dynamics in lead single “NOS”—from ruthless, blown-out bass to a clipped whisper—are at once organic and painstakingly contrived, compressing opposed timbres into a continuous, unified eruption.

Strange and indecipherable voices dot the album's scorched landscape. Sibilance becomes a weapon on “Casch,” where the hissing -sch of the title lingers as a reedy film that coats the track like nuclear residue. “WTF” uses aggressive pitch correction to mold its vocals into a stringy, propulsive bassline that pulls and snaps across the stereo field, transmogrified to taut elastic. Roberts' multivalent production chops turn the listening experience into a demented guessing game: Is the whole album, as the riff-y, Bobby McFerrin-referencing title of “Don't Worry We Happy” might suggest, an a capella project that got out of hand? Is this kick drum, that synth, that snare merely another vocal fricative turned sideways and run through Blawan's expansive stable of effects? SickElixir is compelling enough to render such questions immaterial: Its technique is swallowed whole by its form.

When unqualified beauty appears amid the album's grotesqueries, it's canted at odd angles, wrung from ear-searing hysterics. As the bubbling throb of “Rabbit Hole” cedes to plush vocals from singer Monstera Black, the resulting atmosphere feels almost alien in its charm; the album's gnarled universe seems to shiver and glitch before snapping back into place on the next track. Such small spots of light can only accentuate darkness, and SickElixir's shadow is deep and unrelenting. The album's knotted speech collages familiar sounds into a kinetic slurry of semantic satiation, near-words repeated until they disintegrate. The abstracted language becomes a parodic lingua franca, a means to coagulate clashing textures. Knife in hand, Roberts proposes the most elegant solution available to separate signal from noise: cut deeper.

Genre:

Hausu Mountain

Reviewed:

October 10, 2025

Maybe you thought you knew what you were getting from a Pulse Emitter album called Tide Pools. Limpid ambient miniatures lapping against the speakers, right? Turns out Daryl Groetsch got all that out of his system with his 2022 album Dusk and the run of synth albums he's put out under his own name since then; now, he's ready to play in spikier territory. More challenging than Dusk or Swirlings, his 2020 debut for the trippy Chicago label Hausu Mountain, Tide Pools suggests not so much the shimmering surface of its namesake as the strange denizens that might be found within, pulsating and flexing their spines for whatever beachcomber is lucky enough to find them.

Still drawing from the array of vintage synths that are his bread and butter, Groetsch paints here with short-attack, long-release choir tones; where his sequencers previously bubbled in the Phaedra fashion, here they press closely against the listener's ear like the ones used by the Japanese producer Shinichi Atobe. The tone is urgent and almost panicked for much of the first half, starting with “Energy Flying,” which puts Logic Pro's trusty “South African Voice Effects” sound-pack preset (you might remember it as the “timo” from Kendrick Lamar's “Mr. Morale”) through a wringer of little backmasked interruptions as the sequencers go bugnuts. In the second half, the music relaxes and is allowed to unfurl a little more, characterized by quieter pieces like the chittering “Critters” or the pinging, Barker-like “Scattered Clouds.”

Though Groetsch's been recording for HausMo for years, he's something of an outlier on their roster. He's been prolific on many labels for more than two decades, starting in 2002 with the hard-to-find IDM pastiche Slem, and he lives in Portland rather than Chicago, the experimental-music hotspot that's the source of much of the label's core catalog. His music for HausMo has leaned more sedate than recent releases like d'Eon's chamber-prog medulla-yanker Leviathan or the phone-composed sample splatter of Jetski's The Radiant Radish. On Tide Pools he ramps up to the level of his labelmates, both in its progginess (the back cover includes a quote from Rush's “Natural Sciences”) and in the way it seems a little more computerized than his earlier works, with MIDI playing a bigger role.

Dusk's blocky, vintage palette made the music somehow creepier and more inspiring than if it'd been rendered in the meticulously sound-designed language of, say, Monolake; I was reminded of old monster movies whose practical effects had a physicality often absent from CGI. Tide Pools is uncanny in a different way, one that's become a constant in experimental music since the early days of vaporwave, steeped in a sentimental (if slightly apprehensive) view of the crude 3D and unplaceable eeriness that defines the early age of computers. “Jellyfish and Friends” could be a lost theme from the sort of educational PC game you might've played in a library if you were a kid in the late '90s, while “Bug on Desk” and “Tide Pool 1” are written in computer start-up tones not unlike the one Brian Eno famously designed for Windows 95.

The early internet often seems tied to the element of water, maybe because there's something uniquely beautiful about the way water looks rendered in low-res digital media—as on the awesome cover from HausMo co-founder Max Allison; wouldn't you love to rejuvenate in those pools?—or maybe because its sparkling surface conceals vast and scary depths. Groetsch finds that intersection and submerges in it. Stretching for 45 minutes across 15 tracks, Tide Pools doesn't quite escape the trap some digital prog albums fall into, where the combination of claustrophobic sound design and content-packed maximalism leads to the same sort of fatigue you might get from staring at a screen too long. But at its best, the barrier between the listener and the music turns liquid.

Halfway through writing Don't Trust Mirrors, Kelly Moran stopped in her tracks. She had made a name for herself with the prepared piano, making John Cage's approach to the instrument accessible to a new generation through 2018's heady, LSD-inspired Ultraviolet. Moran partied her way through the following European tour, playing festival sets early in the day and raving deep into the night. This, she decided, is what she should do next: take the prepared piano even further by inspiring people to dance to it. Then Covid hit. She had moved in with her mother after her parents' divorce, and now she was stuck at home. “I was regressing the fuck out and I was… trying to write clubby piano music? Like no, this is not happening,” she explained. “I was going to make my great techno record in my bedroom with my mom in the next room over, while there's a pandemic? Yeah, the inspiration just died.”

This wasn't the end of Don't Trust Mirrors, but a new beginning. Moran took what she had so far, five compositions for prepared piano and electronics, and rewrote them for the Disklavier, a modern player piano that allowed her to reproduce her own playing and “duet” with herself. She wrote five more Disklavier tracks to complete last year's Moves in the Field, a set of seemingly impossible piano songs that are as cerebral as they are dizzying. Then, Moran returned to Don't Trust Mirrors by rewriting those additional pieces for her original setup. These are truly companion albums, as the recording of one led directly into the other, and then vice versa, in a sort of creative ouroboros. Don't Trust Mirrors is the snake's head and tail: the project's flash of inspiration and its culmination, the point where Moran lost her passion for the prepared piano and found it again.

The record's five earliest pieces (the first four tracks, plus “Reappearing”) date from 2019 and 2020, when Moran wanted to take the prepared piano to the dancefloor. It's easy to imagine album opener “Echo in the Field” blasting out over a late-night festival stage: A repeating synth line introduces buzzing bass chords, with the chiming piano carrying a clear melody over the top. Don't Trust Mirrors isn't really a dance record, though, and this club-friendly feel disappears quickly as Moran focuses on the timbral character of the prepared piano. “Prism drift” and “Sans sodalis” are built on spacious, ringing harmonics, not likely to move bodies, but to leave them stock-still and blissfully overwhelmed. These versions were later reworked into their more subdued partners, “Hypno” and “Sodalis (II),” for Moves in the Field, and their effect here is like seeing a familiar stage play shot in IMAX, with small, expressive gestures made grandly cinematic.

In the second half of Don't Trust Mirrors, Moran largely works in the opposite direction, translating those songs written for Disklavier into pieces for prepared piano and synth. These tracks stand out from their originals through textural variety rather than compositional complexity. “Systems,” for example, is recognizable as Moves in the Field's “Superhuman,” but it finds new force in the prepared piano's clanging strings. At times, it sounds more like gamelan and with a bit of subtle synth, it becomes quietly sinister. The more variable sound of Moran's electronics can completely alter a track, too: “Leitmotif,” a delicate little thing that unfurls like a rose petal on Moves in the Field, is big and airy and resonant as “Cathedral,” with tinkling notes spilling into an ambient wash of synth and disappearing in the cavernous distance.

Companion albums are nothing new for Moran, who released the improvisatory rush that became Ultraviolet later, unedited, as the Origin EP. But the relationship between Don't Trust Mirrors and its predecessor is different, more involved, and ultimately more illuminating: Neither of these albums could exist without the other; neither is a first draft, though they each started where the other left off. Hold them up next to each other and you can see Moran reflected more accurately than in either: a picture of the artist becoming herself.

In the slow, centerless world of Weirs, folk music is a memory that leaps from skull to skull, riding our dreams through time. The North Carolina collective gently dismantles old ballads, standards, and hymns and strews the parts across their three-legged workbench to see what they can find, like curious kids inventing a time machine while tinkering with a pocket watch. On their second album, Diamond Grove, simple tunes telescope into mind-bending epics; tape hiss and digital artifacting scrub the difference from past and present like some metamodern turpentine. It's a hauntingly familiar signal from next door, leaking across a dimensional dam.

Centered on the fiddle-string tenor voice of Oliver Child-Lanning, a naturally resonant instrument that sounds a little Arthur Russell and a lot Sam Amidon, Weirs started as an early-lockdown online collaboration with Sluice's Justin Morris, leading to the self-released debut Prepare to Meet God. The disembodiment fit that era, but on Diamond Grove, released by Dear Life Records, Weirs restore their communal idiom to its natural habitat. The music is vitally alive, crackling with mouth harps and junk percussion, turkey calls and Irish pipes—charismatic sounds that clamor above the richly sounding depths of the organs, strings, and vocals. It's an approach inspired by how we hear the sonic past, mediated and mutated by its long journey from pickin' and grinnin' sessions to wobbly shellac 78s to tape to CD and onward.

Diamond Grove is named for the former dairy farm in Virginia where Child-Lanning's grandfather once lived, and where these nine musicians gathered to take advantage of site-specific features like the creak of farmhouse floors, the birds and insects of the fields, and the cylindrical echo of the silo, to say nothing of the accreted residue of personal history. Their long-form drones now take the shape of the space around them, with a palpable sense of a live band cooking deep in the music's hyperreal folds. Field recordings of making dinner and doing chores are woven in, instantiating the broader human context that a folk song suggests, the performance unpartitioned from everyday life.

The ensemble includes Mipso's Libby Rodenbough, who plays with Child-Lanning and Morris in Sluice and Fust, and Magic Tuber Stringband, a group that likewise creates warped ethnographic archives of other worlds. They dissolve a mass of fiddles, cellos, acoustic guitars, banjos, harmoniums, organs, and mutating shape note singing in a warm, radiant, brainwave-spiked singularity. “I Want to Die Easy,” based on the revered Smithsonian Folkways recording that Sam Amidon's parents sang on, eases us into the continuum from traditional to turbulent: Conventional close harmonies, bathed in the silo's long reverb, open out into lush gospel stacks and start poking into tart modernist corners. This alternate Appalachia's roots include classical minimalism, the arcane edges of jazz, process art, and musique concrète.

“Everlasting” transforms a hymn into a locust swarm of electroacoustic psychedelia, while the MIDI-juiced “Doxology (I),” based on a Sacred Harp hymn, is a pitch-shifted tiny anthem in the line of Macha's “Believe” cover, so sweet you wish there were more than 72 seconds of it. And there are two tour-de-force deconstructions of English ballads, “Lord Randall” and “Lord Bateman,” the latter heroically convolving for 20 prismatic minutes. It sounds like someone dragging a sack of wind chimes and rusty shovels in some weird, quantized cartoon reality, with strange liquid bends like shooting stars in a desert sky. Above all, Weirs are amazing at sticking to the moment like glue, letting it unfold, never rushing, reaping those rewards. In their deconstructed folk music, it's not the stories that sweep me away; it's the sound, and the sense of a hidden continuity between what seems a more coherently structured time and our scrambled, deracinated age. Weirs hit the mark with gorgeous idiosyncrasy, retrieving the tangible energy of the present from the illusions of the past.

“It's, what, almost seven years since we last played together?” Daniel Rossen asks over the phone, trying to do the math. “Sorry, I'm a little rusty with interviews.” The Grizzly Bear singer, guitarist, and multi-instrumentalist is calling from a hotel room in Burbank, California, where he's been staying for several days. A short drive away is the rehearsal space where Rossen, Ed Droste, Chris Taylor, and Chris Bear are relearning their catalog, one cherry-picked song at a time. At last, the band is together again: mostly calm, a little jittery, but excited.

Elsewhere in Los Angeles is Taylor, the band's backing vocalist, bassist, and multi-instrumentalist, whose steady zeal over the phone is refreshing. “Leading up to this rehearsal, we've been nervous about how we'll sound or what it feels like being together in a room again, but the vibe is really positive,” he says. “I'm happy to see everyone so happy—although maybe that's the caretaker in me. I live to see everyone happy together.”

In the eight years since Grizzly Bear released Painted Ruins, Droste enrolled in graduate school for psychology and became an associate therapist, occasionally guesting on songs by Morrissey and Haerts. Rossen released his 2022 solo full-length debut, You Belong There, and worked with Bear to score the Oscar-nominated movie Past Lives. Bear also played drums on Fleet Foxes' album Shore and recorded music under his solo outlet Fools. Meanwhile, Taylor produced dozens of records for other artists, including Beth Orton and Clark.

Next week, Grizzly Bear headline the first show in a five-night run at New York's Brooklyn Steel, the beginning leg of their first tour in six years. In a discography ripe with ornate songs dominating playlists like “Indie Rock Hits” and, arguably most complimentary of all, “Songs to Test Speakers With,” Rossen and Taylor are eager to pull from overlooked corners of their discography for their grand return. “It's been a bit of a journey finding our way back to playing this music again,” says Rossen. “The nice thing about this run of shows, where we're not promoting a specific album, is that we can delve into whatever material we want to, go very far back in time, and explore the catalog however we feel.”

Rossen and Taylor talked to Pitchfork about why the band stopped playing in the first place, how time apart helped them grow, and why these upcoming shows might be the setlist of their dreams. This interview has been edited for clarity.

Daniel Rossen: I wouldn't say there was a formal conversation, but there was an understanding—and definitely exhaustion. It's hard to condense into a short summary. By the end of the tour cycle for Painted Ruins, we had grown apart in a lot of ways. Everybody needed time to pursue their own lives. There was never a formal decision that we would never make music again. But at our best moments, I think the band was this balance between an idealistic, writerly, personal pursuit, and this collective soundcraft thing we had going at the high period of the band. It was really hard to keep that balance over the long run. Towards the end, it became difficult to keep morale up, everybody engaged, and a feeling of equal participation in a satisfying way while still functioning. Not a bad run though, huh? It was what, 2005 through 2019? Not bad at all.

Chris Taylor: A band is a collective effort: if everybody isn't totally on board, it doesn't work. You can't force people to do this job because it's disruptive to what would otherwise be a normal human existence. It's pretty strange to constantly travel around and play concerts for people; you're living on a bus for 15 years or something.

Indefinite means indefinite, but I think we all assumed it wasn't gonna happen again. We just didn't want to pretend to quit and then surprise you by coming back real quick. I've seen bands do that move. It was a matter of time and all of us individually having space, being back in our respective homes, and turning the lights on. After a while, it felt like it could actually be interesting, talks resumed, and it suddenly rose out of the ashes.

Taylor: I've been in full-time producing mode, booking out the calendar, because I haven't been on tour. Five LPs that I produced came out in the past six months or so. As a producer, I try to cultivate artists' best facilities and get them primed to create, to feel great. You can tell by how they react to a suggestion how you should support them in the studio. I also just finished a little six-song solo EP that I'll put out in a month or something. I haven't released solo music in like 14 years or some regrettably long amount of time.

I was just thinking about this the other day: it's always been this way, where getting to make music with my band really is the best version of me. So I'm always working on music and wondering how I would apply it to Grizzly Bear material, even if there's no plan for us to ever record again. Anything I do, even producing other artists, I want to take tricks and bring them back to the band. I guess it's just my home base, my musical family.

Rossen: It's funny: I've always made music, but I live in Santa Fe and feel isolated from the music world generally, so I tend to think of it as a hobbyist activity now. It doesn't feel like a pursuit in that same way. That Hannah Frances album [Nested in Tangles] is an interesting one, in how it came together. She came to one of my solo shows in Philadelphia to help sell my merch, and afterwards she gave me a copy of her record Keeper of the Shepherd. You never know what you're going to hear when someone hands you their album, but as I drove to my next gig I thought, My God, she has a real voice. When she sent me her new music and invited me to collaborate, it seemed fun to try to help her realize it, because her music has some kinship with work I've done in the past.

I'm just trying to keep going though. That's how everybody feels, I think: you don't wanna stop, in part because I don't know what else I would do. The solo album was an experience I poured myself into and then it drifted away afterwards. It was hard to promote, obviously, because it's a dark record, very internal, and not easy to get across to people. After I poured myself into that, I felt like music became something I did in my personal life. Maybe it's just the state of my music interest, where I am in my life in my 40s, and the way tastes have shifted, but it's hard for it to feel like a primary pursuit anymore, even though it's obviously central to who I am.

Rossen: That was really fun to work on actually! The director was very familiar with our whole catalog, so there were no surprises with him. It was an open, riffing exchange making the whole film; a lot of quick, interplay ideas is my favorite way to do that type of work. I think the reason he reached out to me is because he liked the idea of my music opening up the interior world of these characters while the film itself is a bunch of bros being awful to each other. I loved working on that film. There's a scene where the director asked me to score over this awful pop song called “Glad You Came.” He said, “Why don't you do this like you did that Jojo cover: just make a verse, score over it, and we'll try to use it.” It was a very fun back-and-forth exchange working on the film like that.

Rossen: I've heard some of those bands and think it's nice. Hannah Frances is also in that type of lineage, I think. The last couple years, there's just been a lot of great music, regardless of whether it relates back to that more baroque pop influence of ours in a post-freak-folk era. I've just been enjoying being at this stage of my life where I can reapproach the music that's happening now as a consumer and just enjoy it. The last couple years have been great. Obviously the Cindy Lee record was insane; I had a whole phase with that, like many people did. There's this Warp artist Clarissa Connelly whose album was really pretty, kinda weird, and wildly singular, like Metallica but played very slowly with acoustic instruments. I really enjoyed that Chanel Beads record record, the new Bad Bunny, Cameron Winter of course, and that Chicago band Lifeguard. Those kids are so talented. I saw them in a little club in Kingston, New York, which was so fun.

Taylor: Maybe it's counterintuitive, but I don't follow indie rock closely. It was never my genre of choice to listen to. So I'm unfamiliar with those bands, but I can speak to what it's like incorporating bells and whistles to your music or punching up the arrangements. It's important not to focus on the instruments themselves as adding complexity.

For example, I'm a saxophone player and several people have asked me to play a rock sax solo on their songs. Now, I don't play saxophone like Clarence Clemens from the E Street Band. People ask from this place of thinking it's just a cool thing to add. It's like adding a lucky rabbit foot to your song as opposed to asking if it serves an emotive purpose. Why choose that instrument or this arrangement? It's a form of overdressing when a good t-shirt and pair of jeans look great. This probably sounds funny coming from me because we add a lot to our music, but we removed what isn't essential or doesn't further the song. The goal isn't to be superfluous with production ideas or arrangements, but to be intentional with what we're conveying and how we do it. Study the greats and learn from them: those amazing Brazilian records, the Beach Boys, Scott Walker, all these masters of recording and arranging.

Taylor: I don't know if it was any one moment rather than everyone picking up the project individually on their own. Not to overstate the obvious, but you have four sovereign individuals, and spending this much time together doing something is weirdly tough—tougher than you'd think. From the outside, you wonder why wouldn't a musician want to be in a band? It turns out it's complicated for most folks, or at least the three guys in my band. I've always thought it's the coolest thing I could possibly do professionally. But I think for everyone else it's tough.

Rossen: We still have the same management team and booking agency, so requests to play festivals or stuff have popped up, but the answer was always no. To some degree, we got to a point where we have this whole catalog and it's been so long that we finally missed what it felt like to play with each other. With this new vantage point where three of us are parents and feel like elderly people, it seemed novel to come back. You can appreciate it in a different way than when you were younger and in the music industry. We stay in touch, but we lead such different lives now and haven't talked about music itself in a long time, or what each other is listening to, or thinking about musically. Getting back to that place took work. Even the rehearsals themselves are a starting point for us again, and I think that's what we needed: a starting point.

Taylor: Super special. We've been working hard and I think everyone's having fun being together again. It's very sweet. We're remembering, Oh yeah, this is why we loved doing this. There's hard times when you're in what's essentially a relationship for 20 years with many chapters: beautiful ones, exciting ones, hard ones, exhausting ones. So this has been very inspiring for me to remember how good it feels. It's also a trip to feel the songs come out of your body after years and years of not playing them, that dusting-off process.

Rossen: Sometimes we're rehearsing and I genuinely don't remember what happened at that point in the song, which is kind of disturbing? [laughs] Some of these songs are pretty hard to execute. But yeah, being together again in the same room doesn't feel that different. Well, except that a lot of the tension is gone because the pressure has lifted.

Taylor: It's also a relief because I've had this recurring nightmare for the past seven years where I'm at a festival and our band is supposed to play, but I can't find my bandmates, I lost my instruments, I don't know what stage we're on, and I don't remember the songs. I'm wandering around this festival while people are trying to hang out with me and I'm telling them I have to play a show but don't know where or how. Apparently that's Ed's recurring nightmare, too. [laughs] We have the same panic dream. We've both run into each other in our stress nightmares at the festival grounds, too.

Rossen: We haven't really discussed that yet. I wouldn't count it out. Honestly, this is just a lot of material to go through in a short amount of time, what with us doing five shows in New York. So we're trying to relearn as many songs as we can in this short window. There's not really much room for any other discussion.

Taylor: I've always been the excited one who wants to make more music; I can't help it. I wish I could bring it to the band, but I don't know if that's an outlet anymore. You can't tell grown men what to do [laughs] so I'll just keep storing it away. There's no plans to make a record just yet. We're seeing how these shows go, how everybody feels up onstage, and enjoying the act of being a band again.

Taylor: For sure. We've been forced to review the old records and watch live videos just to relearn our songs. We haven't listened to our music in many, many years. While dusting off this very old material, you can hear us as these young, excited kids; I can actually hear that excitement. I have the privilege of having been around for every single recorded second of our catalog as the producer, as I'm usually the recording engineer, so there's also this feeling of entering a tunnel of kaleidoscopic memory. I hear all these elements and remember tidbits of past memories and experiences. It's a lot to process because it runs the gamut.

Rossen: There's different songwriting teams in the band, and we were often lost in our own little worlds back then, whatever it was we were going through. So it's nice to come back now and hear Ed's songs in a much different light. There's ones I didn't think about much at the time because I wasn't the one immersed in it, but now I can hear this emotion in it in new ways and appreciate it more. That's a special feeling as a bandmate. Similarly, there's songs in the catalog that have my thumbprint and I'm staring at them thinking, Well, that wasn't very good. [laughs] Some ideas didn't hit the way you thought they would.

Taylor: Oh for sure. We're learning many, many songs. We're planning on switching the set for every night. So, for example, those five nights at Brooklyn Steel? We're playing a different set each night.

Rossen: There will be a core of, what, 10 songs or so that we'll probably do each night? But yeah, we're trying to balance the songs that we assume are the popular ones or algorithmically favorite songs, coupled with more obscure songs that we maybe wouldn't have touched at the time. That's been fun to do. I'm hoping we get as many of those deep cuts in there as we can, dig out the stranger songs, mix them into the set.

Rossen: I always loved shifting between different roles and putting on hats. I could be supportive in certain ways. I can be the guitar player and sing the song because it's my tune, and then move into a different role to support someone else's song. Getting to shift modes is really enjoyable, especially live. I think it suits my personality because I don't like to be the center of attention. That's not me. It's funny though; seven years passed, we get back in the room again, and it doesn't really feel all that different. It's like old times, except now we're adults, so we're not expressing our primary emotions in bizarre ways that are unhelpful to one another. [laughs]

Taylor: My favorite thing to do in all of the music-making things that I do is play instruments. And there's nobody in the world who I love playing music with more than my bandmates. It's everything for me. I love producing and recording, but what I'm really here to do is play – and with these guys in particular. I've loved playing bass or woodwinds and singing on these albums I've been producing, but it's not the same. These guys? We just share so much: the history, the references, the appreciation, the things we understand about each other that get us stoked. There's a shared history between us that makes it all the more meaningful to play together. I've missed it so much.

	Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize on Friday morning, a blow to President Donald Trump, who has been heavily campaigning to receive the honor. The Norwegian Nobel Committee said Machado was given the prize for “her tireless work promoting democratic rights for the people of Venezuela and for her struggle to achieve a just and peaceful transition from dictatorship to democracy.”


	During the ceremony in Oslo, Norwegian Nobel committee chair Jørgen Watne Frydnes praised Machado as a “brave and committed champion of peace” who “keeps the flame of democracy burning during a growing darkness.” 


	“This is precisely what lies at the heart of democracy, our shared willingness to defend the principles of popular rule, even though we disagree,” Frydnes said. “At a time when democracy is under threat, it is more important than ever to defend this common ground.”

	Machado has been working tirelessly as a politician in Venezuela for decades, and is known for fighting for free elections. She has lived in hiding for the past year due to threats against her life. The committee noted, “When authoritarians seize power, it is crucial to recognize courageous defenders of freedom who rise and resist.”

	











	She responded to the honor in a video shared posted to the X account owned by Edmundo González, who replaced her as the presidential candidate when she was barred from running. In the video, Machado tells González on speaker phone that she is in “shock” over the announcement. “We're shocked with joy,” replies González, who is currently in exile. Machado adds, “What is this? I can't believe it.”

	During this morning's announcement, a reporter asked Frydnes about Trump's demand to receive the award himself. Frydnes said the committee receives thousands of campaign and nomination letters every year, adding that they make the final decision in a room “filled with both courage and integrity.” He said they decide based on “work and the will of Alfred Nobel.”

	Trump has been outspoken about believing he deserves the Nobel Peace Prize. Even as he sets the military on his own citizens and brutalizes migrant communities, he has seized on the recent ceasefire between Israel and Hamas to crown himself a peacemaker. At the White House on Thursday, Trump told reporters that he had “made seven deals and now it's eight.” The assertion was a variation on the president's recent claims that during his current nine months in office, he “ended” seven wars. 


	“[I] solved the wars, one going 31 years, one going 34 years, one going 35 years, one going ten years. I made seven deals. This would be number eight,” he said Thursday, adding that former President Barack Obama had received the prize, “For doing nothing. Didn't even know what he got it for. … My election was a much more important election.” 


	At the UN General Assembly last month, the president said that “everyone says that I should get the Nobel Peace Prize.”


	Many of Trump's supporters campaigned for the president to be the next recipient of the prize. “Give [Trump] the Nobel Peace Prize – he deserves it!,” the office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu wrote on X. The official White House X account posted a photo of Trump with the caption “THE PEACE PRESIDENT.”


	The Trump administration has notably been attacking Venezuelan citizens in recent months. The president has been using false information to justify military strikes on alleged drug-trafficking boats in the Caribbean near the country. After destroying on of these boats, Trump shared an impossible claim on Truth Social, writing, “A boat loaded with enough drugs to kill 25 TO 50 THOUSAND PEOPLE was stopped, early this morning off the Coast of Venezuela, from entering American Territory.”

	Trump has yet to respond to the announcement from the Norwegian Nobel Committee. As recently as five hours before the ceremony, the president was sharing links on Truth Social promoting himself for the win. 


	The Nobel Peace Prize can be given to an individual or an organization. Last year, the Japanese atomic bomb survivor movement Nihon Hidankyo won the prize. Past winners include Nelson Mandela, Chinese rights activist Liu Xiaobo, the EU, and the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons.

	Jackie and her kids had been missing for four days. 


	When Mimi Lettunich, a family friend with powerful social connections in Portland, Oregon, learned of their disappearance, she spared no effort to locate the immigrant mother and her four U.S. citizen children. 


	It would take another eight days — and an unorthodox road trip by a hands-on member of Congress — before the Trump administration would even disclose where it was holding the family. And it would be four days after that before the children were released to Lettunich and set free from conditions likened in a congressional hearing to “psychological torture.”


	The story of Jackie Merlos is singular and conscience-shocking. “They literally disappeared her — kept her from due process in the presence of her four U.S. citizen children,” Rep. Maxine Dexter, who serves Portland in Congress, tells Rolling Stone. But her experience is also emblematic of the full-throttle mass-deportation machinery put into motion by the Trump administration. “Our government is kidnapping people,” Dexter says, “and holding them in incredibly inhumane situations.”

	











	The Merlos family nightmare began, ironically, with a hug, at Peace Arch Park.


	Kenia Jackeline “Jackie” Merlos is the mother of four children under the age of 10. Although she arrived undocumented from Honduras more than two decades ago, Jackie was a model non-citizen, with a pending U-visa, a work permit, and no criminal record. She and her husband Carlos own a small business in Portland. Jackie had been the worship director in her church. 

	











	For the Merlos family, early summer was a season of reunion: Jackie's parents had flown to the United States on valid tourist visas. With her mom, Juana, and her four kids, Jackie drove from Portland to the U.S.-Canada border for the afternoon of June 28 to have a picnic with Jackie's sister, Flor, and her family, legal residents of Canada.


	Peace Arch Park sits astride the border, near Vancouver. Maintained by both British Columbia and Washington state, the park doesn't have a clearly delineated boundary between the two countries, and it has long functioned as a neutral space for cross-border reunions and international exchange. (During the pandemic, cross-border lovers canoodled in the park without attending to international quarantine controls.)

	The Merlos family picnic took a devastating turn when Flor was giving goodbye hugs to her relatives. The family was intercepted by Customs and Border Patrol agents, who claimed Flor had crossed illegally into the United States. The CPB agents took the whole clan into custody. A spokesperson for CBP told Rolling Stone in a statement that its agents “arrested Kenia Jackeline Merlos at Peace Arch Park as she attempted to smuggle illegal aliens into the United States.”To Jackie's advocates, this notion is nonsense. Jackie's father and her husband, Carlos, had remained in Portland because there wasn't room in the family car for more passengers. “If you're smuggling somebody, you're certainly not bringing your four young children and your elderly mother,” Lettunich tells Rolling Stone. 


	The government never brought smuggling charges against anyone. Flor and her kids were soon released back to Canada. Jackie's mother Juana, despite her tourist visa, was transferred to an Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention facility. But Jackie and her four children disappeared into off-the-grid federal custody, while the Trump administration attempted to speed-run their removal from the United States. 


	The family remained hidden from friends, a lawyer hired on their behalf, and even Rep. Dexter, who made it a mission to physically track down her missing constituents. In the meantime, Carlos, the children's father, was also seized and detained by ICE. This story has been pieced together from congressional and court documents, interviews with Dexter and Lettunich, as well as comment from CPB.

	The mistreatment of the Merlos family — and in particular the citizen children — offers context for why the ICE building in Portland has become a hotspot of local protest, and a focal point for Donald Trump's militarized crackdown on dissent.


	At a moment when anti-immigrant hysteria affects the highest levels of our national government, likely hundreds if not thousands of similar stories are unfolding outside of public scrutiny, as law abiding immigrants and even their citizen children are being torn from the fabric of their communities and unjustly exiled from America. 

	











Mimi Lettunich runs a creative agency and lives in a wooded, modernist home in Portland's prosperous West Hills, where she invited Rolling Stone for an interview in late September. She had known Jackie and Carlos for nearly 20 years; the couple's firm had done work on a remodel of Lettunich's home, and the two women became fast friends. “Jackie and I are like sisters,” she says.


	When Jackie and her children were first detained, Lettunich had been out of town attending to a death in the family. She returned home July 2 to news that her friends were missing. “I talked to Carlos that evening,” Lettunich recalls. For the Merlos family, the nightmare was about to widen. “By the next morning he was taken,” she says of Carlos, by federal immigration agents.


	The following days, encompassing the 4th of July holiday, were a blur. “We started calling everybody we could. We got an attorney. We got some national groups involved. And we started navigating the chaos of the immigration system,” Lettunich says. “Make a phone call. Somebody tells you to call somebody else. You call — it's a dead end. It's very challenging. I feel horrible for people that don't have other resources,” she says. “How they're finding their loved ones has gotta be just a nightmare.”


	The days ticked by. Jackie and her children didn't turn up through any of the online locator tools maintained by the Department of Homeland Security. Lettunich reached out to Rep. Dexter through a mutual friend to see if the congresswoman — newly elected in 2024 — could help. 


	Dexter was all in. The freshman legislator is a medical doctor who has carved out a lane in Congress fighting for the due process rights of immigrants. Earlier this year she joined a congressional delegation that traveled to El Salvador demanding the release of Kilmar Abrego Garcia from that nation's foul gulag.


	But even a member of Congress couldn't get a straight answer from the Trump administration. “Nothing from CBP or ICE was helpful,” Dexter tells Rolling Stone. “They're like, ‘We don't know where they are. Maybe they're in Blaine or Ferndale,'” she says, naming Washington state cities with immigrant detention facilities. 


	On Thursday, July 10, Dexter decided to take matters into her own hands. “Carrie, my chief, and I just got in the car, and we're like, ‘We're gonna go try to find them.'” As the congresswoman headed north, she and her staff were still gathering information, and leading a loose caravan up the interstate. “Mimi was a couple hours behind us.” 

	











	Dexter zeroed in on CPB lockups, because few ICE centers can hold children and they're not supposed to hold U.S. citizens. By policy, CPB facilities are only supposed to hold detainees for 12 hours. “But it's not illegal to do longer than that,” Dexter says. “And because Jackie was refusing to separate from her children, they couldn't send her to an ICE facility. So they were caught in this sort of no man's land, literally, near the border.”


	Late in that afternoon, Dexter and her crew pulled up at the CPB facility in Ferndale, outside Bellingham, Washington, well north of Seattle. “We literally rang the bell. I said, ‘I'm Congresswoman Maxine Dexter. I'm here looking for a family.” The representative was told she'd have to wait for the arrival of the facility supervisor. Dexter persisted: “Can you just tell us if we're in the right place? And he was like, ‘Yes, you are.'”


	“That's the first time somebody was recognizing that they had custody of these kids and their mom,” she says.


	Dexter alone was allowed to enter the lockup, without her phone, to see where her constituents were jailed. “It's a windowless cell to the outside,” she recalls. “But there's a soundproof glass window that the guards can look through. There's no privacy at all. The lights go on and off all night long.” The cell had a toilet, a “tiny sink,” and a cement bench. “They were the only people at this detention facility. They don't have food facilities, they don't have shower facilities. It is not meant for long term detention.” The conditions looked dismal: “There were a few mats on the floor and a couple blankets,” Dexter says. “They had been there 12 days at that point.”


	The member of Congress wasn't allowed to communicate with Jackie. She could only wave, as the mother sat on the floor with her children, praying. “Jackie had no idea who I was, or that we were trying to help her. She didn't know if her family knew where they were. This is happening on our watch,” Dexter says. “With our taxpayer dollars.”


	Attempting to talk sense into the officials in the scene, Dexter objected to the jailing of the Merlos children, insisting: “They didn't do anything wrong. You can't just detain them.” The officials countered that Jackie wouldn't let herself be separated. “Would you?” Dexter shot back. “You don't know if you'll ever get to see your kids again.”

	











	“I'm a mother,” she tells Rolling Stone during an interview from her district office in a federal building in Portland. “I wouldn't agree to have my kids removed from me either.”


Locating Jackie and the children didn't end the drama. Federal authorities were still attempting to rush the family out of the country. Dexter had arrived on a Thursday, and stayed overnight in a hotel. The next day she presented again at the facility with Jackie's attorney. But the family was already being moved around by federal authorities, who were pressing forward with a plan to remove Jackie and the kids from the country. “They put them in a van and went to Portland to go try to find the paperwork that they needed to get them passports,” Dexter says. 


	The government claimed that Jackie had signed an order for voluntary removal — but would not produce that paperwork, even for Dexter. The children didn't have passports, and to obtain them the government needed their father's consent. Jackie's team soon learned the government had taken pictures of the children to the ICE detention center in Tacoma where Carlos was being held, and had him sign documents verifying these were his offspring. “They showed him photos of each of his kids, and said, ‘Is this your child? Yes? Sign this form,'” says Dexter. “It was the form to get them passports.”


	For Jakie's advocates, it was time to pull out all the stops. Dexter dressed down the Congressional Affairs liaison for CBP, warning him that effectuating the involuntary removal of four American citizens would be an “enormous illegal maneuver, and I, as a member of Congress, will not stand silent on that.” Simultaneously, Jackie's lawyer filed a request for a temporary restraining order in federal court to block Jackie and her children from leaving the country. 


	That restraining order came through Monday morning, with the judge detailing that Jackie had been “serially re-located and denied contact with counsel” in ruling to block her removal from the court's jurisdiction. The order went into effect just hours before the Merlos family were scheduled to board a flight.


	Only when its hands were tied by the court did the government move to release Jackie's kids. “I got a call the day we got the TRO,” Lettunich recalls. “They say, ‘We have the Merlos children. Would you like to come get them?” It was the first time the idea had been floated, and suddenly the government was behaving, Lettunich says, as if the children had just wrapped up a play date. “Come get them.” Lettunich rushed to the pickup at SeaTac airport. ”I still didn't get to see Jackie, but we picked up four children — with four new passports.”

	











Rolling Stone reached out to the Department of Homeland Security with a detailed list of questions about the Merlos family's experience. A CPB spokesperson responded with a brief emailed statement about Jackie: “At her request, her children initially remained with her in CBP custody. She is now in ICE custody, and formal removal proceedings are underway.” The statement adds: “For clarity, DHS does not deport U.S. citizens. In cases involving minors, parents are given the choice to accompany their children during removal proceedings, or alternatively, to have the children placed with a designated guardian of the parent's choosing.”


	In the car with Lettunich, the kids revealed a secret. “Mimi, Mom wrote you a note.” One of the children had left the facility with a coloring book provided by the feds. On the first page was a handwritten note to Lettunich offering thanks and parenting pointers — asking that the kids be careful near the swimming pool and noting an upcoming orthodontist appointment. “I will miss my babies. Please take care of them. This is so hard,” Jackie wrote, adding: “We are on God's hand.”


	Lettunich and her husband were aspiring empty nesters. “I have two boys. They're both drinking age,” she says. In her mid 50s, Lettunich has now been vaulted back into caregiving for nine-year-old triplets — two boys and a girl — and one younger brother, seven. The children share a bedroom, and have the run of the lower floor of the Lettunich home, which has a basketball hoop and a life-size sculpture of a bull by the covered pool.


	Debriefing the children from the traumatic experience of their incarceration, Lettunich learned that they had been questioned by federal agents, away from their mother. She testified to this in an unsworn “shadow” congressional hearing held by Democrats in Washington D.C.  in mid-September. Lettunich denounced “the state sponsored abuse the children endured.” As she described it, “Agents interrogated the children without Jackie. They were asked: Where did they live? Did they have any money? Did they have relatives? Did they have a father? Shortly thereafter, ICE took their dad,” Lettunich said. “The children believed that was their fault.”


	Jackie is now being held in an ICE facility where she can be reached by phone and is an active part of the children's parenting. “They talk every day,” says Lettunich. The Merlos children, she says, “are strong, really, smart, confident kids, which is a tribute to how they've been raised. That said,” she adds, “they're in trauma. They're seeing a psychologist. A couple of them have night constant nightmares.”The four children have their clothes and possessions organized in a tidy series of bins with their names on them, spaced throughout their bedroom, and on shelves in the closet. Attached to a mirror are family photos of the Merlos children from the before times, clinging affectionately to their parents. 

	











	Here is also taped a handwritten note from Jackie to her children, in Spanish, decorated with an array of small pink hearts. “Pardon me for not being there,” it reads, promising the children that she is saving up all the hugs and little kisses she has not been able to give them directly. “What's happening to us won't last a lifetime,” Jackie adds. “I only ask, my children, that you be patient and that we trust in God that the best is yet to come.”


	Jackie has so far been denied release, and her next court date is October 14. After weeks in detention, her mother, Juana, was finally set free in late September, telling The Oregonian: “I'm so traumatized that I have nightmares that I'm still there.” As detailed on the family's Go Fund Me page, Carlos lost his own hearing in early October. Lettunich tells Rolling Stone he was deported to Honduras on October 7. “It's hard to be optimistic,” she admits.


	Dexter holds up the Merlos family story against the promises of Trump and his administration to to target violent offenders and drug dealers for deportation. “This story is so egregious and so cruel — and so clearly not what the American people thought Donald Trump was going to be doing,” she says. “He said he was going after the ‘worst of the worst' — and cleaning up crime and getting fentanyl out of our communities.”

	By contrast, she says, “These folks are tax-paying, law-abiding Christians — employing community members and sending their kids to Christian school. There's nothing about them that our community wants to have removed — and yet this is who they are pursuing and won't let out.“


	She insists the administration is abusing other families like Jackie's, who don't have the resources or the family connections to make their stories heard. And she says the administration is using the machinery of mass deportation to keep millions more on edge — carrying their passports and green cards at all times because they are frightened that they could be snatched off the street.“You don't use fear to control people,” Dexter says, “unless you have nefarious goals.”

No Doubt is Vegas bound. Gwen Stefani will reunite with her band for six shows at the Sphere in Las Vegas, according to multiple reports. 


	The short run will kick off May 6, with five more shows scheduled through the month, wrapping May 16. Additional gigs will take place May 8, 19, 13, and 15. Presale for all shows will start Oct. 15 at 10 a.m. PT, with all tickets going on sale Oct. 17 at 10 a.m. PT. Full info is available on No Doubt's website, where fans can also sign up now for the artist presale. 

A post shared by No Doubt (@nodoubt)


	Since opening in 2023, the 17,600-seat arena has featured performances from U2, Dead & Company, the Eagles, the Backstreet Boys, and more. Stefani will be the first woman to headline the iconic venue.


	“The opportunity to create a show at Sphere excites me in a new way,” Stefani said in a statement. “The venue is unique and modern and it opens up a whole new visual palette for us to be creative. Doing it with No Doubt feels like going back in time to relive our history, while also creating something new in a way we never could have imagined.”

	











	After splitting in 2015, No Doubt have only reunited twice. In January, the Orange County natives performed at FireAid in Los Angeles, opening with their massive 1995 hit “Just a Girl,” and following it with a performance of “Don't Speak” and their traditional set closer “Spiderwebs.” The benefit raised funds for victims of the devastating Pacific Palisades fire.

	Last year, No Doubt took the stage for the first time in over a decade to perform a special set at Coachella and were joined by Olivia Rodrigo. They haven't released an album of new material since 2012's Push and Shove, which Stefani previously discussed during an interview with Fault magazine in 2023.


	“I feel that record was where No Doubt was most confused,” the frontwoman said at the time. “We just had come back together, and we wanted to do it so badly, but for me, I was completely depleted from my world tour and giving birth. So many things had happened and then we tried to write that record…When you work with No Doubt, it's almost like you have to have somebody that's just there to make everybody happy so that everybody can have their little piece. It was a lot. That was a struggle, that record. But I'm happy that someone listened to it.”

Madison Beer has dropped a new single, “Bittersweet.” The pensive track follows her recent release “Yes, Baby,” which she shared in September. 


	“Now that it's over, you blame it all on me,” she croons on the song. “I know I should be bitter, but baby/Right now I'm bittersweet/ I'm getting over what you put me through/And I'd say I'm done crying, but baby/I don't lie like you do.”


	“'Bittersweet' is about the end of a chapter and the difficulty of coming to terms with it, while also recognizing that deep down you know it's for the best — and finding peace in that along the journey,” Beer explained in a statement.


	“Yes, Baby” and “Bittersweet” mark Beer's return to music in 2025. Prior to the new songs, her last single, “15 Minutes,” dropped in July 2024. Several months prior to that, in February, she released “Make You Mine,” which would go on to earn a Grammy nomination for Best Dance Pop Recording earlier this year. (The song ultimately lost out to Charli XCX's “Von Dutch.”)

	 A press release for “Yes Baby” said more music from Beer would be arriving “sooner than you think,” suggesting the singles may mark the start of a new album cycle. Beer's most recent LP, Silence Between Songs, was released in 2023, and she spent much of last year on her “Spinnin Tour” in support of the album.


	The singer is set to perform at the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show in New York City on Oct. 15. The performance will stream on Prime Video and Amazon Live for U.S. audiences and globally on Victoria's Secret's YouTube, TikTok, and Instagram accounts.

Sombr fulfilled a childhood dream during his sold-out hometown show at New York's Pier 17 on Thursday, Oct. 9. The 20-year-old musician welcomed special guest Sam Smith to the stage to perform the In the Lonely Hour single “I'm Not the Only One.” The duet brought Sombr together with an artist who unknowingly played a significant role in his career.


	“This is me when I was 14 years old, I was singing your song,” Sombr told Smith, playing them a video of an early “I'm Not the Only One” cover. “All I wanted to do is be like you.”

	For a while, Sam Smith will be calling New York home, too. This week, they performed the first night in their 24-date To Be Free Residency at Brooklyn's historic venue, Warsaw. Initially planned for 12 dates, the run is now scheduled to extend through December.


	Smith performed “I'm Not the Only One” during the encore segment on opening night of the residency. They also packed their setlist with covers of Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, Simon & Garfunkel, and the Magnetic Fields of Love. From their own extensive discography, Smith performed “To Be Free,” “I've Told You Now,” “To Die For,” “Palace,” “Dancing With a Stranger,” and more.

Regardless of how you feel about the potential for alien life somewhere out there in the universe, UFO sightings are often difficult to substantiate with real evidence. They tend to be fleeting and isolated incidents that can't be corroborated by third parties. That's not the case for the sightings below, which were witnessed by multiple people and frequently documented in local newspapers. 

On the evening of March 13, 1997, people throughout Arizona, New Mexico, and Nevada witnessed something that would come to be one of the most famous UFO incidents of all time. Around 8 p.m., reports began trickling in of an enormous V-shape in the sky. Made up of seven glowing orbs, this shape was gliding in a north-south direction so slowly that it was difficult to tell if it was moving at all. Then, it disappeared. Half an hour later, there was another strange sight in the sky—this time, a single line of orbs hovering in place and then also vanishing.

One 1997 poll found that up to 10 percent of Arizonans claimed to have witnessed the lights—ranging from police officers, families, air-traffic controllers, and even the governor of Arizona himself (though he didn't admit this until several years after the incident). Actor Kurt Russell was flying a personal aircraft into Phoenix with his stepson at the time, and he was allegedly one of the first pilots to report the lights.

Unlike most other UFO sightings, the Phoenix Lights have an official explanation—the first set of orbs was a formation of planes, and the second a set of flares dropped during a training program—but almost 30 years later, some still don't buy it. 

Add Mental Floss as a preferred news source!

Outside the small town of Ruwa, Zimbabwe, a group of around 60 children made international news when they claimed to see a UFO and its passengers during a brief recess from class. Adults were in a faculty meeting when students of the Ariel School reportedly saw a silvery disc flying over a field near their playground on September 16, 1994.

According to interviews with the children conducted by both a UFO expert and a Harvard professor, the kids watched the disc land and saw aliens emerge from it. The creatures were waxy-skinned and child-sized, with bulbous eyes but otherwise small features. They wore shiny black suits and had long, dark hair, and communicated telepathically to the students, warning them: “Pollution mustn't be.” Others in Zimbabwe and the neighboring countries of South Africa and Zambia also reported seeing bizarre streaking objects in the sky in the days preceding and following the Ariel School incident.

Some have called this a case of mass hysteria rather than a genuine UFO sighting, saying the group interview tactics employed by investigators on the scene allowed students to feed off one another and align their versions of events. Despite longtime scrutiny, however, many of the students have stuck to their stories even well into adulthood.

Three hundred miles southeast of Moscow in Voronezh, Russia, a trip to the local park turned into something beyond explanation for several dozen people. On September 27, 1989, some children and their parents witnessed a glowing disc-shaped craft hover and then land in a small park outside the city. The craft opened and several beings disembarked—they were over 9 feet tall, had green skin and three eyes, wore shiny metallic suits, and were escorted by some kind of robot. They seemed to survey the area, and some reports allege that the aliens shot one of the children with a beam, causing him to temporarily disappear.

Soviet media covered the ensuing investigation extensively, revealing that the spaceship had allegedly left a mark on the ground where it had landed along with trace amounts of radiation in the area. Some of the child witnesses drew what they had seen, and many believers point to similarities across these images as proof that the sighting was genuine. 

Ann Arbor, Michigan, experienced a series of mass UFO sightings in March of 1966 that still have people talking to this day. Starting at around 4 a.m. on March 14, multiple UFOs were reported to police from all over town. Soon enough, it was confirmed that two other police departments along with the nearby Selfridge Air National Guard Base had also received reports. Even across the border in Ohio, people had seen the same thing: several “disc-shaped” objects with red and green lights, swinging back and forth in the sky for around two hours before vanishing. The reports were so numerous that the Civil Defense as well as the U.S. Air Force immediately began investigating. 

Three days later, more strange objects were spotted in the air by a police sergeant, and three days after that came another mass sighting that is perhaps the most infamous of the series. On that day, March 20, a farmer and his adult son saw a strange light flying towards their farm. As it got closer, the farmer noticed it was oval-shaped with a “waffled” pattern on the exterior, and then it lowered into the woods a distance away.

The farmer and his son located the landing site and saw what they later described as a car-sized ship with a cone-shaped top, outfitted with lights bright enough to light up the whole forest. The two men reported that the ship began disappearing and reappearing around the woods, almost glitching in and out of existence, before it took off into the sky at incredible speed. The following night, a similar craft was reported at a nearby college. Cops, staff, students, and the director of civil defense all watched the ship hover and lower over the college for hours before it vanished, marking the end of the series of bizarre sightings over the area. 

Officials ultimately blamed “swamp gas” in the area for what had been seen—an explanation that was so widely derided even at the time that it's now become synonymous with UFOs and government skepticism. In conversation with the Ann Arbor News 30 years after the string of sightings, former Washtenaw sheriff Douglas Harvey recalled a conversation he had with the Civil Defense-appointed astronomer tasked with investigating the reports at the time, J. Allen Hyneck.

“Dr. Hynek in the car said, ‘There is something. We just can't put our finger on it. We've been investigating this for quite a while.' ” Back at Sheriff Harvey's office, he says, Hynek received a phone call that lasted for quite some time. “He came out and I said, ‘Well, Dr. Hynek. What do you think?' He said, ‘It's swamp gas.' He tells me one minute he has no idea what it is. And then he makes one phone call to Washington and comes out and gives a statement that it's swamp gas. Very strange.” The swamp gas story, according to some, also doesn't explain the presence of high levels of radiation and boron at both of the latter two sighting locations, making this an intriguing case for UFOlogists even now.

On October 27, 1954, 10,000 fans were watching a football match in Fiorentina's Stadio Artemio Franchi outside Florence, Italy, site of the World Cup 20 years prior, when they saw something inexplicable. It was just after half-time during a game between the stadium's home Fiorentina club and their local rival, the Pistoiese club, when suddenly players stopped playing and started pointing to the sky.

For 15 minutes, players and patrons alike watched as an unidentified aircraft hovered above the stadium, moving slowly. Some say it was egg-like, while others describe it as more cigar-shaped or even as multiple objects rather than just one. As the object passed overhead, a silvery substance rained down from the sky—sticky, similar to cotton wool or cobwebs, and extremely delicate. It quickly coated the stadium along with residential houses nearby, but disintegrated nearly immediately. Samples taken of the substance came back from the lab as containing boron, silicon, calcium, and magnesium. 

Some have hypothesized that the sighting and raining substance could be misidentified spider silk from migrating spiders. While October is within the migrating range of Northern Hemisphere spiders, many refute this explanation, pointing out that spider silk is made of proteins that would have been identifiable via lab work and doesn't contain the elements found in the substance. Many of the players in the match insist to this day that they saw something extraterrestrial. 

Yet another school witnessed an unidentified object in the sky all the way back in 1966 in what has been nicknamed “Australia's Roswell.” Around 11 a.m., just after recess was called, many saw a metallic flying disc in the sky over Westall High School, just southwest of Melbourne. The saucer-like object was larger than a car; it flew across the sky and then descended towards a wooded area known locally as The Grange, briefly landed, then darted back into the sky and away at impossible speeds. The object was reportedly so clear that nearly all witnesses described the same features, and many immediately refuted the notion that it could be a misidentified weather balloon. The sighting was so shocking and bizarre, in fact, that one young girl supposedly fainted from fear.

As soon as the craft was gone, some of the students ran to the landing site and were amazed to find an oval burn mark in the grass. Some say that the students were interviewed by the men in black at the scene, while others say they saw military personnel in the area soon after the sighting.

In total, over 200 students, faculty, and residents witnessed the event. There's significant belief in some kind of government cover-up at play, with one retired schoolteacher who witnessed the UFO claiming he was visited by officers of the Australian Air Force who threatened his job if he spoke out about what he had seen. Surviving student witnesses still gather each year at the crash site, frustrated that the Australian government has yet to recognize the sighting or offer an official explanation of what happened on that day over 50 years ago. 

In January of 2008, residents of Stephenville, Texas, reported seeing a large, triangular object lined with bright lights flying low in the sky. According to witnesses, it was silent, moved quickly, and vanished without a trace. Several of those who caught a glimpse say they also witnessed two military F-16 jets chase the object in hot pursuit. Once the Mutual UFO Network (MUFON) caught wind of the sighting and began to investigate, reports began flooding in by the dozens across town. 

The investigation turned to the local Naval Air Station, which adamantly refuted any involvement from any of its planes—but then flipped weeks later, claiming it had been performing routine training exercises in the area at the time of the sightings. Additional investigation into radar data corroborates the townspeople's experiences, and may also cast doubt onto the official explanation; radar detected not only two F-16s in the area and headed in the direction as was claimed, but also a third object in the air ahead of them lacking a transponder (something all military craft are outfitted with). The case remains mysterious.

On Labor Day of 1969, an entire Massachusetts county had a run-in with some kind of unknown craft, and some even claim to have been abducted. From Sheffield, to Great Barrington, to Stockbridge, many residents began noticing lights in the sky around 8 p.m. that night—bright, colorful orbs that performed in ways known aircraft didn't.

Accounts vary: Jane Green reportedly saw a large, bright object in the sky hovering over her car, while 9-year-old Thomas Reed claims to have been abducted that night. According to Reed, his family car was bathed in a bright light one moment and a mile away from their original location the next, with no recollection of most of the previous hour. (Reed claims he could remember some of the ship's futuristic interior, though.) The family sat through multiple interviews and even polygraphs, but their stories stayed consistent and no apparent deception was observed. 

One radio station got calls all evening of people reporting their various sightings. With anywhere from 40 to 250 eyewitnesses total, all across various locations, many find it difficult to easily write off the Berkshire UFO sightings as some kind of mass hysteria or hallucination, and many witnesses maintain their belief that something otherworldly visited them that night.

Reality TV can come in all shapes and sizes, and while many audiences are content with reality shows that create drama and romance, or seeing people compete for an ultimate prize, there are other genres worth exploring. In the world of scary reality TV, it has thrived by exploring the most accessible topics: the paranormal. Things that exist just beyond the explained remain interesting to viewers and can also deliver some genuine scares.

Paranormal reality shows that can leave a viewer with a skin-crawling sensation. Whether a viewer is a skeptic or a true believer, these series explore the ways in which paranormal experts and enthusiasts attempt to communicate with and understand spirits and the supernatural. Among the dozens of paranormal investigation TV shows available, HBO Max has one of the best collections of seemingly real encounters with the ghosts, demons, and supernatural creatures that bring nightmares to life.

Josh Gates, the host of Destination Truth, is an archaeologist who has dedicated his life to exploring the world and documenting his experience and observations in various ways. In this reality TV show, Gates would go to different parts of the world to investigate various paranormal legends, their origins, and attempt to have his own experiences at these locations. Some of the most iconic episodes include his visit to the infamous haunted forest in Japan, Aokigahara, in ""Aswang; Haunted Forest,"" Season 2, Episode 11, and an investigation concerning a goblin in Mexico in ""Haunted Forest; Alux,"" Season 3, Episode 1.

Gates' Destination Truth isn't a ghost hunting show exactly because the team investigates various paranormal myths throughout the world, but many episodes include spirits. Some of the episodes are creepy, delving into vivid detail about the legends of these creatures, which can be a bit scary for some viewers. However, even those who aren't easily spooked by mythology and ghost stories can find the expedition series entertaining and informative.

Ghost Brothers follows a group of friends, Dalen Spratt, Juwan Mass, and Marcus Harvey, who all had paranormal experiences as children and are now on the hunt to prove ghosts exist. Throughout the three seasons, they investigate some of the most haunted places in the country, such as the Magnolia Hotel in Season 1, Episode 5, and Winchester House in Season 2, Episode 3. It had two short-lived spin-offs, Ghost Brothers: Haunted Houseguests and Ghost Brothers: Lights Out.

By framing the show around two major questions-""Are ghosts real?"" and ""Why is everyone white?""-they strike a balance between traditional ghost reality shows and an important discussion about the structure and themes of previous series. Many Ghost Brothers fans prefer the team to many others, feeling they are more genuine than other paranormal investigations. The show has been praised for balancing eerie paranormal investigations and friendly, relatable banter.

In A Haunting, people tell about their real-life experiences with the paranormal, detail the encounter, how it influenced their lives, and how it continues to have an impact on them. Each episode focuses on individual experiences, using the stories of these people to recreate the ordeal with a dramatized re-enactment. These paranormal encounters include ghosts, demonic possessions, and chance encounters with the supernatural.

Though the creators of A Haunting don't hunt for ghosts themselves, they do engage with people who have claimed to have encounters with the paranormal, allowing their stories to be told. Those who had these experiences often sought the help of professionals, including ghost investigators and spiritual advisors. By dramatizing these narratives, the eleven seasons provide the viewers with dozens of eerie supernatural scenarios.

Ghost Adventures is an extensive ghost hunting series consisting of twenty-nine seasons of the paranormal investigators, led by Zak Bagans, exploring reported hauntings. Most episodes follow a similar formula, beginning with the story of the haunted location and the team visiting the site, followed by an investigation with the technology used to capture ghost noises and visuals. The popularity of this reality show has attracted a lot of attention, especially regarding the celebrity appearances, such as the iconic country music singer Loretta Lynn and the young comedian Matt Rife.

Though the series has become controversial among ghost-hunting show fans due to some of the problematic behavior displayed on-screen among the team members, Ghost Adventures has some of the scariest episodes of paranormal TV series. Viewers appreciate the unsettling histories of these haunted places, adding realism to the supernatural topics. After seventeen years, it's still one of the best paranormal reality shows for those looking to be a bit freaked out.

 The leader of the Ghost Adventures team, Zak Bagans, has dedicated his life and career to sharing ghost stories on-screen, and he once again impresses viewers with The Haunted Museum. In this series, Bagans hosts this show as well, exploring several of the haunted objects in his Las Vegas museum. Partnering with renowned horror filmmaker Eli Roth, each episode offers a dramatized version of the experiences people had with these haunted or possessed items.

This horror anthology isn't the most realistic project of Bagans', especially considering the special effects and CGI utilized to bring these terrifying ghosts and demons to life. However, The Haunted Museum does paint a disturbing, eerie image of the stories of those who have encountered foreboding spirits. Viewers who appreciate the re-enactments of ghost hunting encounters will love this recent addition to the paranormal media universe.

In Destination Fear, Dakota and Chelsea Laden, brother and sister, travel with their friends Tanner and Alex across the country in an RV to explore various haunted sites. During these investigations, the team spends the night camping out at these locations, using their ghost-hunting technology to capture paranormal encounters. They learn the history of these locations to aid in their attempts to connect with whatever presence is supposedly haunting the property.

At first glance, Destination Fear is like any other ghost-hunting reality TV show, exploring the locations of rumored hauntings. However, the most horrifying aspect is how personal they get with these locations, spending the night and secluding themselves from the outside world with the intention of being terrified by paranormal encounters. This intimate exploration of the fear people have of the unknown is captivating, and the key reason the series had a dedicated fanbase.

Kindred Spirits is an investigation team that includes Adam Berry and Amy Bruni, who were previously members of the teams featured on Ghost Hunters. In later seasons, the duo was joined by a psychic medium, Chip Coffey, who utilized his connection with spirits to aid in their cases. In this show, the investigators focused on family homes, attempting to communicate and understand the supposed ghosts haunting the premises to help them find peace and help the current occupants with their fears of the entities.

There was some skepticism from fans regarding the authenticity and style of Kindred Spirits, but the previous work of the team members gave them a level of credibility many amateurs lack. Many viewers found certain situations endearing, appreciating the effort represented to assist both the living and the dead. In addition, fans were entertained by the scary possibility of unsuspecting homeowners encountering lingering spirits.

 Paranormal Caught On Camera does not feature a team walking through haunted houses or trying to communicate with the dead, but analyzes available footage of various paranormal sightings. There are many instances of supposed ghost encounters, but the series also features other supernatural or mythological beings, such as Bigfoot and UFOs. It has a diverse cast of experts, such as the paranormal researcher Brian J. Cano and actress/paranormal investigator Susan Slaughter.

A major critique of Paranormal Caught On Camera is that a majority of the cast is far too willing to accept the videos they are commenting on without addressing the possibility that these encounters are staged or faked in some way. However, not all paranormal fans are interested in skeptical opinions about supernatural encounters. These reviews of captured sightings of the paranormal can occasionally be creepy and unnerving, satisfying viewers who want to be spooked by the possibility of ghosts and ghouls.

The Dead Files follows former homicide detective Steve DiShiavi and current paranormal investigator and psychic medium Amy Allen, who was replaced by another medium, Cindy Kaza, in the final season. During their investigations of haunted places, Steve and Amy/Cindy had separate interviews with clients and examinations of the locations to see if their findings were consistent. At the end of the episode, the two come together with clients to discuss the case and their opinions on their experiences.

What made The Dead Files so popular is that there was the logic vs. spiritual beliefs that went into each case, with the investigator attempting to find a logical explanation and the medium accepting the presence of ghosts and how they communicate. Compared to other terrifying TV shows that seek to frighten viewers regardless, this series capitalizes on both skeptics and believers being entertained. Overall, it's a creepy, but fun take on paranormal investigations.

Sometimes high fashion is just a little bit over our heads. Bringing wearable art to the world of sneakers is a recipe for bold designs, intricate details, and unique materials, but just like runway-ready pieces, the results can often be hard to actually picture on foot. If you're trying to stand out from the pack, though, a new collaboration between Windowsen and Nike is exactly what you're looking for.

The first collaboration between the brand by Chinese-born designer Sensen Lii and Nike, the Windowsen x Nike Air Max Muse Pack takes the chunky futuristic runner and chucks it into outer space. The two pair pack is covered in shiny uppers in metallic silver and gold. Starting with the gold pair, the shoe features alien graphics subtly woven into an all-over print, adds bright blue behind the gold, and finishes things off with hits of red.

The silver pair features the same extraterrestrial print throughout the silver panels, but instead of contrasting colors, it adds even more silver to the rest of the upper, switching it up with subtle hints of alien green on the tongue and heel labels, Swoosh, and outsole. On both shoes, the tongue gets a custom AM Windowsen label with alien eyes, and a custom alien head figurine affixed to the bottom lace. For a brand that Vogue once described as wanting you to “dress like a hot alien,” Windows did not disappoint.

The Windowsen x Nike Air Max Muse Pack will be released Holiday 2025 through Windowsen, Nike, and select retailers in-store and online. Available in women's sizing, the retail price is set at $260. To be the first to know the exact date these will hit shelves, download the Sole Retriever mobile app.

The first observation of interstellar object 3I/ATLAS.

DOWNLOAD PDF VERSION

A team of astronomers has attempted to track the path of interstellar object 3I/ATLAS back into the past, tracing its path through the galaxy in simulations involving over 13 million stars.

On July 1, astronomers spotted an unusual object speeding through the Solar System at nearly twice the velocity of previous interstellar visitors ‘Oumuamua and Comet Borisov. The object was soon confirmed to be an interstellar comet, and is suspected to have a nucleus (the rocky center of the comet, excluding its coma) of around 5.6 kilometers (3.5 miles), and a potential mass of over 33 billion tons.

The astronomical community continued to track the object as it moved through the Solar System and behind the Sun from our perspective. We may even have seen it using NASA's Perseverance rover on Mars.

But where did it come from? Luckily for us, gravity is time-reversal symmetric, and if we know an object's trajectory, we can work backwards and trace its path. In a new paper submitted to the Astrophysical Journal, but not yet peer reviewed, a team from the University of A Coruña attempted to do just this.

  

The team used data from the European Space Agency's Gaia mission, which produces a three-dimensional map of stars and other objects in the Milky Way and beyond. Tracing the object's path backwards through 10 million years, the team tried to identify where it had close encounters in the past, coming within 2 parsecs (6.5 light-years) of another star. 

""We identify 93 nominal encounters, 62 of which are significant at the 2σ level. However, none of these encounters produced any meaningful perturbation,"" the team writes in their paper. ""The strongest perturber Gaia DR3 6863591389529611264 at 0.30 pc and with a relative velocity of 35 km s−1, imparted only a velocity change of |∆v| ≃ 5 × 10−4 km s−1 to the orbit of 3I/ATLAS. Our results indicate that no stellar flybys within the past 10 Myr and 500 pc contained in Gaia DR3 can account for the present trajectory of 3I/ATLAS or be associated with its origin.""

In short, none of these potential close(ish) encounters could explain 3I/ATLAS's origin, and barely altered its trajectory. But mapping it back into the past, the team believes it likely originated from the galaxy's thin disk, in contrast to an earlier study, which suggested it may be from the thick disk, given how little it wandered from the galactic plane.



""Together, all data indicate that while 3I/ATLAS follows a thin-disk orbit in the solar neighborhood, it may nonetheless be an old object, consistent with ejection from a primordial planetesimal disk in an early-formed system, or from an exo-Oort cloud, and is most likely associated with the transition region between the thin and thick disk, although its origin remains undisclosed,"" the team concludes.

Further study of 3I/ATLAS and other interstellar objects is needed to draw further conclusions, but this preliminary study suggests it could be a very old object, that may have been traveling alone for billions of years until we spotted it near our star. The team suggests the object is around 10 billion years old, making it a time capsule of the formation of the earliest planetary systems in the galaxy and universe, though we will likely never know its true origin.

“What makes 3I/ATLAS unique is that it allows us to study the evolution of objects originating from other stellar systems – something we had only theorised about until now,"" Pérez Couto, Centre for Research in Information and Communication Technologies researcher and team leader, added in a statement. ""Each observation is like opening a window into the Universe's past.""

The study is posted to the pre-print server arXiv.

TOPICS:

CHARLESTON, W.Va. (WCHS) — Spooky season is upon us, and the Capital High School Theatre Department is embracing that fully by presenting Lucas Hnath's The Thin Place this weekend.

The story centers around a friendship between two women: Hilda, who is dealing with loss and seeking answers to reconnect with those she lost, and Linda, a medium who can talk to the dead, who reside in ""the thin place,"" a fine line between our world and the next.

The Thin Place features an intimate cast of just four people, who, in Capital's production, are all played by women. Directed by Jakob Spruce, Capital's play stars Sylvia Pierson as Hilda, Quincy Steele as Linda, Reagan Brown as Gerri and Jilli Arthur as Sylvia.

Capital's production is performed in the round, meaning that the audience surrounds the stage and performers; no matter which way the actors turn onstage, they will be facing an audience member.

""Learning to work in the round has been an interesting thing,"" Arthur said. ""I'm used to delivering out to one audience. Trying to speak around me, but also not scream or stare directly at someone has been a challenge lately.""

""I kind of enjoy it,"" Steele said. ""You can walk around and you don't have to worry about cheating this way to look at the audience. You can just look wherever you want and it doesn't matter, because the audience is always there.""

The Thin Place has challenged the actresses, from learning to work with just four people to learning more about themselves as a performer.

""In middle school, I'd always done huge musicals with about 40 people,"" Brown said. ""I wasn't used to being only with four. So it was a bit harder to get used to the fact that it was just four kids trying to work their way through an entire play together.""

""I feel like I've grown a lot as an actor through this show,"" Pierson said. ""I've learned a lot from this show, more than I have from a lot of other shows.""

The Thin Place at Capital High School runs Friday through Sunday. The first performance on Friday, a 2 p.m. schooltime performance, has already sold out. The 7 p.m. performance on Friday will feature an American Sign Language interpreter. Saturday's show will take place at 7 p.m. and Sunday's show will begin at 2 p.m.

""I think the audience will walk away with a new perspective,"" Pierson said. ""We're all connected, even if we don't realize it.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=Supernatural","Good Boy Review: Horror Tale Places Canine Star in a Supernatural Setting","https://thatshelf.com/good-boy-review-horror-tale-places-canine-star-in-a-supernatural-setting/","Fri, 10 Oct 2025 14:18:31 GMT","




Modern humans (homo sapiens) made their appearance on the world stage sometime between 200,000 and 300,000 years ago. Descended from grey wolves, canines became domesticated anywhere between 15,000 and 40,000 years ago. Whenever they did, they became constant companions to their human counterparts. Domestication involved not just physical changes, but behavioural ones, too—unerring, unconditional, lifelong loyalty.

Throughout their appearance in the arts, canines have remained mostly peripheral or background characters. Especially on film, they've rarely received top billing, both as a result of human-centric creativity (or lack thereof) and their physical limitations (speech, for example). First-time filmmaker Ben Leonberg saw the latter not as an excuse to focus his creative pursuits elsewhere, but as an opportunity to put his dog, Indy, a Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever, at the centre of Good Boy. It's a standout supernatural film that exploits the dog's-eye-view premise for maximum emotional impact and more than a few frights.

The film is inspired by the experiences we've all had (or seen), where our canine companions find themselves intrigued, even startled, by something (or some “thing”) outside human sight or hearing. Here, Leonberg places Indy front and centre as Indy's owner, Todd (Shane Jensen), attempts to recover from a life-threatening illness at a long disused family home somewhere outside New York City (New Jersey serving as a credible substitute).

Driven by the aforementioned loyalty, Indy never willingly leaves Todd's side, following him everywhere. He is always nearby, always willing to give and—just as importantly—receive affection from Todd. But with Todd's health failing, punctuated by long, guttural coughs and the occasional spurt of blood, it seems like Indy might find himself alone or, if he's lucky, adopted by Todd's mostly off-screen sister, Vera (Arielle Friedman).

As expected, Todd's return to the long-abandoned family home stirs up old ghosts—some imaginary, some possibly real. To Indy, however, they're all real. They manifest either as Todd's grandfather (horror icon Larry Fessenden) or as a faceless, spectral figure. Where Todd, increasingly concerned about his ill health, begins the slow, painful pull-away typical of terminal patients, Indy stubbornly, steadfastly remains at his side, constantly scanning their dimly lit surroundings for the possibility or the potential of a supernatural threat, and all but physically interposing himself between said threat and a fading Todd.

True to Good Boy's infinitely ingenious premise, Leonberg—working closely with cinematographer Wade Grebnoel—keeps the camera fixed at Indy's level. When Todd and Vera do appear onscreen, they're often cut off or bisected by the film's frame or shown in shadowy silhouette (we see Todd's face clearly only two or three times), intensifying the audience's natural inclination to identify with the character or characters onscreen. Lit with an emphasis on darkness as a suffocating shroud over other, dimly illuminated areas, Good Boy ably maintains a subtle sense of unease and discomfort throughout its brief, 73-minute running time.

Good Boy wouldn't be more than a cleverly executed gimmick, however, without the presence of Indy in practically every frame. There's never a doubt about what Indy's feeling or even thinking in any scene. Patiently trained over several years by Leonberg and his life partner, Kari Fischer (who also co-produced under their “What's Wrong With Your Dog?” banner), Indy gives not only an impressively emotive performance, but a consistently believable one. His large, expressive eyes, floppy ears, and body language transparently communicate Indy's moment-by-moment experience.

Good Boy premiered at the 2025 South by Southwest Film Festival this spring. It received a limited theatrical release on October 3, and will arrive on Shudder later this month.

Gary Arnold, an Oxford, Pa. resident, is inviting people to hear what he's been hearing since 2017; conversations he's had with other-worldly voices. Arnold said these voices have answered his questions and also given him winning lottery numbers.

OXFORD, Pa. — It started with a recording on an inexpensive cellphone.

Now, Gary Arnold has had more than 1800 eerie encounters since 2017 with some type of other-worldly speaker and he wants your opinion on what's being heard. He is inviting people to visit his Ultimate Haunted Attraction online.

“It's the ultimate haunted attraction for alien and other-worldly encounters,” Arnold said of the online experience. Think of it as another Halloween experience, he said.



By going to https://wearenotalone-81923.medium.com/ visitors can listen to several short clips that Arnold says prove there's something out there.

The voices have given him winning lottery numbers, he said. However, they do not want to predict election outcomes, indicating they “do not want to cause catastrophic disruption.”

“They are not going to destroy us,” Arnold said, but added, “Some are not happy with us.”

Arnold has run the recordings past audio-forensic professionals and through spectral analysis, and all agree the voices are non-human.

“These recordings have been exhaustively tested waveform by waveform,” Arnold said. “Every analysis confirms they are real phenomena, not tricks of the microphone. Researchers using leading-edge A.I. software have confirmed these recordings are authentic.”

“I am not interacting with people who have passed on,” he said of the metallic sounds. “These are non-human intelligences that are interacting with us.”

He's had full conversations with these voices via Electronic Voice Phenomena (EVP), hearing them answer his questions in real time.

The online clips are short — mere seconds — but in one conversation he's had, Arnold said he was told “You're our favorite.”

“The reason they want you is you're open minded,” he said he was told.

The two self-proclaimed Montgomery County psychics may not have seen this coming: They were arrested for allegedly swindling two women out of more than $600,000 to remove black magic curses.

Gina Marie Marks, 53, of Huntington Valley, and 40-year-old Steve Nicklas of Jenkintown have been charged with numerous felonies for their complex, yearslong fortunetelling scheme, Montgomery County District Attorney Kevin Steele said in a statement.

The first victim contacted the owners of Jenkintown Psychic Visions along Old York Road for a phone reading in 2022.

Marks, who identified herself as “Naomi,” convinced the woman that a “powerful curse (was) preventing her from finding love and happiness and convinced her that a curse would destroy her marriage, business and family if it wasn't removed.”

It was such a dire case of black magic doom that she needed the help of a second seer, Nicklas, who Marks called “Stephan.”

The pair asked her to send them money in exchange for removing the curse.

Between September 2022 and August 2023, the pair played on the woman's fears. She sent them cash, jewels, concert tickets, gift cards and luxury items, the DA said.

The cash and pricey goods were needed for an altar ritual that would “cleanse” the items, and would be returned later, the victim was told. But none of the cash and items totaling $595,959 ever came back. Marks kept “stringing her along,” a court record stated.

Montco detectives examined various cash accounts owned by Marks and Nicklas, including Zelle and CashApp, which showed tens of thousands of dollars transferred to them by the victim.

A Navy Federal Credit Union account owned by Nicklas showed thousands of dollars deposited into the account were spent on the betting site FanDuel. There were also ATM withdrawals from the credit union account totaling $17,000 at Parx Casino, among other expenditures, the DA said.

Montco detectives learned of the alleged fraud in December 2024. During their investigation, they found that a second victim who had also contacted Jenkintown Psychic Visions in June 2023.

In that case, Marks told the woman to give her photos and personal life details in sessions that lasted through February 2024.

“Marks … made further unorthodox requests to satisfy rituals that would help (the victim),” the D.A. said.

In addition to cash, Marks demanded a Chanel purse. She threatened the victim “with reputational damage and personal repercussions if (Marks') instructions weren't followed,” the DA said.

The woman gave Marks a total of $18,000.

Marks and Nicklas were arrested Oct. 7, charged with corrupt organizations, dealing in the proceeds of unlawful activities, theft by unlawful taking, theft by deception and receiving stolen property, as well as fortune telling. They were arraigned before District Judge Jodi L. Griffis, who set Marks' bail at 10% of $50,000, and Nicklas' bail at 10% of $25,000.

Both made bail and were released.

“These defendants, through their con scheme, preyed on people who were looking for help, guidance and hope, exploiting them for financial gain,” Steele said.

A preliminary hearing has been scheduled for 9:30 a.m. Oct. 20 before District Judge R. Emmett Madden.

Conspiracy theorists believe the shutdown has put a stop to schemes by billionaires to alter the weather.

Published Oct 10, 2025, 11:00 PM

Updated Oct 10, 2025, 11:00 PM

WASHINGTON – With federal services crippled on Oct 10, the US government shutdown has one unexpected perk, according to believers in the long-debunked “chemtrails” conspiracy theory – “clear” skies.

“Best thing about government shutdowns: no chemtrails,” Kentucky Republican Representative Thomas Massie wrote on Instagram.

“Ever since we had the government shutdown, there has been zero chemtrails. I haven't seen the sky this clear in decades,” a Los Angeles-based artist says in a reel watched 1.7 million times.

The trend is symptomatic of now-normalised conspiratorial discourse about weather control in the United States.

Chemtrails is a scientifically-unsound theory mistaking condensation trails emanating from aircraft as a government programme “spraying” toxic chemicals in the sky to manipulate the weather.

In 2025, state legislatures have doubled down on efforts to block all geoengineering and local weather research programmes, moves that risk jeopardising scientific innovation.

“As of October 1st, Florida's airports are closed to any weather modification activities,” the state's Attorney-General James Uthmeier said on X, in the latest push on the matter. 

But comments under the post show people questioning why they still observe trails of clouds in the sky.

Others appeal to Florida's Republican Governor Ron DeSantis with footage of white trials, some positing the activities are being carried out by “private rogue companies and evil billionaires”.

The state now allows residents to report “suspected weather modification” and “geoengineering” activities.

Professor Holly Buck, who teaches environment and sustainability at the University at Buffalo, said people “invested in this idea of atmospheric manipulation” will view current events through that same prism.

“In a sense, we are all analysing the impact of the shutdown through the lens of things we care about”, and conspiracy theorists make no exception, she said. AFP

U.S. Treasury yields were lower on Friday as investors ran for safety following a threat from President Donald Trump on higher tariffs targeting Chinese goods.

The 10-year Treasury was down more than 8 basis points at 4.061%, while the 2-year Treasury yield was more than 7 basis points lower at 3.526%. The longer-maturity 30-year Treasury yield dropped 8 basis points to 4.654%.

One basis point is equal to 0.01% and yields and prices move in opposite directions.

In a Truth Social post, Trump threatened to put forward a ""massive increase of Tariffs"" on goods from China, adding that Chinese President Xi Jinping was ""becoming very hostile, and sending letters to Countries throughout the world, that they want to impose export controls on each and every element of production having to do with rare earths.""

Stocks tanked following the post, with investors running away from riskier assets. Gold also jolted higher.

The threat adds to the uncertainty investors face, as they also wade through a U.S. government shutdown that made it into its 10th day. On Thursday, the Senate failed to advance stop-gap funding bills for the seventh time, with Republican and Democratic lawmakers appearing unwilling to give up on their own party's demands.

The shutdown has resulted in an economic data blackout which leaves investors ""flying blind to some extent on the US economy,"" Deutsche Bank analysts said in a note.

Instead, investors turned to the Federal Open Market Committee minutes for clues about the shape of the economy this week, which revealed that officials last month were mostly in agreement on lowering interest rates but split on just how many reductions there should be this year.

Fed Governor Christopher Waller told CNBC Friday that while he still supports cutting rates, the central bank needs to be ""cautious about it.""

In this article

Shares of U.S. rare earth miners jumped Friday after President Donald Trump threatened countermeasures against China, accusing Beijing of holding the world ""captive"" with its strict export controls.

""I will be forced, as President of the United States of America, to financially counter their move,"" Trump said on his social media plaftorm Truth Social.

""One of the Policies that we are calculating at this moment is a massive increase of Tariffs on Chinese products coming into the United States of America,"" the president said. ""There are many other countermeasures that are, likewise, under serious consideration.""

MP Materials soared 15%, USA Rare Earth surged 19%, Energy Fuels jumped more than 10%, and NioCorp Developments was up nearly 14%. 

China this week imposed more stringent export controls on rare earths, a subset of critical minerals that are crucial inputs for U.S. weapons platforms, robotics, electric vehicles, and electronics among other applications. Beijing dominates the global supply chain for rare earths and the U.S. is dependent on imports from China.

The U.S. Defense Department struck an uprecedented deal in July with MP Materials, the largest U.S. rare earth miner, in an effort to stand up a domestic supply against China. 

China is now requiring foreign entities to obtain a license to export products that contain rare earths worth 0.1% or more of the goods' value. Companies will also need export licenses if they use China's extraction, refining or magnet recycling technology.

China imposed the controls before Trump was expected to meet President Xi Jinping on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Seoul, South Korea later this month. 

""I was to meet President Xi in two weeks, at APEC, in South Korea, but now there seems to be no reason to do so,"" Trump said.

Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Oct. 10 that the agreements he reached with U.S. President Donald Trump during their August summit in Alaska remain in force, despite recent tensions over the war in Ukraine. 

Putin's remarks come after a shift in tone from Trump, who has suggested that Ukraine could regain all of its territories and said he is considering supplying Kyiv with long-range Tomahawk missiles. 

""We have an understanding of where to move and what to strive for to end the Ukrainian conflict by peaceful means,"" Putin said. ""We have not fully disclosed what was discussed in Anchorage. We remain committed to the basis of that discussion and have changed nothing for ourselves.""

The Anchorage summit in August was the first face-to-face meeting between Putin and Trump in six years, as well as Putin's first visit to U.S. soil in a decade. The two leaders discussed the war in Ukraine, arms control, and potential territorial adjustments, though Kyiv was not invited to participate.

Putin also said that Russia could soon unveil a new weapon system following successful tests and that an agreement with the United States on strategic arms reduction would be ""acceptable and useful."" He added that otherwise ""nothing will remain"" of the global arms control framework.

Asked whether Russia is prepared to respond to potential U.S. deliveries of Tomahawk missiles to Ukraine, Putin said Moscow's answer would be ""strengthening the air defense system."" 

At the same time, Putin dismissed the discussion of Tomahawk transfers as a form of ""showing off."" 

""This is also a kind of bluff. There's an element of showing off here,"" Putin said.

President Volodymyr Zelensky told reporters on Oct. 8 that such weapons could ""force the Russians to sober up and sit down at the negotiating table,"" adding that Trump had not ruled out supplying the long-range missiles during their latest meeting at the United Nations General Assembly.

The Tomahawk, a subsonic cruise missile with a range of up to 2,500 kilometers (1,550 miles), would give Ukraine the capability to strike targets deep inside Russian territory. Moscow has warned that any such transfer would mark a ""new stage of escalation.""

Putin said last week that the potential delivery of Tomahawks would ""seriously undermine"" progress in U.S.-Russia relations and could destabilize efforts to negotiate peace.

The IPI said Roshchyna's death on Sept. 19, 2024 ""exposed the brutal treatment suffered by the dozens of Ukrainian journalists unjustly held by Russian authorities, and brought new urgency to the need to protect the press and secure accountability for attacks on journalists.""

Among the seven nations increasing their purchases, France saw a 40% jump, importing 2.2 billion euros ($2.5 billion), while the Netherlands' imports surged 72% to 498 million euros ($579 million). Belgium, Croatia, Romania, and Portugal also raised their imports. Hungary recorded an 11% increase over the past year.

This month marks one year of the Kyiv Independent's Explaining Ukraine weekly newsletter on Ukrainian history, literature, and culture, written by culture reporter Kate Tsurkan.

""We have not fully disclosed what was discussed in Anchorage. We remain committed to the basis of that discussion and have changed nothing for ourselves,"" Russian President Vladimir Putin said.

Igor Kartavykh, editor-in-chief of Sputnik Azerbaijan, was moved from police detention to house arrest in Baku, according to Dmitry Kiselyov, who oversees Sputnik's parent organization.



The legislation reflects a $100 million increase in the aid for Ukraine over the House of Representatives' version.

Russia launched a large-scale drone and missile attack on Ukraine overnight on Oct. 10, killing a child and injuring at least 24 people in the country while leaving a part of Kyiv without electricity and water.



""Very shortly, we'll be producing around 2,000 drones a month, deliberately shipping all of them to Ukraine so they can be used to intercept Russian drones,"" U.K. Defense Readiness and Industry Minister Luke Pollard said.

The committee described Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado as ""a brave and committed champion of peace.""

""I am sure that in the end we will get there, that (Russian President Vladimir) Putin will pay for this war,"" Germany's Finance Minister Lars Klingbeil said.

The attacks come amid Russia's intensifying aerial campaign targeting Ukraine's energy infrastructure ahead of the winter months.

The upcoming delivery addresses Ukraine's urgent need for cost-effective air defense solutions as Russia intensifies drone attacks.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:cnn.com","Thousands of Palestinians are returning home to northern Gaza, finding destruction and heartbreak","https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/10/world/palestinians-returning-gaza-city-intl","Fri, 10 Oct 2025 18:27:30 GMT","


            Thousands of Palestinians began the long, dusty walk from the south of Gaza toward Gaza City after a ceasefire came into effect in the enclave on Friday. They found their city lying in ruins – yet were relieved to be returning home.
    


            Virtually the whole population of northern Gaza had been displaced since Hamas' attack on October 7, 2023, led to Israel's war in the enclave, and the area has been reduced to rubble over the past two years.
    


            Aerial footage shows vast stretches of land with nothing but ruins. There's no infrastructure, no electricity and no running water.
    


            Yet for many of those making the trek on Friday, there is no question about returning.
    


            “I pray that God relieves our sorrow and distress and that people return to their homes. Even if the houses are destroyed, we will return, God willing,” said Ahmad Abu Watfa.
    


            Abu Watfa spoke to CNN on his way back home to Sheikh Radwan in Gaza City. He said he was feeling an overwhelming joy, even though he knew that it's likely that nothing awaits him that he could call home.
    


            “There is no feeling more beautiful than this — the feeling of people returning from the south to the north,” he said.
    


            An Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) spokesperson said that people were allowed to move from the south to the north via the coastal Al-Rashid Street and the Salah al-Din Road in the center of the Gaza Strip.
    


            For many residents of northern Gaza, Friday marked the second time they tried to return home.
    


            While Israel forced most residents of northern Gaza to leave the area early in the war, it briefly allowed people to return to some parts during the last ceasefire in January.
    


            But that homecoming was short lived for most, as Israel once again ordered a complete evacuation of Gaza City in early September, ahead of a ground invasion into the city.
    


            The IDF told CNN at that time that 640,000 people have left the city after the evacuation order. That number represented about 90% of Gaza City's pre-war population, although it was not possible to verify that estimate.
    


            The situation in Gaza City was critical even before that ground offensive, with no fully functioning hospitals and few places to shelter.
    


            On Friday, medical teams from the Al Rantisi hospital in Gaza City returned to the facility to find it completely destroyed. Gaza's deputy minister of health, Dr Yousef Abu Al Rish, shared a video from the scene with CNN that showed ruins and burned and destroyed medical equipment.
    


            The Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC), a United Nations-backed initiative, said that famine took hold of Gaza City in August and has since spread to the rest of the strip.
    


            As people began to return to the north, grim discoveries awaited them there. Footage from the city shows many multistory buildings completely flattened and others ripped apart by blasts. The whole area appears to be covered in grey dust, with mostly no other color visible.
    


            Mohammed Abu Salmiya, the director of Al-Shifa hospital in the north, told CNN that the bodies of at least 33 Palestinians have been recovered from Gaza City on Friday, after the Israeli military withdrew from some areas of the city.
    


            He said that it was impossible to identify some of the bodies, which is why they were sent to the hospital where forensic teams could examine them.
    


            Majdi Fuad Mohammad Al-Khour was standing amid the rubble of what used to be his house in Tal el Hawa when he spoke to CNN.
    


            He said two of his children – a son and a daughter – were killed in the war. His house was destroyed and nearly everything he ever owned is gone.
    


            “Forty years of work to build this home,” he said. “I am 70 years old now. Since I was 10, I worked until I could marry, build this house, and have children. Now I cannot work, and my health does not allow me to. Where should I go? My health is no longer what it was when I was young. I am old and sick, and I cannot work. My wife is also sick and cannot see with her eyes.”
    


            The Israeli military said on Friday that a ceasefire was now in effect in Gaza, with forces pulling back in accordance with the plan that was approved by the Israeli government.
    


            Under the ceasefire agreement, a 72-hour period for the release of the hostages held by Hamas started Friday. Nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners and detainees in Israel will also be freed as part of the agreement.
    


Israel says ceasefire in effect as troops withdraw from parts of Gaza



            Sair Hikmat Subh from Beit Lahiya, a town just north of Gaza City said he was “tired and fed up” but hoping to return home soon.
    


            Subh spoke to CNN as he was dismantling and packing up his tent near Al-Rashid Street ahead of his trip north.
    


            “We are happy that the roadblock has been removed. Praise be to God for everyone's safety. Of course I am happy!” he told CNN.
    


            However, he said that experience taught him to be cautious.
    


            “I have dismantled many tents and left many behind. I have been displaced nearly 20 times,” he said.
    


            Subh was likely correct to be cautious. The IDF spokesperson said on Friday that Israeli troops would still be present in various areas of Gaza, including Beit Hanoun, Beit Lahia and Shuja'iyya, and warned people to avoid them.
    


            “Approaching the …  zones where the forces are stationed is extremely dangerous,” the spokesperson said.

            A 2,000-year-old tunnel once used by Roman emperors to slip into the Colosseum unseen will open to the public this month, offering visitors a rare glimpse of the arena's imperial backstage.
    


            Known as the Passage of Commodus, the 180-foot corridor was built beneath the amphitheater to let emperors and VIP guests reach their seats in the imperial box without mingling with the crowds.
    


            The passage takes its name from Emperor Commodus, the ruthless leader who governed from 177 to 192 CE and was nearly assassinated in the underground walkway.
    


            Moviegoers will remember Commodus as Joaquin Phoenix's scheming emperor in “Gladiator” — the one who murdered his father, Marcus Aurelius, and faced Russell Crowe's Maximus in the arena.
    


            In real life, Commodus' vanity went further. He fought in gladiatorial bouts dressed as Hercules, killing weakened fighters and even animals — once beheading an ostrich before a cheering crowd, according to the Colosseum Archaeological Park.
    


            The hidden corridor was first uncovered between 1810 and 1814 by French excavators under architect Carlo Lucangeli, then reopened in 1874 and studied again in the 1990s. During the 2020–2021 restoration of the entire site, archaeologists fully mapped the tunnel and began a new phase of conservation.
    


            The recent restoration removed centuries of dust and grime, reattached fragile plaster using laser tools, and revealed marble-lined walls etched with landscapes and mythological scenes — including the story of Dionysus, god of wine and revelry. Near the entrance, carvings of boar hunts, bear fights and acrobats recall the spectacle that once filled the arena.
    


            “Once this passage is now open to the public, visitors will appreciate what it was like to be an emperor,” said archaeologist Barbara Nazzaro, who led the work.
    


            Massimo Osanna, director general of Italy's museums, called the reopening “a significant milestone” that blends research and preservation. New features such as a tactile map and video reconstructions aim to make the site “truly accessible and inclusive for all audiences.”

            The restoration includes lighting that recreates daylight from long-sealed skylights, plus glass panels allowing visitors to watch archaeologists at work. A new excavation set for next year will trace the tunnel's route — possibly toward the gladiators' barracks.

Donald Trump has expressed gratitude to his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, for the latter's reaction to the Norwegian Nobel Committee's decision not to award the US president its famed Peace Prize.

Since assuming office in January 2025, Trump has on multiple occasions claimed that his efforts in mediating international conflicts, including most recently in Gaza, merit him winning the award.

Speaking in Dushanbe on Friday, the Russian president, who was on a state visit to Tajikistan, remarked that the Nobel Committee has a history of awarding individuals who in fact “did nothing for peace,” thus discrediting the honor of the award to a large extent.

Putin noted that while it was not his place to decide who should get the prize, Trump is “really doing a lot to resolve difficult crises, which last for years and decades.” He cited the US president's recent mediation between Israel and Hamas in the Middle East and his genuine efforts to put an end to the bloodshed in Ukraine.

In a post on his Truth Social platform, Trump published a screenshot of Putin speaking, declaring: “Thank you to President Putin!”

Earlier in the day, the Nobel Committee awarded the Peace Prize to Venezuelan opposition politician Maria Corina Machado “for her tireless advocacy of democratic freedoms in Venezuela.” The government in Caracas has accused Machado of channeling US funds to “fascist” anti-government groups.

Commenting on the committee's decision in a post on X, White House communications director Steven Cheung stated that its members had “proved they place politics over peace.”

The official insisted that Trump “has the heart of a humanitarian, and there will never be anyone like him who can move mountains with the sheer force of his will.”

Marimar Martinez, 30, was charged with impeding a federal officer with a deadly weapon in fracas preceding shooting

A Chicago woman shot multiple times by US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agents was recently indicted by a grand jury on federal charges of impeding a federal officer with a deadly weapon.

Prosecutors allege Marimar Martinez, 30, rammed the vehicle of federal agents with her own before they shot her, which they say was an act of self-defense. They also claim Martinez was armed.

Martinez's lawyer, Christopher Parente, said footage from one of the agent's body-worn cameras contradicted that account, and Martinez will plead not guilty at an arraignment scheduled in the coming days.

According to Parente, that camera footage captured one of the officers saying, “Do something, bitch,” before opening fire.

The footage has not been made public.

Another person, 21-year-old Anthony Ian Santos Ruiz, was also indicted on Thursday in the same case.

Federal agents allege that Martinez was involved in a vehicle chase before ramming a CBP vehicle. Authorities claim that a government vehicle carrying three CBP agents was followed and boxed in by a “convoy of civilian vehicles”, including cars driven by Martinez and Santos.

The shooting occurred as immigration agents, at the behest of the second Trump administration, have been scouring Chicago – Illinois's largest city – for people to deport.

Police chief calls explosion near Bucksnort, south-west of Nashville, ‘devastating' and says ‘we have some deceased'

Nineteen people are missing and feared dead following a huge explosion at a military munitions plant in Tennessee.

The powerful blast ripped through the explosives manufacturing plant in rural Tennessee on Friday morning, rattling homes miles away and bringing emergency services to the scene, authorities and residents said.

Upon being asked at a news conference on Friday afternoon to describe the scene, the Humphreys county sheriff, Chris Davis, replied: “There's nothing to describe. It's gone.”

He added that the explosion was “one of the most devastating situations I've been on in my career”.

The incident occurred at Accurate Energetic Systems near the town of Bucksnort, about 60 miles south-west of Nashville, the Hickman county sheriff's office said. The agency asked people in a social media post to avoid the area to allow responders to do their work.

Further blasts were initially keeping rescuers at some distance, David Stewart, a Hickman county advanced EMT, told the Associated Press by telephone.

Some time later on Friday morning, access was achieved and first responders and explosives experts were searching the rubble for casualties and trying to determine what caused the explosion.

There were casualties and injuries related to the explosion, but the Tennessee emergency management agency was not yet sharing any numbers early on Friday afternoon because the state department of health had not confirmed them, spokesperson Kristin Coulter said by telephone.

“We can confirm that we do have some that are deceased,” Davis said

In a later news conference on Friday, Davis said: “We have not notified all the families. We are still reaching out to the families.

“It's a massive situation.”

He went on to say: “It's hell. It's hell on us. It's hell on everybody involved … I can tell you right off the top of my head that there's three families that's involved in this that I'm very close to.”

Davis went on to urge residents to notify law enforcement of any unfamiliar debris that they may spot on their properties, saying: “That's something we need to get recovered – and because it could have information that we need for the investigation.”

Accurate Energetic Systems, which makes and tests explosives and is based in nearby McEwen, did not immediately respond to a phone message seeking comment on Friday morning. The cause of the explosion is not yet known.

In an email to the Associated Press, McEwen's mayor, Brad Rachford, said: “This is a tragedy for our community.”

Video from the scene showed a burning debris field with smoke billowing into the air. WTVF-TV in Nashville broadcast images of debris strewn about the site, with damaged vehicles in a parking lot. The news station said it received calls from people in the area who felt a large explosion.

Residents in Lobelville, more than a 20-minute drive from the manufacturer, said they felt their homes shake and some people captured the loud boom of the explosion on their home cameras.

The blast rattled Gentry Stover from his sleep.

“I thought the house had collapsed with me inside of it,” he told the AP by phone. “I live very close to Accurate and I realized about 30 seconds after I woke up that it had to have been that.”

Tennessee's governor, Bill Lee, responded to Friday's blast on X, saying: “We are monitoring the ongoing situation in Hickman county & state agencies are responding in partnership with local & federal agencies. We ask Tennesseans to join us in prayer for the families impacted by this tragic incident.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

President William Lai (賴清德) yesterday pledged to strengthen the nation's air defense capabilities and build a “T-Dome” system to create a safety net against growing military threats from China.

“We will accelerate our building of the T-Dome, establish a rigorous air defense system in Taiwan with multi-layered defense, high-level detection and effective interception, and weave a safety net for Taiwan to protect the lives and property of citizens,” he said in his National Day address.

In his keynote address marking the Republic of China's (ROC) 114th anniversary, Lai said the lessons of World War II have taught nations worldwide “to ensure that the tragedies of history are never repeated.”

“The outcomes of that conflict tell us that aggression fails, unity prevails and that peace is won through strength,” he said.

Lai reiterated his administration's commitment to raise Taiwan's defense budget to 3 percent of GDP next year and 5 percent by 2030, saying that developing the “T-Dome” system is among its key objectives.

He said that Taiwan would integrate “high-tech and artificial intelligence [AI]” to develop a “smart defense combat system,” invest in innovative defense research and cooperate with defense industries in advanced nations to boost domestic capabilities.

He did not provide details about the “T-Dome” system.

A Reuters report published late on Thursday ahead of Lai's speech said the “T-Dome” — short for Taiwan Dome — is intended to counter increasingly complex threats, including drones, rockets, missiles and military aircraft.

Citing multiple unnamed sources, Reuters said the system is modeled after Israel's Iron Dome missile-defense network, with planning still under way and “initial integration” expected to begin soon, one source said.

Delivering his second National Day address since taking office in May last year, Lai said building a more resilient Taiwan requires closer coordination between the public and private sectors, both in responding to natural disasters and in preparing for a potential Chinese invasion.

“We are determined to maintain peace through strength. We firmly believe that strength is not obtained through military strength alone, but must also rely on resilience throughout society,” Lai said.

In June last year, Lai's administration established the Whole-of-Society Defense Resilience Committee under the auspices of the Presidential Office.

Over the past year, the committee has helped improve coordination between the government and the private sector, as well as between central and local authorities, to enhance “integrated disaster prevention and defense,” Lai said.

On cross-strait relations, Lai said his administration looks forward to the day when China “can take responsibility as a major power and cease its distortion of UN General Assembly Resolution 2758 and historical World War II documents.”

“We also hope it will renounce the use of force or coercion to change the status quo across the Taiwan Strait so that we can jointly maintain the peace and stability of the Indo-Pacific,” he said.

Resolution 2758, adopted by the 26th UN General Assembly in 1971, addressed the issue of China's representation at the international body.

It resulted in Taiwan, officially the ROC, losing its seat as representative of “China” at the UN to the People's Republic of China (PRC). 

Lai called Taiwan a “beacon of democracy” in Asia, drawing a distinction with China's one-party state.

“Democratic Taiwan ... will strive to maintain the status quo, protect peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait, and promote regional prosperity and development,” he said.

Lai also announced plans to implement 10 new AI infrastructure initiatives aimed at strengthening Taiwan's position as a global technology leader.

“In addition to helping make Taiwan one of the world's top five computing centers, we will also invest more vigorously in research and development in three key technological fields — quantum technology, silicon photonics and robotics,” Lai said.

He described the initiatives as forming a “chain of guardian mountains” to reinforce Taiwan's industrial base and expand the application of AI across multiple sectors.

Although Lai offered no further details, his remarks echoed Premier Cho Jung-tai's (卓榮泰) statement in August that government ministries and agencies would begin allocating budgets for the 10 AI infrastructure projects starting next year, citing the US AI Action Plan released in July as a reference.

Cho said the initiatives would focus on smart applications, infrastructure foundations and core technologies, such as silicon photonics, quantum computing and robotics. Hundreds of billions of New Taiwan dollars would be invested in the plan.

Lai also described 2025 as “a year in which Taiwan rises,” while emphasizing the strength and strategic importance of the nation's semiconductor, information and communications technology, and electronic component industries in the global supply chain.

“Taiwanese exports continue to reach record highs, while employment is at its strongest level in 25 years,” Lai said. 

“Our stock market has risen for six consecutive months, hitting an all-time high of 27,301 points. Taiwan's market capitalization has exceeded US$3 trillion, making the stock market the eight-largest in the world, while foreign-exchange reserves have surpassed US$600 billion for the first time, setting a new record,” he said.

Taiwan also leads the Four Asian Tigers and China in economic growth, Lai said, citing the Asian Development Bank's latest forecast of 5.1 percent GDP growth for this year.

In addition to maintaining Taiwan's competitive edge, the president said that his administration continue to deepen its global partnerships, including efforts to address its trade deficit with the US and advance tariff negotiations with key partners.

National Day is held on the anniversary of a 1911 uprising that led to the overthrow of China's last imperial dynasty and the establishment of the ROC.

The Nationalist government fled to Taiwan in 1949 after losing a civil war with Mao Zedong's (毛澤東) communists, and the ROC remains Taiwan's formal name. 

The PRC was established on Oct. 1, 1949, two months before the ROC government relocated to Taiwan.

Responding to the speech, Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Guo Jiakun (郭嘉昆) said that “seeking independence by force” would only drag Taiwan into conflict.

“He peddles the separatist fallacy of Taiwanese independence,” Guo said in Beijing. “This once again exposes his stubborn nature as a troublemaker, creator of danger and a warmaker.”

A US administration official said the US welcomed Lai's commitment to increase defense spending and comments on ensuring peace and stability.

“We're not going to speculate on how Beijing might react, but our general policy is that we don't think routine speeches should be used as a pretext for taking any sort of coercive or military action,” the official said.

The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that the proposed order would be placed using the defense procurement special budget, adding that about NT$1 trillion (US$32,88 billion) has been allocated for the budget. 
The proposed acquisition would include launchers, missiles, and a lower tier air and missile defense radar system, they said

POLITICAL AGENDA: 
                                        Beijing's cross-strait Mid-Autumn Festival events are part of a ‘cultural united front' aimed at promoting unification with Taiwan, academics said                                        Local authorities in China have been inviting Taiwanese to participate in cross-strait Mid-Autumn Festival celebrations centered around ideals of “family and nation,” a move Taiwanese academics said politicizes the holiday to promote the idea of “one family” across the Taiwan Strait.
Sources said that China's Fujian Provincial Government is organizing about 20 cross-strait-themed events in cities including Quanzhou, Nanping, Sanming and Zhangzhou. 
In Zhangzhou, a festival scheduled for Wednesday is to showcase Minnan-language songs and budaixi (布袋戲) glove puppetry to highlight cultural similarities between Taiwan and the region.
Elsewhere, Jiangsu Province is hosting more than 10 similar celebrations in Taizhou, Changzhou, Suzhou,                                    


COGNITIVE WARFARE:

Several Chinese fishing vessels transmitted fake automatic identification system (AIS) signals in Taiwan's waters last month, with one mimicking a Russian warship and another impersonating a Chinese law enforcement vessel, the report said.
Citing data from Starboard Maritime Intelligence, the report said that throughout August and last month, the Chinese fishing boat Minshiyu 06718 (閩獅漁06718) sailed through the Taiwan Strait while intermittently transmitting its own AIS

Following Russia's overnight large-scale attack on Ukraine's energy infrastructure, President Volodymyr Zelensky accused Russia on Oct. 10 of deliberately delaying strikes on Ukrainian energy infrastructure in an effort to maximize damage, while attempting to minimize the political implications of the attacks.

""I believe that the weather conditions affected our capability to repel by something like 20-30%,"" Zelensky told reporters during a press briefing following the attack, Reuters reported. 

Zelensky's comments follow a large-scale attack on Ukrainian energy infrastructure overnight on Oct. 9-10, in which Russia used 465 drones as well as 32 cruise and ballistic missiles to target Ukrainian cities.

Ukrainian air defenses reportedly intercepted 405 Russian drones and 15 missiles amid the attack that killed a child and injuring at least 24 people.

Weather conditions overnight were favorable for Russia's attempt to evade air defenses, with low visibility reported in Kyiv and the country's eastern regions. The temperature in Kyiv also dropped to approximately four degrees Celsius (39 degrees Fahrenheit) overnight.

In his evening address, Zelensky further lambasted Russia for staging the attack amid an international focus on the ongoing peace deal between Hamas and Israel.

""(Russian President Vladimir) Putin is clearly taking advantage of the moment when the world is now paying almost all its attention to the possibility of establishing peace in the Middle East. Most of the world's states, all key leaders, have focused their attention on what is happening there. And this is a really good chance to achieve real peace after so many victims in that region,"" Zelensky said.

""And this is a new record of Russian meanness - to intensify terrorist attacks at such a moment, to strike precisely at the lives of our people,"" he added.

The attacks come amid Russia's intensifying aerial campaign targeting Ukraine's energy infrastructure ahead of the winter months. Millions of Ukrainian suffered through power and water outages amid the attack on various cities.

Bloomberg reported on Oct. 9, citing undisclosed sources, that Russian strikes on energy infrastructure have destroyed more than half of Ukraine's natural gas production capacity ahead of winter.

Following the attack, Zelensky spoke with the leaders of Finland, Germany, and the United Kingdom on Oct. 10, stressing that he hoped the ""coalition of the willing"" would hold a meeting in the coming weeks.

Zelensky further revealed that a Ukrainian delegation is set to visit Washington next week to negotiate the purchase of additional air defense systems as well as HIMARS rocket systems as the country continues to cope with attacks on energy infrastructure.

Editor's note: The story was updated with comments by Russian presidential aide Yuri Ushakov.

Ukraine is ready to nominate U.S. President Donald Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize if he helps secure a ceasefire with Russia, President Volodymyr Zelensky told journalists on Oct. 8.

Trump has pledged to broker a swift peace deal between Kyiv and Moscow and end the full-scale Russian invasion, ongoing for more than three and a half years.

This effort has largely stalled as Russia continues to reject a ceasefire and demands territorial concessions from Ukraine.

The U.S. president, who has boasted about ending ""seven wars"" since returning to office, has actively campaigned for receiving the prestigious award. 

Some officials, including Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, have already put forward Trump's name for nomination.

Yuri Ushakov, Russian President Vladimir Putin's foreign policy advisor, also said Moscow would support Trump's nomination, state news agency TASS reported on Oct. 10.

The 2025 Nobel Peace Prize is set to be announced by the Norwegian Nobel Committee on Oct. 10. As nominations for this year closed in January, any nominations Trump has received since then will not count toward this week's prize.

Despite initially saying he would end the Russia-Ukraine war within 24 hours, Trump later acknowledged that resolving it ""turned out to be a little harder"" than he thought.

Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov recently said that the ""strong momentum"" for ending the war has waned since Trump's meeting with Putin in Alaska on Aug. 15.

While Trump pledged to arrange direct talks between Zelensky and Putin, no agreement was reached.

Zelensky rejected Putin's invitation to meet in Moscow, calling it impossible while Russia bombs Ukraine, but repeatedly said he is ready to meet the Russian leader on neutral ground.

The Alaska summit, initially expected to include sessions on bilateral cooperation, ended abruptly after those segments were canceled. Two months later, no tangible progress has been made toward peace.

 

Trump has also sought to broker a peace deal between Israel and Hamas, announcing on Oct. 8 that the two parties agreed to the first phase of the U.S.-brokered peace plan.

Thousands of displaced Palestinians trekked over the wastelands of Gaza to return to the ruins of their abandoned homes on Friday, after a ceasefire took effect and Israeli troops began pulling back under the agreement to end the war.

A huge column of people filed on foot north along the coastal road overlooking sandy beaches towards Gaza City, the enclave's biggest urban area, which had been under attack just days ago in one of Israel's biggest offensives of the war.

“Thank God my house is still standing,” Ismail Zayda, 40, said in the Sheikh Radwan district of Gaza City. “But the place is destroyed, my neighbours' houses are destroyed, entire districts have gone.”

In the south, people picked their way through the dusty moonscape that was once Gaza's second-largest city, Khan Younis, which Israeli forces razed this year. Most walked in silence.

A middle-aged man, Ahmed al-Brim, was pushing a bicycle with bundles of scrap timber tied to the front and back: his family would need the firewood to cook. It was all they had been able to recover from the ruins of their home.

“We went to our area. It was exterminated. We don't know where we will go after that,” he said. “We couldn't get the furniture, or clothes, or anything, not even winter clothes. Nothing is left.”

Palestinian health authorities said medical teams were able to recover 100 bodies from areas across the Gaza Strip after the army pulled back.

The Israeli military said the ceasefire agreement had been activated at noon local time.

The first phase of U.S. President Donald Trump's plan to end the war between Israel and the Hamas militant group gives Israeli troops 24 hours to pull from positions in urban areas, although they will still hold more than half of Gaza.

Israeli police said they were preparing for Trump's visit on Monday that officials said would include a speech to the Knesset, Israel's parliament, the first by a U.S. president since George W. Bush in 2008.

Trump said he would head to the region on Sunday, perhaps to attend a signing ceremony in Egypt. Axios, citing four sources with knowledge of the matter, reported on Friday he plans to convene world leaders for a summit on Gaza while in Egypt.

The next phase of Trump's plan calls for an international body – the “Board of Peace” – to play a role in Gaza's post-war administration. The plan calls for Trump to lead it and includes former British Prime Minister Tony Blair.

But in a potential challenge to this element of the plan, Hamas issued a statement late on Friday rejecting what it called any “foreign guardianship,” adding that governance of Gaza was purely an internal Palestinian matter.

In a televised address, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israeli forces were staying in Gaza to ensure Hamas was disarmed: “If this is achieved the easy way then that will be good, and if not then it will be achieved the hard way.”

As the day wore on and it became clear troops were no longer blocking the roads into cities, an initial trickle turned into a flood of Palestinians returning from makeshift tented camps to the homes they had left behind.

Mahdi Saqla, 40, said his family had decided to set off north towards Gaza City as soon as they heard the news of the ceasefire.

“Of course there are no homes – they've been destroyed,” he said. “But we are happy just to return to where our homes were, even over the rubble. That too is a great joy. For two years we've been suffering, displaced from place to place.”

Israel's government ratified the ceasefire with Hamas in the early hours of Friday. Once Israeli troops have pulled back, Hamas has 72 hours to release the 20 living Israeli hostages it is still holding. Israel will free 250 Palestinians serving long terms in its prisons and 1,700 detainees captured during the war. Hundreds of trucks per day are expected to surge into Gaza carrying food and medical aid.

Israeli military spokesperson Brigadier General Effie Defrin urged residents of Gaza to avoid entering areas under Israeli military control: “Keep to the agreement and ensure your safety,” he said on Friday.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu thanked U.S. President Donald Trump, Special Envoy Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner on Thursday.

Israelis and Palestinians alike rejoiced after the deal was announced, to end two years of war in which over 67,000 Palestinians have been killed, and to return the last hostages seized by Hamas in the deadly attack that provoked it.

The exiled Gaza chief of Hamas, Khalil Al-Hayya, said he had received guarantees from the United States and other mediators that the war was over.

Here's what you need to know about Gaza and the Israel-Hamas war, including ceasefire talks, famine and the Israeli ground offensive.

During the Hamas-led attack on Israeli communities and a music festival on Oct. 7, 2023, fighters killed 1,200 people and captured 251 hostages.

Twenty hostages are still believed to be alive in Gaza, while 26 are presumed dead and the fate of two is unknown. Hamas has indicated that recovering the bodies of the dead may take longer than releasing those who are alive.

Analysis: Gaza ceasefire would represent Trump's best deal yet, but there is still work to be done

Displaced Palestinians in Central Gaza welcomed on Friday a ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas, expressing hope that they can finally return to their homes.

Reuters

The accord, if fully implemented, would bring the two sides closer than any previous effort to halt the war.

Much could still go wrong. Further steps in Trump's 20-point plan have yet to be agreed. Those include how the demolished Gaza Strip is to be ruled when fighting ends, and the ultimate fate of Hamas, which has rejected Israel's demands it disarm.

The Hamas-run interior ministry said it would deploy security forces in areas where the Israeli army withdrew. It was not clear whether armed militants would return to the streets in significant numbers, a move Israel would see as a provocation.

Smoke fills the air as debris covers the ground and vehicles after a powerful blast ripped through a military explosives manufacturing plant in Hickman County, Tenn., on Friday.The Associated Press

A blast that leveled an explosives plant Friday in rural Tennessee left 19 people missing and feared dead, authorities said.

Humphreys County Sheriff Chris Davis said the blast at Accurate Energetic Systems, which supplies the military, was one of the worst scenes he's ever seen. He said multiple people were killed but declined to say how many, referring to the 19 missing as “souls” because officials were still speaking to family.

“There's nothing to describe. It's gone,” Davis said of the building.

The blast occurred about 7:45 a.m., Davis said, with aerial footage by WTVF-TV showing the smouldering hilltop facility and the burnt-out shells of vehicles.

People reported hearing and feeling the explosion from miles away. The company's website says it processes explosives and ammunition at an eight-building facility that sprawls across wooded hills in the Bucksnort area, about 60 miles (97 kilometres) southwest of Nashville.

Davis said investigators are trying to determine what happened and couldn't say what caused the explosion. Emergency crews were initially unable to enter the plant because of continuing detonations, Hickman County Advanced EMT David Stewart said by phone.

Aerial footage of the aftermath by WTVF-TV showed the explosion had apparently obliterated one of the facility's hilltop buildings.The Associated Press

By Friday afternoon, there was no further danger of explosions, and the scene was under control, according to Grey Collier, a spokesperson for the Humphreys County Emergency Management Agency.

Accurate Energetic Systems, based in nearby McEwen, did not immediately respond to a phone message seeking comment Friday morning.

Accurate Energetic Systems has been awarded numerous military contracts, largely by the U.S. Army and Navy, to supply different types of munitions and explosives, according to public records. The products ranged from bulk explosives to landmines and small breaching charges, including C4.

When the explosion occurred, residents in Lobelville, a 20-minute drive from the scene, said they felt their homes shake and some people captured the loud boom of the explosion on their home cameras.

The blast rattled Gentry Stover from his sleep.

“I thought the house had collapsed with me inside of it,” he said by phone. “I live very close to Accurate and I realized about 30 seconds after I woke up that it had to have been that.”

State Rep. Jody Barrett, a Republican from the neighbouring town of Dickson, was worried about the possible economic impact because the plant is a key employer in the area.

“We live probably 15 miles as the crow flies and we absolutely heard it at the house,” Barrett said. “It sounded like something going through the roof of our house.”

The U.S. has a long history of deadly incident at workplaces, including the Monongah coal mine explosion that killed 362 men and boys in West Virginia in 1907. Several high-profile industrial accidents in the 1960s led President Richard Nixon to sign a another law creating the Occupational Safety and Health Administration the next year.

In 2019, Accurate Energetic Systems faced several small fines from the U.S. Department of Labor for violations of policies meant to protect workers from exposure to hazardous chemicals, radiation and other irritants, according to citations from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration.

The Nobel Peace Prize for 2025 has gone to Maria Corina Machado. The committee lauded ""her tireless work promoting democratic rights for the people of Venezuela."" Follow DW for more. 

This is a roundup of news and analysis about the announcement of the Nobel Peace Prize winner on Friday, October 10.

The Norwegian Nobel Committee has awarded Venezuela's opposition leader, Maria Corina Machado, this year's Nobel Peace Prize for unifying political factions and citizens and standing up to dictatorship, committee chair Jorgen Watne Frydnes told DW.

The United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has hailed Maria Corina Machado's Nobel Peace Prize victory as a ""tribute to all those working to preserve democracy, freedom and political rights around the world.""

In a post on X, Guterres said the award is a ""stirring reminder of the resilience and power of the democratic spirit.""

In a separate statement, the UN chief said Machado was a ""champion of democracy.""

Maria Corina Machado has dedicated her Nobel Peace Prize to ""the suffering people"" of her home country, Venezuela, and to US President Donald Trump.

""This recognition of the struggle of all Venezuelans is a boost to conclude our task: to conquer Freedom,"" the Venezuelan opposition leader said in a post on X.

Machado said the opposition in Venezuela — where Nicolas Maduro has ruled since taking over from his mentor, leftist leader Hugo Chavez in 2013 —  is ""on the threshold of victory.""

""Today, more than ever, we count on President Trump, the people of the United States, the peoples of Latin America, and the democratic nations of the world as our principle allies to achieve freedom and democracy,"" Machado added.

She concluded her post with: ""I dedicate this prize to the suffering people of Venezuela and to President Trump for his decisive support of our cause!""

Ties between the US and Venezuela, which have been strained for years, have soured further in recent months. 

Trump has accused Maduro of leading a drug cartel and recently deployed US Navy warships to the Caribbean. The US has carried out multiple strikes on what it says are drug smuggling boats near Venezuela.

Caracas, meanwhile, has accused Washington of seeking ""regime change"" in the oil-rich South American nation.

How Trump, who made no secret of his ambition to be nominated for the prize, has received Machado's dedication is unclear. 

Although the White House's official X account shared Machado's post, communications director Steven Cheung had earlier slammed the Nobel Committee for not nominating Trump, saying their choice ""proved they place politics over peace.""

It is not clear whether Maria Corina Machado will be able to attend the Nobel Peace Prize award ceremony in Oslo on December 10.

The Venezuelan opposition leader has been living in hiding, and she has not been seen in public since January, when she was reportedly detained briefly.

If she does not attend, she will join the list of Nobel Peace Prize laureates who have been prevented from doing so during the award's 124-year history.

This list includes Soviet dissident Andrei Sakharov in 1975, Poland's Lech Walesa in 1983, and Myanmar's Aung San Suu Kyi in 1991.

Machado is the first Venezuelan and the sixth Latin American to win the Nobel Peace Prize.

Maria Corina Machado said she was confident that the opposition would succeed in securing a peaceful transition to democracy in her home country of  Venezuela.

""We're not there yet. We're working very hard to achieve it, but I'm sure that we will prevail,"" she told Kristian Berg Harpviken, the director of the Nobel Institute and secretary of the Nobel Committee, when he called to inform her that she had won the 2025 Peace Prize.

""This is certainly the biggest recognition to our people that certainly deserve it,"" she said, adding: ""I am just, you know, one person. I certainly do not deserve this.""

The White House accused the Nobel Peace Prize committee of prioritizing politics over peace by awarding the prize to a Venezuelan opposition leader instead of US President Donald Trump.

""President Trump will continue making peace deals, ending wars, and saving lives. He has the heart of a humanitarian, and there will never be anyone like him who can move mountains with the sheer force of his will,"" White House spokesperson Steven Cheung said in a post on X.

""The Nobel Committee proved they place politics over peace,"" he added.

Earlier this year, Trump repeatedly claimed that he deserved the Nobel Peace Prize for resolving conflicts, including those between Pakistan and India, as well as between Armenia and Azerbaijan.

The German government has congratulated Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado on winning this year's Nobel Peace Prize.

According to government spokesperson Steffen Meyer in Berlin, with this award, the Nobel Committee is honoring ""her courageous and long-standing commitment to democracy, the rule of law, and respect for human rights in Venezuela, as well as her contribution to strengthening Venezuelan civil society.""

Meyer added that the award represents support for ""all those who peacefully campaign for political freedom, justice, and human rights protection in Venezuela, Latin America, and around the world.""

German Chancellor Friedrich Merz also personally congratulated Machado on his X account, saying that ""democracy thrives on the courage of individuals.""

He added that Machado ""has fought tirelessly for years for freedom and the rule of law in Venezuela — values that we uphold worldwide.""

Meanwhile, German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul praised Machado as a ""voice for freedom worldwide."" 

On X, he praised the opposition leader, writing, ""The courage, strength, and steadfastness with which you keep the hope for democracy alive in Venezuela are admirable.""

EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen celebrated Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado's Nobel Peace Prize win.

In a post on X, she stressed that the prize not only honored Machado's courage but also the courage of every voice ""that refuses to be silenced.""

""In Venezuela and across the world. It sends a powerful message. The spirit of freedom cannot be jailed. The thirst for democracy always prevails. Dear Maria, the fight continues,"" von der Leyen wrote.

Meanwhile, European Council President Antonio Costa called the prize a testament to Machado's ""tireless work for justice.""

""For your steadfast commitment to democracy, human rights, and your fight for freedom in Venezuela,"" he added on X.

European Parliament President Roberta Metsola said she is proud of Machado for receiving the Nobel Peace Prize.

""Your tireless struggle for freedom and democracy in Venezuela has touched hearts and inspired millions across the globe,"" she wrote on X.

Edmundo Gonzalez, Maria Corina Machado's ally who lives in exile in Spain, posted a video of himself speaking on the phone with Machado.

""I am in shock,"" she said, adding, ""I cannot believe it.""

In a post on X, Gonzalez celebrated Machado's Nobel Peace Prize win, calling it ""very well-deserved recognition for the long fight of a woman and a whole people for our freedom and democracy.""

Maria Corina Machado, this year's Nobel Peace Prize winner, is a 58-year-old Venezuelan opposition activist and industrial engineer who lives in hiding.

In 1992, she founded the Atenea Foundation to benefit street children in Caracas. Ten years later, she co-founded Sumate, an organization that promotes free and fair elections and conducts training and election monitoring.

In 2010, Machado won a record number of votes and was elected to the National Assembly. The regime expelled her from office in 2014.

She leads the Vente Venezuela opposition party and, in 2017, helped found the Soy Venezuela alliance, uniting pro-democracy forces across political divides in the country.

In 2023, Machado announced her candidacy for president in the 2024 presidential election. However, in 2024, Venezuela's courts blocked her from running for president and challenging President Nicolas Maduro, who has been in power since 2013.

Edmundo Gonzalez, who had never run for office before, took her place. Widespread repression, including disqualifications, arrests, and human rights violations, preceded the election.

The crackdown on dissent only increased after the National Electoral Council, stacked with Maduro loyalists, declared Maduro the winner despite credible evidence to the contrary.

The election results announced by the council sparked mass protests across the country, to which the government responded with force, resulting in more than 20 deaths. 

Machado went into hiding and has not been seen in public since January. A Venezuelan court issued an arrest warrant for Gonzalez, who moved to Spain and was granted asylum.

Last year, Machado and Gonzalez received the Sakharov Prize, the European Union's highest human rights honor.

The Norwegian Nobel Committee announced that Maria Corina Machado, a Venezuelan opposition politician, is the winner of the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize.

Machado was awarded ""for her tireless work promoting democratic rights for the people of Venezuela and for her struggle to achieve a just and peaceful transition from dictatorship to democracy,"" the Nobel Committee stated.

The chair of the committee, Jorgen Watne Frydnes, called Machado a ""champion of peace"" working to loosen the Venezuelan government's ""rigid hold on power.""

""In the past year, Miss Machado has been forced to live in hiding. Despite serious threats against her life, she has remained in the country, a choice that has inspired millions,"" Frydnes added.

He stressed that it is crucial ""to recognize the courageous defenders of freedom who rise and resist"" when authoritarians seize power.

The Nobel Peace Prize, worth 11 million Swedish crowns (about €1 million or $1.15 million), will be presented in Oslo on December 10, which is the anniversary of Swedish industrialist Alfred Nobel's death.

Last year, the Japanese peace organization Nihon Hidankyo received the award for promoting a world free of nuclear weapons.

Nihon Hidankyo is a group of survivors of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings.

Since August 1956, the organization has campaigned for greater healthcare provisions for survivors of the attacks, known as ""hibakusha"" (bomb-affected people), as well as a blanket ban on the development and use of nuclear weapons.

Traditionally, the public does not know the identities of Nobel Prize nominees.

However, US President Donald Trump has repeatedly claimed that he deserves the award for resolving conflicts ranging from those between Pakistan and India to those between Armenia and Azerbaijan.

On Thursday, the AFP news agency asked Trump what he thought his chances were of winning the Nobel Peace Prize. He replied: ""I don't know what they're going to do, really. But I know this, that nobody in history has solved eight wars in a period of nine months.

""And I've stopped eight wars. That's never happened before,"" he claimed, adding that Gaza was ""the biggest of them all.""

Trump's proposal to end the two-year war in Gaza provided the framework for a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, drawing more attention to his bid for the prize.

The committees that award the Nobel prizes do not announce the nominations, and the Nobel statutes ban the judges from discussing their deliberations for 50 years.

However, those doing the nominating may choose to make their recommendations public.

People cannot nominate themselves, though they can be nominated multiple times by others, including members of each prize's panel.

The Nobel Peace Prize committee is the only one that regularly recognizes achievements from the previous year.

According to the AFP news agency, the five members of the committee held their final meeting on Monday, during which they finalized the statement explaining their selection, which is typically made several days before the final meeting.

The Norwegian Nobel Committee is due to announce the winner of the 2025 Peace Prize at 11 a.m. local time (0900 GMT) in Oslo.

This year, 338 candidates are in the running for the Peace Prize. This includes 244 individuals and 94 organizations. The total number is 52 more than last year.

The Nobel awards will be formally presented to the winners at a ceremony on December 10, the anniversary of the death of Alfred Nobel, the Swedish industrialist who founded the prize.

Unlike all the other Nobel Prizes, which are traditionally awarded in Stockholm, the Peace Prize is presented in Oslo.

Each prize carries a cash award of 11 million Swedish kronor, which is equivalent to €1 million or $1.15 million.

This week, laureates have already been named in medicine, physics, chemistry, and literature. The Nobel week will conclude on Monday with the announcement of the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences.","{'href': 'https://www.dw.com', 'title': 'DW'}","world"

			‘Nothing left' of munitions plant in Tennessee after deadly explosion that was felt 10 miles away

Up to 19 people are missing, feared dead after an explosion that destroyed a munitions factory in Tennessee.

The plant near Bucksnort, about 60 miles west of Nashville, caught fire and exploded on Friday.

In a tearful press conference, Chris Davis, the Humphreys County sheriff, said: “This is the most devastating incident I have been on in my career.

“I can tell you right now that we're looking for 19 individuals. A lot of times, when I have this type of situation, I refer to more than just a person. They're a soul to me.”

Reluctant to say how many had died, Mr Davis told reporters there was a possibility that at least some of the missing could be injured. Asked if anything of the factory remained, he said: “There is nothing to describe, it's gone.”

After the initial explosion at the Accurate Energetic Systems factory, which was felt more than 10 miles away, flames set off secondary blasts, delaying attempts to rescue any survivors. Debris fell into the garden of a house four miles from the plant.

Authorities appealed to people to stay away from the site as the US Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives was called to the scene.

The factory makes and tests explosives for the military, aerospace, demolition and mining industries. It also produces explosive charges used to control avalanches.

Founded in 1980, Accurate Energetic Systems “proudly holds certification as a Small Business Alliance women-owned small business,” according to its website. The company is yet to comment.

ABC reported that the munitions plant serves the US departments of defence and homeland security, according to the Association of the United States Army. It currently holds contracts worth $140m with the US government.

A safety document written for regulators said the site, which covers 1,300 acres, contains large amounts of TNT. It means firefighting teams were advised to use a dry powder agent, rather than water, to douse the blaze.

The explosion took place just before 8am CDT (2pm BST) and destroyed one of the facility's buildings, officials said.

Sheriff Davis said: “We do have several people at this time unaccounted for. We are trying to be mindful of families and that situation. We do have some that are deceased.”

“We got a very big investigation. This is not going to be something that is like a car wreck or something like that, that we're just going to clean up the debris and leave. We're going to probably be here for a few days.

“We're trying to take as much time as is needed right now. We're prioritising people that are involved, their families, and trying to be very compassionate toward them.”

The cause of the explosion was not immediately known. Video from the scene showed flames and heavy smoke rising from a debris field, and residents miles away reported feeling the blast.

A Hickman County emergency services spokesman said it is not yet known if any rescue workers were hurt in the secondary explosion.

Brad Rachford, the mayor of nearby McEwen, where Accurate Energetic Systems' headquarters is based, said: “This is a tragedy for our community.”

Drone footage from the scene showed at least one building had been almost completely obliterated, with rubble strewn across a huge stretch of ground.

In the clips, a huge black cloud of smoke rises from the smouldering wreckage. Burnt and smashed up cars, some still neatly parked, can be seen in the car park. First photographs of the scene showed swathes of the local vegetation destroyed.

Residents in Lobelville, a 20-minute drive from the scene, said they felt their homes shake, and some people captured the loud boom of the explosion on their home cameras.

The blast rattled Gentry Stover from his sleep. He said: “I thought the house had collapsed with me inside of it. I live very close to Accurate and I realised about 30 seconds after I woke up that it had to have been that.”

			US president's 19-year-old son could be appointed to the app's board

Barron Trump is being eyed for a top role at the streaming app TikTok.

The US president's son could be appointed to the board of the $14bn (£10.5bn) company, it was suggested, after his father sealed a deal to spin-off TikTok's US business from its Chinese parent.

Barron's potential role was pitched by Jake Advent, Donald Trump's former social media manager.

Mr Advent is the genius mind behind a meme-filled presidential campaign that Mr Trump credits for helping to propel him to the White House a second time, nicknamed “TikTok Jack” by the president.

Speaking to the Daily Mail, Mr Advent said: “I'm hopeful President Trump will consider appointing his son Barron and maybe other young Americans to TikTok's board to help ensure it remains an app young people want to keep using.”

Mr Trump has credited Barron for his win, saying his 19-year-old son, currently a student at New York University, helped him to win the youth vote. He also heralded the power of TikTok, which has more than 170 million users, in his campaign.

“I have a warm spot in my heart for TikTok, I won youth by 34 points, and there are those that say that TikTok has something to do with it,” he told Fox News earlier this year.

“Joe Rogan [helped] and some other people, who were recommended by my son, Barron, he knew names... that had an impact, and TikTok had an impact.”

Last month, Mr Trump signed an executive order saying that TikTok “will be majority-owned and controlled by United States persons and will no longer be controlled by any foreign adversary”.

He celebrated by posting his own TikTok video to the app. “To all of those young people of TikTok, I saved TikTok, so you owe me big,” he said in the clip.

“Now, you're looking at me in the Oval Office, and someday one of you are going to be be sitting right at this desk, and you're gonna be doing a great job also.”

The US-China agreement was reached just days before a ban on TikTok operating in America was to take effect.

Joe Biden, the former president, signed bipartisan legislation in April 2024 giving ByteDance, the Chinese internet company that owns TikTok, the option of reducing its stake in the app to 20 per cent, or facing a ban in the United States.

The video sharing platform has courted controversy in the US owing to claims it could be used by Beijing to harvest data on Americans. TikTok has consistently denied this.

Mr Trump attempted to block the platform in his first term in office, but reversed course before the 2024 election by pledging to halt a federal ban that had been passed in Congress.

			Terror group became weary of war turning its own population against it

Donald Trump was able to strike his Gaza peace deal when Hamas terrorists began to see hostages as a liability, US officials have said.

The key moment in weeks of negotiations came when the terror group stopped seeing the captured Israelis as an “asset” and had grown tired of the war.

The result was a historic deal, struck after 20 hours of negotiations in Egypt on Wednesday.

A day later, the Israeli cabinet approved the agreement, paving the way for Israeli forces to move back from the heart of Gaza and for Hamas to release the final 20 living hostages within 72 hours.

A senior US official said a shift in the Hamas stance had made it possible. It had grown weary of a war that was turning the Gaza population against it.

Mr Trump's top negotiators, Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, who travelled to Egypt for the final round of talks, sensed that Hamas had simply “had enough”.

“Hamas was at that place where they wanted to do a deal,” said a US official. “And I would describe it as this, where they were almost looking at the hostages less as an asset and more as a liability.”

Hamas initially captured 251 hostages during its deadly October 7 2023 attack on Israel. Today, it still holds 48, of whom 20 are believed to be alive.

For the past two years, and throughout the Israeli assault on Gaza, they have been used as a bargaining chip by terrorist leaders, hidden in tunnels and exchanged for aid or prisoners in Israeli jails.

Last week, Mr Trump set out an ambitious 20-point plan to end the conflict and build a pathway to a lasting peace in the Middle East.

On Wednesday morning, Mr Witkoff and Mr Kushner, the president's son-in-law, flew to the Red Sea resort city of Sharm El-Sheikh for the final round of negotiations.

The officials said the final evening of talks involved working through some “consequential” things and some “misunderstandings”.

The two men arrived at 6.30am and finalised the deal at 2.30am the following day.

From there, they flew to meet Abdel Fattah El-Sisi, the Egyptian president, and then on to Tel Aviv, where they briefed the Israeli cabinet on Thursday evening.

The deal really came together, the official said, when Mr Kushner and Mr Witkoff were able to decouple the hostage release from the wider plan: demilitarising Gaza, setting up an international stabilisation force, and a transitional authority to run the territory.

“I think Hamas began to realise that they didn't need the hostages necessarily to enforce their view that it was better for them to concede, that a release was a positive thing, that better things would happen as a result of that decision on their part,” said one official.

Families had been destroyed, and public opinion seemed to be turning against the terrorist group as starving Gazans increasingly began to see Hamas as villains.

The deal leaves the thornier question of whether Hamas will give up its weapons and who will govern Gaza for another day.

A second senior official said the process was not over, adding: “The reason we're here in Israel is just to make sure the implementation occurs. 

“There's still, you know, just a lot of ways that this can go wrong. So we're staying on top of the details to make sure everyone fulfils their obligations and that any misunderstandings are quickly discussed and adjudicated.”

The official said Israel was motivated to convert military victories over Hezbollah, Hamas, and Iran into political progress and strengthen its economy.

He added: “And I think from Hamas and the Arab countries, there was a general fatigue with the way this war was going, and a desire also to try something new.”

The war deepened Israel's international isolation and upended the Middle East, drawing Iran, Yemen, and Lebanon into a regional conflict.

Earlier in the day, Mr Trump used a meeting of his cabinet to herald “peace in the Middle East”. He announced that he expected the final hostages to be returned on Monday or Tuesday, and that he would be travelling to the region.

“It's going to be a very big day,” he said. “I think it's going to be a day of great celebration.”

Overworked and understaffed, over 45,000 health care workers at Kaiser Permanente are poised to strike.

Overworked and understaffed, over 45,000 health care workers at Kaiser Permanente are poised to strike.

“Our patients deserve the best, not mediocrity.”

This phrase has been emblazoned across graphics on the social media feeds of the Oregon Federation of Nurses and Health Professionals (OFNHP), an American Federation of Teachers affiliate, Local 5017. The roughly 6,000 health care professionals of the OFNHP are locked in a contract fight with their employer, Kaiser Permanente, the sprawling health care consortium. The mediocrity in question is not that of the staffers themselves; instead, it warns of the impending consequences for staff and patients alike of the workplace stressors to which Kaiser's tens of thousands of doctors, nurses, technicians, and others are systematically subjected.

In what has become an extended set of pitched battles with Kaiser management, the OFNHP has set out to address some of the most severe crises in nursing and health care — at Kaiser and elsewhere. Pressure from the rank-and-file to confront chronic understaffing, stagnating pay rates, and a loss of control over their schedules and work arrangements has driven the union to place these demands at the forefront in their return to contract bargaining this year.

But their struggle is not a lonely one, and it's far from confined to Kaiser's Northwest branch. The OFNHP is one of the 23 unions that together make up the Alliance of Health Care Unions (AHU), a labor federation that comprises over 60,000 Kaiser workers across California, Hawaii, Oregon, Washington, Maryland, Colorado, Georgia, and Washington, D.C. A significant portion of the Alliance membership is bargaining as a single unit, simultaneously negotiating for better wages and conditions at national and local levels. Strike action has been authorized, and the countdown has begun: If management does not return to the table by October 14, Kaiser Permanente will witness an enormous nationwide walkout of more than 40,000 employees.

The amassing strains on staff, exacerbated by the obstinate bargaining position staked out by management, have led the AHU to play its final card. Should the strike go forward, the number of participants alone would make this one of the single largest labor actions of the year. It's telling that this year has seen a groundswell of nurses' strikes and other health care actions — a symptom of the widespread, deeply rooted and ever-worsening issues facing U.S. hospital staff, both at Kaiser and in countless medical facilities across the nation.

The gouging-out of the U.S. frontline health care workforce — in large part attributable to a combination of low pay, punishing hours, burnout, and exhaustion, along with the stresses and risks of COVID-19 — have led to severe strain on remaining employees — which in turn intensifies turnover, perpetuating the cycle. At Kaiser Permanente, several of these unfortunate trends have amplified each other, and in this way have become mutually reinforcing.

Back in 2021, to address similar grievances, the AHU had also voted to authorize a strike; membership came to the brink of a walkout but called it off the night before when management came back to the table. A new contract was won, establishing a staffing committee to address shortages and stemming some of the most immediate concerns by securing a wage increase and blocking management's attempt to implement a “two-tier” system. But the structural issues remained unresolved, and wage gains that were won four years ago have been diluted by inflation. Now, as that contract is expiring, some Kaiser staff have asserted that, compared to 2021, the pressures on the workforce and the adversarial stance of management have significantly worsened.

Kaiser has a largely unionized workforce, represented by the AHU as well as overlapping memberships like the Coalition of Kaiser Permanente Unions. The health care titan has operated for nearly three decades under a version of a labor-management partnership. Initially implemented as a compromise to avoid a strike in the late 1990s, the Kaiser conglomerate's unique partnership provides notable concessions to labor, codifying organizing rights and benefits and securing unions a seat at the bargaining table. The central compromise on the part of labor is that, by alleviating these pressures, worker militancy and possible strike action is averted, neutralized before it can take root. In theory, this works to the benefit of all involved.

Broadly, this arrangement is still in place — but sources say that the process has become decidedly less cooperative. Over many protestations, Kaiser administrators have continued to maintain practices that hospital employees have come to feel are absolutely untenable. That they've gone so far as to call for a strike, the strongest possible measure, testifies to their feelings as to the absence of alternatives.

Brenda Rowe is a histology technician at Kaiser and an OFNHP member in the technical bargaining unit, which comprises 33 different roles — surgical and laboratory technicians, respiratory therapists, and so on. Her unit members have not yet seen their own particular contract expire and are therefore ineligible to join this strike. (One of their tertiary demands is to remedy this contract-timing misalignment so that all contracts are signed simultaneously.) Still, Rowe and her unit are actively involved in negotiations to settle terms for their renewal next year.

Speaking to Truthout, Rowe emphatically shared that Kaiser technicians are proud to stand in solidarity with the strikers in their local counterpart bargaining units and with the multi-state AHU as a whole. Bargaining units are subdivisions of union membership: in the OFNHP, they include groups for workers with advanced degrees (the “Pro” unit), nurses at various tiers, Rowe's fellow technical staff, registered dental hygienists, and several others.

Rowe explained how chronic staffing shortages wreak havoc on the complex operations of a hospital. “All of our work is interconnected,” she told Truthout. “It's all intertwined.… When the nurses can't step in and cover as much, then that puts more pressure on lab techs, who are dealing with staffing shortages themselves. It's a no-win situation.”

In response to the union's charges of staffing shortages, Kaiser Permanente replied in a statement to Truthout:

“Kaiser Permanente meets—and often exceeds—mandated nurse-to-patient ratios and staffing standards. We continue to hire, adding over 6,300 new employees in 2024, including nearly 4,700 in care delivery and more than 1,600 in Alliance-represented roles. “

Neoma Palmer is a physical therapist with a sports-clinic specialty who has been employed at Kaiser for 12 years, largely in outpatient physical therapy. She's also an OFNHP shop steward, a labor partner (a liaison and support role unique to Kaiser), and, like Rowe, a volunteer on her respective bargaining team. On a call with Truthout, Palmer explained that, “There's short staffing everywhere, and it's just been getting worse. We're seeing, ever since the end of June, that management started to not replace open positions.” Palmer said that as many as “hundreds of jobs” might remain unfilled.

The void of new hiring, along with the first-year attrition rates, are at the same time both symptoms and catalysts of the understaffing crisis. This is also the case for the increasing workloads and stagnant wages that tend to disincline new job seekers, to say nothing of top talent. A large AHU survey of the workforce found that a full 95 percent of respondents felt “Kaiser's staffing crisis is affecting patient care and access,” while over 90 percent worked in short-staffed departments. According to Palmer, “In the past two decades, we've increased our membership in the Northwest by 400 percent.” And yet, in many areas — for example, she says, at the outpatient rehab — the level of staffing “has stayed exactly the same. When you have to be 400 percent more productive … it's just not possible.”

Kaiser staff have also been constrained in their ability to participate in the creation of their work schedules (often called “schedule templates”). Management has backed away from what was once a more collaborative process. A new inflexible practice of top-down scheduling, said Rowe, doesn't “allow for adequate charting, adequate break time, being able to leave when you're supposed to be off work. It's very disorganized … That's a very, very big point of contention.”

Like Rowe's technical unit, the OFNHP's Pro bargaining unit encompasses staff in around 30 separate disciplines; Palmer is among them. As has been the case for so many other units in AHU locals, Palmer and her colleagues have arrived at unnavigable impasse: Management has seemingly decided to advance no further towards compromise.

“In theory, the partnership works great,” Palmer went on. “But in reality, I don't think we've been working well together for at least the last five to 10 years. Part of that is because we have different management now, and they don't buy into the partnership as much.” Onetime opportunities for staff input and joint problem-solving, she says, have dried up — replaced by “a more of a traditional top-down approach” from newer managers. “Often, they've never worked in health care.”

A likely motivator for this newly uncooperative, profit-focused management is the perverse incentives introduced to health care entities by financialization, especially after the intrusion of private equity firms — as has been apparent time and again at modern institutions like universities and hospitals (Kaiser among them). Many venerable institutions, handwaving away the lofty and noble aims of their founding charters, have moved to prioritize profit, often by leveraging their assets to reap returns for investors. But the intrusion of profit mechanisms reliably distorts institutional motives. Financialization of this type seems to inevitably compromise the original service — for instance, teaching medical students, or treating patients. The consequences of a profit-focused orientation for hospital patients can range from inconvenience to death — as credible research has shown, finding clear causal links between private equity acquisition of hospitals and the actual fatality rates in emergency rooms. At Kaiser, the stakes are no less severe.

“More and more, the managers and directors that are coming in are bean counters that have no experience in health care.”

“More and more, the managers and directors that are coming in are bean counters that have no experience in health care, but they feel like they can make things more efficient,” said Palmer. “And that's just not the way it works.”

For many Kaiser employees, it's becoming nearly impossible to ignore the sense that the incentives of profit and control are the prime reason behind these changes — more than patient care, more than staff welfare. (It's also both alarming and revealing that Kaiser has proven ready to retaliate against those who blow the whistle on internal understaffing and patient safety concerns.)

Many have also been dismayed to see Kaiser's reputation and metrics dwindle. “We know our access and staffing is really bad,” Palmer said, “because it's incredibly difficult to get just basic appointments.” Indeed, earlier this year, Kaiser was issued a $4 million fine from California's Department of Managed Health Care for its failure to address recurrent major mental health care delays — which had become so bad that they were actually illegal. The department, finding dismal standards that have gone unaddressed, has cited Kaiser multiple on multiple occasions over the years. According to the charges in a National Union of Healthcare Workers report, Kaiser has also, in some cases, resorted to falsifying records of patient schedules to avoid citation by regulators.

Extended wait times are rampant, even in critical treatment areas. As Palmer said with chagrin, “Your cancer screening appointments are only available three, four months past the time when you're due” to have them. Needless to say, delays of this kind will also inevitably cost patients their lives. Statistically, it's a near-certainty that they already have.

Kaiser leadership disputed those claims. “The Alliance's campaign uses strong language, pickets, and strike threats to rally support,” they told Truthout in a statement. “They say their goal is to protect patients by ensuring better care and staffing, but the real issue is wages… Their claims about Kaiser Permanente's quality and staffing don't reflect the facts.”

Uncompetitive Compensation

Perhaps the central concern for labor in the negotiations is that Kaiser's pay has failed to keep up with inflation. In general, Kaiser's pay runs low compared to other hospital systems, particularly in the Northwest, though pay rates can vary, and are reportedly more reasonable in areas of California.

“Your cancer screening appointments are only available three, four months past the time when you're due.”

“One of our main goals in bargaining was to be paid fairly, and to be paid for all hours worked,” Palmer said. (She described how at Kaiser, it's the norm to consistently get in early, stay late, and/or take on extra work, often multiple hours per week. This is done to keep up with workloads and licensing, but also very often out of a desire to provide patients with more attentive care.)

On wage increases, she says, “We had lots of different ideas … and management had no interest in continuing to bargain with us on that topic.” Asked if she felt that Kaiser was abusing the knowledge that its employees would devote extra unpaid hours to make up shortfalls, Palmer replied without hesitation: “100 percent.”

The AHU negotiates for wage rates that apply to all employees, referred to as “across-the-boards” (ATBs). The AHU is asking that over the four-year contract, ATB raises increase incrementally to 25 percent. Management's current counteroffer grants 6.5-percent upticks for two years, and reaches 20 percent over four. Over time, this represents a considerable difference: tens of thousands of dollars at some rates.

As if to ensure that their reluctance at the bargaining table feels maximally galling, Kaiser Permanente has continued to grant CEO Gregory Adams millions of dollars in compensation per year, leading to his reliable appearance among the top three highest-paid chief nonprofit executives in the nation. And further congratulations may also be (bitterly) due, as the company itself has also recently attained record multibillion-dollar profits.

Nevertheless, Kaiser negotiators have not budged an inch on wages. Ultimately, despite the painstaking negotiations, Palmer felt that “nothing has been touched when it comes to those really large issues about workloads, templates, and being paid for all hours worked, as well as the local wage increases … At national there has really been no movement as well,” she said. “It's different this time around than in 2021. I feel like in 2021, Kaiser was still coming to the table and offering different things. They're not doing that.”

Kaiser disputed the characterization that its pay runs below market, noting that it had offered to boost wages by 21.5 percent over four years. In a statement, Kaiser wrote: “Taking the current economic environment into consideration, our across-the-board 4-year wage increases would normally have averaged 14 percent in total, to be consistent with estimated annual wage inflation. Our offer is significantly higher than that because from the beginning of the negotiations process, the union asked that contract raises consider their lower increases during the pandemic. Our strong offer boosts above-market pay, benefits, and career growth, and raises wages by 21.5 percent over four years.”

Traveling Blues

While it is true that management does regularly act to ease staffing shortages by recruiting extra help, they do so by bringing on travel nurses — akin to temps, or maybe gig workers or freelancers. They're paid fairly well, and Kaiser outlays considerable funds to make use of them.

Yet how could this major expenditure possibly be of any benefit, even from the vantage of pure self-interest? One possibility is that travel nurses, if not cheap, are less empowered and more expendable. Palmer agreed with this assessment. “I think that they see hiring more union workers as too difficult to deal with,” she said, “whereas they see hiring travelers or externalizing us as a really easy fix, instead of having to deal with bargaining in good faith with us.”

Madeline Litts is a registered nurse at Kaiser, as well as a shop steward who's also involved in a bargaining unit and the negotiations. As a one-time travel nurse herself, Litts made it clear that criticizing this state of affairs does not imply any personal antipathy toward other individual nurses, travel or otherwise. No matter how skilled and compassionate, travel nurses are just inevitably less familiar with the hospital and procedures than a full employee. Some research has found a correlation with their use and poorer patient outcomes. When they're used in lieu of permanent staff, Litts feels, there's a lesser degree “of shared interest, of a commitment there … I'm not anti-travel nurse. I just don't understand why a business wants to pay more to someone to be less committed.”

Litts says that in bargaining, management made it clear that they “would like to be able to [hire travelers] at-will, without any labor participation.” To help guard against bad hires, Litts and her colleagues asked management for at least a chance to give feedback on resumes. “And they said no. They don't want us to be able to vet each other.”

“I think the daily frustrations that have built up … there's a boiling point.”

Litts herself expressed uncertainty that management is careless enough to place profit over patient welfare. Of course, things are more complex than that. Still, whatever the good intentions of individual administrators — and there are surely many — it appears evident that impersonal, structural pressures are acting upon all involved, with or without their willing complicity.

As of now, it would seem that, if management remains intransigent through October 14, a system-wide strike remains the only recourse for the Kaiser staff of the AHU's member unions, both to protect their own livelihood and to stem some of the deleterious effects that pressure tactics and profiteering have inflicted on the Kaiser system.

Litts aptly summed up the state of mind of Kaiser staffers. As she told Truthout, “I think the daily frustrations that have built up … there's a boiling point. When you're feeling disrespected day to day, publicly disrespected, there's only so much any of us can take. We take pride in the work we do. We take pride in who we work with. So for it not to feel reciprocated — we don't want to make things easy for them when they're not trying to make things easy for us. We're going to keep showing up at the table and bargaining in good faith, because that's who we are.”

As Trump cracks down on political speech, independent media is increasingly necessary.

 American and Arab Pressure Can Ensure Israel and Hamas Reach a Durable Settlement

 Dennis Ross

If all goes to plan, by the beginning of Saturday, Israel and Hamas will start observing a cease-fire. Their weapons will fall silent, and Israeli troops will withdraw from their present positions to an agreed-on line further back in Gaza. Hamas, meanwhile will release all the living hostages in exchange for 250 Palestinian prisoners serving life sentences and an additional 1,750 Gazans that Israel has captured over the last two years. Humanitarian assistance will immediately flood into the area, and Palestinians will begin attempting to rehabilitate the enclave, remove the rubble, and resume limited commercial activity.

But U.S. President Donald Trump's peace plan is essentially divided into two phases, and these steps are just phase one. And although such measures are obviously difficult (given how long it has taken for Hamas and Israel to agree to them), they are far easier to implement than the proposed elements of phase two. This phase involves the disarmament of Hamas; Israel's further withdrawal to a buffer just inside Gazan territory, with a complete withdrawal once Gaza no longer threatens the country; the creation of a board of peace to oversee the enclave's governance and a technocratic group of Palestinians to administer it; an international stabilization force; and the actual reconstruction of and investment in the strip. It also includes genuinely reforming the Palestinian Authority—the organization that administers the West Bank—to set the stage for the political reunification of Gaza and the West Bank and a pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood.

Fulfilling these goals will involve haggling over a variety of both technically and politically fraught questions. Negotiators, for example, will have to determine how and when the IDF will withdraw, who will be in the international stabilization force that helps replace it, where that force will deploy, and what its mission is. (So far, the Egyptian and Emirati governments say the stabilization force will deploy to the crossing points and that Palestinian security forces trained by Egypt and Jordan will be responsible for law and order in the enclave's interior.) Both this force and the Israelis are likely to face serious problems, such as the real possibility that Hamas will try to subdue the clans in Gaza—including the al-Shabab, al-Astal, al-Manasi, al-Da'mush—that have been cooperating with Israel. The group would do so for no other reason than to maintain control of the strip. And it is not at all clear what anyone will do, or should do, if Hamas attempts to reassert itself. The Israelis and Hamas have very different expectations about where Gaza will go from here.

The problems and uncertainties are very real. Yet while the road ahead is hard, there is reason for hope. The very same forces that produced phase one of this agreement can be used to achieve phase two. The United States can keep up its pressure on Israel and the Arab states can keep up their pressure on Hamas. Washington and its partners can use the channels they have created to reach phase one to figure out the composition and parameters of the stabilization force. And Israel can keep working with Arab countries to set up a peaceful, better government in Gaza.

This cease-fire came together, in no small part, because U.S. President Donald Trump sent a clear message to all the parties involved that it was time to release the hostages and end the war. It was the latest illustration of a long-standing fact: when it comes to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the United States has great leverage. As Egyptian President Anwar Sadat said in 1977, in explaining his move to make peace with Israel, Washington holds “99 percent of the cards.” No one else, he realized, could move the country.

Consider the last few weeks, when Trump helped push Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu into agreeing to this deal. Netanyahu may have been able to resist U.S. President Joe Biden's push for peace by drawing on the support of Republicans, and thus dividing Washington. But he had no such option with Trump. There is no serious political constituency for any effort by Netanyahu to keep fighting over the objections of Trump—something the Israeli prime minister knows all too well. He did not want to test what Trump might do if he rejected his proposals.

Trump had another essential role to play in trying to end this war. The key Arab states and Turkey have the ability to exert leverage over Hamas. And these states want good relations with Trump and for him to have a stake in their own success—which means the American president has indirect sway with Hamas, as well. The Arab countries and Turkey, for example, apparently believed it was time to end the war, and thus applied real pressure on Hamas to be responsive to Trump's plan.

There are many reasons why Turkey and the Arab states want to be on good terms with Trump. Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan wants American F-35s. Saudi leader Mohammed bin Salman and Emirati leader Mohamed bin Zayid want American cooperation on artificial intelligence and increased U.S. military support. They took notice when Qatar received a security commitment from Trump that, at least on paper, is essentially equivalent to NATO's Article 5 collective defense provision. Trump, they realized, can promote their interests.

All the key Arab states—and especially the so-called Arab Quint (Egypt, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates)—desperately want an end to a war that at best complicates their plans to develop their economies and at worst threatens their regimes. The fighting is fostering anger among their publics, which can be mobilized in unpredictable and potentially dangerous ways. That meant they were looking for a way out that only Trump could get Israel to provide, and were happy to pressure and isolate Hamas in return.



There is a final reason why Hamas and Israel finally agreed to a cease-fire: Israelis are starting to recognize that although their extraordinary military achievements have changed the balance of power in the region, weakening Iran and its proxy network, they have lost the political war. Never before has their country been so isolated internationally. Many of Israel's traditional friends in Europe are leading the charge to recognize a Palestinian state, and some of them are decrying what they say are Israeli war crimes in Gaza. European publics have been protesting in huge numbers against Israel's actions. Trump has shielded Israel from much of this international pressure, but polling shows there has been a dramatic loss of support within even his own country, with American Democrats, independents, and younger Republicans now far less sympathetic toward Israel. Instinctively, many Israelis feel they cannot satisfy the outside world while still protecting their security and meeting their own needs. But for Israel, the cold reality is that its security will suffer more from remaining this isolated than it will from abandoning Netanyahu's goal: the complete subjugation of Hamas in Gaza (which required a seemingly endless campaign). Eventually, the prime minister seemed to agree it was time to find a way to end the war.

Hamas, furious about losing power and committed to weakening Israel, could try to violate the cease-fire's various terms. If so, it might spark renewed war. If the group moves to quickly recoup and the interim administration and stabilization force do nothing to stop it, Israel will act.

Hopefully, however, both this administration and force will fight back against any such effort by Hamas. The two countries most likely to invest in reconstruction—Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates—share Israel's goal of disarming Hamas and making sure it does not retain control over Gaza. And the broader constellation of forces—a powerful United States, a wider Arab world committed to helping end the conflict, and an Israel that wants the fighting to stop—are also cause for optimism. They mean the remaining obstacles can be overcome.

Implementing phase one will, by itself, create some momentum for phase two, including by reducing the incentives to resume fighting. No one will want to appear responsible for resuming the war. But this momentum will last only so long. If nothing else, the Trump administration must thus quickly work with its partners to present a clear understanding of what is meant by each of the remaining 20 points of the president's plan, and who will take which steps to implement each one. That means the administration must clarify how disarmament should be done. It should explain how much disarmament is required before Israel can move to the next phase of withdrawal. Washington and its partners will need to establish which forces will deploy to Gaza—and make sure they are not only at the crossing points. Palestinian security forces cannot be expected, from the outset, to assume responsibility for protecting the Gazan public. The United States and its allies must figure out whether militaries from outside the region will be part of the stabilization force, and Washington must make clear what it is prepared to do to support this force logistically, including when it comes to providing intelligence and coordinating with the Israelis. Similarly, the United States, the Arab states, and other interested parties need to figure out who and what will ramp up humanitarian assistance. They must find ways to ensure that such aid goes to those who most need it in Gaza and that it is not seized by Hamas or other armed militants.

There is a Palestinian public in Gaza that craves normality and is likely to be supportive of forces distributing assistance and safeguarding the public. But creating a workable security system that is capable of addressing all these problems will require tenacity and hard work. Trump and his foreign policy team (which likely needs to be expanded to preside over all the different issues) must remain focused and engaged, and hold every actor's feet to the fire.



The Arab states, meanwhile, must keep pressuring Hamas and the Palestinian Authority. These countries (or at least Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates) seem as if they are finally ready to assume much greater responsibility for the Palestinians. This marks a sea change. Arab countries have historically exploited the Palestinian issue as a political slogan but have taken little interest in solving it. They have viewed the conflict as the responsibility of the United States and Israel. When Washington tried to persuade the Arab states to pressure Palestinian leader Yasir Arafat into accepting U.S. President Bill Clinton's parameters for settling the conflict in December of 2000, none of them agreed. This was, in no small part, because the Arab states feared Arafat would accuse them of trying to force him to betray the Palestinian national cause. But there is no Palestinian leader today who has Arafat's stature, and leading Arab states understand that ignoring the Palestinian problem can threaten their own agendas and priorities. As a result, they are more likely to ensure that Hamas cannot control Gaza directly or indirectly and support steps on the ground to ensure it doesn't. To achieve a lasting peace, the Arab states must also insist that the Palestinian Authority carry out substantial reforms, such as sidelining Mahmoud Abbas, the organization's discredited leader, and replacing him with someone new who is internationally respected. Such measures are necessary if Gaza and the West Bank are to be politically unified. Arab countries know that the more they do to create a workable Palestinian administration, the more likely Trump is to press Israel not only to stop the war in Gaza but also to stop its creeping annexation of the West Bank.

The Israelis, for their part, must work with the Arab states in transforming Gaza. The government needs to support an overhaul of the enclave's educational system and, critically, endorse a reformed Palestinian Authority eventually assuming control over Gaza. Right now, Netanyahu is opposed to such measures, but he must realize that the Arab commitment to remaking Gaza will be to Israel's advantage. Arab countries, in turn, must remain willing to work with the Israeli government. That, in turn, requires repairing relations between Israel and many of these states, which have soured.

None of this will be easy. But the alternative—a return to fighting—would be worse. A committed Washington, in partnership with Arab countries, can thus make sure that talks between Hamas and Israel stay on track, and thus put a real stop to this terrible war.

            The Federal Aviation Administration reported a growing number of their facilities are short-staffed on Friday, including some which have caused delays for travelers.
    


            Phoenix Sky Harbor International airport will not have the normal number of staff in its control tower from 9 p.m. to 1 a.m. ET, but it is already experiencing departure delays due to staffing shortages in the facility that operates the surrounding airspace.
    


            Two separate parts of the Albuquerque Air Route Traffic Control Center, that manages flights over a large portion of the Southwest, is understaffed until 3 p.m. ET.
    


            The Central Florida TRACON, where controllers guide planes approaching or departing Orlando International Airport, will be short-staffed from 7 p.m. ET to 11 p.m. ET.
    


            Two different FAA operations that deal with traffic at Newark Liberty International Airport reported staffing problems earlier Friday. The control tower and the facility that handles flights approaching or departing the airport did not have their normal amount of workers, which led to delays.
    


            Not all staffing problems cause delays, as controllers can sometimes route planes to other airspace with more workers, but there are times slowing flights so a reduced number of staff can manage them is the only way to make everyone is safe.
    


            The reasons for the short staffing are not clear, but Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said Thursday a “small fraction” of controllers were “lashing out” because of the government shutdown and not going to work.
    


            Air traffic controllers, along with Transportation Security Administration officers, are considered essential employees and have to work during the shutdown, despite not being currently paid.
    


            Twelve FAA facilities saw staffing shortages Thursday, including airport towers, approach controls which handle arriving and departing flights as well as centers that handle flights en route.
    


            This busy holiday weekend travelers are being warned they could see delays and cancellations from the government shutdown at the airports.
    


            “It is safe to fly, but ATC staffing shortages strain the system and cause flights to be spaced out, slowing down everything. In some cases, flights may be delayed or even cancelled,” Airlines for America, the industry trade group, said in a statement.
    


            Thursday was the 12th busiest day so far in 2025, according to the Transportation Security Administration and the rest of the weekend is expected to be busy as well.
    


            “The bottom line is that anyone heading to the airport right now is encouraged to pack their patience,” Airlines for America added.
    


            The “safety and efficiency” of air travel in the United States depends on unpaid air traffic controllers showing up to work, the FAA administrator said in a memo to employees on Friday morning.
    


            “To the entire FAA team, both those continuing operations and those currently furloughed, thank you for your professionalism and resilience,” FAA Administrator Bryan Bedford said in the email. “Your efforts to keep thousands of flights operating safely each day are noticed and deeply appreciated.”
    


            On Thursday Duffy noted more than half of air traffic delays are now being caused by staffing shortages, as opposed to only 5% earlier this year.
    


            “As Secretary Duffy has said, staffing shortages have increased across the country. Air traffic controllers are still required to report to work and carry out their critical duties. The safety and efficiency of our airspace depend on them,” Bedford said in the memo.
    


            He also vowed to delay flights whenever necessary to make sure they are safe.
    


            “I also want to be very clear that safety will never be compromised. When staffing constraints occur, we will reduce the flow of air traffic into affected airports and centers to maintain safe operations,” Bedford said. “We will get through this together and continue delivering for the American people.”
    


            On Tuesday, air traffic controllers will receive a partial paycheck for hours worked before the shutdown. They will not be paid for the time they are working now until the government reopens.
    


            Duffy said on Thursday he will not allow air traffic controllers to use their position as a “bludgeon” for political purposes, including calling out sick during the government shutdown.
    


            There has been a shortage of air traffic controllers for years, so even a small number of unscheduled absences can lead to delayed flights
    


            “When we have small sick outs, if you will, it has massive impacts on the airspace,” the secretary said in an interview with CNN partner Scripps News. “We can't be held hostage, anywhere in government or in our lives, with people who are going to use their positions as a bludgeon.”
    


            Duffy noted most controllers are “great people” but he reiterated his commitment to fire the “small few” who chose not to come to work to protest the shutdown.
    


            “If they're sick, they're sick. I'm fine with that. But if they're not showing up to work, and they're calling out for other reasons, and it's coordinated and they collaborate on it, I don't want those people working in air traffic,” he said. “I'm not going to have them leverage our system, our air travel system, for political benefit. I don't like it, and so I'm willing to make changes that are necessary so that doesn't happen again in the future.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+national+news+site:cnn.com","Melania Trump says she has an ‘open channel' to Putin on Ukrainian children, and some have been reunited with family","https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/10/politics/melania-trump-putin-ukraine-russia","Fri, 10 Oct 2025 15:57:22 GMT","


            First lady Melania Trump said Friday that Russia has allowed eight Ukrainian children to reunite with their parents, following months of private discussions between Russian officials and the first lady's office centered on children separated from their families during the war.
    


            The first lady revealed that she and Russian President Vladimir Putin have had an “open channel” of communication since she wrote him a letter in August about the impact of the war in Ukraine on kids. She said the eight children were all returned to their families over the last 24 hours, with a commitment that the two sides will continue to work toward reunifying additional children displaced as part of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
    


            “This remains an ongoing effort,” Melania Trump said in a brief speech at the White House. “Plans are already underway to reunify more children in the immediate future. I hope peace will come soon. It can begin with our children.”
    


            The first lady's announcement comes as the Trump administration, however, has cut funding to a leading organization that tracks evidence of Russian war crimes, including the forced relocation of tens of thousands of Ukrainian children.
    


            The Ukraine Conflict Observatory was run by Yale's Humanitarian Research Lab and established with State Department backing in 2022 “to capture, analyze, and make widely available evidence of Russia-perpetrated war crimes and other atrocities in Ukraine.”
    


            The group produced reports on a slew of alleged Russian war crimes, including the extent of Moscow's efforts to relocate, re-educate, and sometimes militarily train or forcibly adopt out Ukrainian children.
    


Privately influential but publicly absent, Melania Trump is picking and choosing her moments this term



            Their database included the information and identities of over 30,000 Ukrainian children who were allegedly abducted by Russia across 100 locations, according to a source familiar with the data.
    


            The International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant for Putin for the alleged war crime of forcibly deporting Ukrainian children.
    


            As CNN reported in March, the administration terminated financial support for the Ukraine Conflict Observatory. Funding was temporarily restored later that month to allow the repository of evidence on the alleged Russian war crimes to be sent to the European Union's law enforcement agency, Europol.
    


Researchers have lost access to evidence of alleged Russian war crimes following Trump admin funding cut



            In June, a group of lawmakers called on the State Department to disburse approximately $8 million that the agency told Congress in late 2024 would be used to support the Ukraine Conflict Observatory's work. Two congressional aides said at the time that to their knowledge, the funding has not been disbursed.
    


            The Yale Humanitarian Research Lab has raised enough money through private donations to continue their work until January 1, their executive director said, but they don't know what will happen after that.
    


            President Donald Trump hand-delivered a “peace” letter on behalf of the first lady to Putin in August. The letter did not specifically reference the thousands of Ukrainian children who have allegedly been abducted by Russia since the war began, but urged Putin to consider the impact the conflict was having on children in general.
    


            Putin responded to Melania Trump in writing, the first lady said Friday, offering details about the Ukrainian children in Russia and offering to talk directly about the issue.
    


            “Since then, President Putin and I have had an open channel of communication regarding the welfare of these children,” Melania Trump said. “We have agreed to cooperate with each other for the benefit of all people involved in this war.”
    


            In addition to releasing the eight children, Melania Trump said that Russian officials have provided updates on the identities of some children and the social and medical services that they're receiving. She added that she's also pressed the country over those Ukrainians who were minors when the war started, but are now adults and still residing in Russia. Russian officials have agreed to work toward rejoining those adults in the near future, Melania Trump said.
    


            “My ongoing mission is twofold: To optimize a transparent free-flow exchange of health-related information surrounding all children who have (fallen) victim to this war,” Trump said, “and to facilitate the regular reunification of children with their families until each individual returns home.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+national+news+site:cnn.com","Firings of federal workers underway as government shutdown drags on, Trump budget chief announces","https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/10/politics/government-shutdown-federal-worker-firings","Fri, 10 Oct 2025 17:08:54 GMT","


            The Trump administration has begun firing federal workers, the White House's budget chief announced Friday, as Republicans look to maximize pressure on the Democratic Party more than a week into the government shutdown.
    


            “The RIFs have begun,” Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought posted on X, announcing the government-wide reductions in force that have been anticipated since federal funding lapsed on October 1.
    


            It was not immediately clear how many federal workers had received RIF – or reduction in force – notices, but an OMB spokesperson said the layoffs would be “substantial.”
    


Will the federal government shutdown affect you? Tell us about it



            “It will be substantial, and we regret that the Democrats have shut down the government and forced workers to be put in this position,” the official said.
    


            While the White House has repeatedly placed blame on congressional Democrats for not reopening the government, it is initiating layoffs during this shutdown by choice – administrations are not required to carry out firings when government funding lapses. The layoffs are separate from the furloughs that always occur when government funding runs out.
    


            Democrats on Capitol Hill swiftly criticized the move.
    


            “Once again: if President Trump & Russ Vought decide to do more mass firings, they are CHOOSING to inflict more pain on people. ‘Reductions in force' are not a new power these bozos get in a shutdown,” Washington Sen. Patty Murray, the top Democratic appropriator in the Senate, wrote on X. “We can't be intimidated by these crooks.”
    


            Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer also argued that “nobody's forcing Trump and Vought to do this. They don't have to do it; they want to,” calling the firings “deliberate chaos.”
    


            The White House declined to share specifics on the layoffs, including which agencies and workers were included in them.
    


            But several agencies told CNN that they had started conducting the reductions.
    


            “HHS employees across multiple divisions have received reduction-in-force notices as a direct consequence of the Democrat-led government shutdown,” an agency spokesperson told CNN. “All HHS employees receiving reduction-in-force notices were designated non-essential by their respective divisions. HHS continues to close wasteful and duplicative entities, including those that are at odds with the Trump administration's Make America Healthy Again agenda.”
    


            RIF notices have gone out to employees at the departments of Treasury, Education, Commerce, Homeland Security and Housing and Urban Development, according to department spokespeople and union representatives.
    


            Initially, the Trump administration promised to swiftly roll out mass layoffs of federal workers with the start of the government's lapse in funding, but – as CNN reported – the White House then appeared to shift strategy, holding off on doing so a bit longer as an increasing number of Republican lawmakers and Trump administration officials acknowledged the potential political perils of the move. Friday's announcement came on day 10 of the shutdown.
    


            Some furloughed workers have questioned how they would know they've been laid off since they have limited access to work email during the shutdown.
    


            Administration officials said employees impacted by the layoffs would also be notified by the US Postal Service, which remains operating during the government shutdown.
    


            The White House said furloughed employees can use government-issued equipment for purposes related to a shutdown, which include “checking for any Reduction in Force (RIF) updates.”
    


            Agencies must inform employees affected by a RIF at least 60 days before their termination date.
    


            The American Federation of Government Employees called the administration's move “disgraceful.”
    


            “In AFGE's 93 years of existence under several presidential administrations – including during Trump's first term – no president has ever decided to fire thousands of furloughed workers during a government shutdown,” Everett Kelley, the union's national president, said in a statement.
    


            AFGE, along with another union representing federal workers, filed a lawsuit in a California federal court seeking to stop the Trump administration from initiating the mass layoffs, calling them illegal.
    


            The unions pressed District Court Judge Susan Illston on Friday to immediately halt the RIFs now that the administration had started carrying them out. The filing comes after the unions last week asked the judge for a temporary restraining order to block the administration from carrying out its threat.
    


Shutdown starts to hit federal workers' paychecks



            “We will see you in court,” Skye Perryman, CEO of Democracy Forward, which is representing the unions, posted on X in response to Vought's post.
    


            Illston has not ruled on the requests but earlier this week ordered OMB to provide the status of RIF notices that are planned or in progress by 6 p.m. ET Friday. The judge also asked for information on which agencies would issue layoff notices and how many employees would receive them.
    


            Max Stier, CEO of the Partnership for Public Service, previously told CNN that the shutdown does not give the administration additional power to downsize the federal workforce. “There is no extra legal authority on their part to conduct RIFs on the basis of a shutdown,” he said Tuesday.
    


            In a statement Friday, Stier criticized the Trump administration for using “civil servants as hostages in this ongoing breakdown of our public institutions.”
    


            “These unnecessary and misguided reductions in force will further hollow out our federal government, rob it of critical expertise and hobble its capacity to effectively serve the public,” he said.
    


            The Trump administration has been planning for – and at some agencies, already conducting – widespread reductions in force since soon after the president took office. The layoffs were part of a multipronged effort to downsize the workforce that also included multiple incentive programs to convince employees to depart voluntarily.
    


            More than 2 million people work for the federal government. As of September 23, more than 201,000 civil servants had left federal service, according to the Partnership's tracker. The departments of Defense, Treasury and Agriculture saw the largest reductions.
    


            Trump had campaigned on overhauling the federal government and its workforce, whom he viewed as interfering with his ability to carry out his priorities during his firm term.
    


            In February, Trump signed an executive order telling department officials to begin preparations for sweeping layoffs. The OMB and Office of Personnel Management followed up with a memo instructing agencies to submit two-part plans to carry out the reorganization – including submitting lists of agency divisions and employees performing functions not mandated by law or regulation who are not considered essential employees during government shutdowns.
    


            Federal employee unions sued, but in July, the Supreme Court allowed agencies to proceed with their RIF plans, putting on hold a lower court order that had temporarily blocked Trump from taking those steps without approval from Congress.
    


            Some agencies, including HHS, have already laid off sizeable portions of their staff, while others walked back some of their plans. And still other departments found they had to rehire some workers in order to carry out necessary functions.

WASHINGTON (AP) — The White House budget office said Friday that mass firings of federal workers have started, an attempt by President Donald Trump's administration to exert more pressure on Democratic lawmakers as the government shutdown dragged into a 10th day.

Russ Vought, the director of the Office of Management and Budget, said on the social media site X that the “RIFs have begun,” referring to reduction-in-force plans aimed at reducing the size of the federal government.

A spokesperson for the budget office said the reductions are “substantial” but did not offer more details.

Employees at the departments of Education, Treasury, Homeland Security and Health and Human Services, as well as the Environmental Protection Agency, were set to receive the notices, according to spokespeople for the agencies and union representatives for federal workers. 

The aggressive move by Trump's budget office goes far beyond what usually happens in a government shutdown and escalates an already politically toxic dynamic between the White House and Congress. Talks to end the shutdown are almost nonexistent.

Typically, federal workers are furloughed but restored to their jobs once the shutdown ends, traditionally with back pay. Some 750,000 employees are expected to be furloughed during the shutdown, officials have said.

Government shutdownThe AP has journalists around the country covering the shutdown of the federal government. What questions do you have for them?

Some leading Republicans were highly critical of the administration's actions.




“I strongly oppose OMB Director Russ Vought's attempt to permanently lay off federal workers who have been furloughed due to a completely unnecessary government shutdown,” said Maine Sen. Susan Collins, the chair of the powerful Senate Appropriations Committee, who blamed the federal closure on Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. 

Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski called the announcement “poorly timed” and “yet another example of this administration's punitive actions toward the federal workforce.” She urged affected Alaskans to reach out to her office. 

For his part, Schumer said the blame for the layoffs rested with Trump.

“Let's be blunt: nobody's forcing Trump and Vought to do this,” Schumer said. “They don't have to do it; they want to. They're callously choosing to hurt people — the workers who protect our country, inspect our food, respond when disasters strike. This is deliberate chaos.”

The White House had previewed its tactics shortly before the government shutdown began on Oct. 1, telling all federal agencies to submit their reduction-in-force plans to the budget office for its review. 

It said reduction-in-force plans could apply to federal programs whose funding would lapse in a government shutdown, are otherwise not funded and are “not consistent with the President's priorities.”

On Friday, the Education Department was among the agencies hit by new layoffs, a department spokesperson said. A labor union for the agency's workers said the administration is laying off almost all employees below the director level at the Office of Elementary and Secondary Education, while fewer than 10 employees were being terminated at the agency's Office of Communications and Outreach. 

Notices of firings have also taken place at the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, which leads federal efforts to reduce risk to the nation's cyber and physical infrastructure, according to the Department of Homeland Security, where CISA is housed. The agency has been a frequent Trump target over its work to counter misinformation about the 2020 presidential election and the COVID-19 pandemic, and DHS said the layoffs were “part of getting CISA back on mission.” 

Federal health workers were also being fired, though a Department of Health and Human Services spokesman did not say how many or which agencies were being hit hardest. A spokesperson for the EPA, which also has unspecified number of layoffs, blamed the Democrats for the firings and said they can vote to reopen the government anytime.

An official for the American Federation of Government Employees, which represents federal workers and is suing the Trump administration over the firings, said in a legal filing Friday that the Treasury Department is set to issue layoff notices to 1,300 employees. 

The AFGE asked a federal judge to halt the firings, calling the action an abuse of power designed to punish workers and pressure Congress.

“It is disgraceful that the Trump administration has used the government shutdown as an excuse to illegally fire thousands of workers who provide critical services to communities across the country,” AFGE President Everett Kelley said in a statement.

Democrats have tried to call the administration's bluff, arguing the firings could be illegal, and had seemed bolstered by the fact that the White House had not immediately pursued the layoffs once the shutdown began.

But Trump signaled earlier this week that job cuts could be coming in “four or five days.”

“If this keeps going on, it'll be substantial, and a lot of those jobs will never come back,” he said Tuesday in the Oval Office as he met with Canada's prime minister, Mark Carney. 

Meanwhile, the halls of the Capitol were quiet Friday, the 10th day of the shutdown, with both the House and the Senate out of Washington and both sides digging in for a protracted shutdown fight. Senate Republicans have tried repeatedly to cajole Democratic holdouts to vote for a stopgap bill to reopen the government, but Democrats have refused as they hold out for a firm commitment to extend health care benefits.

Some Republicans on Capitol Hill have suggested that Vought's threats of mass layoffs have been unhelpful to bipartisan talks on the funding standoff.

And the top Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Committee, Sen. Patty Murray of Washington, said in a statement that the “shutdown does not give Trump or Vought new, special powers” to lay off workers.

“This is nothing new, and no one should be intimidated by these crooks,” she added.

Still, there was no sign that the top Democratic and Republican Senate leaders were even talking about a way to solve the impasse. Instead, Senate Majority Leader John Thune continued to try to peel away centrist Democrats who may be willing to cross party lines as the shutdown pain drags on.

“It's time for them to get a backbone,” Thune, a South Dakota Republican, said during a news conference.

The Partnership for Public Service, a nonpartisan organization that tracks federal service, says more than 200,000 civil servants have left since the start of this administration in January due to earlier firings, retirements and deferred resignation offers.

“These unnecessary and misguided reductions in force will further hollow out our federal government, rob it of critical expertise and hobble its capacity to effectively serve the public,” said the organization's president and CEO, Max Stier.

An explosives plant in rural Tennessee rocked by an explosion Friday that authorities said left 19 people missing and feared dead is owned by a company that processes explosives for the military, according to the company's website. 

The explosion at Accurate Energetic Systems' flattened a building on its 1,300-acre campus and shook houses miles away. Rescuers had to keep their distance for hours due to burning debris and risk of secondary blasts. The smoldering wreck could be seen in aerial footage by WTVF-TV, black smoke billowing up.

“There's nothing to describe. It's gone,” said an emotional Chris Davis, the Humphreys County Sheriff. He said multiple people were killed but declined to say how many, referring to the 19 missing as “souls.” Officials were still speaking to family members, some of whom had gathered at the plant.

The company website said it processes explosives and munitions for the military and aerospace and commercial demolition industries. Its facility has some eight buildings on a wooded hill near the town Bucksnort, some 60 miles (97 kilometers) southwest of Nashville.

Accurate Energetic Systems' executives did not immediately respond to emails seeking comment Friday, and a call to the company's phone was not answered.

The company sells explosive products for use ranging from structural demolition to strategic defense operations, according to its website. Some of the products listed for sale are designed by the U.S. military and approved for use for “foreign military units, police forces and commercial customers.”

Public records show that Accurate Energetic Systems has been awarded numerous military contracts going back years to process different types of munitions and explosives.




The contracts, which were awarded largely by the U.S. Army and Navy, were for a variety of products that ranged from bulk explosives to landmines and small breaching charges, including C4.

The company also uses the sprawling campus to test explosives, according to its website, measuring the velocity as well as impact on surrounding areas under different conditions. 

The website noted that it “rigorously adheres to the stringent security standards” of Defense Department security and safety protocols.

Officials at the Pentagon said that they were aware of the explosion and were looking into the situation.

Davis said investigators are trying to determine the cause of the explosion.

First responders searched the rubble for missing people Friday after a powerful blast ripped through an explosives manufacturing plant in rural Tennessee, sending plumes of smoke into the air and shaking homes miles away. 

Humphreys County Sheriff Chris Davis said 19 people were still missing and feared dead Friday afternoon.

“This has probably been one of the most devastating situations that I've been on in my career,” Davis said through tears.

Here is what to know as officials try to determine what caused the explosion:

Rescuers had to wait for hours to begin their search because of the burning field of debris and risks of secondary explosions at the site southwest of Nashville, authorities said. The area is now secure and there is no longer a risk.

There are casualties and injuries related to the explosion, but the Tennessee Emergency Management Agency hasn't shared any numbers because the Department of Health hasn't confirmed them, spokesperson Kristin Coulter said by telephone.

It is currently unknown how many people were inside of the building at the time.

The strength of the blast at Accurate Energetic Systems was felt by residents in Lobelville, which is a 20-minute drive away.

“I thought the house had collapsed with me inside of it,” Gentry Stover told The Associated Press by phone. “I live very close to Accurate and I realized about 30 seconds after I woke up that it had to have been that.”

Davis said he expected that the investigation would go on for days to re-create what could have caused the explosion just before 8 a.m. He cautioned that there wouldn't be a “short term explanation.”




Public records show that the company sold numerous types of weapons to the U.S. military and has been awarded military contracts to manufacture a variety of munitions and explosives.

The contracts, which were awarded largely by the Army and Navy, were for a variety of products that ranged from bulk explosives and landmines to small breaching charges used to get through doors.

The manufacturing plant sits on 1,300 acres in Bucksnort, Tennessee, an unincorporated rural community approximately 60 miles (96 kilometers) southwest of Nashville. There are eight plant buildings that manufacture, store and research explosives for customers beyond just the military, including aerospace, oil and other commercial demolition industries.

The company also uses the sprawling campus to test explosives, according to its website, measuring the velocity of explosions as well as their impact on surrounding areas under varying environmental conditions. 

The company's website noted that it “rigorously adheres to the stringent security standards” of Defense Department security and safety protocols.

The Nobel Peace Prize prize has long been coveted by Trump, who said during his 2024 presidential campaign that he would resolve the war between Russia and Ukraine in just one day. Opposition activist María Corina Machado of Venezuela won it on Friday.

The White House budget office said Friday that mass firings of federal workers have started in an attempt to exert more pressure on Democratic lawmakers as the government shutdown continues.

Russ Vought, the director of the Office of Management and Budget, said on the social media site X that the “RIFs have begun,” referring to reduction-in-force plans aimed at reducing the size of the federal government.

Employees at the departments of Education, Treasury, Homeland Security and Health and Human Services, as well as the Environmental Protection Agency, were set to receive the notices, according to spokespeople for the agencies and union representatives for federal workers.

The aggressive move by President Donald Trump's budget office goes far beyond what usually happens in a government shutdown and escalates an already politically toxic dynamic between the White House and Congress. Talks to end the shutdown are almost nonexistent.

Other news we're following:








The contracts announced Friday are the first to be funded by $50 billion set aside in a bill the president signed in July. They also draw on money left over from 2021.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem waived environmental and other legal reviews in California and New Mexico to expedite construction.

Seven contracts were awarded to a company identified as BCCG Joint Venture in a U.S. Customs and Border Protection statement. Construction is to take place in California, Arizona, New Mexico and Texas.

The first Trump administration built more than 450 miles (720 kilometers) of wall, covering nearly one-fourth of the border.

The president, giving his reaction to the award, listed off peace efforts he made while in office this year but said that when it comes to the Nobel Peace Prize, “You could also say it was given out for '24, and I was running for office in '24.”

There is some truth to that: There is a Feb. 1 deadline to be nominated for the 2025 award, which fell just a week and a half into his second term.

Trump said Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado called him after her win and told him, “I'm accepting this in honor of you because you really deserved it.”

He then joked: “I didn't say, ‘Then give it to me.'”

“I think she might have,” Trump added.

The president also confirmed that he will deliver an address to the Knesset, the Israeli parliament, and that he expects to meet with “leaders from all over the world” in Egypt.

Trump expressed confidence that a ceasefire, which went into effect earlier Friday, will hold.

“Hopefully, you're going to have success or as I call it everlasting success,” he said.

“I'm going to be there regardless,” the president told reporters during an Oval Office appearance for an announcement on prescription drug pricing.

The leaders are expected to meet at the end of October on the sidelines of a regional conference in South Korea.

Trump had said earlier on social media that there didn't seem to be a reason to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping anymore because of export controls the country placed on rare earths.

He said in the Oval Office that China's move was unexpected.

The president said the ceremony will be held in the East Room of the White House when he returns from his Middle East trip.

Both Pfizer and AstraZeneca will offer medications through the site, which the administration says will allow people to buy drugs directly from manufacturers.

The website's landing page features two very large pictures of Trump and a promise that the site is “Coming Soon” in January 2026.

It says at the bottom that the website was “Designed in DC by The National Design Studio,” which was created by executive order in August and is being led by Airbnb co-founder Joe Gebbia.

A monthslong calm on Wall Street shattered as the S&P 500 sank 2.7% in its worst day since April; the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 878 points, or 1.9%; and the Nasdaq composite fell 3.6%.

Stocks had been heading for a slight gain in the morning, until Trump took to his social media platform and said he's considering “a massive increase of tariffs” on Chinese imports. He's upset at restrictions China has placed on exports of its rare earths, which are materials that are critical for the manufacturing of everything from consumer electronics to jet engines.

The ratchet higher in tensions between the world's largest economies led to widespread drops across Wall Street, with roughly six out of every seven stocks within the S&P 500 falling. Nearly everything weakened, from Big Tech companies like Nvidia and Apple to stocks of smaller companies looking to get past uncertainty about tariffs and trade.

Late in the afternoon, the president brought the press into the Oval Office to announce that drug manufacturer AstraZeneca will offer “major discounts” on prescriptions.

He touted it as “another historic achievement in our quest to lower drug prices for all Americans.”

The president says he's placing an additional 100% tax on Chinese imports starting Nov. 1 or sooner. He cited Chinese export controls on rare earths.

If Trump goes ahead with it, the move would push tariff rates close to levels that in April fanned fears of a steep recession and financial market chaos.

Trump made the announcement on his social media site. He said the date for imposing the tariff would depend on “any further actions or changes taken by China.”

The Republican president is known for backing down from his threats.

“It is appalling that the Trump administration is using the government shutdown as an excuse to fire federal workers, including dedicated EPA employees who provide critical services to communities across the country,” said Justin Chen, president of American Federation of Government Employees Council 238, which represents EPA workers.

The Environmental Protection Agency said it has begun an unspecified number of layoffs. A spokesperson blamed congressional Democrats, saying they “have chosen to shut down the government and brought about this outcome.”

Chen said using EPA jobs “as political leverage is an unprecedented and illegal abuse of power,” adding that they will weaken the agency workforce and thus pose a direct threat to public health and safety.

Rachel Gittleman, president of AFGE Local 252, said the Trump administration is laying off almost all employees below the director level at the agency's Office of Elementary and Secondary Education. The office was down to about 165 employees after mass firings that nearly halved the Education Department in March.

The office oversees much of the department's grantmaking activities to school districts. It supports work ranging from helping schools affected by natural disasters to allocating funding for teacher training and disbursing money allocated by Congress.

Fewer than 10 employees were being terminated at the Education Department's Office of Communications and Outreach. It will eliminate one of two teams remaining in the office after the March layoffs.

The union said it's unclear exactly how many Education Department staffers are being laid off as part of mass firings across the federal government Friday.

As James' indictment provokes harsh condemnations from high-profile Democrats – including allegations of “tyranny” and “political retribution” – one party member is reserving judgment.

On Friday, Eric Adams, the outgoing mayor of New York City, repeatedly evaded questions about the prosecution, saying only that he would “let the process play out.”

“Don't start asking me about what do I think about what's going on now,” he added, launching into a lengthy broadside about the lack of support he received following his own federal indictment. “I want to know what did you think about when my life was destroyed.”

Adams' corruption case was dropped earlier this year following another norm-breaking intervention by Trump's Justice Department. The Democratic mayor has since refused to criticize the president publicly and recently met with Trump intermediaries to discuss the possibility of accepting a federal job in exchange for dropping out of the mayoral race.

Adams has since abandoned his re-election campaign but says he hasn't received any formal offers to join the Trump administration.

Virginia's two senators, Democrats Mark Warner and Tim Kaine, say the Trump administration's firing of thousands of federal workers is not an unfortunate byproduct of the government shutdown, “but a deliberate choice.”

The senators represent a state that will be predominantly affected by the layoffs. They said the president and his budget director, Russell Vought, are “reckless ideologues willing to inflict real pain on hardworking Americans to score political points.”

“It's irresponsible, it's cruel, and it won't work,” they wrote in a joint statement.

In a speech earlier this year, Trump said America's first president was a “great general” who was also a “great executive and a true statesman.”

The statue belongs to the National Park Service and is a 1992 reproduction of the original white marble statue on display at the Virginia State Capitol in Richmond, according to the White House. The original was made by French artist Jean-Antoine Houdon.

The statue sits at the edge of the Rose Garden in an area where first lady Melania Trump had installed a different work of art during her husband's first term in office.

Homeland Security says that layoffs are happening at the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency.

The Department did not say how many people would be laid off.

The agency is one of the smaller components within the sprawling Department of Homeland Security. As of May, there were about 2,540 employees at CISA compared to a total Homeland Security staff of roughly 270,000 people.

CISA was formed in 2018 during the first Trump administration and is charged with protecting the nation's critical infrastructure.

The agency has been a frequent target of the Trump administration and its allies over the agency's work to counter misinformation about the 2020 presidential election and the COVID-19 pandemic.

“I strongly oppose OMB Director Russ Vought's attempt to permanently lay off federal workers who have been furloughed due to a completely unnecessary government shutdown,” said Collins, the chair of the powerful Senate Appropriations Committee.

“Their work is incredibly important to serving the public,” she said in a statement, adding that “arbitrary layoffs” cause harm to families in her state of Maine “and throughout our country.”

Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer says nobody is forcing President Donald Trump and his budget director, Russell Vought, to fire thousands of federal workers.

“They don't have to do it. They want to,” Schumer said in a statement. “They're callously choosing to hurt people -- the workers who protect our country, inspect our food, respond when disasters strike. This is deliberate chaos.”

Schumer said the way forward is simple: stop the attacks and come to the negotiating table and reopen the government.

The unions cited Vought's social-media post and said they've begun receiving credible information that the Office of Management and Budget has directed federal agencies government-wide to begin issuing layoff notices.

They argue that firing federal employees during a shutdown is an unlawful abuse of power designed to punish workers and pressure Congress and violates laws that govern how shutdowns are supposed to function.

The lawsuit was first filed in federal court in San Francisco last week by the group Democracy Forward. The plaintiffs are the American Federation of Government Employees and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees.

Illinois Sens. Dick Durbin and Tammy Duckworth said they were denied access Friday to a federal immigration enforcement building outside Chicago, the site of confrontations between protesters and federal agents.

“It is appalling that two United States senators are not allowed to visit this facility,” Duckworth said. “What are you afraid of? What are you afraid of? You don't hide, you don't run away when you're proud of what you're doing.”

The two Democrats were at the building in Broadview where National Guard members had assembled Thursday. Hours later, a judge halted the Trump administration's deployment of troops in northern Illinois for at least 14 days.

Durbin and Duckworth said they wanted to see the Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility as part of their congressional oversight authority. ICE processes immigrants there before taking them elsewhere. Illinois lawmakers said they were denied access in the summer.

A labor union for federal employees is asking a federal judge for a restraining order to halt the White House's plans to fire federal workers during the government shutdown.

The American Federation of Government Employees was already challenging the Trump administration for threatening to perform the mass firings during the shutdown, arguing that the layoffs violate the laws that govern how shutdowns are supposed to function and are an unlawful abuse of power designed to punish workers and put pressure on Congress

In a statement, the union president, Everett Kelley called it “disgraceful that the Trump administration has used the government shutdown as an excuse to illegally fire thousands of workers who provide critical services to communities across the country.”

Attorney General Pam Bondi said at a news conference Friday in Tampa that a California man has been charged with sending a threatening letter to conservative podcaster Benny Johnson, who lives in the Tampa area. 

She identified the suspect as 69-year-old George Russell Isbell Jr.. An FBI criminal complaint filed in Tampa federal court contains a copy of the letter, which compares Johnson to slain activist Charlie Kirk and makes threats of violence. 

Bondi would not say whether Isbell took any steps to carry out a threat, but said the Justice Department is extra vigilant about political violence. 

“We are going to catch you if you do something like this,” Bondi said. “We cannot allow political violence to continue.” Johnson and his wife, Katelyn, attended the news conference and expressed gratitude that an arrest was made. “This has to stop,” Benny Johnson said. 

Court documents show Isbell, who lives in the San Diego area, is charged with mailing threatening communications. His public defender in California did not immediately return an email seeking comment on the charge.

The president returned to the White House from his “semiannual physical” around 2:15 p.m. Friday, slightly ahead of schedule.

He did not answer questions from reporters upon his arrival. The White House has not indicated when it would release results or more information about his exams from Friday.

Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, Oregon Gov. Tina Kotek and California's Gavin Newsom warned in Newsom's podcast Friday. The governors also condemned the deployment of military troops to Chicago and Portland.

They said they wouldn't be surprised to see federal law enforcement officers at voting places next year during the midterm elections.

“This is a preview of things to come at voting booths and polling places all across the country,” Newsom said. “This is about something much insidious than just control in the short run.”

Kotek met with Secretary Kristi Noem when she was in Portland earlier this week, but said “it's hard to have a rational conversation with irrational people.”

A spokesperson for the department has confirmed that it will lose even more staff, though details weren't immediately provided.

The department -- which Trump wants to eliminate -- had about 4,100 employees when he took office in January but its workforce was nearly halved amid mass layoffs in the administration's first months.

The agency had about 2,500 employees when the government shut down on Oct. 1.

Trump administration officials said furloughed federal health workers are being fired “as a direct consequence” of the government shutdown, but they did not say how many or which agencies were being hit hardest. 

A U.S. Department of Health and Human Services spokesman confirmed the terminations in an email Friday, saying everyone receiving a notice was designated as non-essential. 

“HHS continues to close wasteful and duplicative entities, including those that are at odds with the Trump administration's Make America Healthy Again agenda,” said the spokesman, Andrew Nixon. 

Some employees at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, one of the HHS agencies, on early Friday afternoon said they had not heard of anyone receiving a notice yet.

Federal prosecutors have obtained a grand jury indictment against a woman and man accused of using their vehicles to strike and then box in a Border Patrol agent's vehicle last Saturday in Chicago.

The agent exited his car and fired five shots at Marimar Martinez, 30, who was treated and released. The indictment filed Thursday formalizes the initial charges of assaulting a federal officer with a dangerous weapon – a vehicle -- that were filed Sunday against Martinez and Anthony Ruiz, 21.

Because of the indictment, probable cause hearings for Martinez and Ruiz that were scheduled for Friday were canceled. Future court dates were not immediately set.The two were released Monday pending trial. Martinez's lawyer claimed then that body camera footage contradicts the government's narrative of her actions.

The S&P 500 dropped 2% after President Donald Trump shattered a monthslong calm on Wall Street by threatening to crank tariffs higher on China. 

The main measure of Wall Street's health is heading toward its worst loss since April. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 622 points, and the Nasdaq composite sank 2.7%. 

Stocks had been on track for a slight gain in the morning until Trump took to his social media platform and said he's considering a massive increase of tariffs on Chinese imports. He's upset at the restrictions China has placed on exports of its rare earths.

A federal judge late Thursday ordered ICE to temporarily remove a fence outside an ICE facility in the western Chicago suburb of Broadview.

The Village of Broadview sued DHS, accusing them of erecting an 8-foot-tall fence to illegally block the public street outside the facility, creating problems for local emergency services trying to access the area. The ICE facility has been the site of intense protests over the last few weeks.

Broadview Mayor Katrina Thompson said the decision was a “validation of local law and, most importantly, a decisive win for public safety.” 

She said it “remains to be seen if ICE will respect the judge's order and dismantle this hazard immediately, or if they will continue their pattern of defiance.”

The White House budget office said Friday that mass firings of federal workers have started in an attempt to exert more pressure on Democratic lawmakers as the government shutdown continues.

Russ Vought, the director of the Office of Management and Budget, said on the social media site X that the “RIFs have begun,” referring to reduction-in-force plans aimed at reducing the size of the federal government.

The White House previewed that it would pursue the aggressive layoff tactic shortly before the government shutdown began on Oct. 1, telling all federal agencies to submit their reduction-in-force plans to the budget office for its review.

Sen. John Thune is showing no sign of backing away from his current tactic of pressing Democrats to vote for a stopgap government funding bill.

Thune, a South Dakota Republican, has tried to peel away Democratic senators to vote to advance the bill. So far, it hasn't worked. Despite repeated votes on the bill since the government shutdown, the voting pattern has not changed, leaving Republicans five votes short of advancing the legislation.

Yet Thune at a news conference laid down a challenge to any Democrat who may be thinking about crossing party lines: “All it takes is a little backbone, a little courage on behalf of five Democrats.”

MIT President Sally Kornbluth said she “cannot support” the proposal that calls for universities to adopt Trump's political agenda in exchange for favorable access to federal funding.

MIT was one of nine universities invited last week to sign a compact the White House billed as providing benefits including “substantial and meaningful federal grants.” 

Leaders of the University of Texas system said they were honored its flagship university in Austin was invited, but most other campuses have remained silent as they review the document.

First lady Melania Trump says eight children displaced by the Russia-Ukraine war have been reunited with their families after ongoing talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Melania Trump in August wrote a letter to Putin and had her husband hand-deliver it during his meeting with the Russian president in Alaska.

Putin's invasion of Ukraine has resulted in Russia taking Ukrainian children out of their country so that they can be raised as Russian.

Correction: A previous version of this post mistakenly said only Ukrainian children were reunited with their families.

Trump says “there seems to be no reason” to meet with Chinese leader Xi Jinping as part of an upcoming trip to South Korea after China has restricted exports of rare earths needed for American industry.

Trump suggested that he was looking at a “massive increase” of import taxes on Chinese products in response to Xi's moves.

“One of the Policies that we are calculating at this moment is a massive increase of Tariffs on Chinese products coming into the United States of America,” Trump posted on Truth Social. “There are many other countermeasures that are, likewise, under serious consideration.”

 The White House says that the president's Friday afternoon announcement in the Oval Office is aimed at reducing drug prices.

It follows Trump announcing late last month that his administration had reached an agreement with Pfizer aiming to reduce the prices of its U.S. prescription drug to be similar to the lowest prices paid by other developed nations.

The Venezuelan opposition leader said in a statement that she wanted to dedicate the award to the U.S. president for support of her cause, along with dedicating it to the people of her country.

“We are on the threshold of victory and today, more than ever, we count on President Trump, the people of the United States, the peoples of Latin America, and the democratic nations of the world as our principal allies to achieve Freedom and democracy,” Machado said in a statement on X.

Johnson is making clear he won't be bringing House lawmakers back to Washington until the Senate passes a government funding bill.

The House has not held votes for about three weeks. 

It could take up other issues besides a government funding bill, and Democrats have described the situation as House Republicans going on vacation.

But Johnson said members are working diligently in their districts to help constituents.

“We will come back here and get back to legislative session as soon as the Senate Democrats turn the lights back on,” Johnson said.

Steven Cheung, the White House communications director, made the comment on X Friday as he reacted to Trump being passed over for the Nobel Peace Prize on Friday despite jockeying from his fellow Republicans, various world leaders and — most vocally — himself.

Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado received the award.

Cheung did not comment on Machado's recognition but said Trump “has the heart of a humanitarian, and there will never be anyone like him who can move mountains with the sheer force of his will.”













This morning, Trump is having his appointment at Walter Reed Medical Center. At 3 p.m., he will return to the White House before a 5 p.m. announcement.

At 11 a.m., first lady Melania Trump is expected to make an announcement as well.

Speaker Mike Johnson is highlighting the prospect of 1.3 million military service members missing a paycheck next week as the federal government shutdown continued Friday.

Also, the next paycheck for civilian workers will be a partial one. He's blaming Democratic lawmakers for that scenario during a press conference and emphasizing that Republicans have voted multiple times to keep the government funded temporarily.

“You've got millions of American families who will now have to figure out how to make their mortgage, how to cover the rent, pay the car note, keep food on the table because Democrats, Chuck Schumer and his colleagues in the Senate are here playing games,” Johnson said.

National Guard troops were seen patrolling in Memphis for the first time on Friday, as part of President Donald Trump's federal task force, which faces multiple legal challenges.

National Guard troops have been seen patrolling in Memphis for the first time, as part of Trump's federal task force. 

The deployment comes a day after a federal judge in Illinois blocked the deployment of troops in the Chicago area for at least two weeks. 

It was unclear Friday how many Guard members were on the ground in Memphis or were expected to arrive later. Tennessee Republican Gov. Bill Lee supports the deployment.

 Senators are leaving Washington after a late night of votes Thursday, but without making progress towards ending the government shutdown.

The Senate is not scheduled to meet again until Tuesday, leaving many government services shuttered, federal employees furloughed and no scheduled payday for military members and other federal employees.

The nation's third shutdown in 12 years is once again raising anxiety levels among service members and their families because those in uniform are working without pay. While they would receive back pay once the impasse ends, many military families live paycheck to paycheck. During previous shutdowns, Congress passed legislation to ensure that troops kept earning their salaries, but time is running out before they miss their first paycheck in less than a week.

“There are so many things that Congress can't agree on right now,” said Kate Horrell, the wife of a Navy veteran whose Washington, D.C., company provides financial advice to military families. “I don't want to assume that they're going to be able to agree on this.”

The economic impact will ripple through regions with large military footprints, like coastal Virginia, home to the nation's largest Navy base and several other installations. The area's 88,000 active duty service members and their families likely have pulled back significantly on spending, said Rick Dwyer, executive director of the Hampton Roads Military and Federal Facilities Alliance, an advocacy group.

The U.S. is sending about 200 troops to Israel to help support and monitor the ceasefire deal in Gaza as part of a team that includes partner nations, nongovernmental organizations and private-sector players, U.S. officials said Thursday.

The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss details that were not authorized for release, said U.S. Central Command is going to establish a “civil-military coordination center” in Israel that will help facilitate the flow of humanitarian aid as well as logistical and security assistance into the territory wracked by two years of war.

The remarks provide some of the first details on how the ceasefire deal would be monitored and that the U.S. military would have a role in that effort. After Israel and Hamas agreed to the first phase of a Trump administration plan to halt the fighting, a litany of questions remain on next steps, including Hamas disarmament, a withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza and a future government in the territory.

New York Attorney General Letitia James was indicted Thursday in a mortgage fraud case that President Donald Trump urged his Justice Department to bring after vowing retribution against some of his biggest political enemies.

James, a Democrat who infuriated Trump after his first term with a lawsuit alleging that he built his business empire on lies about his wealth, was charged with bank fraud and making false statements to a financial institution in connection with a home purchase in Norfolk, Virginia, in 2020.

The top federal prosecutor for the Eastern District of Virginia, a former Trump aide, personally presented the case to the grand jury weeks after she was thrust into the role amid the administration's pressure to deliver charges.

The indictment, two weeks after a separate criminal case charging former FBI Director James Comey with lying to Congress, is the latest indication of the Trump administration's norm-busting determination to use the law enforcement powers of the Justice Department to pursue the president's political foes and public figures who once investigated him.

 Fox News senior White House correspondent Jacqui Heinrich has the latest on the impact of air traffic control staffing issues amid the government shutdown on 'Special Report.'

A ground stop was issued Friday afternoon at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport in connection to a fire alarm incident involving ""strong gas fumes,"" the FAA confirmed. 

Planes were grounded around 5 p.m. ET. 

The FAA said the ground stop went into effect after an alarm was triggered by a ""strong"" odor of gas fumes. 

The airport's air traffic control tower was evacuated, and the first responders are at the scene.

American Principles Project President Terry Schilling praises President Donald Trump's performance in his second term while stressing that he should be nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize.

Russian President Vladimir Putin praised President Donald Trump's efforts to negotiate peace deals around the world, specifically citing his work brokering a truce between Israel and Hamas.

""He's really doing a lot to resolve such complex crises that have lasted for years and even decades,"" Putin said at a summit in Dushanbe, Tajikistan, where he met with leaders of nations once part of the former Soviet Union.

The remarks came in response to a question about whether he felt Trump had been passed over for the Nobel Peace Prize.

The award was given Friday morning to Venezuelan opposition leader and democracy activist María Corina Machado.

""There have been cases where the committee has awarded the Nobel Peace Prize to people who have done nothing for peace,"" Putin said. ""A person comes — good or bad — and [gets it] in a month, in two months — boom. For what? He didn't do anything at all.

""In my view, these decisions have done enormous damage to the prestige of this prize,"" he continued.

In September, Trump alluded to the likelihood that he would again be passed over for the Nobel Prize despite helping to end several conflicts.

""If this works out, we'll have eight — eight in eight months. That's pretty good,"" Trump said during remarks to dozens of top generals and admirals in Quantico, Virginia. ""Nobody's ever done that. Will you get the Nobel Prize? Absolutely not.

""They'll give it to some guy that didn't do a damn thing,"" he continued. ""They'll give it to the guy who wrote a book about the mind of Donald Trump and what it took to solve the wars. The Nobel Prize will go to a writer.""

An Indiana mother who vanished more than a week ago has been found alive in a nearby forest, just days after flames broke out in her home in what authorities are calling a ""suspicious"" fire.

According to the Putnam County Sheriff's Office, around 5:30 p.m. on Oct. 8, dispatchers received a 911 call from 46-year-old Britney Gard, who said she was lost in the Hall Woods Nature Preserve, east of Bainbridge, Indiana. The location was about 2½ miles from her residence, officials said.

""Britney was quickly found by Putnam County Sheriff's deputies with the assistance of Indiana Conservation Officers, an Indiana State Police detective, Bainbridge Fire Department personnel and excellent directions from our 911 dispatchers,"" Sheriff Jerrod E. Baugh said in a statement.

Gard was evaluated by medical personnel before being taken to a hospital for further treatment. Authorities have not disclosed her current condition.

""The Putnam County Sheriff's Office is not currently looking for any individuals of interest in this missing person investigation of Britney Gard,"" the statement continued. ""There is no current threat to the general public in this case.""

Baugh expressed gratitude for the coordinated search effort.

""It is with great relief that we were able to find Ms. Gard last evening and bring this missing person case to a close,"" Baugh said. ""We would like to thank her family and all of the organizations that worked with us around the clock.""

Baugh added that detectives and staff ""continued to work tirelessly with Ms. Gard's family to bring her home"" and emphasized that the case remains under investigation.

""We will not be releasing any further details in this case at this time,"" he said.

Gard was reported missing after a fire broke out at her Putnam County home Oct. 1. Fire crews extinguished the blaze, which was contained to one portion of the residence, but could not locate Gard inside, according to the sheriff's office.

Investigators said the fire appeared ""suspicious in nature."" Family members and authorities were unable to reach Gard after the fire, prompting days of searches through fields, wooded areas and ponds near her home.

Gard's daughter, who had been at a volleyball game that evening, returned home to find emergency crews and was told her mother was missing, according to WRTV.

The outlet also reported that Gard's purse and ID were left behind. 

Family members — including Gard's four sisters — traveled from across the country to help with search efforts during the week she was missing, WRTV reported.

Authorities have not released further details about how Gard ended up in the wooded preserve or the cause of the fire.

""Please continue to keep Ms. Gard's family, our investigators and emergency personnel in your prayers,"" Baugh said.

IDF combat veteran Benjamin Anthony breaks down the deal and the expectations from Hamas on 'Fox & Friends First.'

U.S. service members will arrive in Israel by Sunday to oversee the implementation of the ceasefire with Hamas, Fox News has learned. 

The U.S. troops, all of whom come from the U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM), will set up the civil military command center as the ceasefire unfolds, a senior U.S. official said. 

Some of the service members are coming from the U.S., and some were already in the region. Most are with the Army. 

They are experts in logistics, security, engineering and transportation.

None of the troops will be going into Gaza. 

Navy Adm. Brad Cooper, head of CENTCOM, attended talks in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt, with U.S. Special Envoy Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, a former White House advisor and President Donald Trump's son-in-law, a U.S. official confirmed. 

Cooper then flew to Israel and is in the country.

The Israeli government approved and signed the first phase of the Trump-brokered ceasefire deal in Gaza overnight Thursday, kicking off a 24-hour countdown clock during which time troops had to withdraw to a predetermined position.

""Following the political echelon's instructions and due to the situational assessment, the IDF has begun operational preparations ahead of the implementation of the agreement. As part of this process, preparations and a combat protocol are underway to transition to adjusted deployment lines soon. The IDF continues to be deployed in the area and prepared for any operational development,"" the IDF wrote on X.

Hours later, the IDF confirmed that the ceasefire commenced and that ops had positioned themselves ""along the updated deployment lines.""

Witkoff said Friday morning that CENTCOM confirmed the IDF had completed the first phase of its withdrawal from Gaza, which allowed the ceasefire to go into effect at noon local time, and Hamas' 72-hour window to release the hostages had begun.

CENTCOM's role in monitoring the ceasefire with Qatar and Turkey was a big reassurance to the negotiating parties, according to those involved in the talks.

U.S. Ambassador to NATO Matt Whitaker reacts to Maria Corina Machado winning this year's award as President Trump strikes a deal between Israel and Hamas and ramps up pressure to end the Ukraine-Russia war.

Venezuelan opposition leader and newly minted Nobel Peace Prize winner María Corina Machado dedicated the award on Friday to both President Donald Trump and the ""suffering people of Venezuela.""

Machado, a leading figure in the resistance against Venezuela's ruling party, took to X to acknowledge the honor and to praise Trump for his support.

""This recognition of the struggle of all Venezuelans is a boost to conclude our task: to conquer Freedom,"" Machado said. ""We are on the threshold of victory and today, more than ever, we count on President Trump, the people of the United States, the peoples of Latin America, and the democratic nations of the world as our principal allies to achieve Freedom and democracy.

She added, ""I dedicate this prize to the suffering people of Venezuela and to President Trump for his decisive support of our cause!""

Machado has previously been outspoken in her support for the Trump administration's actions against Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro's regime and the country's narco-trafficking network.

Last month, following reports that a U.S. strike killed 11 alleged Tren de Aragua narco-terrorists transporting drugs from Venezuela, Machado appeared on ""Fox & Friends"" to discuss Maduro's leadership, saying it was time for him ""to go.""

""On behalf of the Venezuelan people, I want to tell you how grateful we are to President Trump and the administration for addressing the tragedy that Venezuela is going through,"" Machado said at the time. "" … Maduro has turned Venezuela into the biggest threat to the national security of the U.S. and the stability of the region.""

Trump has also been a vocal critic of Maduro, and the U.S. is among several countries that do not recognize Maduro's government as legitimate, according to Reuters.

In last year's election, Machado rallied millions of Venezuelans to reject Maduro. She was described as a ""brave and committed champion of peace"" by Joergen Watne Frydnes, chair of the Norwegian Nobel Committee.

""She is receiving the Nobel Peace Prize for her tireless work promoting democratic rights for the people of Venezuela and for her struggle to achieve a just and peaceful transition from dictatorship to democracy,"" Frydnes said.

The New York Giants shocked the Philadelphia Eagles, beating them 34-17. Colin Cowherd asks what went wrong for the Eagles and whether Jaxson Dart is the Giants' franchise QB. 

The third start of rookie quarterback Jaxson Dart's career was undoubtedly his best. The rookie threw for 195 yards in the New York Giants 34-17 win over the Philadelphia Eagles.

But before Dart could officially celebrate the second victory of his NFL career, the 22-year-old entered the medical tent to be evaluated for a possible concussion. Russell Wilson, who was the Giants' starter for the first three games, briefly entered Thursday night's game.

Giants head coach Brian Daboll became visibly upset once Dart left the game. The team's head physician, Dr. Scott A. Rodeo, then got caught in the crosshairs.

Daboll appeared to scream at Dr. Rodeo during a heated exchange while other medical personnel checked Dart for a head injury. The rookie quarterback missed just two plays before returning to action.

Nevertheless, the NFL decided to take a closer look into the team's application of the concussion protocol, ESPN reported Friday. Daboll later issued an apology for his role in the tense moment with Dr. Rodeo.

""If you've ever been on an NFL sideline, there's a lot of emotions,"" Daboll said after the game. ""There's a lot of emotions. And I certainly am an emotional guy. I apologized directly to our team physician. I just wanted his a-- out there if he was OK. 

""But I wanted the process — like, we were getting ready to go for it on a potential fourth down. I would have burned a timeout if he could have came out there. So, I was asking how long is it gonna take?""

At one point during Dart's time with the medical staff, Daboll entered the tent to presumably check on the young quarterback. Giants President and CEO John Mara said he had a conversation with Daboll about his actions during the game.

""I spoke to Coach Daboll this morning about approaching the medical tent last night. While I firmly believe, as he has stated, that he was not trying to influence the process in any way, he understands the appearance of going to the tent is inappropriate,"" Mara said in a statement.

""We have protocols in place as a league to ensure player safety, and we need to allow our medical staff to execute those protocols without interference. We understand the situation is under review by the NFL and the NFLPA, and obviously we will cooperate fully.""

Daboll said he respects the medical staff and reiterated his apology.

""So, again, you want your guy out there, not at risk of anything else. But, you know, he came out. ‘I think he's gonna be good.' I'm like, ‘Is he gonna be good or not? I'm gonna call a timeout on fourth down and go for this son of a b----.' You know what I mean? So, I love our doctors. … I apologize. I was in the wrong.""

The Giants have won two of their past three games. Meanwhile, the Eagles have dropped two straight.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:washingtonexaminer.com","Trump announces 100% tariff increase on ‘very hostile' China and shelves Xi meeting","https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/white-house/3845676/trump-appears-cancel-meeting-xi-jinping-china-trade-war/","Fri, 10 Oct 2025 16:01:02 GMT","

President Donald Trump slapped China with a 100% tariff increase starting Nov. 1 on imports “over and above any tariff that they are currently paying” in an escalation of a trade war. 

The announcement on Friday evening on Truth Social followed an earlier post where Trump appeared to cancel a meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping on his trip to Asia, possibly endangering recent talks on a bilateral trade agreement with Beijing.

Trump slammed China's recent imposition of tougher export controls on rare earth minerals, set to take effect in December, in an apparent effort to gain a negotiating advantage over the Trump administration. The decision could upend supply chains for American technology companies, which still source the vast majority of the rare earth metals and minerals required for chip production from China.

“Some very strange things are happening in China!” Trump posted. “They are becoming very hostile, and sending letters to Countries throughout the World, that they want to impose Export Controls on each and every element of production having to do with Rare Earths, and virtually anything else they can think of, even if it's not manufactured in China. Our relationship with China over the past six months has been a very good one, thereby making this move on Trade an even more surprising one. I have always felt that they've been lying in wait, and now, as usual, I have been proven right! There is no way that China should be allowed to hold the World ‘captive,' but that seems to have been their plan for quite some time.”

As for canceling the meeting, Trump added that he has “not spoken to President Xi because there was no reason to do so.”

“This was a real surprise, not only to me, but to all the Leaders of the Free World,” he said. “I was to meet President Xi in two weeks, at APEC, in South Korea, but now there seems to be no reason to do so.”

Furthermore, on Friday evening, Trump floated a 100% tariff increase for Chinese imports, “over and above any tariff that they are currently paying.”

“Also on November 1st, we will impose Export Controls on any and all critical software,” the president continued. “It is impossible to believe that China would have taken such an action, but they have, and the rest is History.”

White House officials did not say whether Trump's comments meant the meeting was off or simply a threat that he might skip out on the planned event.

WHAT WILL TRUMP'S ULTIMATE LEGACY BE: PEACEMAKER OR ‘DISRUPTOR'?

Trump also said China's decision to alert trading partners of the new trade restrictions was “especially inappropriate,” as Beijing announced them amid the Trump administration's efforts to advance a ceasefire in Gaza.

“Dependent on what China says about the hostile ‘order' that they have just put out, I will be forced, as President of the United States of America, to financially counter their move,” Trump concluded. “One of the Policies that we are calculating at this moment is a massive increase of Tariffs on Chinese products coming into the United States of America. There are many other countermeasures that are, likewise, under serious consideration.”","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

A blast at a Tennessee explosives factory left multiple people dead Friday morning.

The explosion occurred at Accurate Energetic Systems on the border of Humphreys and Hickman counties, about one hour west of Nashville. Humphreys County Sheriff Chris Davis announced that there were multiple deaths and multiple persons unaccounted for after the 7:45 a.m. explosion during a Friday press conference.

“We do have several people at this time that's unaccounted for,” Davis said. “We do have some folks, we can confirm that we do have some that are deceased.”

Accurate Energetic Systems manufactures explosives and ammunition for the military and commercial markets. It is a small business “dedicated to the development, manufacture, handling, and storage of high-quality energetic products utilized in both defense and commercial markets”, according to its website.

Davis called the incident a “very devastating blast,” according to USA Today. The Hickman County Sheriff's Office confirmed the explosion occurred Friday morning in its Bucksnort area in a Facebook post.

“Please avoid the area to allow emergency responders to do their work,” the Hickman County Sheriff's Office posted. “If you are in the area, stay clear and follow the instructions from local authorities.”

The Humphreys County government also confirmed that emergency personnel are responding and “actively managing the situation.” The government asked its community to keep the families of those involved in their prayers in a Facebook post.

“We ask that everyone please avoid sharing speculation, photos, or misinformation,” the Humphreys County government posted. “These are real families in our own community who may be impacted, and they deserve privacy and respect during this time. Please avoid the area to allow responders to work safely and efficiently.”

Airline pilots are very concerned by United States flight delays and cancellations amid the government shutdown and believe the effect on the industry is “only going to get worse” in the coming days, according to an airline union official.

Capt. Dennis Tajer, spokesman for American Airlines' Allied Pilots Association, told the Washington Examiner that the thousands of pilots who lived through the 2019 government shutdown are living through “PTSD” right now, knowing full well that things will get worse in air travel before they get better, unless the Senate passes funding.

“One thing that we learned in the last shutdown was that the longer it goes, the worse it gets. Delays will increase, and the impact, not only the human impact on those who are working without paychecks, but on the air traffic control system, it will take even longer to recover, and you'll see a domino effect,” Tajer said in a phone call Thursday.

“Everyone has some PTSD, knowing it's only going to get worse, unless they get the government open again,” Tajer said. “We're respectfully sending out a warning. We've been here before. We all know what can happen. Let's not go there again, and let's get it fixed.”

Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy warned on Monday that the Federal Aviation Administration's air traffic controllers were taking slightly more sick leave than normal as the 13,000 employees were forced to work without pay since Oct. 1.

As air traffic controllers skip work, the FAA is forced to impose ground delays to ensure it has enough eyes in the tower to track planes. The ground delays then affect pilots, flight attendants, and staff. This week, more than 13,000 U.S. flights have been delayed thus far.

Pilots are scheduled by day and can only accrue so many hours on duty before they are maxed out and unable to work, including hours spent delayed in airports.

“It's a linear inconvenience, but it becomes exponential as you go forward. So at the 15-day point, the 20-day point, it's anybody's guess, but it gets exponentially worse the longer it goes,” said Tajer, whose union represents 15,000 American Airlines pilots.

Delta CEO Ed Bastian told CNBC that the situation could quickly worsen by next week.

A more than monthlong government shutdown from late 2018 to early 2019 ended hours after an increase in sick calls from air traffic controllers snarled travel in the New York area.

“I would say that if this doesn't get resolved, say beyond another 10 days or so, you probably will start to see some impacts,” Bastian told CNBC's Squawk Box on Thursday.

Delays and cancellations should not be indicative of danger in the skies, Tajer added.

“Seeing airports slowed down for unique staffing issues is actually a clear sign that the metering, the reduction of air traffic, is happening to ensure that the safety margin is maintained,” Tajer said. “They are not going to let it get to a dangerous place. They're just going to slow it down.”

BOUNTIES TO ASSASSINATE ICE IN CHICAGO CAME FROM MEXICO, DHS REVEALS

Airline passengers will not be the only ones frustrated by the delays and cancellations if the shutdown continues.

“For every pilot that's missing a day off at home, you've got passengers who paid for tickets that are missing important events,” Tajer said. “If you're delayed, canceled on a flight because of the shutdown, everybody's on the phone giving the bad news to family. Chances are, pilots are on that same call with family.”","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

More than a week into the first government shutdown in nearly seven years, congressional Democrats are showing no signs of backing the GOP's proposed clean continuing resolution that would maintain federal spending at the sky-high levels of former President Joe Biden‘s presidency. Nor do they seem willing to admit why they're holding some 900,000 federal workers hostage.

According to Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-CA), Republicans are actually to blame, and they're keeping the government shut down to conceal the nonexistent Jeffrey Epstein files. Ask Sen. Chris Murphy (D-CT), and it's all a part of President Donald Trump's plan for an “authoritarian takeover” to “tilt the election playing field [his] way and destroy the idea of truth.” In the words of Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-MD), “This is just more of [the White House's] Project 2025 assault on our government.”

Practically speaking, the Democrats are the ones who have repeatedly rejected clean continuing resolutions from the party in power, and regardless of the rhetoric, it's the Democratic Party that handed Congress's power of the purse to Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought. And the real reason, despite all the high-minded defenses of “democracy” and Epstein conspiracy theories, is that the Affordable Care Act has run out of cash to conceal its veneer of affordability.

To clarify here, the GOP has still failed to fulfill 15 years of promises and repeal the Affordable Care Act outright. From the premium tax credits to expansion dollars, Obamacare, under a Republican trifecta controlling Washington, D.C., receives multiple times the amount of taxpayer funding that it got under its namesake, former President Barack Obama. About $250 billion has gone to the Affordable Care Act during the first fiscal year of Trump's second term.

But Democrats wish to undo the most minor of Trump's reforms to rein in the COVID-19-era expansion of the Affordable Care Act and its coverage of illegal immigrants.

The crux of the Democrats' demands is that Trump permanently expand Biden's premium tax credit coverage to include Americans earning more than 400% of the federal poverty line and reduce the maximum household contribution. Forestalling the expiration of this expansion, which was due to come later this year regardless, would cost $350 billion over the next decade, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.

The Democrats also want to relitigate Trump's 2025 signature domestic law, his self-proclaimed “one big, beautiful bill.” Hill Democrats pointedly did not even try to influence back when House Republicans began drafting the reconciliation bill in the spring. There's the slew of Affordable Care Act-funded expansions to Medicaid that Democrats wish to restore in defiance of the law. All in all, the Democratic proposal is to add at least another trillion dollars to our national debt on top of the outstanding $37.5 trillion.

The overwhelming majority of Americans do not benefit from the Affordable Care Act. Only 7% of the country is enrolled in a marketplace plan, and even broadening the definition to include Medicaid expansion coverage as well as marketplace plans, just 13% of the population uses Obamacare. The CBO estimates that even if Democrats got all of their wishes, roughly 2% of the population would benefit.

And at what cost?

JOHNSON AND ARIZONA DEMOCRATIC SENATORS SPAR OVER SWEARING IN ADELITA GRIJALVA

The Affordable Care Act explicitly made non-Affordable Care Act, employer-sponsored health insurance more expensive, notably through increased compliance costs, regulations, and taxes, as well as the obliteration of the high-deductible, low-premium plans that served as the backbone of health insurance for younger and less wealthy workers. But by throwing money at an industry that already had rampant demand, the government did with Obamacare subsidies what it did with student loan subsidies: it made the entire industry more expensive.

When the Democrats warn that without once-in-a-century pandemic-era subsidies, the Affordable Care Act will no longer be affordable, they are telling on themselves. Like all government entitlements based on subsidizing demand, Obamacare has proven it will effectively bankrupt itself, and all Republicans have to do this time is stand by and watch Democrats let it happen.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Here's how Taylor Swift's The Life of a Showgirl just shattered sales records.

Listen to more stories on the  Noa app.

The news that Taylor Swift's The Life of a Showgirl has recorded the biggest sales week for any album ever is an astonishing milestone in the annals of e-commerce. Swift's fame ensured that the album would be a hit no matter what, but moving more than 3.5 million units in seven days required high-pressure sales techniques more common to mattress retailers than musicians. The feat testifies to one of the strangest aspects of modern music: the way that popularity has become part of the performance.

To understand what Swift achieved, it's helpful to understand how Adele set the record Swift just broke. When her album 25 sold 3.38 million copies in 2015, the music industry was a different place than it is today. Spotify had come to America just four years earlier, and it was only beginning to qualitatively and quantitatively erode the value of music.

As streaming slowly became the public's preferred way of listening to records, the medium complicated the traditional definition of success. An album having 100 plays could mean one person played it 100 times, or 100 people played it once. In either case, the artist is making a lot less money than they would from 100 album sales. In late 2014, the music industry started counting album equivalent units, a composite metric that accounts for streaming and sales. The term weights sales—physical and digital—far more heavily than it does streams.

Understanding that their business model was under threat, pop music's titans initially balked at streaming. Swift withheld her catalog from Spotify from 2014 to 2017; Adele released 25 without making it available to stream at all for months. Unlike a lot of young pop stars, Adele had a multigenerational audience that included people who were still in the habit of buying albums. She followed up an inescapable breakout album (2011's 21) with a monumental single, “Hello,” that sent a typhoon of hype through social media. The strategy worked. She smashed a sales record that 'NSync had set in 2000—which, hauntingly, was the height of the CD-sales era, right before file sharing brought the industry to a low.

As streaming then supplanted sales and stars such as Swift hammered out their issues with Spotify, a new playbook was written. Streaming encourages a volume game—the more songs on an album, the more streams it's likely to notch. Streaming also makes repeat listening more important. Pop was always premised on replay value—but no matter how many times someone spun their CD of Bedtime Stories, Madonna received money only from the initial sale. In monetizing each listen, Spotify gave artists distinct incentives to cultivate fervent fan loyalty.

The streaming era coincides with the rise of “stans” for good reason. Listeners can now contribute to their favorite artist's success by hitting “Play” and never “Pause.” The Billboard charts have accordingly leapt from being an insider-y topic to a subject of mainstream conversation akin to player stats in professional sports. K-pop fandoms circulate guides on how Billboard counts streams. When Cardi B and Nicki Minaj were recently feuding, they and their supporters waged war in part by comparing sales totals. Ed Sheeran has talked openly about thinking of his career in arithmetic terms. To be a fan of pop music already required appreciating a market-minded approach to art, but now it also means participating—simply by listening.

Read: How did Taylor Swift convince the world that she's relatable?

Swift is the prime predator in this ecosystem. On the same day in 2024 that she released her 16-track album The Tortured Poets Department, she also released a 15-track bonus anthology. The payload of content was embraced by a sprawling fan base that was supercharged with excitement from the Eras Tour (the highest-grossing tour ever), and the album handily broke the record for the most streams in a debut week. But because its consumption skewed so heavily toward on-demand digital listening, it couldn't beat Adele's total-units sales record.

For The Life of a Showgirl, Swift and her team have taken advantage of an unexpected by-product of streaming: the elevated importance of traditional album sales. Vinyl has boomed in the past decade not because people necessarily want to listen to that format but because it gives listeners a tangible way to display their appreciation. Cassette and CD sales have bounced back a bit for similar reasons. Relatedly, music merchandise—tees and totes—has become a hot status symbol.

Showgirl turns an album release into something closer to the McDonald's Monopoly contest, encouraging repeat purchases. The album exists in more than 30 “variants” so far: different combinations of listening formats, album art, merch, and bonus music. At Target—only at Target—you can buy The Life of a Showgirl: The Crowd Is Your King Edition (Summertime Spritz Pink Shimmer Vinyl), for $34.99. Online, you can order the So Glamorous Cabaret Edition CD featuring a show tunes-y take on the song “Elizabeth Taylor.” Different versions have different hand-signed photos; one edition comes with a cardigan; another has voice notes and a cover that tints the turquoise bathwater of the regular album image into a brownish orange.

Variants aren't a new idea, but the sheer volume in this case appears to be unprecedented, and Swift has marketed them in a brazenly manipulative fashion. In the nearly two months between when the album was announced and when it was released, her website featured a number of mysterious countdown clocks. Invariably, they counted down to the announcement of an album variant—many of which were then available for a limited time only. Countdown clocks and flash sales are common features of online retailers that try to panic consumers into buying things they don't need, and here Swift was acting in the spirit of Temu.

Listeners can, of course, resist these offers. But for many of Swift's fans, ponying up must feel simultaneously pleasurable and obligatory—just like paying to attend Life of a Showgirl movie screenings that mostly consisted of lyric videos. On social media, some Swifties have been sharing photos of their hauls. It's not yet clear how many variant editions have been sold, but if even a small percentage of Swift's enormous fan base picked up more than one copy, she would have added a significant multiplier to her sales total.

What does this new record signify? Swift may well be more important today than Adele was a decade ago—but the comparison is apples to oranges because the cultural mainstream has fractured so dramatically since then. Swift is unlike her pop predecessors in the shape of her success: Rather than conquer the world with easy listening for a broad audience of casual listeners, she has inspired an intense, tribal devotion. The release of Showgirl—like those of Swift's previous four original albums—was preceded by no singles, and you can stream the album for free. The people who are buying it are, plainly, making an investment based on extramusical reasons.

Which is not to say the music doesn't matter; now that the album is out, it's also breaking streaming records in ways that testify to her talent for making addictive pop. Showgirl is far less dazzling than advertised, but it remains a tight, 12-track album infused with the bubblegum witchcraft of the producers Max Martin and Shellback. A week after I reviewed it, I still feel that it's her weakest effort to date—she's previously rendered many of its ideas more cleverly, profoundly, ambitiously. Listening invites far too many thoughts about commerce winning over art.

Swift herself certainly seems to be thinking about money more than ever. Perhaps reflecting a cultural vibe shift back toward “greed is good,” Showgirl sees America's favorite girl next-door flaunt her wealth lyrically, really for the first time. She mentions Gucci clothes, Cartier diamonds, and Parisian hotel stays. At first, “Wi$h Li$t” reads as an anti-materialist love song: Swift doesn't crave “Balenci shades”; she just wants kids, love, and peace. But the joke implied by its title punctuation is that every dollar she earns is underwriting her own personal quest for happiness. This is Showgirl's boldest achievement: disguising new bragging rights for a billionaire as a fairy-tale ending, and giving her fans a noble reason to spend.

They might be surprised that the republic exists at all.

Listen to more stories on hark

When the American republic was founded, the Earth was no more than 75,000 years old. No contemporary thinker imagined it could possibly be older. Thus Thomas Jefferson was confident that woolly mammoths must still live in “the northern and western parts of America,” places that “still remain in their aboriginal state, unexplored and undisturbed by us.”

The idea that mammoths or any other kind of creature might have ceased to exist was, to him, inconceivable. “Such is the œconomy of nature,” he wrote in Notes on the State of Virginia, “that no instance can be produced of her having permitted any one race of her animals to become extinct; of her having formed any link in her great work so weak as to be broken.”

Those illusory behemoths roaming out there somewhere beyond the Rockies remind us that the world of the Founding Fathers is in some ways as alien to us as ours would be to them. A distance of two and a half centuries is too long for us to be able to fully inhabit their universe, but not long enough for us to be capable of viewing them disinterestedly or dispassionately. In trying to imagine how they would perceive the state of their republic in 2025, the risk is that we invent our own versions of Jefferson's nonexistent beasts. The originalist fallacy that dominates the current Supreme Court—the pretense that it is possible to read the minds of the Founders and discern what they “really” meant—in fact turns the Founders into ventriloquists' dummies. We express our own prejudices by moving their lips.

From the October 2025 issue: Jill Lepore on how originalism killed the Constitution

Yet asking what the Revolutionary leaders would think of America now has long been a spur to critical thinking. The interrogation of how well or badly the present condition of the nation matches the founding intentions is one of the vital forces behind the American political project. It kindles the fire that blazes in Frederick Douglass's Fourth of July speech of 1852, during which he said of the Founders that their “solid manhood stands out the more as we contrast it with these degenerate times.” It is the test Abraham Lincoln presents in the Gettysburg Address: whether the form of republican government created “four score and seven years ago” by “our fathers” might be about to “perish from the earth.” It underpins Martin Luther King Jr.'s resplendent rebuke at the Lincoln Memorial in 1963: “When the architects of our republic wrote the magnificent words of the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence, they were signing a promissory note to which every American was to fall heir.”

We do not have to sanitize the Founders into secular sainthood to ask what their republic has done with that legacy. We can use their magnificent words to reproach many of America's contemporary follies even while recognizing that some of their actions prefigure those follies. It is quite possible, for example, that many of the Founders might be enthusiastic supporters of Donald Trump's unilateral imposition of swinging tariffs on foreign trade—albeit not of the bellicose rhetoric that accompanies them. In 1807, Congress, with Jefferson as president and James Madison as secretary of state, prohibited cargo-bearing American vessels from sailing to foreign ports and forbade the export of all goods out of the country by sea; imports also declined, largely because it was impractical for ships from abroad to make the trip if they had to return empty.

From the September 2003 issue: Our reverence for the Founders has gotten out of hand

Jefferson thought of this as the invention of an experiment in “peaceful coercion” that might do away with war and make possible an enlightened era of universal peace. He persisted with this foolishness for 14 months while agricultural prices fell sharply and thousands were thrown out of work. In his book Empire of Liberty, about the early republic, Gordon Wood notes, “Perhaps never in history has a trading nation of America's size engaged in such an act of self-immolation with so little reward.” If he were to update the book, he might wish to add “until now.”

Conversely, most of the leading revolutionaries would likely be dismayed to discover that their republic now allows women not only to vote but to hold public office. The vile misogyny of Trump's invective against Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election would have repelled them, but they would have been more astonished that one of the main contenders for the office was female than that she was a person of color.

To acknowledge that the Founders could be as wrongheaded as any of their successors is also to marvel at how acute their thinking could be—even when they were woefully misguided. George Washington, Jefferson, and Madison all owned slaves. Their unwillingness or inability to confront at the birth of a new nation what Jefferson acknowledged as an “abominable crime” is the gaping crack in the foundation on which they built the republic: the “self-evident” truth that “all men are created equal.”

Yet they were not stupid. “I tremble for my country,” Jefferson wrote, “when I reflect that God is just: that his justice cannot sleep forever.” The Founders knew very well that the simple word all was indeed, as Martin Luther King would point out, a promissory note. Lincoln put his finger on it when he said that Jefferson “had the coolness, forecast, and capacity to introduce into a merely revolutionary document, an abstract truth, applicable to all men and all times.”

Lincoln's point remains potent: Equality was indeed a cruel abstraction for women, Native Americans, and the nearly one-fifth of the American population that was enslaved at the time of the republic's founding. But the word was intended to transcend the time and circumstances of its utterance and to make a claim on the future. There is no going back from that all. The Founders might at first be amazed by the evolution of their republic into one that guarantees the principle (if not the practice) of racial equality, but they would recognize on reflection that they had planted a seed that would blossom in heroic struggles for justice.

The Founders would be taken aback, not just by the geographic scale of contemporary America but by its cultural and ethnic diversity. It is true that they already lived in a multicultural world—in 1790, only about 60 percent of white Americans were of English ancestry. Most of the rest were Irish, German, Scottish, French, Dutch, or Swedish. The French immigrant J. Hector St. John de Crèvecoeur celebrated “that strange mixture of blood, which you will find in no other country.”

Yet the Founders preferred to imagine American blood as unmixed. The Federalist Papers call Americans “people descended from the same ancestors.” In the aftermath of a war of independence that was also in effect a civil war, they were for obvious reasons much more interested in generating a sense of unity than in recognizing diversity. It seems likely that they would be confounded by the problem of how to preserve an “unum” when the “pluribus” is ever more disparate. They might in fact wonder at the ability of the United States to do so at all—to survive as a multicultural, let alone multiracial, entity.

They might have concluded, though, that they had left it an invaluable legacy by writing on their new nation's birth certificate a phrase that can be—and has been—easily mocked. When the Founders included “the pursuit of happiness” in the Declaration of Independence as one of the three primordial human rights, they were making large claims, not just about the meaning of a republic but about the meaning of life.

They were drawing on one of the basic ideas of the Enlightenment—John Locke, for example, had declared, “I lay it for a certain ground, that every intelligent being really seeks happiness, which consists in the enjoyment of pleasure, without any considerable mixture of uneasiness.” Pleasure, in this sense, is more about human self-fulfillment than the self-indulgence of the rich. We might now call it well-being. This happiness is a radically egalitarian idea—everyone has an innate right to seek it. And there is an implicit embrace of diversity in that equality: No two ideas of happiness will be exactly the same.

But the elevation of happiness was also a radical challenge to the religious insistence that the point of life was to pursue sanctity through suffering. It is easy to forget that Christian Churches taught their flocks that our fate as human beings was to spend our time on Earth (in the words of a prayer I recited as a child) “mourning and weeping in this valley of tears.” To declare happiness as a foundational idea for a new kind of state was to suggest that human beings should be able to live enjoyable lives in the here and now.

Both of these ideas of happiness are under attack in contemporary America. Trumpism is all about the “considerable mixture of uneasiness” that Locke wished to exclude—the wallowing in self-pity, the horror-movie thrills of imagining American carnage, the terror of invasion by migrant hordes. Even the pleasures that Trump offers his followers are sadistic ones, predicated on his invitation to enjoy the pain of others. His happiness is a zero-sum game: “Real” Americans can experience it only if others are miserable.

This would be anathema to the Founders. The Declaration of Independence does not rest on any claim to American exceptionalism. On the contrary, it bases the necessity “to institute new Government” on the alleged violation of rights that are not national but universal. They belong to mankind first, not to “America First.” Likewise, the Bill of Rights is, as Jefferson wrote, “what the people are entitled to against every government on earth.”

The Founders would be equally repelled by a contemporary-American reaction against their belief that the meaning of collective political life is not dependent on religious faith. The separation of Church and state was essential to their republic. They understood from European and recent colonial history that true religious freedom is impossible if faith is intertwined with government. Thus the First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States begins: “Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.” Or as Jefferson put it: “It does me no injury for my neighbour to say there are twenty gods, or no god. It neither picks my pocket nor breaks my leg.” The neighbor who believes in 20 gods or no god must therefore have the same political rights as the one who is an orthodox monotheist.

The Founders would thus be dismayed to find their insistence on establishing the political sphere as a neutral space in relation to religious belief and unbelief now flatly denied by, for example, Speaker of the House Mike Johnson, who insists that what they really meant was that “they did not want the government to encroach upon the Church—not that they didn't want principles of faith to have influence on our public life. It's exactly the opposite.” The Founders would have asked Johnson which set of religious principles they wished to hold sway over public life.

If the Founders would not have recognized themselves in this distorting mirror, there is nonetheless far too much about today's America that they would recognize all too well. They did not know where their republic would go, but they knew exactly where it was coming from. They knew what theocratic politics were like, because they or their ancestors had lived under established Churches—as Madison put it, “We revere this lesson too much soon to forget it.” They knew exactly why it was necessary to stop officeholders from accepting gifts from “any King, Prince, or foreign State” without the consent of Congress; Benjamin Franklin, when he received a valuable snuffbox from the king of France, was so sensitive to possible perceptions of bribery that he sought congressional approval to keep it. It is not hard to surmise what he would have done with the offer of a Boeing 747 from Qatar.

It is true that the Founders did not think of their republic as one in which all citizens could be active participants in political life. Every state retained property qualifications for voters or officeholders, and this of course suited the interests of the economic elite, to which the Founders belonged. But their limitations on democratic participation were not mere expressions of snobbery and self-interest. The Founders were not wrong to believe that full citizenship is possible only for people who have the economic means to exercise it. It is hard to be free when you're mired in poverty—and easy to override the principle of equal citizenship when you are superrich.

The great problem of contemporary democracy is, indeed, that suffrage became universal but the kind of economic dignity imagined by the Founders as its necessary condition did not. In this regard, one thing we can say with certainty is that the Founders would be horrified by the spectacle of Elon Musk handing out $1 million a day to voters in swing states—a subversion of the democratic process even cruder and more grotesque than their worst fears.

The Founders imagined that access to property—then thought of primarily as the ownership of land—would spread, and that the political nation would expand accordingly. This may be a very conservative idea, but if we apply it to contemporary America, it would have radical consequences. The Founders would surely be distressed to find, for example, that the modern equivalent of land ownership—having one's own home—is ever more out of reach for young Americans.

The Founders would also be perplexed by the growth of oligarchy. They were mostly rich men who believed, as the rich usually do, that economic inequalities arise naturally from the “diversity in the faculties of men”—so wrote Madison in “Federalist No. 10.” Yet, as Gordon Wood observed, they nonetheless “took for granted that a society could not long remain republican if a tiny minority controlled most of the wealth.” If they were told that the top 0.1 percent of Americans currently holds 14 percent of the country's wealth while the bottom half holds just 2.5 percent, they would surely have calculated that the odds on the survival of their republic had become very steep.

Likewise, they would be deeply depressed by America's rapid loss of a common sphere in which political arguments can be teased out as a collective enterprise. What is most invigorating about the Founding Fathers is not even what they thought. It is how they thought. They did their thinking aloud. The pseudonym used by Madison, Alexander Hamilton, and John Jay for The Federalist Papers is Publius, redolent of both public and the people. The Federalist Papers think through complex questions but do so in a language written to be read in coffeehouses and taverns. When Jefferson observed that “where the press is free and every man able to read, all is safe,” the second requirement was as important as the first. The Founders imagined a republic of readers.

Even while they were anxious to limit the vote to men of property like themselves, they understood that there were no such limits on the right to hold an opinion. The opening of the Declaration of Independence acknowledges that it is written out of “a decent respect to the opinions of mankind”—not, notably, heads of state or popes or grandees but people in general. And its authors knew that the opinions even of women and working people percolated upward into political institutions. Madison wrote, “Public opinion sets bounds to every government, and is the real sovereign in every free one.” The quality of public discourse thus mattered as much to him as the forms of government did. This much wider public sphere had to be capable not just of dealing with intricacies but of guarding them. Madison wrote that the chief responsibility of the people was to maintain the “complicated form of their political system.”

The public arena therefore had to be kept clear of the detritus of mere insult. Franklin, who made his fortune in what we would call the media business, boasts in his Autobiography,

In drawing attention to his own refusal to publish personal abuse, Franklin was of course acknowledging that the newspapers were otherwise full of it. The Founders themselves were often fractious, splenetic, and happy to attack one another through paid proxies. But they nonetheless believed that the vigor of public debate must ultimately serve rational purposes. The press was a blacksmith's shop full of heat and resounding with heavy blows, but that was because it was where ideas of the common good were being hammered out.

In this light, there is little doubt that the Founders would be particularly appalled both by the loss of so many local newspapers in contemporary America and by the conduct of a president who smears the press as “the enemy of the people.” Madison wrote that “a circulation of newspapers through the entire body of the people” was as vital as good roads to the maintenance of “a general intercourse of sentiments.” The shattering of public opinion into algorithmically generated echo chambers, the monetization and weaponization on a massive scale of insult and detraction, and the reduction of complexities to tribal slogans would probably have led him to conclude that the republic was on its way out.

The collapse of a shared public sphere has in turn made possible a closed-mindedness that would dismay the Revolutionary generation. Political tribalism inhibits one of the essential tools of democracy: the capacity to change one's mind, which is what the Founders did so radically throughout the Revolutionary period. Franklin was well into his 60s when he began his journey from loyal British monarchist to supporter of American independence. Jefferson didn't want a federal constitution but came to regard the one that emerged as “unquestionably the wisest ever yet presented to men.” Madison initially believed that the attachment of a bill of rights to that Constitution would be unnecessary and perhaps even dangerous. When he came to think differently, he not only drafted the Bill of Rights but did more than anyone else to get it adopted.

This capacity not just to change one's mind but to transform it was essential to the very creation of the United States as we know it. The American revolutionaries were men who changed their minds. In 1776, almost no one thought of an independent America as anything other than a broad alliance of 13 sovereign states, bound together by friendship, mutual interest, and bilateral treaties. A decade later, few thought of it as anything other than a federal state. Which also suggests that most of the Founders would be at once proud that their Constitution has endured so long and puzzled by the obdurate retention of institutions and practices (the Electoral College; the Senate's grossly disproportionate representation of voters) that worked for the 18th century but do not work for the 21st. They would have agreed with Chief Justice John Marshall when he wrote in 1819 that their Constitution was “intended to endure for ages to come, and consequently, to be adapted to the various crises of human affairs.” They might even have regretted their failure to create more workable mechanisms to amend it.

There is also a more fundamental sense in which the Founders would struggle to understand how contemporary America can continue to function. They would wonder how it might be possible for anyone to fully envision a country as large as the U.S. became after their deaths. They wanted a big country—one of the core arguments of The Federalist Papers is that a large republic is likely to be better at resisting control by self-interested political factions than a small one. They certainly imagined their new nation becoming a continental power.

But how large is too large? Madison in particular worried that a very extensive country would become prone to autocracy. If, he wrote, a republic were to acquire “the dimensions of China,” it would be difficult to resist a government capable of “veiling its designs from distant eyes” while “turning the prejudices and interests real or imaginary of the parts agst each other.” This would “gradually enable the Executive branch of the Govt. to overwhelm the others, and convert the Govt. into an absolute monarchy.”

The United States does indeed now have the same physical extent as China, and the rest of Madison's prediction for the likely fate of a republic on that scale has moved far beyond the realm of speculation. The sight of ICE agents on the streets of America veiling their designs behind masks would have appalled the Framers. They would have demanded their own history lesson to help them understand how a republic founded, above all, on civil liberty had over time generated a massive apparatus of national security with so little public scrutiny.

They would need no such lessons, however, to understand how Trump has mastered the art of turning the republic's red and blue parts against each other by stoking both real and imaginary prejudices. They would see how this polarization has both enabled and been enabled by the overwhelming domination of the executive over the legislative branch. The danger they were most anxious to avoid—a government that (in Hamilton's words) “unites all power in the same hands”—is now a peril they would recognize as urgently and immediately present.

What would surely have sickened them most is the sycophancy of legislators who abandon their duty of independent judgment and act as fawning courtiers of a monarchical presidency. Whatever else the Founders can be accused of, they were spectacularly innocent of servility. They would have had nothing but contempt for representatives who surrender their constitutional powers because they are afraid of arousing the ire of the president's supporters.

In “Federalist No. 71,” Hamilton writes of the people “beset, as they continually are, by the wiles of parasites and sycophants, by the snares of the ambitious, the avaricious, the desperate.” He suggested that citizens needed politicians “who had courage and magnanimity enough to serve them at the peril of their displeasure.” He had a ready-made term for the sheer cowardice of so many legislators in today's Congress: “servile pliancy.”

The Founders knew what a swaggering oligarchy looks like when it floats above the rest of society, as Jefferson saw in the European societies of his own day, “where the many are crouched under the weight of the few, and where the order established can present to the contemplation of a thinking being no other picture than that of God almighty and his angels trampling under foot the hosts of the damned.”

They knew what it was like to be subject to a despot who, in Locke's words, “set up his own arbitrary will as the law of society”—this is the essence of their complaints against King George III and his junto of ministers. And they knew how demagoguery could turn into despotism. Hamilton forcefully cautioned in “Federalist No. 1,” “Of those men who have overturned the liberties of republics, the greatest number have begun their career by paying an obsequious court to the people; commencing demagogues, and ending tyrants.” They knew that these rough beasts, unlike the mammoths of Jefferson's imagination, were real and would never go extinct.

Comedians went to Saudi Araba — and faced blowback in America.

Earlier this month, comedians, including Dave Chappelle, Kevin Hart, Pete Davidson, and Bill Burr, flew to Saudi Arabia to perform at the inaugural Riyadh Comedy Festival. The organizers claimed it was the largest comedy festival in the world, with over 50 international comedians performing stand-up, sketch, and improv. It was put on and paid for by the Saudi government as a part of their effort to increase investment in their local economy — and also to improve their global image.

The Saudi regime's human rights record is why other performers such as Marc Maron, David Cross, and Atsuko Okatsuka have strongly criticized the comedians who attended. They have accused their peers of helping to “put a fun face on their [Saudi Arabia's] crimes against humanity.”

The critics also see hypocrisy; many of the comedians who attended the festival have a history of complaining about not being able to freely express themselves in their standup in the US. While on stage in Riyadh, Chapelle joked, “It's easier to talk here than it is in America.”

But as Abdullah Aloudh, senior director for countering authoritarianism at the Middle East Democracy Center, explains, speech is far from free in the kingdom. There is a Saudi counterterrorism law that says questioning the wisdom of the king or crown prince is an act of terrorism. Another law addressing “anti-cybercrime” criminalizes anything that they describe as threatening the public value or questioning the tranquility of society. These laws have led to the jailing of thousands, including former aid worker Abdulrahman al-Sadhan, who is currently serving a 20-year prison sentence for tweeting some jokes about the Saudi government.

To learn more about the festival and why it's exposed a rift within the comedy industry, Today, Explained host Noel King spoke with Seth Simons, a journalist and critic who covers the comedy industry.

Below is an excerpt of their conversation that has been edited for length and clarity. There's much more in the full podcast, so listen to Today, Explained wherever you get podcasts, including Apple Podcasts, Pandora, and Spotify.

How did Saudi manage to book all these guys? 

I don't know exactly, but I know they worked with WME, the mega-talent agency, and they worked with Bruce Hills, who was, for years, in charge of Just for Laughs, the huge comedy festival in Montreal. So, they have a lot of ways to lure A-list comedians, and they also threw a lot of money at them. There's a comedian named Tim Dillon, who, on his podcast, bragged that he was offered $375,000. He also told a bunch of jokes about — not really jokes — but about how they have slaves in Saudi Arabia, and they murdered a journalist for criticizing them. And he said, “You know, we comedians, we're looking the other way. They pay us enough to look the other way.” Then, he got fired for saying all that.

What have the comedians that went there said about performing there? 

They framed it as a cultural interchange. They are bringing comedy to “people who don't have a lot of stand-up comedy,” I guess. They've said that they “didn't have to censor themselves,” even though they sort of agreed to a contract that forbade criticizing the Saudi government or religion. You've seen some of them say that there were women at these shows, there were young people at these shows. They weren't just performing for the royals. I believe it was Bill Burr and some others have said that they did fairly raunchy jokes. They've said that they got treated very well. [Chris] Distefano said that Whitney Cummings said that “no one has treated her as well in the US as the Saudis treated her.”

You've seen a lot of videos posted by the Saudis running the festival of these comedians getting applied with flowers and surrounded by food and being given the red carpet treatment, which I think is important to a lot of these comedians to feel like they are important and famous celebrities.

The pushback was really interesting because it came not just from Joe Schmoes, but people like Mark Maron. But how big of a deal is it really? In a month, do we care what Pete Davidson did in Saudi Arabia? Like, does this tarnish these guys? 

I don't know, and I'll be curious to see. I do think it is a big deal for other comedians to speak out, because, if you've been paying attention to comedy over the last five or six years, you've seen Chappelle release a series of anti-trans specials and declare himself a TERF. You've seen, in the very first months of the pandemic, when people were still dying by the thousands and there was no vaccine, a lot of these comedians we're talking about now went right back out on the road in May and June of 2020 and performed across the country in fairly small, often underground rooms. Those were super-spreader events.

You've seen levels of racism that would've been scandalous six years ago that are now normal on these comedians' podcasts and, sometimes, in their acts. And you don't see a lot of criticism of that from other comedians. So, I think there's a lot of shady stuff that happens in comedy that would be a big deal if people like Marc Maron or other ostensibly liberal and left-leaning — or just plain good, decent comics — made a fuss about it. But I think a lot of them just want stay in their lane and not make a fuss.

But, to answer your question, it is very notable that this caused the uproar it did. Even fans: If you go to these comedians' subreddits, or if you look at their comment sections on Twitter, you'll see a lot of their fans are bringing it up pretty constantly. But it remains to be seen how well that will be metabolized by a public that is obviously dealing with a constant stream of horrible news and disappointing public figures.

UPS customers are finding their shipments stuck in package purgatory.

Some customers of the shipping service say that packages sent to the US from abroad are getting held up at the carrier's facilities for weeks and, in some cases, are being subjected to higher-than-expected tariffs and customs brokerage fees, according to tracking information. Eight people whom Business Insider spoke to said that they received updates indicating they might never get their packages at all.

""The package is undeliverable and is in the process of being disposed of according to the local guidelines,"" reads one tracking update sent to several UPS customers Business Insider spoke with and posted widely on a subreddit for UPS users.

For many of these UPS customers, the delayed packages marked their first encounter with international shipping in the era of tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump's administration this year.

At the end of August, the Trump administration ended the de minimis exemption, which allowed foreign imports worth less than $800 to enter the US without being subject to tariffs. Personal gifts worth less than $100 are still allowed through, but the complexity of the new rules led several international carriers to suspend higher-value shipments to the US.

A UPS spokesperson said the company was seeing ""a significant increase"" in the number of shipments that require formal customs clearance.

For some UPS customers, the changes have meant that additional information or payments are required to complete certain shipments.

Kunal Sharma, an auto parts business owner in Canada, said he sent four car wheels, each in a separate box, to a customer in Texas in late August. He forgot to include the tariff codes for the wheels with the shipment information.

UPS sent three of the four wheels back to him. The fourth still hasn't shown up, he said. Last week, its tracking page said the shipment was being disposed of, though it's since moved between UPS facilities in Ontario, Michigan, and Tennessee.

""An entire set of wheels is worthless if one of them is missing,"" he said.

After Sharma emailed UPS CEO Carol Tomé about the fourth wheel, a UPS customer relations employee apologized for the problem, in a message viewed by Business Insider. On Thursday, tracking indicated that the wheel was on its way to his customer in Texas. Sharma has started using FedEx to ship orders to his US customers.

""Because of changes to US import regulations, we are seeing many packages that are unable to clear customs due to missing or incomplete information about the shipment required for customs clearance,"" a UPS spokesperson told Business Insider. The spokesperson said that ""more than 90% of all imported packages"" that move through UPS's network clear customs the first day that they arrive in the US.

For packages that don't have complete customs information and when UPS cannot contact the shipper, the company either returns the package to the sender at their expense or disposes of it ""consistent with US customs regulations."" The spokesperson did not provide details on how the disposal process works.

David Ordal, who lives in California's Bay Area, shared tracking information for his order of an annual supply of French sunscreen, which has been languishing for a month in Louisville, Kentucky.

""It's still not out of purgatory,"" he said.

Katie Golden, who resells vintage clothing on Depop, told Business Insider that she ordered $179 worth of used apparel from the UK. The package left that country and made its way to UPS's facility in Louisville, Kentucky, according to a screenshot of UPS tracking information seen by Business Insider.

UPS notified her that she had to pay $769 in import fees, including tariffs, as well as a UPS broker fee. At over four times the cost of her order, that's more than she was expecting to pay for used clothes, she said.

Golden is currently trying to dispute that tariff amount with UPS. In the meantime, she said she's worried about her shipment being disposed of. ""I'm going to keep bothering UPS,"" she said.

And it's not just tariffs.

Recent changes to the Food and Drug Administration's review process for imports could also be causing issues.

A consultant in Los Angeles who is starting a coffee business told Business Insider she received two out of 12 boxes of inventory from Taiwan and was notified that the remaining 10 would be marked as abandoned and disposed of. She requested her name be withheld out of concern for her privacy.

In a recording of a call with UPS that the customer provided to Business Insider, an agent tells her that the FDA and Border Protection ""decided to approve only a percentage of the shipment.""

""They are getting very strict now,"" the UPS agent said, adding that they had received about 10 calls from other customers about similar issues.

Heather Elliott, who lives in Virginia, told Business Insider she ordered about $750 worth of French cosmetics in July, and was charged $165 when the shipment was processed at a UPS facility in Philadelphia. She paid that bill only to receive a second charge for roughly $289.

In an email exchange shared with Business Insider, UPS representatives itemized the charges as ""PGA disclaimer ($25), disbursement fee ($14), entry line charge ($45), and FDA processing ($111),"" as well as a duty of $94.

Elliott's package was delivered, and UPS later refunded the initial $165 payment.

She said she has since ordered several shipments from a Korean retailer that have arrived via FedEx without any issues. A FedEx receipt Elliott shared with Business Insider shows a $180 order of personal care items that received a $27 duty charge and a $27.50 FDA clearance fee.

Alex Castellani, cofounder of Toronto-based coffee roaster Subtext, said that many of his shipments to the US since late August have sat for weeks at UPS facilities in Buffalo, New York, and Detroit, according to tracking information. That, plus higher-than-expected tariffs and broker fees, prompted him to switch to DHL for his US-bound shipments to cafés and individual consumers.

""They're now paying more in brokerage and tariffs than the entire value of their package,"" Castellani told Business Insider.

UPS has made changes this year in response to the Trump Administration's tariff policies. In April, the shipping service said that it would cut 20,000 jobs and shutter dozens of facilities in response to what CEO Tomé called ""a changing trade environment.""

Last week, UPS suspended its service guarantee for international shipments and many within the US. The guarantee allowed customers to get a refund if their package arrived later than UPS projected.

Some recipients say UPS has items that can't be easily replaced.

Nicole Lobo, a graduate student in Philadelphia, said that she shipped 10 boxes of personal possessions, including clothing that belonged to her grandfather and rare books on art history, using UPS after a year studying in the UK. Lobo shipped the boxes from the UK in late August but hadn't received them when Business Insider spoke with her on Thursday.

""It's my life's work,"" she said. ""I'm probably one of only a few people in the world who have this sort of library.""

The LA consultant said this is her second time launching a business that depends on imports, though it is her first time dealing with food. Now, she says she's not sure if there's a path forward if other carriers have the same problems as UPS.

""It impacts my decision whether or not to continue my business,"" she said.

Business Insider Edition 

In a major show of confidence in Africa's industrial potential, the European Union (EU) has announced a fresh investment commitment of €11.5 billion ($12.5 billion) in South Africa's sustainable energy, transport, and health sectors.


        The EU delegation to South Africa said the move reflects Europe's resolve to “work with South Africa to become global leaders in the just energy transition, sustainable infrastructure, digital connectivity and pharmaceutical value chain.”



        The announcement builds on a previous €4.7 billion ($5.1 billion) pledge made in March, though it remains unclear if the new figure is in addition to that earlier commitment.
    


        EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen reaffirmed the bloc's support in a post on X, addressed to President Cyril Ramaphosa, writing:
    


“Dear @CyrilRamaphosa, with Global Gateway investments worth almost €12 billion, we're fully behind your ambition to become a clean energy leader. And we're making great strides in scaling up renewables in Africa with a €618 million Team Europe package.”



        According to the EU, about €8.7 billion ($9.5 billion) of the total will come through blended financing, combining public and private sector resources, to help develop facilities for critical mineral processing and green hydrogen production in South Africa, Africa's most industrialised economy.
    


        The remaining funds will support projects aimed at climate resilience, modern transport networks, and vaccine manufacturing capacity, underscoring Europe's growing interest in long-term African supply chains and local production ecosystems.
    


        Analysts say the investment marks a strategic shift in Europe's engagement with Africa, from aid to partnership, as global powers compete to secure access to the raw materials needed for the global energy transition.
    


“This is more than investment, it's collaboration for mutual growth. Africa's green transformation is vital for the world's sustainable future,” an EU official noted.
    


        The initiative positions South Africa as a key hub in Europe's broader Africa strategy, potentially unlocking new industrial and trade opportunities across the continent.

Business Insider Edition 

Typically, reports surrounding BUA, a group owned by one of Nigeria's richest individuals, Abdulsamad Rabiu, consistently lean towards a positive reception.


        The company, which is synonymous with adapting to Nigeria's economic climate, be it in the form of increasing the salaries of its employees in response to rising cost of living or adjusting prices of products, recently recorded significant revenue growth.
    


        One of the group's primary companies, BUA Foods, posted a profit of ₦260.07 billion, making it Nigeria's most lucrative listed consumer goods company.
    


        The company recorded ₦912.5 billion in revenue for the half-year (up 36%) and PBT of ₦276.1 billion (a 101% rise year on year), driven by strong volume and margin gains in sugar, wheat, and pasta, according to Nairametrics.
    


        Earlier reports in September by the aforementioned publication also showed that Abdulsamad Rabiu was set to receive a record N216.7 billion in dividends as a result of resolutions adopted at BUA Foods Plc's fourth annual general meeting.
    


        All of these have culminated in a $1.6 billion growth of Abdulsamad Rabiu's net worth.
    


        As per Forbes's recent updates, Abdulsamad Rabiu is now worth $7.6 billion, a 21.05% increase from his net worth mid-way into the year.
    


        This growth puts him firmly in second place atop Nigeria's list of richest men, following Africa's richest man, Aliko Dangote, close behind.
    


        Prior to this growth, industrialist Wale Adenuga was Africa's richest man, with a net worth of $6.3 billion, which has been at the figure since June, but declined from $6.8 billion at the start of the year.
    


        In contrast, Abdulsamad Rabiu began the year with a net worth of $4.7 billion, which jumped to $6 billion in June, and now, as of the 10th of October, at $7.6 billion.
    


        As for Africa's richest man, he began the year with a net worth of $10.9 billion, according to Forbes, which is now $25.1 billion, nearing the almost elusive $30 billion mark.

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth on Friday announced an agreement to build a Qatari Emiri Air Force facility at a U.S. Air Force Base in Idaho.

Hegeth said the facility at the Mountain Home Air Force Base will allow pilots from Qatar's air force to train with American military personnel.

The Defense secretary made the announcement at a Pentagon press conference with Qatari Defense Minister Sheikh Saoud bin Abdulrahman Al Thani.

Hegseth said the facility will ""host a contingent a Qatari F-15's and pilots to enhance our combined training, increase lethality, interoperability, it's just another example of our partnership.""

The Mountain Home Air Force Base currently has a contingent of F-15 fighter jets from Singapore's air force stationed there as part of a training program for that nation's pilots.

The Pentagon didn't immediately respond to a request for comment on Hegseth's announcement.

The announcement is another sign of the deepening of the relationship between the Trump administration and Qatar.

Last month, following Israel's decision to go through with a military strike in Doha, Qatar's capital city, the president signed an executive order ""assuring the security of the state of Qatar.""

Earlier this year, the administration accepted a Boeing 747 jet gifted to the U.S. by the Qatari government.

A Pentagon spokesperson told CNBC that Hegseth accepted the luxury plane ""in accordance with all federal rules and regulations.""

The gift drew criticism from Democrats and others who said the jet smacked as looking like bribe to President Donald Trump.

Trump's family business has also been expanding its footprint in the Middle East -- including a golf resort in Doha with Qatar's sovereign wealth fund's real estate arm,  as well as a Trump International Hotel & Tower in Dubai, a Trump Tower located in Jeddah, and a hotel that is under construction in Muscat.

President Donald Trump on Friday said the United States would impose new tariffs of 100% on imports from China ""over and above any Tariff that they are currently paying,"" starting on Nov. 1.

Trump also said that the U.S., on that same date, would also impose export controls on ""any and all critical software.""

The president's announcement came hours after he threatened to slap ""a massive increase"" of tariffs on Chinese imports in retaliation for new controls that China imposed on exports of rare earths minerals from that nation.

Around 70% of the global supply of rare earths minerals comes from China. The minerals are essential for high-tech industries, including automobiles, defense and semiconductors.

Trump suggested earlier Friday that he would cancel a meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping at the upcoming Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in South Korea because of China's new controls.

Nearly every product imported into the U.S. from China already faces steep tariffs. While there are different levels of specific duties on imports, ranging from 50% on steel and aluminum, to 7.5% on consumer goods, the so-called effective tariff rate on Chinese imports currently is 40%, according to Wells Fargo Economics and analysts at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.

""It has just been learned that China has taken an extraordinarily aggressive position on Trade in sending an extremely hostile letter to the World, stating that they were going to, effective November 1st, 2025, impose large scale Export Controls on virtually every product they make, and some not even made by them,"" Trump wrote in a Truth Social post on Friday.

""This affects ALL Countries, without exception, and was obviously a plan devised by them years ago. It is absolutely unheard of in International Trade, and a moral disgrace in dealing with other Nations,"" Trump wrote.

""Based on the fact that China has taken this unprecedented position, and speaking only for the U.S.A., and not other Nations who were similarly threatened, starting November 1st, 2025 (or sooner, depending on any further actions or changes taken by China), the United States of America will impose a Tariff of 100% on China, over and above any Tariff that they are currently paying,"" he wrote.

""Also on November 1st, we will impose Export Controls on any and all critical software.""

China's Ministry of Commerce on Thursday said that starting Dec. 1 foreign entities must have a license to export products that contain more than 0.1% of rare earths sourced from that country, or that are manufactured using Chinese extraction, refining, magnet-making or recycling technology.

The Trump administration began laying off federal workers across a wide range of agencies on Friday, the 10th day of the U.S. government shutdown.

President Donald Trump on Friday afternoon told reporters in the Oval Office that the number of federal workers who will be laid off will ""be a lot.""

""It'll be Democrat-oriented,"" Trump said, reiterating his promise to target programs he believes are favored by Democratic officials.

The permanent job cuts, formally known as ""Reductions in Force,"" are different from the furloughing of government workers. Furloughed employees return to their jobs after a government shutdown ends.

The layoffs were first announced by Russell Vought, the director of the Office of Management and Budget.

""The RIFs have begun,"" Vought wrote on X.

OMB soon after confirmed his tweet, and said the cuts ""are substantial.""

CNBC confirmed that RIF notices went to workers at the Treasury Department, and the Health and Human Services Department.

An administration official told NBC News that other departments targeted by the RIFs included Commerce,, Education, Energy, EPA, Homeland Security, Housing and Urban Development, and Interior. 

The announcement comes four days after National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett warned in a CNBC interview that could ""start taking sharp measures"" if the shutdown continued due to the lack of a stopgap funding deal approved by Congress.

Hassett said that ""any government worker who loses their job"" will have Democrats to blame for their layoff.

While many federal workers have been furloughed because of the shutdown, it is not the normal practice in shutdowns to permanently lay off government employees.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, said, ""Russell Vought just fired thousands of Americans with a tweet. 

 ""Let's be blunt: nobody's forcing Trump and Vought to do this,"" Schumer said in a statement. ""They don't have to do it; they want to. They're callously choosing to hurt people — the workers who protect our country, inspect our food, respond when disasters strike. This is deliberate chaos."" 

""Here's what's worse: Republicans would rather see thousands of Americans lose their jobs than sit down and negotiate with Democrats to reopen the government,"" Schumer said.

Sen. Susan Collins, a Maine Republican who chairs the Senate Appropriations Committee, in a statement said, ""I strongly oppose OMB Director Russ Vought's attempt to permanently lay off federal workers who have been furloughed due to a completely unnecessary government shutdown caused by Senator Schumer.""

""Regardless of whether federal employees have been working without pay or have been furloughed, their work is incredibly important to serving the public,"" Collins said. ""Arbitrary layoffs result in a lack of sufficient personnel needed to conduct the mission of the agency and to deliver essential programs, and cause harm to families in Maine and throughout our country.""

 A spokesman for the Health and Human Services Department, in a statement to CNBC, said, ""HHS employees across multiple divisions have received reduction-in-force notices as a direct consequence of the Democrat-led government shutdown.""

""HHS under the Biden administration became a bloated bureaucracy, growing its budget by 38% and its workforce by 17%,"" department spokesman Andrew Nixon said.

""All HHS employees receiving reduction-in-force notices were designated non-essential by their respective divisions. HHS continues to close wasteful and duplicative entities, including those that are at odds with the Trump administration's Make America Healthy Again agenda,"" Nixon said.

A union representing federal workers, the American Federation of Government Employees, quickly replied to Vought's tweet, writing, ""The lawsuit has been filed."" AFGE, the largest federal employee union, represents 820,000 workers, some of whom work for the District of Columbia.

""America's unions will see you in court,"" the AFL-CIO said in its own tweet.

Lee Saunders, the president of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees union, in a statement obtained by NBC News, said, ""These mass firings are illegal and will have devastating effects on the services millions of Americans rely on every day.""

""Whether it's food inspectors, public safety workers, or the countless other public service workers who keep America running, federal employees should not be bargaining chips in this administration's political games,"" Saunders said.

Since the shutdown began last week, Vought has announced in tweets decisions by the Trump administration to freeze and cut billions of dollars in federal funding for projects in states and cities controlled by Democratic elected officials.

The Trump administration and Republicans in Congress have repeatedly sought to blame Democrats for the government shutdown and any negative fallout from it.

Democratic senators have largely refused to vote for a Republican stopgap funding plan that would reopen the government, saying that any such resolution must include an agreement to extend enhanced Affordable Care Act tax credits.

Those tax credits lower the cost of Obamacare health insurance plans purchased by millions of Americans from government-run ACA marketplaces.

Dueling Republican and Democratic funding resolutions failed to pass in the Senate for the seventh time on Thursday.

The shutdown is expected to continue until at least early next week because the Senate is not due to resume business until Tuesday.

Although Republicans hold majorities in both the Senate and House, they need the votes of at least some Democratic senators to pass a funding bill because of the 60-vote threshold in the Senate required to avoid filibusters blocking legislation.

Nineteen people were missing and possibly dead after a devastating explosion on Friday morning at a military explosives plant in Tennessee, officials said.

The explosion at Accurate Energetic Systems about 50 miles (80 km) west of Nashville occurred at 7:45 a.m. local time (1245 GMT), Humphreys County Sheriff Chris Davis told a press conference.

Davis said there were multiple fatalities but it was still too early to know precisely how many people had perished, saying it was still possible there were some survivors.

When asked to describe the building where the blast occurred, Davis said, ""There's nothing to describe. It's gone.""

Investigators from the FBI and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives were at the scene working to determine the cause of the explosion, Davis said.

Aerial video on CNN showed what appeared to be the footprint of where a building once stood. In an adjacent parking lot, debris and what appeared to be ashes were scattered among a few parked vehicles.

Efforts to reach the company were not successful.

Accurate Energetic Systems develops, manufactures and stores explosives for ""military, aerospace, and commercial demolition markets,"" according to the company's website. The 1,300-acre headquarters in Bucksnort, Tennessee, includes eight production buildings and a quality lab.

Hickman County Mayor Jim Bates told CNN the plant did not have a history of safety problems, although there was a small ammunition explosion there in 2014. That incident killed one person and injured three, according to The Tennessean newspaper.

In this article

Apple is in late-stage talks to acquire top talent from computer vision startup Prompt AI, as well as the company's technology, CNBC has learned.

Leadership at Prompt told employees of the pending transaction at an all-hands meeting on Thursday and said that those who don't end up joining Apple will be paid a reduced salary, and encouraged to apply for open roles at the company, according to audio that was accessed by CNBC.

The 11-person company was approached by other potential suitors, including Elon Musk's xAI and Neuralink, executives said in the meeting.

Prompt was founded in 2023 and raised a $5 million seed round that year led by AIX and Abstract Ventures. Co-founders include CEO Tete Xiao, a notable AI researcher with a Phd in computer science from UC Berkeley, and President Trevor Darrell who was a founder of the Berkeley Artificial Intelligence Research (BAIR) lab.

Xiao and Darrell didn't respond to requests for comment, nor did Apple. Neither xAI nor Neuralink immediately responded to a request for comment.

Investors will get paid some money in the deal but ""won't be made whole,"" executives said in the meeting. Prompt employees were asked to refrain from mentioning Apple until further notice while searching for other jobs or updating friends and family on their situation.

Prompt's flagship app, Seemour, connects to home security cameras, adding sophisticated capabilities. The technology helps cameras detect specific people, pets and other animals or objects around a household, and to send alerts and text-based descriptions of unusual activity or answer questions about what's been happening in front of the camera.

Xiao told employees at the meeting that while Prompt AI's technology and the Seemour app were working well, the business model wasn't. The company is retiring the Seemour app, and plans to inform users their data will be deleted and privacy protected, executives said.

Silicon Valley's tech giants have been snapping up top AI talent through acquihires, in part to bolster their AI research and development in a way that helps them skirt regulatory concerns. Apple's deal for Prompt is much smaller than recent high-profile transactions, such as Meta's $14.3 billion investment in Scale AI that brought with it the company's founder and other execs, and Google's $2.4 billion deal for Windsurf's CEO and leaders that included licensing fees.

Apple has historically avoided making large acquisitions. In the half-century since its founding, Apple's biggest purchase was the $3 billion deal for Beats Electronics in 2014. The company prefers to quietly acquire smaller teams and use their talent and technology to develop features for its product lines.

Some analysts have attributed Apple's relatively slow progress in AI to its unwillingness to make big purchases. Its stock is down 2% this year, badly trailing major indexes and the worst performance among the tech megcaps.

While Apple Intelligence, the iPhone maker's foray into generative AI, has underwhelmed critics and faced delays, the company achieved technical success with computer vision, especially in its mixed reality headset, Vision Pro. The iPhone also has the ability to decipher what objects, people or pets are in photographs taken by users.

Prompt's technology and talent are likely to be part of Apple's HomeKit smart home division.

— CNBC's Kif Leswing contributed to this report.

Jim Edwards is the executive editor for global news at Fortune. He was previously the editor-in-chief of Business Insider's news division and the founding editor of Business Insider UK. His investigative journalism has changed the law in two U.S. federal districts and two states. The U.S. Supreme Court cited his work on the death penalty in the concurrence to Baze v. Rees, the ruling on whether lethal injection is cruel or unusual. He also won the Neal award for an investigation of bribes and kickbacks on Madison Avenue.

Hargreaves Lansdown, the largest retail investment platform in the U.K., which has about $225 billion in assets under management, issued a surprisingly harsh warning to its customers: Stay away from Bitcoin. The cryptocurrency has “no intrinsic value,” it told its clients, and should not be included in their life savings and retirement plans. 

HL is the third large financial institution recently to remind customers that crypto might be based on nothing, following Deutsche Bank and Elliott Management.





“While longer-term returns of Bitcoin have been positive, Bitcoin has experienced several periods of extreme losses and is a highly volatile investment—much riskier than stocks or bonds. The HL investment view is that Bitcoin is not an asset class, and we do not think cryptocurrency has characteristics that mean it should be included in portfolios for growth or income and shouldn't be relied upon to help clients meet their financial goals. Performance assumptions are not possible to analyze for crypto, and unlike other alternative asset classes it has no intrinsic value,” the company said in a statement that also noted the platform would begin offering crypto trades for customers. 





A few days ago, Deutsche Bank told clients that Bitcoin was “backed by nothing” even though it would also likely end up being used as a reserve asset by central banks in the next few years.





And back in January, activist investor Elliott Management told clients that Bitcoin faced an “inevitable collapse” because as an asset it has “no substance.”




The argument that crypto has no fundamental value is based on the view that other assets—stocks, bonds, cash, property, or derivatives thereof—usually entitle holders to an underlying right, such as dividends, interest, land, or other legal rights. Crypto, by contrast, is merely a medium of exchange whose price reflects only the balance of supply and demand.





While HL is right that Bitcoin is volatile and risky, it has also been a profitable trade. Bitcoin is currently at $121,000 per coin and is up 30% this year, compared with the S&P 500, which is up 15%.





Fortune contacted HL for comment.

Ops, si è verificato un problema

October got off to a hot start, but the historically strong month for Bitcoin and crypto prices—called ""Uptober"" by many investors—hit a roadblock Friday thanks to President Trump's trade war. And now prices are falling fast as liquidations pile up.

More than $1 billion worth of crypto positions have been liquidated over the last 24 hours, per data from CoinGlass, as crypto prices plunge alongside stocks following Trump's Friday morning declaration that ""massive"" tariffs against China are in the works.

Bitcoin plunged from a price above $122,000 Friday morning to about $116,200 recently, down 4% on the day, while Ethereum has fallen almost 8% to about $3,975 and Solana has dipped over 7% on the day to $205.

With those declines, Bitcoin has nearly erased all of its October gains, returning to a price last seen on October 1, while Ethereum and Solana both hit October lows on Friday per data from CoinGecko.

October has historically been a particularly strong month for Bitcoin's price—a longstanding pattern that has led much of the crypto industry to expect the same results come every fall. The trend at first seemed poised to continue this year; the first week of this month, BTC surged some 10.5% to a new all-time high price north of $126,000.

Polymarket Token Is Coming, But Likely Not This Year: Sources

But this week, those gains started to fall off. And on Friday, they were nearly entirely erased after President Trump announced he was calling off a planned meeting with Chinese president Xi Jinping, ordering a “massive increase” of tariffs on Chinese goods entering the United States, in a move even he conceded could be “potentially painful” for Americans.

Trump's sharp words also spooked the stock market. The Nasdaq is deep in the red Friday, down about 3.5%, while the S&P 500 has fallen about 2.7%. The Dow is down 1.9%.

But perhaps the most impacted asset of the day is Trump's own crypto token. WLFI, the native token of World Liberty Financial, the Trump family's crypto platform, plummeted over 17% immediately following the president's China announcement, to just north of $0.14 a token. It has since partially recovered to $0.16.

Written by Ananda Banerjee

Edited by Harsh Notariya

Weekends often bring quieter trading, but that also means sharper moves for those paying attention. While most of the market has stayed choppy, more so with BTC correcting almost 4% from its all-time high, a few altcoins to watch are flashing signs that deserve a closer look.

From breakout formations to renewed whale activity and fresh smart money accumulation, these three coins show short-term setups that could extend over the next 48 hours.

ZORA is a creator-focused token in the Base network that has caught strong attention this week. The token has surged more than 73% in the past 24 hours, driven by massive DEX inflows of roughly $420,000, according to Gecko Terminal data.

On the 12-hour chart, Zora has already broken out of an inverse head and shoulders pattern, clearing the neckline around $0.06. The move confirmed the breakout, and the token now trades near $0.09. Based on the pattern projection, Zora still carries upside potential toward the $0.10 zone — roughly a 53% measured target from the neckline.

Adding to this momentum, the Smart Money Index (SMI) — which tracks buying from informed or early traders — has continued climbing since yesterday. 

The sustained SMI uptrend suggests there's still steam left in the rally, making ZORA one of the altcoins to watch most closely this weekend as long as it stays above $0.06 support. However, if selling takes over and the ZORA price falls under $0.05 (the right shoulder of the pattern), the bullish structure would get invalidated. 

PENGU, the token linked to the Pudgy Penguins network on Solana, is another one of the altcoins to watch this weekend. While its price has stayed near $0.031, data shows steady interest from large wallets and short-term traders.

Over the past week, Smart Money holdings have increased by roughly 2.8 million tokens (3.89%), confirming quiet accumulation despite a choppy broader market. This aligns with the Smart Money Index (SMI) on the 12-hour chart, which has started forming higher highs — a sign that informed traders are positioning for a rebound. The SMI visualization is presented later in this section. 

From a technical view, PENGU trades inside a falling wedge, a bullish chart pattern that often signals the end of a downtrend. Between October 4 and 9, the token formed a higher low, while the Relative Strength Index (RSI), which measures momentum, made a lower low, creating a hidden bullish divergence that supports the recovery case.

A breakout above $0.032 would confirm this wedge pattern and could open the path toward $0.034, the next major resistance and a 10% rise from the current level. 

A close above that level might invite further upside momentum over the weekend. However, if the PENGU price falls below $0.027, the rebound setup would likely fail, and sellers could regain control. However, for the structure to turn bearish in the short-term, a dip under $0.026 might be needed. That could open possibilities for the short traders. 

For now, with improving smart money inflows and a bullish formation still intact, PENGU remains one of the more compelling altcoins to watch this weekend.

Aster (ASTER) — a newer DEX native to the BNB network — has seen its strong rally fade fast. After climbing past $2, the token has dropped almost 17% week-on-week, now trading near $1.59.

While the price trend looks weak, the on-chain data tells a more nuanced story. Smart money holdings increased by 3.65% in the last 24 hours, while mega whales (top 100 addresses) added 0.06% to their supply. Combined, that's roughly 172.9 million new ASTER tokens, equal to nearly $275 million at current prices — a significant shift after a week of steady selling.

This sudden accumulation follows an extended drawdown and signals renewed interest from large and smart holders.

On the charts, ASTER's falling wedge pattern — often a bullish reversal structure — is developing on the 1-hour timeframe. Since ASTER has a limited trading history, the 1-hour chart provides the clearest signal for short-term price behavior. In such cases, the hourly view helps identify quick momentum reversals that can extend across 24–48 hours, making it a practical setup for weekend tracking.

Between October 9 and 10, the price made a lower low, while the RSI made a higher low, confirming bullish divergence and hinting that selling pressure is weakening.

If the ASTER price holds above $1.52 and breaks $1.72, it could test the upper wedge boundary near $1.84. A successful breach might open short-term targets around $1.89–$2.02, indicating a potential weekend rebound.

A close below $1.52, however, would invalidate this recovery setup and return control to sellers.

After a sharp 17% correction, ASTER's combination of whale activity, smart money inflow, and bullish structure makes it one of the altcoins to watch this weekend, especially for traders eyeing fast, technical rebounds.

The cryptocurrency market, a landscape famed for its volatility and rapid innovation, operates on a rhythm dictated by the dominance of Bitcoin and the subsequent explosion of Altcoins. This pattern is proof that the market still moves to BTC's beat, positioning it as the unseen conductor of this vast digital sector.

How Bitcoin Dominance Peaks Before Altcoin Euphoria

In an X post, Swissblock has mentioned that the Bitcoin and Altcoin cycle continues to indicate that the crypto market remains firmly anchored to BTC dominance. Despite the rise of narratives and market behavior, the market is now approaching the full BTC season zone, a phase where capital seeks safety and structure within BTC.

However, this cycle has an interesting nuance that dominance isn't surging higher as expected, but stabilizing, hinting at early signs of rotation readiness. BTC still leads the narrative, commanding attention and confidence, but the dominance curve appears to be plateauing. 

If BTC can maintain its stability while altcoin impulses broaden, the market could soon evolve from a BTC-led phase into a mixed regime, a stage where altcoin leadership will begin to re-emerge.

Leading full-time crypto trader and investor, Daan Crypto Trades, has also recently offered a key technical perspective on the current state of the crypto market, Bitcoin Dominance, and its implications for a potential all-time high (ATH) breakout.

According to Daan's analysis, BTC has been steadily outperforming altcoins in recent weeks, a dynamic he views as healthy and necessary for the broader market. As BTC dominance rises, capital and attention consolidate around BTC, reinforcing confidence and creating the conditions needed for a convincing break toward ATH.

The analyst noted that this phase of BTC strength could extend further, potentially pushing BTC dominance as high as 60% before altcoins begin to catch up again. He believes that this dominance rally may be a bounce within a larger downtrend on the BTC dominance chart. Despite the shift, Daan maintains a balanced approach, keeping a 50/50 split portfolio between BTC and ETH altcoin spot positions, a strategy he has held for some time.

Why Bitcoin Strength Still Matters

While Bitcoin dominance is trending up, Koroush AK, Founder of ZCTraders, highlighted that as long as BTC's price maintains above the 0.382 Fibonacci retracement level around $119,400, altcoins won't enter panic mode. In addition, the broader market will continue positioning for potential all-time high breakouts.

However, BTC may experience a short-term pullback toward the midpoint at around $116,000. Thus, if BTC remains resilient above current support, an extension toward $125,000 could trigger a clean breakout to new highs, reaffirming bullish market structure. Koroush also addresses the psychology behind this kind of trading approach, that a disciplined trader must always prepare for two scenarios when trading.

A one-of-one NFT was recently created on the XRP Ledger by an artist known as Dale Forward. Listed on XRP Café, the digital artwork depicts what it feels like to pet a dog. As the artist himself describes it, ""It's like love is coming out into you and the dog.""

While the piece is wholesome on its own, what drew more attention was how quickly this 1/1 item was sold — and, ultimately, who bought it.

Thanks to the reach of social networks, less than two hours later one of the original architects of XRP Ledger and Ripple CTO, David Schwartz, announced that he had acquired the NFT, titled Pats. 

Made this 1/1 on @xrpcafe about how it feels to give a dog pats. Like love is coming out into you and the dog. pic.twitter.com/4GLKkVLSfj

Schwartz is no stranger to the digital art space, particularly the XRPL ecosystem. The address believed to belong to him — rHzWtXTBrArrGoLDixQAgcSD2dBisM19fF — currently holds 146 NFTs from 117 collections, valued at 64,265 XRP, or roughly $190,000 at current rates.

His wallet history often reveals bids on niche series that have never gained broad traction but still represent the early stages of XRPL art culture.

Ending 14-month collecting pause

As for this latest purchase, Schwartz bought Pats for 30 XRP, about $90 at the time, though its value is likely much higher now as part of Ripple CTO's collection.

Notably, this marks his first XRP NFT acquisition since August 2023, when he purchased Space Mermaid #335 for 120 XRP. Amusingly, despite being more expensive in XRP, the dollar value of that earlier buy was just $72.

Who knows? Maybe Schwartz showing interest in NFTs again is sort of a signal that this once booming segment of crypto is on the verge of a revival. Or maybe it was just a momentary effort to support a fellow XRP enthusiast.

Sorare, a blockchain-based fantasy sports game where fans can collect NFT player cards, is once again changing its home, this time migrating from StarkEx to Layer 1 chain Solana.

In an announcement on Oct. 8, Sorare described the migration from StarkEx, an Ethereum Layer 2 scaling solution, as “more than a technical upgrade,” calling it a “step forward in our vision to become the most open and flexible platform for digital sports collectibles.”

In its FAQ section for the migration, Sorare explained that it's moving to Solana to connect Sorare cards “to a broader ecosystem,” including the ability to manage the NFTs on popular Solana wallets like Phantom. The team also hinted at a possible Sorare ecosystem token in the future, as part of its long-term vision:

While the announcement didn't provide further detail as to why Sorare chose to move to Solana, commentators on X have suggested that Sorare was paid an eight-figure sum to make the switch. The Defiant reached out to Sorare and Solana for comments, but haven't heard back by press time.

Founded in 2019 by Nicolas Julia and Adrien Montfort, Sorare started on Ethereum and by mid-2021 moved onto L2 StarkEx, the application-specific scaling engine from Starknet developer, StarkWare, to cut gas costs. That same year the company raised a $680 million Series B that valued it at roughly $4.3 billion.

As part of the migration, starting this month, Sorare said that users' ETH balances currently on StarkEx will migrate to Base, Coinbase's Ethereum Layer 2, to improve “transaction efficiency while keeping the experience familiar.”

By the end of October, Sorare cards will be bridged as Solana NFTs while preserving all cards' attributes like scarcity, serial number, season, XP, and metadata, per the blog post. The team also said that Sorare will cover all gas fees for the migration, specifying that users “won't sign transactions or spend crypto during migration.”

Sorare also added that once the migration is complete, cards withdrawn to Ethereum wallets “still work in gameplay but cannot trade on Sorare until re-deposited or bridged to Solana,” while NFTs left on StarkEx will be bridged to Solana.

Sorare's migration comes as the total number of NFT sales has reached its highest level since 2022, per data from blockchain analytics platform DappRadar.

In a Thursday research post, the DappRadar wrote that in Q3, the market recorded over 18.1 million NFTs sold, generating $1.6 billion in trading volume, adding that “one of the leading dapps” in this sports field is Sorare, which is responsible for “multimillions in trading volume, selling hundreds of thousands of digital cards to players and collectors around the globe.”

Earlier today, Larva Labs, the creators of CryptoPunks, Autoglyphs, and Meebits, wrapped up Art Blocks' curated series with a new collection, Quine, with the sale closing at 7.56 ETH, or $31,000 per Quine NFT.

Engineering careers often have to go up against a backdrop of constant change in technological advancements and people's interests, and as a result, each new role brings a different set of challenges, industries, and software to master.

With a decade of work spanning robotics, cloud infrastructure, large-scale financial systems, and now cryptocurrency, engineer Brindal Patel knows firsthand what that means. After early roles at an embedded-systems startup, he built high-volume platforms at Twilio, modernized critical payment systems at Meta, and today develops internal tools and enterprise applications as a senior software engineer at Coinbase.

Brindal Patel was born in India in 1992, part of a generation that witnessed technology leap from floppy disks to the internet in just a few years. That rapid change sparked his curiosity about how machines could learn, adapt, and ultimately make life easier.

When Patel arrived in the United States in 2014 to pursue a master's degree in electrical engineering at California State University, Long Beach, he immersed himself in emerging fields that were starting to define modern computing: embedded systems, IoT, robotics, and computer vision.

For his master's project, he developed a system he called “R-eye,” designed to give robots a form of vision through real-time objects and facial recognition. The project pushed beyond academic theory, relying on low-power computing and low-resolution cameras to prove that AI could run efficiently even in constrained environments.

Patel has described R-eye as a step toward merging the physical and digital worlds — a way for machines to process their surroundings independently, without constant human input. The potential applications ranged from healthcare and industrial safety to security and disaster response, areas where speed and precision can save lives.

The experience cemented his interest in robotics and how it could play a central role in shaping the future, giving him a drive to build technology that serves practical, human-centered goals.

After earning his master's degree, Patel began his career at an early-stage startup as an embedded software engineer, drawn to the chance to work on a little bit of everything. “Since I joined the company at a very early stage,” he recalls, “I actually ended up working with hardware, web, app, product management — everything you can imagine in startup culture.”

The experience taught him how products take shape in real-time, where decisions about technology and design have an immediate impact. It also helped him discover a passion for cloud technologies and backend systems, where complex infrastructure meets problem-solving at scale. 

Three years later, he applied those lessons to Twilio, a company whose products he already admired as a customer. There, he helped build large-scale cloud systems capable of processing 18 billion daily events, a technical challenge that tested everything he had learned about designing for scale and reliability. “That was one of my proudest moments,” he says. “Being one of the main developers on a system of that scale showed me what was possible when the right technology meets the right team.”

Twilio, he adds, was also home to some of the best technical and non-technical colleagues he had ever worked with, reinforcing his value of collaboration in solving complex problems.

For his next stage, Patel joined Meta during the COVID-19 pandemic, moving to Silicon Valley and working on two high-impact engineering teams: Payouts and Instagram Channels. On the Payouts side, he was involved with expanding systems that had been in place for nearly a decade, critical infrastructure for a company of Meta's scale.

His work focused on a full redesign of these payout systems, introducing automation for everything from validation and reconciliation to approval flows and ledgering. One of the most significant upgrades was a system for ad-hoc payments, allowing Meta to send funds more quickly during crises such as natural disasters or sudden large-scale service outages.

“Our goal with these projects was to ensure people received support quickly both during regular events and unique emergencies, without needing manual intervention,” Patel explains.

These efforts carried major financial and compliance implications. By replacing manual processes with automated, rules-based systems, Patel and his team helped reduce the risk of costly errors or regulatory penalties while improving the consistency and timeliness of payment operations.

Today, Patel works as a senior software engineer at Coinbase, where, just like in his time at Meta, he's leading efforts on high-impact initiatives, where his decisions shape systems relied upon by millions of users and regulatory bodies.

He's been behind the development of internal and administrative tools used by teams across the company, including customer support and compliance officers. These systems help manage critical processes such as investigating fraudulent activity, resolving account issues, verifying user identities, and preparing reports for regulatory inquiries, all to make sure that customer information is handled with care and appropriate safeguards.

Patel notes that Coinbase operates in what he calls “still the early days” of crypto, an industry evolving quickly as companies build the infrastructure for a more open financial system. At Coinbase, engineers are expected to take projects from initial design to production, designing the backend infrastructure that allow millions of users to engage fairly and securely with crypto assets, whether that's trading, staking, spending, or transferring money across borders. That technical challenge, Patel says, is what drew him to the role.

That energy also connects to his long-term ambitions. Patel ultimately wants to start his own company, ideally at the intersection of healthcare, robotics, and the still-growing AI space. He believes technology can do more than power financial systems or social networks; it can personalize medicine, improve industrial safety, and expand access to life-saving tools, and he wants to assist in driving those innovations forward.

Whether he's helping startups grow or designing next-generation tools for crypto compliance at Coinbase, Brindal Patel's career reflects a belief that engineering at its best solves both practical problems and human ones.

Friday brought carnage onto crypto markets as U.S.-China trade tensions ratcheted up with Trump threatening a massive increase in tariffs against Chinese goods.

Worst-hit among the crypto benchmark CoinDesk 20 Index constituents was Ethereum's native token ether ETH$4,005.03, nosediving 7% from Friday's session high and hitting its weakest price since late September below $4,100. Its decline far outpaced bitcoin's BTC$111,480.33 3.5% drop below $118,000 and the index's 5% plunge.

The broad-market downturn spurred a liquidation cascade across crypto derivatives markets, wiping out over $600 million of leveraged trading positions among all assets, CoinGlass data shows.

ETH also led in liquidations with over $235 million long positions wiped out through the session. Longs are leveraged bets seeking to profit from the asset's price rise.

Behind the liquidation cascade was ETH's breakdown of critical support levels, CoinDesk Research's technical analysis model suggested.

• Selling pressure materialized at around 14:00 UTC with a volume of 372,211 units, almost double than the 24-hour average of 190,747 units.

• Volume-based resistance confirmed around $4,287.

• Primary resistance identified at $4,141 during failed recovery attempt.

• Potential support forming just below $4,100 where buyers emerged.

When Will the Leaves Turn? This Is How Scientists Find Peak Fall Colors

If you want to know where the best leaf peeping will be this year, climate science and weather can provide the answer

By Humberto Basilio edited by Andrea Thompson

Evan Fisher first fell in love with the changing colors of fall while looking at an old maple tree in the backyard of his childhood home in North Carolina. A decade later the meteorologist and geospatial analyst set out to use his professional skills to predict where he could find the most striking reds, oranges, yellows and purples each year.

Together with a college friend, Fisher began using data on temperature, daylight hours and precipitation to build a machine-learning model that could forecast where the first signs of autumn would appear and when the colors would reach their peak throughout the country. In 2023 the team launched Explore Fall, a public platform that is able to predict fall foliage progression across the continental U.S.

Fisher and other experts agree that autumn foliage is arriving early this year. Yellow, orange and reddish leaves can already be seen in the Northeast, the Northwest and some central portions of the country. Peak colors are gradually spilling out from New England and the higher elevations of the Rockies into lower elevations and areas closer to the coast. According to a seasonal forecast from AccuWeather, the best fall foliage in 2025 is expected in New England, the Colorado Rockies, the Plains and the Midwest, whereas regions such as the Appalachians and Pacific Northwest may see duller color or early leaf drop.

Accuweather

The arrival of autumn isn't just a matter of natural beauty—and billions of dollars in tourism—it also gives scientists a chance to study the health of trees and forests, including how climate change affects the aging of leaves, known as senescence.

During autumn, three main factors—day length, temperature and rainfall—influence when the leaves of various tree species change color, how long that takes and how vibrant the colors are. Reduced sunlight, for example, slows photosynthesis, which reorganizes leaf pigments and causes them to change color. Lower temperatures allow plants to begin shutting down. Rainfall during the summer increases soil moisture, making leaves more vibrant when autumn arrives, whereas summer drought can mean dull foliage.

Each tree species responds differently to these factors. Maple leaves, for instance, get their vivid reds and deep purples from anthocyanins, pigments that form when sugars accumulate after growth stops in fall. Cool nights trap these sugars, enhancing color, whereas warm nights deplete them, causing anthocyanins to fade and the leaves to lose their characteristic autumn brilliance.Meanwhile research has shown that warmer conditions delay leaf fall in oak and beech, whereas other studies find the opposite is true in birch and poplar.

Extreme weather events such as early frosts, drought and high heat or rainfall also have a strong effect on the brightness and timing of leaf color, says University of Arizona plant phenologist Theresa Crimmins. Stress on trees can dull the display and, in some cases, cause leaves to drop without ever changing color. “That's definitely a bummer,” she says.

This year drought and low soil moisture will shorten and dull peak foliage in parts of the Northeast and around the southern Great Lakes and Ohio Valley, according to AccuWeather. Across the West, severe drought will trigger early, less vivid foliage.



Explore Fall

The Explore Fall team trained its model to capture these patterns, using deep learning to process decades of data on temperature, daylight and rainfall. The system classifies regions into categories ranging from “Little to No Color” to “Peak Color” and can adjust predictions with satellite observations. Fisher says the model can predict the peak to within an accuracy of three days about 80 percent of the time.“Their map looks really cool,” Crimmins says.

Although leaf color change has remained stable over the past two years, data going further back in time show that peak color has been arriving earlier than before, which may be “a sign of what is still to come,” Fisher says.

Research bears this observation out: A 2023 study that used satellite data, ground observations, measurements of atmospheric carbon and controlled experiments to separate the roles of temperature, photosynthesis and day length found that warming before the summer solstice tends to make senescence start earlier. On the other hand, warming after the solstice slows it down, extending the colorful season.



Accuweather

Though a longer period of senescence might sound exciting for autumn enthusiasts, the downside is that leaves have less time to photosynthesize. “As soon as leaves lose their green color in autumn, they switch to producing CO2, and if that period gets longer, that can be a problem,” because it contributes to global warming, says ecologist Constantin Zohner of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich, who co-authored the 2023 paper.

“Fall colors are indicators of the vitality of our forests,” says forest ecologist Andy Finton of the Nature Conservancy. A drastic change in the foliage is not a good sign, he explains. “Forests provide our clean drinking water, clean air, and they give us opportunities for recreation and well-being.”

Now You Can Add It Yourself.","https://www.popularmechanics.com/cars/car-technology/a68902844/a-lot-of-evs-dont-have-apple-carplay-now-you-can-add-it-yourself/","Fri, 10 Oct 2025 13:00:00 GMT","

It costs $399, piggybacks onto the existing infotainment screen, and allows for both wired and wireless phone connectivity.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story.

Let's face it, cars have rapidly become extensions of our smartphones. This seamless integration—facilitated by software like Apple CarPlay and Android Auto—allows mission-critical phone apps to be displayed on the much larger infotainment screens of our cars. However, not all automakers have signed off on adding these services; Rivian, Tesla, and General Motors are among the few automakers that have yet to allow Apple and Google's services into their automobiles.

Rivian's CEO, RJ Scaringe, remains confident that the brand's user interface is just as good as Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. And that's why the small California startup Amprocity is working on EV Play, a small piggyback box that adds CarPlay and Android Auto to new vehicles that don't support either service. That's not to say that Rivian hasn't made efforts to add third-party apps—the brand has recently added a Google Maps layer to its navigation suite, and has embraced Spotify support for quite some time.  

EV Play is an Android-powered device that connects directly to the vehicle's infotainment system. The installation process isn't necessarily what we'd call “plug and play,” but EV Play remains impressive. The $399 device is currently available for pre-order, with a $99 refundable deposit required. There's also an optional $36 annual subscription that adds new feature updates and an extended warranty, along with priority tech support and access to developer forums. 

Installation requires tapping into several fuses, as well as the vehicle's video and CAN bus connectors. Once installed, the box itself features two USB ports that allow you to add dongles for wireless keyboards and WiFi, which you should also be able to use them for wired Apple CarPlay and Android Auto access. Once everything is installed, Amprocity includes a wireless one-button remote for switching between EV Play access and the vehicle's standard interface. Amprocity mentions Gen2 Rivian vehicles will revert to the standard system when reverse gear is engaged to retain use of the backup camera.

While we haven't had the chance to evaluate EV Play ourselves, we're impressed with how well the system seems to integrate with the existing infotainment system. The touch-screen controls also appear very responsive—unlike many of the CarPlay tablet add-on solutions we've seen previously, which were marketed as a one-size-fits-most approach. With pre-orders supposedly over, we're looking at hopefully evaluating an EV Play module ourselves in the near future.

Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) shows variable responses to immunotherapy, highlighting the need for biomarkers to guide patient selection. We applied a spatial multi-omics approach to 234 advanced NSCLC patients treated with programmed death 1-based immunotherapy across three cohorts to identify biomarkers associated with outcome. Spatial proteomics (n = 67) and spatial compartment-based transcriptomics (n = 131) enabled profiling of the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME). Using spatial proteomics, we identified a resistance cell-type signature including proliferating tumor cells, granulocytes, vessels (hazard ratio (HR) = 3.8, P = 0.004) and a response signature, including M1/M2 macrophages and CD4 T cells (HR = 0.4, P = 0.019). We then generated a cell-to-gene resistance signature using spatial transcriptomics, which was predictive of poor outcomes (HR = 5.3, 2.2, 1.7 across Yale, University of Queensland and University of Athens cohorts), while a cell-to-gene response signature predicted favorable outcomes (HR = 0.22, 0.38 and 0.56, respectively). This framework enables robust TIME modeling and identifies biomarkers to support precision immunotherapy in NSCLC.

Patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) without targetable driver alterations generally face a poor prognosis, with only a minority responding to existing therapies. More than 50% develop resistance, and approximately 40% show primary resistance even with high programmed death 1 (PD-1) ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression1,2,3. Furthermore, immunotherapy can cause severe immune-related toxicities, including fatal events. These challenges highlight the urgent need for patient stratification to optimize therapeutic efficacy.

Spatial multi-omics enhances our understanding of the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) by integrating various omics data in the context of the underlying tissue architecture. This approach combines protein cell phenotyping with gene expression profiling, delivering unique insights into cellular functions and disease mechanisms. Techniques such as codetection by indexing (CODEX)4 enable high-resolution protein mapping in intact tissues, revealing both cellular heterogeneity and spatial dynamics within the TIME. Similarly, Digital Spatial Profiling (DSP)-GeoMx Whole Transcriptome Analysis (WTA) enables spatial transcriptomic profiling at cellular compartment resolution, allowing direct correlation between gene expression and spatially localized cellular phenotypes5. Together, spatial proteomics and transcriptomics offer a comprehensive view of tissue organization, uncovering key molecular interactions and disease-associated changes6. This integrated strategy enables the identification of compartment-specific biomarkers and therapeutic targets for diagnostic and prognostic use7. Furthermore, machine learning approaches have shown that complex spatial molecular patterns can be linked to clinical outcomes8. Predicting the outcomes of first-line immunotherapy treatments is particularly important due to the absence of confounding from prior treatments. Tailoring models to predict treatment outcomes specifically for first-line immunotherapy aids in clinical decision-making by ensuring that assessments are unaffected by prior treatments, thereby enhancing treatment efficacy and enabling predictions for patients without multiple treatment exposures.

Our study aimed to develop a robust machine learning approach for training spatial signatures to predict first-line immunotherapy outcomes, including progression-free survival (PFS) at 2 and 5 years, and overall survival (OS), in NSCLC using a multi-omics approach. We hypothesized that integrating cell types and gene expression data with spatial context would enhance predictive accuracy. We first constructed cell-type-based signatures, then derived gene signatures from outcome-associated cell types using a training cohort (Yale cohort; Fig. 1a). These resistance and response signatures were validated in two independent external cohorts from University of Queensland and University of Athens (UQ and Greek cohorts respectively; Fig. 1a). By integrating spatial omics and machine learning techniques (Fig. 1b), we aim to improve treatment decisions and patient outcomes.

Spatial proteomic profiling of advanced NSCLC tissues identified distinct cellular populations within tumor and stromal compartments. Figure 2a and Extended Data Fig. 1a,b illustrate cell phenotyping using a 29-marker panel, while Fig. 2b lists the markers used for identifying specific cell types. Representative tumor areas of interest (AOIs) are displayed in Fig. 2c,d. Tumor cells were most abundant in tumor AOIs, whereas M1/M2 macrophages and fibroblasts predominated in stromal AOIs. We then compared cell-type distributions as a function of PFS. In tumor AOIs from the training (Fig. 2e) and validation cohorts (Fig. 2f), granulocytes and proliferating tumor cells were enriched in patients with shorter PFS. In stromal AOIs (Fig. 2g,h), M1 and M2 macrophages were more prevalent in patients with longer PFS. These trends were consistent across cohorts. We also analyzed cell composition in the Yale cohort using a 5-year PFS cut point. Due to limited follow-up, this analysis was not performed in the UQ cohort. The observed patterns aligned with earlier findings that granulocytes and proliferating tumor cells were enriched in progressors in the tumor compartment, while M1 and M2 macrophages were more prevalent in nonprogressors in the stromal compartment (Supplementary Fig. 1a,b).

To further explore associations between cell fractions and treatment outcome, we used a 2-year PFS endpoint and performed univariable Cox analyses for each cell type and compartment independently. In the tumor compartment, granulocytes, proliferating tumor and vessel cells were linked to increased risk of disease progression or death (Fig. 3a and Supplementary Fig. 2a). These trends were observed across cohorts but did not reach statistical significance after Benjamini–Hochberg (BH) adjustment. Figure 3b shows a representative region of interest (ROI) from a patient with shorter PFS, enriched in granulocytes and vessel cells. In the stromal compartment, M1 macrophages, M2 macrophages and CD4 T cells were associated with improved PFS in both cohorts (Fig. 3c and Supplementary Fig. 2b). While consistent trends were observed, for instance, granulocytes, vessels and proliferating tumor cells were linked to worse PFS, and M1 and M2 macrophages were associated with better PFS, none remained significant post-BH-adjustment. We also investigated associations with 5-year PFS in the Yale cohort (Supplementary Fig. 2c,d), which showed consistent patterns with the 2-year analysis across both tumor and stromal compartments.

Spatial cell-type signatures were developed using spatial proteomic-derived cell fractions to predict outcomes to immunotherapy in advanced NSCLC patients. A schematic overview of the signature generation pipeline is shown in Extended Data Fig. 2, which is based on a previously established robust signature training approach5. The Yale cohort served as the training set, which was split multiple times into tenfolds. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO)-penalized Cox models were built to predict 2- and 5-year PFS, constrained to identify resistance-associated cell types by enforcing their coefficients to be non-negative (Methods). Each split generated a LASSO model using cross-validation, and a final Cox regression model was trained using cell types consistently selected across all splits, which identified proliferating tumor cells, vessels and granulocytes as high-risk features. The final model was evaluated on the full training cohort and then tested in the independent UQ validation cohort. In the tumor compartment of the training set, the resistance model was significantly associated with worse PFS (HR = 3.8, P = 0.004, two-sided log-rank test; Fig. 3d,e). Validation in the UQ cohort showed consistent predictive value (HR = 1.8, P = 0.05, one-sided log-rank test; Fig. 3f). In the stromal compartment, granulocytes and proliferating tumor cells were predictive in the training set (Supplementary Fig. 3a,b) but did not reach significance in the UQ cohort validation cohort (Supplementary Fig. 3c), despite similar trends. These results highlight the role of granulocytes, vessels and proliferating tumor cells in resistance within the tumor compartment, underscoring the spatial specificity of these signatures.

Spatial cell-type signatures were developed using spatial proteomics-derived cell fractions to predict response to immunotherapy in advanced NSCLC patients. As with the resistance model, the Yale cohort was used for training, using a robust signature training approach5. Cell-type signatures were trained to predict 2- and 5-year PFS, constrained to identify response-associated cell types, by enforcing their coefficients to be nonpositive (Methods). In the stromal compartment, M1 and M2 macrophages and CD4 T cells had negative coefficients, indicating reduced risk. These were significantly associated with improved outcomes in the training cohort for PFS-5 years (HR = 0.4, P = 0.019, two-sided log-rank test) and showed a similar trend for PFS-2 years (HR = 0.57, P = 0.12; Fig. 3g,h). In the UQ validation cohort, this signature remained predictive (HR = 0.49, P = 0.036, one-sided log-rank test; Fig. 3i), supporting the role of stromal M1 and M2 macrophages and CD4 T cells mediating immunotherapy response. In contrast, the tumor compartment response model, which included tumor cells, M1 macrophages, M2 macrophages and DCs, was predictive in the training cohort (Supplementary Fig. 3d,e), but did not achieve significance in the validation cohort (Supplementary Fig. 3f). These results emphasize the importance of the stromal immune context in predicting immunotherapy benefit.

We further evaluated the association of the resistance model with OS at 2 and 5 years (Supplementary Fig. 4a–d) and observed consistent trends with PFS across cohorts. Conversely, when we examined the association of the response model with OS at 5 years and 2 years, the response model showed no statistically significant association in OS at either time point in the UQ validation cohort (Supplementary Fig. 5a–d). This suggests that response-associated cell types are more reflective of early treatment dynamics and disease control rather than long-term survival. The lack of statistical significance in OS highlights the temporal specificity of the response signature.

To explore spatial features linked to response and resistance models derived from cell frequencies, we analyzed spatial organization and interactions. Representative Voronoi diagrams illustrate the spatial distribution of cell types associated with the response (Fig. 4a) and resistance (Fig. 4b) models. M2 macrophages predominated in response-associated regions, while the resistance Voronoi diagram shows an enrichment of vessels, PD-L1+ tumor cells and proliferating tumor cells. Cellular neighborhoods were constructed to determine the spatial aggregation of cellular communities9. We identified ten distinct neighborhoods representing unique spatial architectures (Fig. 4c). These were annotated based on predominant cell-type enrichment, including M1 macrophage, vessel and immune cell, tumor cell, PD-L1+ tumor, granulocyte, tumor-adjacent stroma, immune-rich, M2 macrophage, proliferating tumor and stromal cell communities. Neighborhood frequencies were correlated with PFS. Proliferating tumor communities were more common in patients who progressed (P = 0.07, two-tailed t test), supporting the role of tumor proliferation in therapy resistance (Fig. 4d). Changes in neighborhood composition further revealed insights into the biology of therapy response. Within granulocyte-rich neighborhoods, higher levels of PD-L1+ tumor cells, B cells, and DCs were linked to progression (P < 0.0001, Ordinary Least Squares; OLS model F test), suggesting a protumor microenvironment (Extended Data Fig. 3). Pairwise spatial interactions were analyzed to uncover cell-cell relationships (Fig. 4e). Proliferating tumor cells predominantly interacted with granulocytes and endothelial cells (vessels), implying roles in tumor proliferation and angiogenesis. In the response model, we examined interactions between M1/M2 macrophages, or CD4 T cells and other immune or tumor cells. B cells showed high interactions with M1 macrophages, suggesting a potential role in antitumor activity. M2 macrophages showed near-significant interaction with CD8 T cells (P = 0.06), highlighting a modulation of cytotoxic responses. Comparing interaction scores between progressors and nonprogressors revealed higher M2-CD4 T cell interactions and M2-CD8 T cell interactions in nonprogressors, (Fig. 4f), indicating an immune-supportive microenvironment in patients with better outcomes.

The response model, derived from spatial analysis, highlights the critical role of M1 and M2 macrophages and CD4 T cells in predicting response to PD-1-based immunotherapy. Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) visualizations of all 14 cell types (Fig. 4g), alongside expression dynamics of each marker, identified in spatial proteomic data, show higher PD-L1 expression on M1 (CD68+) and M2 (CD163+) macrophages compared to PanCK+Ki67+ proliferating tumor cells. In the Yale cohort, nonprogressors showed significantly higher PD-L1 expression in both tumor cells (Fig. 4i) and macrophages (Fig. 4j). However, comparative analysis revealed that PD-L1 expression on macrophages, unlike that on tumor cells, was consistently associated with longer PFS (Extended Data Fig. 4a,b). To address limitations due to sample size, we combined data from the Yale and UQ cohorts to enhance statistical power (Extended Data Fig. 4c,d). The pooled analysis confirmed a significant association between macrophage PD-L1 expression and PFS, while tumor cell PD-L1 remained nonsignificant. Notably, PD-L1 expression on tumor cells correlated with clinical response in only one cohort; however, this correlation was not replicated in the other, indicating inconsistency across datasets. Regression analysis further supported this trend. PD-L1 expression was strongly correlated with the mean proportions of M1 or M2 macrophages or CD14+ myeloid cells (P < 0.001, Spearman's rank), but not with PanCK+ tumor cells (P = 0.17, Spearman's rank; Extended Data Fig. 4e–h). These findings suggest that the presence of PD-L1 on macrophages could be indicative of a positive response to treatment.

To validate the proteomic findings, we performed cell-type deconvolution using whole transcriptomic data. We used CIBERSORTx10 with the LM22 gene signature matrix, which profiles immune cell types enriched in the stromal region. Figure 5a shows a schematic of the deconvolution workflow applied to stromal gene expression data. Transcriptomic profiles were deconvolved into cell-type fractions, and patients were stratified by PFS at 2 years. Figure 5b demonstrates increased M2 macrophage fractions (red cells) in patients with longer PFS. To confirm this, we performed two-tailed t tests comparing groups with longer and shorter PFS. Results show a substantial increase in M2 macrophages in patients with better outcomes (P = 0.02; Fig. 5c). These transcriptomic results are consistent with our proteomic analysis, reinforcing the role of M2 macrophages in predicting favorable responses to immunotherapy.

We developed resistance-associated gene signatures from whole transcriptomic data in the same cohorts profiled proteomically, within the tumor compartment of advanced NSCLC. DSP-GeoMx WTA was performed across all cohorts, and one ROI was excluded from further analysis due to discrepancies across experiments (Supplementary Fig. 6). The overall workflow for gene signature development is outlined in Extended Data Fig. 5. For this purpose, we first isolated cell-type-specific genes based on CIBERSORTx and Lung Cancer Atlas (LuCA) cell-type signatures, focusing on granulocytes, vessels and proliferating tumor cells (~500 genes; Methods). Following an approach based on a previously established robust signature training framework, models were trained and tested on multiple splits of the training set to identify genes consistently associated with the highest performance, which were then included in the final resistance model. This approach selected eight genes with positive coefficients (indicative of resistance), KRT7, KRT18, EFNA1, SERINC2, FZD6, CD24, CCND3 and S100A9 (Fig. 6a). Higher signature scores were associated with worse outcomes across all cohorts. Using the tertile cut point established in the training cohort, high signature scores were linked to a hazard ratio (HR) of 5.3 (P < 0.001, two-sided log-rank test) in the Yale training cohort (Fig. 6b). Validation in the UQ and Greek cohorts confirmed these associations (HR = 2.2, P = 0.036; HR = 1.7, P = 0.042, respectively; one-sided log-rank test; Fig. 6c,d). Two-tailed log-rank tests were used in the discovery/training (Yale) cohort, whereas one-tailed log-rank tests were applied in validation cohorts, to test for effects in the same direction as observed in the discovery cohort. Multivariable analysis adjusting for clinical variables confirmed the signature's independent prognostic value (Supplementary Tables 4 and 5). However, limited heterogeneity in some covariates in the Greek cohort (which contained over 92% stage IV patients and 86% receiving first-line ICIs) and small sample size in the UQ cohort (in which some histologic subtypes were underrepresented) may limit the capacity of multivariable models to effectively control for confounding. Differential expression analysis showed upregulation of these genes in patients who progressed or died on immunotherapy (Extended Data Fig. 6a). Collectively, these genes are significantly associated with Gene Ontology (GO) biological processes related to epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), regulation of cell adhesion, regulation of locomotion and regulation of epithelial cell migration (P < 0.001, F tests; Extended Data Fig. 6b), supporting their role in tumor progression and metastasis.

We developed a response gene signature based on response cell-type models within the stromal compartment using a similar approach to the resistance gene signature training. Gene sets were derived from immune cell types using CIBERSORTx's LM22 matrix and LuCA dataset, which were used to deconvolve stroma transcriptomics and compare profiles by PFS status at 2 years. We focused on the expression of genes associated with M1 and M2 macrophages and CD4 T cells (~200 genes) to construct response models. The final model contains eight genes with negative coefficients (indicative of response), SIGLEC1, TLR2, CXCL9, CD81, MRC1, CCL8, CCL13 and FCGR1A (Fig. 6e). High signature scores, defined by the upper tertile in the training cohort, were associated with improved outcomes. In the Yale training cohort, high scores were correlated with significantly better outcomes (HR = 0.22, P = 0.005, two-sided log-rank test). Validation in the UQ cohort confirmed the association (HR = 0.38, P = 0.034, one-sided log-rank test; Fig. 6f,g) and the Greek cohort showed a consistent trend (HR = 0.56, P = 0.041; Fig. 6h). Multivariable analysis, adjusting for clinical covariates, confirmed the signature's independent prognostic value in both validation cohorts (Supplementary Tables 6 and 7). Differential expression analysis showed these genes were significantly upregulated in nonprogressors (Extended Data Fig. 7a) and were enriched in immune-related processes, including leukocyte and lymphocyte activation (Extended Data Fig. 7b), supporting their role in mediating antitumor immune responses.

We further assessed the association of the gene models with additional clinical endpoints, including 5-year PFS, 5-year OS and 2-year OS. For the resistant model, we applied a tertile cut point for 5-year PFS and median cutpoints for OS endpoints, all established in the Yale training cohort (Extended Data Fig. 8a–f) and used consistently across UQ (Extended Data Fig. 9a,b) and Greek (Extended Data Fig. 10a–f) validation cohorts. In the Yale cohort, both resistance and response gene models were significantly associated with longer 5-year PFS. The resistance model was also significantly associated with both 5-year and 2-year OS, while the response model showed only a trend with P values of 0.06 (HR = 0.34) for OS at 5 years and 0.09 (HR = 0.37) for OS at 2 years. These findings suggest that the resistance gene model more robustly predicts both PFS and OS, whereas the response gene model appears specific to PFS. This underscores the importance of selecting appropriate clinical endpoints when evaluating the efficacy of these models. The stronger association of the resistance model with OS highlights its potential utility in identifying higher-risk patients and guiding long-term treatment strategies. In the UQ cohort, limited follow-up time restricted the OS analysis to months. Although the resistance model showed a trend toward worse PFS (HR = 2.3, P = 0.06), significance was not reached. The response model showed no validation, likely due to insufficient follow-up time. In the Greek cohort, high resistance scores were significantly associated with worse 5-year PFS (HR = 1.8, P = 0.029). OS showed a similar trend, with HR = 1.6 (P = 0.06) at 5 years and HR = 1.5 (P = 0.14) at 2 years. For the response model, higher scores trended with improved outcomes for PFS at 5 years (HR = 0.61, P = 0.06), OS at 5 years (HR = 0.67, P = 0.11) and OS at 2 years (HR = 0.62, P = 0.12). The consistent trends across different endpoints support the prognostic potential of both models.

Our study presents a spatial multi-omic framework for developing biomarkers associated with PD-1-based immunotherapies in solid tumors. In this study, rather than directly generating protein-based signatures, we transformed protein expression into phenotypic cell states and then derived cell-type signatures linked to immunotherapy outcomes. Genes were subsequently extracted from these cell types to construct transcriptomic signatures associated with immunotherapy outcomes. The rationale behind this approach lies in the difficulty of directly combining proteomic and transcriptomic data, which is challenging due to the nonlinear dependency between protein and RNA expression. Incorporating spatial context further strengthens this approach by enabling the identification of not only relevant cell types and genes but also their localization within the TIME. Spatial coordinates embedded in outcome models provide a layer of evidence, capturing interactions shaped by tissue architecture.

We first developed resistance and response cell-type models from spatial proteomic data. These models identified distinct cell-type distributions associated with PFS and enabled the creation of a hierarchical map of gene signatures within the same spatial locations. The resistance signature (comprising proliferating tumor cells, granulocytes and vessels) was enriched in the tumor compartment, forming a resistant niche that promotes cancer progression. In contrast, the response signature, enriched in M1 and M2 macrophages and CD4 T cells, was prominent in the stroma, highlighting the importance of the stromal immune environment in mediating treatment responses. To validate these findings, we conducted orthogonal validation using transcriptomic data and the CIBERSORTx deconvolution, confirming a higher abundance of M2 macrophages in patients with longer PFS, consistent with the response stromal signature. The spatial analysis proved pivotal in clarifying the role of PD-L1 expression on macrophages. Spatial mapping of PD-L1 expression further clarified its role, showing PD-L1-positive macrophages contribute to a favorable TIME and enhance PD-1-based immunotherapy efficacy. Current companion diagnostics in NSCLC, such as pembrolizumab eligibility, rely on the tumor proportion score (TPS), which measures PD-L1 expression on tumor cells alone11,12,13. In contrast, the combined positive score (CPS), which includes immune cells, has shown better correlation with treatment response, aligning with our findings14,15. Furthermore, research in refs. 16,17 showed that PD-L1 expression on macrophages enhances CD8+ T cell proliferation and cytotoxicity, supporting the use of CPS. Neighborhood and cell interaction analysis revealed key spatial dynamics underlying therapeutic outcomes. Patients with disease progression had elevated communities of proliferating tumor cells, granulocytes and vessels, indicating their collaborative roles in tumor proliferation and angiogenesis. In contrast, interactions among M1 macrophages, B cells and CD4 T cells in responders point to effective immune regulation. Increased interactions between M2 macrophages and both CD4 and CD8 T cells in nonprogressors suggest a role in favorable outcomes. Macrophage plasticity, specifically repolarization from M2 to M1 phenotype, can enhance antitumor immunity, making macrophages attractive therapeutic targets18,19,20. A recent study shows that targeting MS4A4A on M2 macrophages can restore CD8+ T-cell-mediated antitumor immunity and improve anti-PD-1 therapy efficacy21. Our findings support the critical role of M2 macrophages in modulating the TIME and their potential to enhance immunotherapy responses, supporting the value of comprehensive markers such as CPS.

Building upon the cell-type signatures, we developed gene-based signatures using a cell-to-gene modeling approach. For the resistance signature, genes such as KRT7, KRT18 and FZD6 are linked to EMT, a process enabling tumor invasion and metastasis, and contribute to chemoresistance and reduced immunotherapy response22. EFNA1 and FZD6 also promote angiogenesis, supporting tumor growth and immune evasion by creating hypoxic environments23. S100A9 and CD24 are associated with immune suppression. S100A9 (and its partner, S100A8) activates endothelial cells via TLR4 and RAGE, producing proinflammatory cytokines and promoting a protumor microenvironment24, while CD24 mediates immune evasion25 via SIGLEC-10 (ref. 26). CCND3 and SERINC2 promote cell cycle progression and proliferation, with CCND3 regulating the G1/S transition27, and SERINC2 contributing to lipid biosynthesis and cancer cell survival28.

The response signature includes genes such as SIGLEC1 and CXCL9, which mediate immune activation. SIGLEC1 is crucial for macrophage differentiation and immune responses29, while CXCL9 attracts immune cells and promotes T cell infiltration30. TLR2, highly expressed on M1 macrophages, supports innate immune activation31. Elevated CD81 on CD4 T cells enhances migration and adhesion, aiding antitumor responses32. MRC1 (CD206), a marker of M2 macrophages33, typically associated with immune suppression, may adopt a more proinflammatory role when co-expressing high PD-L1, potentially enhancing the immunotherapy response. CCL8 and CCL13 facilitate immune cell recruitment to inflammation sites34, potentially improving immunotherapy outcomes. FCGR1A, expressed on macrophages, enables antibody-dependent phagocytosis35, supporting tumor clearance in the presence of opsonizing antibodies. These resistance and response gene signatures collectively highlight distinct spatial patterns. It is noteworthy that the resistance signature primarily originates from the tumor compartment, while the response signature is specific to the stromal compartment. The tumor compartment fosters resistance through EMT, cell migration and angiogenesis, while the stromal compartment contributes to therapeutic response via immune cell activation and differentiation. These spatial gene signatures offer valuable insights into mechanisms underlying immunotherapy outcomes in advanced NSCLC.

While our findings provide strong support for the utility of multi-omics profiling in predicting outcomes, we acknowledge several limitations. Notably, differences in the proportion of disease stages, treatment regimens and line of immunotherapy in the validation cohorts, constrain the interpretability of multivariable results. The UQ cohort had limited representation of certain subtypes. The Greek cohort predominantly included stage IV patients treated with first-line immunotherapy, intentionally selected to test our signatures in this setting. We acknowledge that the broad generalizability of our signatures in highly heterogeneous cohorts requires further testing. Furthermore, we acknowledge that, due to the reduced number of patients in certain covariate subgroups in the validation cohorts, the multivariable analysis may not be able to quantify the effects of all covariates with high accuracy. Therefore, an accurate determination of the effect sizes would benefit from testing on larger cohorts. Finally, PD-L1 expression, tumor mutation burden and performance status were not consistently available and thus excluded from our models.

Due to the small number of patients who received only first-line immunotherapy in the UQ validation cohort, we included patients treated with first, second and third line or beyond immunotherapy, introducing some heterogeneity. The ability of our models to achieve statistical significance in this setting adds credibility to their broad potential clinical utility, although, as noted above, the generalizability of the signatures as prognostic models requires further validation in more heterogeneous datasets. Future retrospective studies with extended follow-up and prospective validation will be essential to strengthen clinical relevance. Ultimately, the development of cell-to-gene signatures, augmented by spatial information, represents a substantial step forward in personalized medicine for NSCLC.

We studied three independent cohorts of patients with NSCLC who were treated with PD-1-based immunotherapies in the advanced or metastatic setting. The clinical characteristics of the cohorts are presented in Supplementary Tables 1 and 2. The first cohort, which served as the training cohort, was obtained from the Yale Cancer Center (New Haven). This cohort comprises 113 tissue samples collected between 2012 and 2019 (Fig. 1a). Tissue microarray (TMA) master blocks were created using nonadjacent tumor cores, each with a diameter of 0.6 mm, from each patient's biopsy. To represent tumor heterogeneity, 5 µm-thick cuts from four independent blocks per TMA, each containing a different core (ROI) from the same patient tumor, were used for transcriptomic profiling using the DSP-GeoMx WTA or CTA (cancer transcriptome atlas, Bruker Spatial Biology, US) platforms and single cores were used for proteomic profiling using the PhenoCycler fusion (PCF) platform (Akoya Biosciences, US). The GeoMx WTA platform and two ROIs per TMA from the same patient tumor were used for proteomic profiling using the PCF platform. These samples were collected and used under the authorization of the Yale Human Investigation Committee (protocol 9505008219), with assurances filed with and approved by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The Yale cohort TMA is designated as YTMA-471. The second cohort, used as a validation cohort, was obtained from the UQ. TMAs were constructed from resected NSCLC tissue specimens from patients who subsequently recurred and were treated with PD-1-based immunotherapies in the advanced or metastatic setting. This cohort contained 42 tissue samples collected between 2009 and 2018 (Fig. 1a) and is designated as UQTMA-4301. The study received ethical approval from the Queensland University of Technology Human Research Ethics Committee (2000000494) and was ratified by the UQ. The third cohort, serving as a second validation dataset, was obtained from Sotiria General Hospital, Medical School, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Greece. It comprised 79 patients who received PD-1-based therapy between 2019 and 2023 and was used to validate the generalizability of the findings from the Yale training cohort. The study was conducted under HIC protocol 16760/23-06-2023. The Greek cohort TMAs are YTMA-642 + YTMA-709. Written informed consent or waiver of consent was obtained from all participants before enrollment. A schematic of the workflow is shown in Fig. 1b. Clinical data are provided in Supplementary Data 1 and 2.

As stated above, the Yale cohort served as a training set, while the UQ cohort and the University of Athens (Greek cohort) served as validation sets. The training cohort facilitated the development of biomarkers associated with immunotherapy outcomes in machine learning models, while the validation cohorts provided independent data to assess the generalizability of these models. Treatment response was classified according to Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors version 1.1 (Complete Response, Partial Response, Stable Disease and Progressive Disease), and PFS was recorded for all cohorts. To minimize biases from prior therapies, the study focused solely on patients receiving first-line immunotherapy. As a result, the Yale cohort was narrowed down to 41 patients. The clinical endpoint was set to 2-year PFS, consistent with prior real-world and clinical trial data supporting this timeframe as a clinically meaningful surrogate for durable benefit in advanced/metastatic NSCLC. Major immunotherapy trials that led to regulatory approval, such as KEYNOTE-189 and KEYNOTE-407, implemented a 2-year cap on treatment duration2,11. In real-world clinical practice, treatment duration beyond two years was common due to the absence of data defining optimal therapy length. However, recent retrospective evidence from over 1,000 patients showed no significant OS benefit beyond two years36. Furthermore, approximately 20% of patients in that study discontinued treatment at two years despite the absence of progression. Taken together with the toxicity and financial burdens of prolonged therapy, these findings support a shift toward 2-year treatment as a clinical standard. Therefore, adopting 2-year PFS as an endpoint enhances the real-world relevance and interpretability of our findings37. Exclusion criteria for each cohort are depicted in the CONSORT diagrams (Fig. 1a,b). A schematic of data acquisition and analysis workflow is shown in Fig. 1b. We began with data acquisition using the PCF platform and validated findings using the DSP-GeoMx platform. The final analysis focused on findings based on cell types identified through the PCF-derived proteomic data.

The CODEX staining method was used for Yale, UQ and Greek cohorts, using the Phenocycler Fusion platform. Staining and imaging were performed by the Akoya Biosciences Spatial Tissue Exploration Program (STEP) following the manufacturer's instructions38. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded TMA sections were mounted on SuperFrost charged slides, rehydrated and subjected to heat-induced epitope retrieval. A 26-antibody cocktail (190 µl per section) was incubated for 3 h at room temperature in a humidity chamber. The list of antibodies is provided in Supplementary Table 3. This was followed by several cycles of washing and fixation. Details on antibody barcoding, dilution and imaging cycles are provided in Supplementary Data 3. Imaging was performed using the PCF platform and registered qptiff files were exported for image analysis.

Images were imported into QuPath (version 0.4.2)39 and segmented using the Cellpose plugin (version 2.0)40 on the DAPI2 channel with the nuclear pretrained model (‘.cellExpansion = 4 µm' and ‘.cellConstrainScale = 1.5'). Segmentation quality was visually inspected, and TMA cores with poor quality, such as those that were fragmented, folded, necrotic, or exhibiting high nonspecific fluorescence, were excluded. An artificial neural network pixel classifier was trained on PanCK (pan-cytokeratin) signals to define a tumor/stroma mask, capturing PanCK+ pixels as tumor. Only tumor nests larger than 100 µm2 were annotated as ‘tumor'. Cell metrics, including universally unique identifier (UUID) codes, spatial coordinates, nuclear size and median cell expression per channel, were exported for analysis in Python. Cell classifications from subsequent unsupervised clustering were re-imported into QuPath and matched by their UUIDs for visual inspection and quality control. A detailed image analysis workflow is illustrated in Extended Data Fig. 1a. Raw fluorescence intensity data (16-bit) underwent arcsinh transformation to normalize and reduce skewness, followed by marker scaling across cells. CD45 was used to illustrate preprocessing effectiveness (Extended Data Fig. 1b).

Expression matrices and cell metadata were imported into Anndata for quality control, preprocessing, clustering and phenotyping41,42,43 in Python 3.10. Data were first subset into canonical lineage markers (CD45, CD3e, CD4, CD8, CD20, CD14, CD68, CD11b, CD11c, CD31, CD34, SMA, Vimentin, E-cadherin, PanCK, nuclear size). Each slide was preprocessed individually by arcsinh transform (cofactor 150), marker-wise scaling, and cell-wise normalization, following recommended CODEX workflows44. Preprocessed data were concatenated and integrated using Scanpy's Harmonypy (version 0.0.5)45 by slide, and adjusted principal components were used for clustering via Phenograph (version 1.5.7)46. Multiple Leiden resolutions (0.1–0.5) were tested across k = 15–30 and r = 0.2, with k = 15 empirically chosen to best resolve canonical cell types. Eighteen clusters were manually annotated to identify CD4, CD8, B cells, granulocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells (DCs), tumor cells, stromal cells, vessels and unidentified cells. Further classification in QuPath defined functional subsets, including CD4 TFH (PD-1+, ICOS+), Treg (FOXP3+), exhausted CD8 (PD-1+), cytotoxic CD8 (granzyme B+), M2 macrophage (CD163+), proliferating tumor (PanCK+Ki67+) and PD-L1 tumor (PD-L1+; Fig. 2a), using an object classifier trained on representative images. Labeled cells were then merged into 14 final cell types (Fig. 2b). For the analysis of PD-L1 expression in progressors and nonprogressors in tumor cells and macrophages, PanCK+ cells above the median were used to compute mean tumor PD-L1 per patient. Similarly, cells expressing CD68 and CD163 above the threshold were used to quantify macrophage PD-L1.

Cell proportions were calculated by normalizing the number of each cell type within a TMA core or tumor/stromal region to the total number of cells within that region, yielding cell percentages. Spatial interactions were analyzed using the ‘spatial_interaction' function in Scimap (https://github.com/labsyspharm/scimap) with the radius method (radius = 30 µm, k-nearest neighbor = 10) for all pairwise combinations. Group means were compared between PFS groups. Cellular neighborhoods were defined using the Neighborhood Identification Pipeline (https://github.com/nolanlab/NeighborhoodCoordination)9. For each cell, the types of its ten nearest neighbors were recorded as features, which were then clustered into ten groups using a k-nearest neighbor unsupervised algorithm. The selection of ten neighbors and ten clusters was guided by prior literature9,47. Each cell was assigned to a ‘neighborhood', based on the most frequent nearby cell types, and these clusters were manually annotated by their dominant phenotype. Differential enrichment of cell types across neighborhoods was assessed using an ordinary least squares linear model from the same pipeline9, measuring fold change significance based on binary PFS outcome.

For the Yale cohort, TMA slides were processed using the DSP-GeoMx manual slide preparation protocol (MAN-10150-01) as described in our prior study5. Briefly, four different ROI containing distinct tumor areas of the same tumors were used to enhance reproducibility. Antigen retrieval of the formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue was conducted for 20 min, followed by deparaffinization and rehydration. The slides were then exposed to proteinase K for 20 min, after which RNA probes were applied to the tissues for in situ hybridization. The following day, stringent washes were performed to remove off-target probes. To delineate areas within each ROI, morphology markers were used for each AOI—CD68 for macrophage, CD45 for leukocyte, PanCK for tumor compartments and SYTO 13 for nuclear staining. The slides were incubated, washed and loaded onto the DSP-GeoMx instrument. Scanning, AOI selection and probe collection were performed as per the user manual (MAN-10088-03). Each AOI representing a compartment, such as tumor region, macrophage region or leukocyte region from a patient tumor core was collected in a 96-well plate. Next, a GeoMx-next-generation sequencing (NGS) readout library was prepared according to the user manual (MAN-10117-01). Sequencing was performed by Yale Center for Genome Analysis, and the sequencing data were processed with the GeoMx-NGS Pipeline (MAN-10153-01), converting FASTQ files to digital count conversion (.dcc) files for read counts. Quality control was conducted on each ROI to ensure accurate analysis of the approximately 18,000 genes targeted using the WTA panel.

For the UQ cohort, pretreatment TMA slides were processed using the DSP-GeoMx CTA manual slide preparation protocol. This methodology was adapted from ref. 5, which profiles approximately 1,800 genes (Cancer Transcriptome Atlas Panel). After antigen retrieval and deparaffinization, proteinase K treatment was performed, followed by in situ hybridization using CTA RNA probes. The stringent washes were then performed to remove off-target probes. CD3, CD68 and PanCK morphology markers were used to identify tumor AOIs (PanCK+) and stromal (PanCK−) regions. The slides were loaded onto the DSP-GeoMx instrument, and scanning, AOI selection, and probe collection were conducted per the DSP-GeoMx user manual. Each AOI representing a compartment, tumor or stroma, was collected into a 96-well plate. A GeoMx-NGS readout library was prepared following the DSP-GeoMx user manual (MAN-10117-01). PCR reactions were pooled into two mixtures for the tumor and stromal compartments. Sequencing was performed by the Australian Genome Research Facility, and data were processed using the GeoMx-NGS Pipeline (MAN-10153-01) to convert FASTQ files to digital counts conversion (.dcc) files for read counts. Quality control was performed according to preset thresholds to ensure accurate and high-quality profiling.

We conducted univariable analysis to assess the association between cell-type fractions and treatment outcomes for 14 cell types in both tumor and stromal compartments. Cell fractions were derived using the PCF platform. HRs and two-sided log-rank test P values were calculated using Cox proportional hazards models to evaluate the impact of each cell type on 2-year PFS. BH correction was applied for multiple hypothesis testing.

We developed cell-type signatures for both tumor and stromal compartments using a robust signature training framework based on a prior study5. The input consists of matrices \({M}_{{ij}}^{\,\mathrm{tumor}}\) and \({M}_{{ij}}^{\,\mathrm{stroma}}\) containing cell fractions for each patient i and cell-type j in tumor and stroma compartments, respectively, where there are 14 distinct cell types across tumor and stromal compartments. For each patient, we have PFS data (time in months and an event indicator: 1 = progression/death and 0 = alive/progression free). For each compartment, we generated n splits of the training data into tenfolds, generating M LASSO-penalized Cox models. For each split, tenfold cross-validation was used to select penalty parameter λ, and a LASSO model was trained using the optimal penalty for that split by pooling all tenfolds. We set lower.limits = 0 in R glmnet (version 4.1-9) for resistance models (positive nonzero coefficients) and upper.limits = 0 for response models (negative nonzero coefficients). This yielded M coefficient sets \({\beta }_{m,j}\), where \({\beta }_{m,j}\) is the coefficient of cell type j in model m. Cell types with a nonzero coefficient in at least t of the models were retained. A final unpenalized Cox model was fit using these selected cell types to obtain coefficients \({\beta }_{j}^{\mathrm{final}}\). The final signature score for patient i was calculated as \({S}_{i}^{\mathrm{final}}={\Sigma }_{j}{\beta }_{j}^{\mathrm{final}}{M}_{{ij}}\). Hence, the final signature is a Cox regression model trained on LASSO-selected cell types. This pipeline was applied to both tumor and stromal compartments to derive resistance and response signatures, where we set M = 50 for stroma and M = 100 for tumor, since we observed that these values were sufficient to identify a stable set of nonzero predictors for each compartment, and the threshold t was set to the maximum value such that each signature contained at least three cell types.

We computed the final signature scores for resistance and response models in both tumor and stromal compartments. Each patient received a final score, indicating their predicted risk of progression based on the specific compartment and cell-type signature. We assessed out-of-sample accuracy by evaluating HR and survival probabilities in the validation cohorts. In resistance models, positive coefficients predicted increased risk \(\mathrm{HR} > 1.0\); in response models, negative coefficients predicted reduced risk \(\mathrm{HR} < 1.0\). Statistical significance of HRs was assessed using Cox proportional hazards models. P values were calculated using a two-tailed log-rank test by binarizing the scores at the median and refitting Cox models.

To validate the proteomically identified cell types, we analyzed gene expression data generated from the stromal compartment using the DSP software (version 0.4). The quantile-normalized matrix was deconvolved with CIBERSORTx, using the leukocyte gene signature matrix (LM22), which defines reference gene expression profiles for 22 immune cell types. This enabled estimation of stromal cell fractions for each patient. The deconvolution model solved for the cell fractions \({F}_{{ji}}\) using: \(B\times {F}_{i}\approx {M}_{i}^{\mathrm{DSPGeoMx}}\), where B is the LM22 signature matrix, \({F}_{{ji}}\) is the fraction of cells belonging to cell type j in patient i, and \({M}_{i}^{\mathrm{DSPGeoMx}}\) is the stromal compartment matrix for patient i. We compared cell fraction distributions between patients with different PFS outcomes (alive versus dead) using two-sided t tests. This analysis identified stromal cell types enriched in either group. By cross-validating our compartment-specific signatures against DSP-derived CIBERSORTx results, we confirmed the consistency and predictive relevance of the spatial proteomic cell-type features.

We developed compartment-specific gene signatures based on the proteomics-derived cell-type signatures using a robust signature training framework based on the approach developed in a prior study5. Gene expression reference profiles were obtained from CIBERSORTx, and a public lung cancer scRNA-seq dataset (LuCA) focusing on CD4 T cells, macrophages, granulocytes and malignant cells. Reference gene lists for both models are provided in Supplementary Data 4. Using the mastR (version 1.8.0) R package48, 892,296 cells from LuCA were aggregated into 2,215 pseudobulk samples (>50 cells each), spanning 14 cell types. Marker genes were identified using differential expression and a ranked product permutation test with default parameters. We constructed matrices \({M}_{{ij}}^{\,\mathrm{tumor}}\) and \({M}_{{ij}}^{\,\mathrm{stroma}}\) containing gene expression counts for each patient i and gene j in tumor and stroma compartments, respectively, where genes were restricted to those associated with cell types occurring in the associated proteomics cell-type signatures. Each patient had PFS data (time in months and event indicator—1 = progression/death, 0 = progression free). For each compartment (tumor and stroma) and each cell-type gene set, we generated 50 data splits, each split 80/20 for training/testing. In each training split, differentially expressed genes between progression-free and nonprogression-free patients (P < 0.05, negative binomial exact test) were identified. For each split, 100 LASSO Cox regression models were optimized with different random seeds, by first using tenfold cross-validation on the current training split to select the penalty λ, and then fitting a final LASSO Cox regression model with the best value of λ using the current training set. Any gene appearing in at least one of these models was retained; a signature for the current data split was then trained by fitting an unpenalized Cox regression model on the current training split restricted to the selected genes, and the HR of the signature was estimated on the current test set. To constrain coefficient directions, we set lower.limits = 0 for resistance models (positive nonzero coefficients) and upper.limits = 0 for response models (negative nonzero coefficients). Each data split m thus produced a coefficient set \({\beta }_{m,j}\) and an associated HR estimate. Genes with nonzero coefficients in at least 0.05 of the models having \(\mathrm{HR} > 1.5\) (resistance) or \(\mathrm{HR} < 0.7\) (response) were selected for inclusion in the final signatures. These thresholds were set so that the number of genes included was at most ten. Final Cox regression models were then refit without the penalty using the entire discovery cohort (not split into train/test), and only the selected genes, to derive the final signature coefficients, \({\beta }_{j}^{\mathrm{final}}\). The final signature score for patient i was calculated as \({S}_{i}^{\mathrm{final}}={\Sigma }_{j}{\beta }_{j}^{\mathrm{final}}{M}_{{ij}}\). For training the resistance gene model, we used genes from cell types in the resistance cell-type signature models (for example, proliferating tumor, granulocytes and vessels), and for training the response gene model, we used genes from the cell types in the response cell-type signature models (for example, M1 macrophages, M2 macrophages and CD4 T cells). This approach was applied uniformly across tumor and stromal compartments to define gene-level resistance and response signatures derived from cell-type-level proteomic signatures.

To validate the gene signatures, we calculated gene expression matrices for tumor and stromal compartments in both the UQ cohort and the Greek cohort. Sequencing and data processing for the UQ cohort were performed by the UQ research team. For the Greek cohort, sequencing and data preprocessing were conducted by the Yale team. Each matrix contained expression counts per patient and gene in the respective compartments. We computed final resistance and response signature scores for both tumor and stromal compartments, with each score indicating the predicted risk of progression. Out-of-sample performance was evaluated using HRs of the signature scores evaluated in the validation cohorts. Genes with positive coefficients in the resistance signature predicted increased risk \(\mathrm{HR} > 1.0\), while genes with negative coefficients in the response signature predicted reduced risk \(\mathrm{HR} < 1.0\). Statistical significance was assessed using Cox proportional hazards models, with two-sided log-rank test P values derived from each model to test the out-of-sample accuracy of our signatures. We also conducted a multivariable analysis adjusting for clinical factors when available (age, sex, disease stage, prior treatment, type of immunotherapy, line of immunotherapy, histology and smoking status). Cox multivariable regression and Chi-square tests (Supplementary Tables 4–7) were used to evaluate associations between gene signatures and outcomes. This validation step is designed to test the generalizability of the spatially defined compartment-specific gene signatures.

No statistical method was used to predetermine sample size. One ROI was excluded from transcriptomic analysis due to pre-identified operator inconsistencies, as documented in Supplementary Fig. 6. The remaining data were included in all analyses. Samples were not prospectively randomized. The investigators were not blinded to allocation during experiments and outcome assessment.

(a) The image workflow begins with exporting multiplex imaging data to QuPath, where cell segmentation is performed using the CellPose plugin. Resulting single-cell expression data is then exported as a .csv file and converted into an Anndata format. Selected markers are subsetted, and an arcsinh transformation (cofactor = 150) is applied independently to each dataset. Both row-wise (cells) and column-wise (markers) scaling are then conducted to standardize the data matrix (markers on the x-axis, cells on the y-axis). Multiple Anndata objects are concatenated across samples, and batch correction and image alignment are performed using Harmony after principal component analysis (PCA) via Scanpy. A nearest-neighbor graph is then constructed, and clustering is conducted using the sc.external.tl.phenograph function, tuning parameters such as the number of neighbors (K) and Leiden resolution (r), resulting in distinct cellular phenotypes. Cell type annotations are appended as metadata columns in the Anndata object. For specific populations such as CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, and macrophages, sub-clustering and classification are further refined within QuPath. Final annotations are enriched using forward-fill (‘ffill') methods to ensure completeness of subtype labels. (b) Raw fluorescence intensities (8-bit scale) are normalized using an arcsinh transformation to reduce skewness and handle the broad dynamic range. Expression values are subsequently scaled across both markers and cells. As shown using CD45 as an example, this preprocessing step prepares data for downstream analysis and comparison.

All signatures were trained using the Yale Cohort as our training cohort. To ensure robust model development, we generated M cross-validation splits and used these to train M models (1), each utilizing a LASSO Cox regression framework to predict 5-year progression-free survival (PFS). We set M = 50 for stroma and M = 100 for tumor, since we observed that these values were sufficient to identify a stable set of non-zero predictors for each compartment. Subsequently, we refit each signature using cell types with a non-zero coefficient in at least t of the models (2), where t was set to the maximum value such that each cell-type signature contained at least 3 cell types. We tested the final signatures on 100% of the training cohort to predict 2-year PFS (3). The validated model was then tested using the UQ validation cohort (4), thereby assessing its generalizability and predictive performance. The figure was created with BioRender.com.

Differential cell type enrichment within each neighborhood is shown.

(a) PD-L1 expression on tumor cells in the UQ cohort, comparing progressors and non-progressors. (b) PD-L1 expression on macrophages in the UQ cohort. (c) PD-L1 expression on tumor cells in the combined Yale + UQ cohorts. (d) PD-L1 expression on macrophages in the combined Yale + UQ cohorts. One-tailed t-tests were employed in cases where the direction of the effect was hypothesized a priori. The correlation between PD-L1 expression and (e) M1 macrophages, (f) M2 macrophages, (g) CD14+ myeloid cells and (h) panCK+ tumor cells within the TIME, are shown, assessed using Spearman's rank correlation method.

All signatures were trained using the Yale cohort as our training cohort. We generated 50 splits of the cohort into training (80%) and validation (20%) subsets (1). To ensure robust model development, we generated intermediate signatures to predict 5-year progression-free survival (PFS) on each of these data splits: in each training split, (2) differentially expressed genes between progression-free and non-progression-free patients were identified, 100 LASSO Cox regression models were optimized with different random seeds, by first using 10-fold cross-validation on the current training split to select the penalty and then fitting a final LASSO Cox regression model with the best value of using the current training set, generating 50 intermediate signatures (3). The final signatures were then generated by selecting genes occurring in at least 0.05 of the models having HR > 1.5 (resistance) or HR < 0.7 (response) in their respective validation sets (4) and refitting the model using unpenalized Cox regression on the whole training set. Subsequently, we tested the consolidated model on 100% of the training cohort to predict 2-year PFS (5). The validated model was then tested using the UQ and Greek validation cohorts (6), thereby assessing its generalizability and predictive performance. The figure was created with BioRender.com.

(a) The volcano plot displays the differentially expressed genes derived from one of the 50 intermediate data splits. Each point represents a gene, with the x-axis indicating the log2 fold change and the y-axis showing the −log10 adjusted p-value. Genes within the final resistance signature are shown. Genes that are significantly differentially expressed are in red. The horizontal dashed line represents the significance threshold (adjusted p-value < 0.1), and the vertical dashed lines indicate the log2 fold change cutoffs. (b) The GO enrichment plot illustrates the functional categories significantly enriched among the differentially expressed genes. The y-axis represents the GO terms, and the x-axis shows the fold enrichment for each term. Enriched GO terms are biological processes. The size of the dots corresponds to the number of genes associated with each GO term, and the color gradient represents the significance level. These analyses highlight key pathways and processes potentially involved in the biological mechanisms underlying the observed gene expression changes, providing insights into the functional implications of the genes identified in the final resistance signature.

The performance of the resistant gene signature in the Yale cohort was evaluated for predicting (a) PFS-5 years, (b) OS-5 years and (c) OS-2 years in the tumor compartment, with KM survival curves illustrating its prognostic significance. Similarly, the response gene signature was tested in the stroma compartment of the Yale cohort for predicting (d) PFS-5 years, (e) OS-5 years and (f) OS-2 years, showing its predictive value for long-term and short-term survival outcomes. Two-tailed and one-tailed log-rank tests are used on the discovery and validation cohorts, respectively, where the direction of the effect in the latter is chosen to match the direction of the effect in the former. Two-tailed log-rank tests are used.

Ion solvating membranes based on polybenzimidazole (PBI) are alternatives to diaphragms in alkaline water electrolysers but can typically only operate with electrolyte concentrations of 15–30 wt% KOH. Sulfonation of the membrane broadens the operational range to 0.1 wt%–30 wt%; however, the swelling of sulfonated para-PBI means that crosslinkers are needed, complicating membrane fabrication and decreasing alkaline stability. Here we report a non-crosslinked PBI membrane with a 50% degree of sulfonation that shows a high room temperature conductivity in 1 M KOH of 135 mS cm−1. We did not observe degradation in a 6-month alkaline stability test at 80 °C. Using this membrane in an anion-exchange membrane water electrolyser, we report a current density of 4.8 A cm−2 at 2 V (3 M KOH at 80 °C; Pt and NiFe electrode catalysts); the H2 crossover to the O2 side remained <2%. Using non-platinum group metal electrodes and a polyphenylene sulfide-reinforced membrane, a cell operated for >1,000 h without failure.

Industrial alkaline water electrolysers (AWE) use a concentrated KOH solution (4–7 M ~ 20–30 wt%) as electrolyte. The electrodes are separated by porous diaphragms such as Zirfon to prevent the mixing of hydrogen (H2) and oxygen (O2)1. Whereas cost-effective non-platinum group metal (PGM) materials such as nickel-based electrodes can be used as catalysts2,3, AWE has a narrow operational window. At too low currents, the amount of H2 crossed over to O2 exceeds the explosion limit4. At high currents, high ohmic resistance requires high voltages, accelerating corrosion of components5,6. Additionally, Zirfon's low bubble point of 2 bar prevents operation at differential pressures, complicating efforts to reduce H2 compression costs7,8.

Proton exchange membrane water electrolysis uses dense membranes and typically reaches current densities of 1–2 A cm−2, and even 6 A cm−2 were reported9. However, the acidic pH necessitates the use of expensive titanium-based bipolar plates10 and platinum and iridium catalysts, which are scarce metals11. Furthermore, Nafion 212 costs around US$225 m−2 (ref. 12), and governments seek to ban fluorinated materials because their toxicity and longevity raise environmental concerns13,14.

Anion exchange membrane water electrolysis (AEMWE) uses membranes with cationic moieties and combines the advantages of AWE (cheap catalysts) and proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (differential pressure)15. However, most AEMs have a conductivity below 80 mS cm−1 (for example, FAA3: 45 mS cm−1 in 1 M KOH)16,17,18, and their quaternary ammonium groups degrade by nucleophilic substitution and Hoffman elimination19, limiting operation to diluted alkaline solutions, which improves stability but increases solubility of H2 and thus permeation20.

Acid-doped polybenzimidazole (PBI) is used in PEM fuel cells21,22 and flow batteries23,24,25, and recently, KOH-doped PBI membranes, so-called ion-solvating membranes (ISM), have been investigated for use in AWE4. KOH deprotonates the imidazole groups, and the increased hydrophilicity promotes absorption of KOH solution between the polymer chains. Depending on the doping process, conductivities of 100–200 mS cm−1 were achieved in 25 wt% KOH solution26,27,28, and an AWE with a reinforced gel meta-PBI membrane exhibited 1.7 A cm−2 at 1.8 V, 80 °C (ref. 27). However, when meta-PBI, the most well-investigated ISM, is immersed in solutions containing ≤1 M KOH, the range relevant for AEMWE, the conductivity decreases strongly. Introduction of N-alkylsulfonic acid side chains to PBI increases water and KOH absorption29, but this type of functionalization consumes imidazole NH groups, and without negative charge, the imidazole C2 position is susceptible to OH− attack30. Recently, we reported the use of sulfonated para-PBI (MS-PBI), which has 50% more ionic groups per repeat unit and thus reaches very high conductivities, even in 1 M KOH, but needs to be crosslinked to avoid dissolution31. Although this material showed excellent alkaline stability over 6 months in 1 M KOH at 80 °C, the crosslinked neutral imidazole units might act as breaking point. Furthermore, chemical crosslinking is difficult to scale up, because casting solutions could gel during membrane fabrication.

Previously, a PBI copolymer (SOPBI, a PBI that contains sulfonated and non-sulfonated diphenyl ether moieties; Fig. 1) was reported for use in PEM Fuel Cells32. In that work, the carbon atoms in the ortho positions relative to the ether groups were selectively sulfonated, and the degree of sulfonation (DOS), and thus the membrane properties, were tuned by copolymerization. Whereas phenyl ethers substituted with quaternary ammonium groups are avoided in AEM, sulfonated poly(ether ether ketone) was stable over 41 days test in 5 M NaOH at 60 °C (ref. 33). In SOPBI, the negatively charged imidazolide groups should further stabilize the ether groups.

In this work, SOPBI properties are optimized by copolymerization of sulfonated and non-sulfonated monomers. Sulfonated units with locally high electrolyte uptake promote conductivity, whereas less sulfonated regions provide stability. Therefore, no crosslinking is needed. The absence of quaternary ammonium and neutral imidazole groups promises high alkaline stability, and in 1 M KOH solution, SOPBI demonstrated a conductivity above that of over 30 membranes that were recently reported in the literature (Supplementary Tables 4 and 5).

4,4′-oxybisbenzoic acid (OBA) was sulfonated to sodium 6,6′-oxybis(3-carboxybenzenesulfonate) (SODBA), as proven by 1H-NMR (Supplementary Fig. 1). Copolymerization of SODBA with diaminobenzidine (DAB) and OBA gave a series of partially sulfonated polymers (Fig. 1). As also observed by others34, polymerizations targeting DOS > 70% give a gelled reaction mixture within 3 h of reaction.

Presumably, the bulkiness of SODBA's sulfonic acid groups reduces the chain mobility and by this, the degree of polymerization35. Simultaneously, Friedel–Crafts-type crosslinking reactions may gain importance. 1H-NMR analysis (Supplementary Fig. 2) confirmed that polymers with DOS of 50%, 60% and 70% were successfully synthesized (50SOPBI, 60SOPBI and 70SOPBI, respectively). In the potassium form, these polymers exhibited excellent solubility in DMSO and partial solubility in DMAc. All polymers formed strong, flexible membranes, indicating that high molecular weights were obtained (>92 kg mol−1; Supplementary Table 2).

Across all KOH concentrations, 50SOPBI exhibits the lowest thickness swelling range of 7.5–63.2%. 60SOPBI swells 24.5–86.9%, and 70SOPBI 19.6–101.6% (Fig. 2a–c). Because in-plane swelling is much lower, electrolyte uptake (Supplementary Fig. 4) follows the same trend as the thickness swelling. Anisotropic swelling of PBI is known in both acidic and alkaline media and related to the preferred orientation of polymer chains, probably forming a lamellar-like structure23,36. It was reported that a freeze-dried gel PBI possesses nanofibrils, which aggregate into 28-nm-thick nano-sheets, which are oriented parallel to the plane37. Whereas non-crosslinked MS-PBI swells excessively and eventually dissolves31, SOPBI copolymers remain dimensionally stable, indicating that the strategy to have regions of high and low ion density on the polymer chain works well. Whereas 50SOPBI swells only 63% in thickness in 20 wt% KOH solution, state-of-the-art meta-PBI swells 175% (ref. 38). Presumably, the non-sulfonated OBA units are more hydrophobic than the meta-phenyl linked units and show a higher degree of π-stacking.

All data points are average values over three samples. Error bars represent the standard deviation but are often smaller than the symbol that represents the data point.

Source data

The properties of ISM depend on the amount and concentration of the absorbed electrolyte. Figure 2d–f show that the internal KOH concentration increases with the concentration of the external solution and is always higher. For 0.11% to 20 wt% KOH solutions, 50SOPBI shows an internal concentration range from 11.9 to 24.3 wt% and from 15.3% to 30.4 wt% for 60SOPBI. 70SOPBI shows lower values of 11.7% to 23.6% KOH. The reason is a strongly increased water absorption (Fig. 2f and Supplementary Fig. 4b), which results in 338% water uptake in 10 wt% KOH and excessive total uptake (Supplementary Fig. 4a). Whereas a high hydration number may improve chemical stability and conductivity of membranes39, excessive water uptake results in large swelling or even dissolution (Fig. 2c) and promotes creep under compressive forces.

As shown in Fig. 3a, the through-plane conductivity at room temperature (RT) increases with the concentration of the external KOH solution and then decreases again, similarly to the uptake data presented in Supplementary Fig. 4. Unlike meta-PBI and 5MS-PBI31, which have the highest conductivity in 25 wt% and 20 wt% KOH solution, respectively, SOPBI membranes reach their highest conductivity in 10–15 wt% KOH solution. At higher concentrations, the membranes lose flexibility and the conductivity decreases.

Source data

AEMWE uses electrolyte concentrations of 0.2–1 M KOH4 to mitigate ionomer oxidation at the anode and loss of interfacial contact40. The conductivity of 50SOPBI and 60SOPBI is 21 mS cm−1 and 25 mS cm−1 in 0.2 M KOH and 49 mS cm−1 and 56 mS cm−1 in 1 M KOH, respectively. For comparison, commercial FAA3-50 has a conductivity of 46 mS cm−1 in 1 M KOH17. 70SOPBI shows a conductivity of 129 mS cm−1 in 1 M KOH, which correlates with its strong swelling and water uptake (polymer weight fraction below 31%, 21% swelling in length and 61% in thickness, Fig. 2c; water uptake of 338%, Supplementary Fig. 4b) and raises concerns about its dimensional stability at elevated temperatures. Because the targeted operation temperature for ion solvating membrane water electrolysis (ISMWE) is 80 °C, the stability of all membranes was tested in 1 M KOH at 80 °C for 48 h. 70SOPBI almost completely dissolved, whereas 60SOPBI swelled 150% in thickness and 30% in length. Noticeably, 50SOPBI remained stable, with only a slight yellowish discoloration of the solution. Therefore, 50SOPBI appears to be the most promising membrane.

For use in flow batteries, meta-PBI membranes showed improved conductivity in 3 M H2SO4 when they were pre-swollen at a higher concentration23. Similarly, pre-swelling in 4 M KOH (19 wt% KOH) increased the conductivity in 2 M H2SO4 from 5 mS cm−1 to 56 mS cm−1 (ref. 41). Interactions between polymer chains are broken, and low molecular weight fractions leach out, resulting in higher solution uptake. Thus, to improve the conductivity of 50SOPBI, it was activated for 48 h at 80 °C in 15 wt% KOH (50SOPBI-act), where conductivity and volumetric swelling (Fig. 2a) are the highest. Additionally, pre-swelling may increase the degree of deprotonation. For gel PBI, X-ray diffraction data and molecular modelling suggested that only 50% of imidazole units are deprotonated in 25 wt% KOH at RT27. Supplementary Fig. 6d,e shows that 48-h activation increases the KOH weight fraction and strongly increases total uptake.

Activation increased the room temperature conductivity in 15 wt% KOH to 182 mS cm−1 (Fig. 3b). Figure 3c displays the temperature effect on the conductivity of 50SOPBI-act in 0.2 and 1 M KOH solution. The inflection point at 40 °C may indicate a change in the degree of deprotonation. This is supported by an increased membrane thickness (Supplementary Fig. 6a–c). In 1 M KOH, volume swelling increases from 94.2% at RT to 114% and 149% at 60 and 80 °C. In 2 M KOH, the volume swelling increases from 94% at RT to 114% and 140% at 60 and 80 °C. In 3 M KOH, the volume swelling is less than in 1 and 2 M KOH, from 88.4% at RT to 97.3% and 100% at 60 and 80 °C, respectively. Furthermore, the total uptake levels off above 1 M KOH (Supplementary Fig. 6d), implying that the activation set a limit to the swelling. In 0.2 M KOH and 1 M KOH, 50SOPBI-act exhibits conductivities of 83 mS cm−1 and 135 mS cm−1 at RT and 217 mS cm−1 and 358 mS cm−1 at 80 °C.

Because ISM absorbs electrolyte, the measured conductivity values are the sum of K+ and OH− conductivity (Supplementary Fig. 3a). However, OER consumes OH−, and movement of K+ ions results in a net transport of KOH from anode to cathode. Supplementary Fig. 3b shows that the transport number of K+ ions decreases as the electrolyte concentration increases. During electrolyser operation, the KOH concentration at the cathode increases, whereas that at the anode decreases. This concentration difference creates an osmotic pressure difference, and water diffuses towards the cathode. In electrolysis systems, this is countered by degassing and mixing anolyte and catholyte. In 1 M KOH at 80 °C, the conductivity of K+ and OH− ions is 151 and 207 mS cm−1 (Fig. 3d). In 2 M KOH, it is 158 and 294 mS cm−1, and in 3 M KOH, it is 122 and 411 mS cm−1, respectively. Figure 3e summarizes the effect of anode concentration on the ion transport numbers. In general, the OH− transport number decreases when the anode concentration decreases. This indicates that the membrane's properties gradually change from anode to cathode and that the side that is in contact with the lower concentrated alkaline solution determines the overall selectivity.

As supported by Fig. 3f, we are not aware of AEMs that have higher conductivity than 50SOPBI-act. In 15 wt% KOH, a conductivity of 592 mS cm−1 at 80 °C was measured (Supplementary Fig. 5a). For comparison, the measured conductivity of hydroxide exchanged 80-μm-thick Piperion in water at 80 °C is 151 mS cm−1, and an AEMWE performance of 13.39 A cm−2 at 2 V was achieved with an optimized AEM showing a conductivity of 208 mS cm−1 in DI water at 80 °C (ref. 42). For 50SOPBI-act, the Arrhenius plot (Supplementary Fig. 5b) reveals an activation energy in 0.2 M KOH of 14.57 kJ mol−1, 1.6 times higher than that of the solution (9.08 kJ mol−1) (ref. 43). In 1 M KOH, the membranes show an activation energy of 18.76 kJ mol−1, almost twice higher than that of the solution (9.45 kJ mol−1); in 2 M KOH, the activation energy is 17.58 kJ mol−1 (1.8 times higher than for 2 M KOH solution). In 3 M KOH, the membranes show an activation energy of 19.32 kJ mol−1 (1.9 times higher than for 3 M KOH solution)43. Physically, a higher activation energy indicates that ion transport by vehicle mechanism contributes more than transport by structural diffusion, for example, because of a reduced water concentration or because narrow passages between polymer chains interrupt the hydrogen-bonded network needed for the Grotthus mechanism.

X-ray diffraction analysis of the peak at 5–10° shows that the inter-chain distances increase with the KOH concentration and correlate with the volume swelling (further discussion in Supplementary Information)23,44.

The ex situ alkaline stability of 50SOPBI-act was tested by immersing samples in 0.2, 1 and 2 M KOH solutions at 80 °C and periodically measuring conductivity at RT (Fig. 4a). In 0.2 M KOH, 50SOPBI-act showed no substantial dimensional changes and a stable conductivity of 86 ± 6 mS cm−1 for over 200 days. In 1 M KOH, conductivity increased linearly from 135.4 to around 170 mS cm−1 after 200 days (0.17 mS cm−1 d−1). In 2 M KOH, a steeper increase rate of 0.47 mS cm−1 d−1 was observed from 180 to 270 mS cm−1 for 200 days. Increased membrane thickness indicates that the conductivity increased due to increased absorption of KOH solution. Most importantly, all membranes remained visibly unchanged in 0.2, 1 and 2 M KOH solutions at 80 °C, and no discoloration of the KOH solutions was observed, implying that the polymer remained stable.

A potential attack of OH− ions would occur at the ether groups and at the imidazole C2 position of non-deprotonated benzimidazole units30. The latter reaction would open the ring and form amides and carboxylic acids. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy did not show any new band in the carbonyl region (1,600–1,750 cm−1; Fig. 4b). This further supports that hydrolysis of imidazole rings is not observed as depicted in Fig. 1.

Gel permeation chromatography analysis showed that ageing did not reduce the weight-average molecular weight (Mw) of 50SOPBI (Fig. 4c and Supplementary Fig. 8). Whereas pristine 50SOPBI had a Mw of 92 kg mol−1, 50SOPBI-act immersed in 0.2 M and 1 M KOH had Mw of 111 and 99 kg mol−1, respectively, with a similar polydispersity index (PDI). PDI and Mw of pristine *50SOPBI (132 kg mol−1) were similar to those of *50SOPBI-act aged in 2 M KOH (120 kg mol−1). Because OH− attack on imidazole or phenyl ether would result in chain scission and decreased Mw, it can be deducted that 50SOPBI did not experience chain scission.

Negatively charged imidazolide groups should increase the electron density on the ether carbon atoms and by this stabilize the aromatic ether against alkaline hydrolysis. DFT calculations support that an increased activation barrier reduces the risk of nucleophilic attack by OH−. The analysis of the deformation in molecular electrostatic potential indicates a charge transfer from the benzimidazolide part to the ether part, and the results of bond-order analysis explain the transition-state destabilization in the model system containing benzimidazolide in terms of possible resonance structures. A detailed discussion is provided in the Supplementary Information.

Eighty-μm-thick Piperion and 97-μm-thick 50SOPBI-act were tested in an electrolyser with 0.2, 1, 2 and 3 M KOH feed solutions at 60 and 80 °C. To achieve high performance, the cathode contained Pt/C on carbon paper, and the anode NiFe on Ni felt (cell type 1). 50SOPBI-act showed much higher performance than Piperion (Fig. 5a,b). At 80 °C and 2 V, 50SOPBI-act reached 3.8 A cm−2 and 4.8 A cm−2 in 2 M and 3 M KOH, respectively, whereas Piperion reached only 3.5 A cm−2 and 3.8 A cm−2, respectively. Piperion's similar performance in 2 and 3 M KOH is expected because the conductivity of AEMs typically levels off at higher KOH concentrations17. The performance of the 50SOPBI-act membrane is compared with literature data in Supplementary Table 1.

a–f, Current–voltage (iV) curves measured at 60 °C are shown for cells with 80-μm Piperion (curves for 1 M and 2 M overlap) (a), 97-μm 50SOPBI-act (b), Nafion 212 (curves for Nafion overlap) (c), 10-μm (dry state) and 40-μm (dry state) mPBI and 500-μm Zirfon; and at 80 °C for 80-μm Piperion (d), 97-μm 50SOPBI-act (e), Nafion 212 (f), 10-μm (dry state) and 40-μm (dry state) mPBI and 500-μm Zirfon.

Source data

50SOPBI-act was also compared with the cation exchange membrane Nafion 212, a 10- and a 40-μm-thick commercial meta-PBI (mPBI) membrane activated at 80 °C (resulting in 13- and 58-μm thickness in 2 M KOH and 16- and 70-μm thickness in 3 M KOH) and 500-μm Zirfon (Fig. 5c,f). In ≥ 2 M KOH, at 60 and 80 °C, all membranes showed lower performance than 97-μm-thick 50SOPBI-act. Nafion 212 gave the lowest performance because it has high selectivity for the less conductive K+ ions45,46, which are not involved in the faradaic reactions at the electrodes. This increases ohmic resistance and locally depletes the concentration of OH− ions close to the surface of the OER catalyst. At 2 V, Nafion only reached 114 and 107 mA cm−2 at 60 °C in 2 and 3 M KOH, respectively, and 141 and 146 mA cm−2 at 80 °C. In case of the 13-μm-thick mPBI membrane, which is 7.5 times thinner than the 50SOPBI-act membrane, the performance was relatively high. At 80 °C in 2 and 3 M KOH, the current density reached 3.0 and 4.0 A cm−2. However, this is due to the membrane's very low thickness, which sacrifices its mechanical integrity and increases hydrogen crossover, which is impractical for real applications. For durability, mPBI would need to be reinforced, but the thinnest-available polyphenylene sulfide (PPS) mesh at the moment is >60 μm thick. However, 40-μm-thick mPBI (58 μm in 2 M KOH; 70 μm in 3 M KOH) showed a much lower performance than 50SOPBI-act. At 80 °C in 2 and 3 M KOH, the current density reached only 1.5 and 1.7 A cm−2. A commercial mPBI membrane, activated at 80 °C and immersed in 2 and 3 M KOH for 2.5 months at room temperature, disintegrated (Supplementary Fig. 10), whereas 50SOPBI-act membranes that were stored at 80 °C in 2 M KOH for 15 months and in 3 M KOH for 9 months showed excellent stability. 50SOPBI-act remained flexible and did not break even when stretched by tweezers. Mechanical properties are shown in Supplementary Table 6.

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis (Supplementary Figs. 9 and 11) reveals that 50SOPBI-act has lower high-frequency resistance (HFR) in 0.2, 1, 2 and 3 M KOH than Piperion at both 60 and 80 °C, because the thicker 50SOPBI-act has higher conductivity than Piperion.

With 0.2 and 1 M KOH, the cell with 50SOPBI-act exhibited lower performance than that with Piperion at both temperatures. This is unexpected because the conductivity of OH− exchanged Piperion in water at 80 °C (151 mS cm−1) is lower than that of 50SOPBI-act in 0.2 M KOH (216 mS cm−1) and 1 M KOH. The reason is that the cell with 50SOPBI-act has lower HFR but significantly higher polarization resistance than the cell using Piperion, similar to our previous observation for sulfonated para-PBI31. The exact reason will be investigated in future work but could be related to loss of active catalyst area by membrane entering the electrode pores, gas entrapment within the porous electrodes, catalyst poisoning, KOH depletion, oxidation of PBI in contact with anode catalyst or ion pair formation between cationic Piperion binder and anionic ISM.

Another electrolyser with 98-µm-thick 50SOPBI-act membrane and PGM-free electrodes based on Raney Ni-type catalysts was operated with 1 and 2 M KOH electrolytes at 60 and 80 °C. The polarization curves indicate currents above 1 A cm−2 at 2 V in all conditions (Fig. 6a,b). The performance improves with increased KOH concentration, probably due to reduced ohmic and charge transfer resistance, as evidenced by EIS measurement (Supplementary Fig. 12). Presumably, higher KOH concentration improves the catalyst activity, membrane conductivity and availability of hydroxide ions. With 0.2 M feed solution, higher total cell resistance led to low performance. Increasing the temperature has a similar effect as increasing the KOH concentration. As the temperature rises from 60 to 80 °C, performance improves from 1.04 to 1.30 A cm−2 at 2 V in 1 M KOH and from 1.52 to 1.91 A cm−2 in 2 M KOH, implying that 50SOPBI-act exhibited excellent performance with PGM-free electrodes. As shown in Supplementary Fig. 12, this can be attributed to reduced ohmic and charge transfer resistance.

To protect the membrane against compressive forces and sharp edges of nickel-based substrates, it was reinforced with a 60–70-µm-thick PPS textile (Supplementary Fig. 13). When a coin was pressed on the membranes, it only cut through the non-reinforced 50SOPBI membrane (Supplementary Fig. 13c). Although PPS fibres themselves are not ion conductive, the PPS-reinforced 50SOPBI-act membrane still had a high ionic conductivity of 399 mS cm−1 in 2 M KOH at 80 °C (Supplementary Fig. 14). An AEMWE cell with PPS-reinforced 50SOPBI-act showed slightly lower performance due to increased ohmic resistance (Supplementary Fig. 12c,d) but still achieved 1.3 and 1.70 A cm−2 at 2 V and 60 and 80 °C, respectively (Fig. 6c,d).

The durability of cells with PPS-reinforced 50SOPBI-act in 2 M KOH was evaluated at constant current density of 0.5 A cm−2 at 80 °C (Supplementary Fig. 15). Though the voltage increased, no failure was observed over 1,000 h. A repeat experiment demonstrated high reproducibility (Supplementary Fig. 15), and the cell was stopped after 400 h. When the cell was restarted again, voltage decreased by about 90 mV and the voltage loss rate decreased. Because the ex situ stability test showed that the membrane does not lose its conductivity (Fig. 4a), the voltage increase could stem from factors such as bubble management or loss of contact between membrane and electrode, which would not be directly a membrane issue.

Figure 7 and Supplementary Fig. 16 show that the H2 in oxygen level (HTO) decreases with increasing current density because the produced oxygen dilutes the crossed-over H2. With 1 M KOH, the HTO at 40 and 60 °C stays below the safe level of 2% when a cell with 50SOPBNI-act is operated at ≥100 mA cm−2, whereas a current density of 400 mA cm−2 is needed at 80 °C. Similarly, in 2 M KOH, the HTO at 40 and 60 °C is safe at current densities ≥50 mA cm−2 and safe at ≥200 mA cm−2 at 80 °C. An 80-μm-thick Piperion membrane showed a higher HTO than 50SOPBI (Fig. 7c). To reach HTO below 2% in 2 M KOH at 40, 60 and 80 °C, Piperion needs to be operated at current densities above 150, 270 and 410 mA cm−2, respectively. In summary, the 50SOPBI-act membrane can be safely operated over a wider current range than the Piperion membrane.

A PPS-reinforced 50SOPBI-act was tested in a 25-cm2 electrolysis cell (Supplementary Fig. 17) with 2 M KOH feed solution at 80 °C and a current density of 500 mA cm−2 for 500 h (Fig. 8). The use of separate electrolyte chambers resulted in a net movement of KOH from anode to cathode. This increased the charge transfer resistance and thus the voltage. To minimize this effect, the electrolyte volumes were manually rebalanced every 24 h. Every five days, the electrolytes were renewed. The voltage almost fully recovered (Fig. 8 and Supplementary Fig. 18), implying that the voltage increase is not due to membrane degradation, but rather due to the KOH-depleted anolyte. Supplementary Fig. 19 reveals a negative linear correlation between voltage and anolyte concentration. Further experiments with different anode and cathode concentrations confirmed that the cell performance is strongly influenced by the anode concentration (Supplementary Fig. 20). On the basis of the voltage values after each electrolyte replacement, a voltage increase rate of 35.6 μV h−1 was observed (Fig. 8). During the first 150 h, the HFR increased by 8.7%, most probably due to activation of the cell. After that, HFR decreased 10.9%, presumably due to increased electrolyte uptake or some morphological changes over time, which is supported by Fig. 4a.

The test was done at 80 °C, at a constant current density of 500 mA cm−2, and with 2 M KOH feed solution (50 ml min−1); cathode was Pt/C/carbon paper, NiFe electrodeposited on Ti mesh was used as anode.

Sulfonated OPBI, which was originally synthesized by others for use in PEM fuel cells, can perform excellently as an ISM in alkaline electrolytes. By optimized partial sulfonation of OPBI, it was possible to control the swelling in KOH solution without the need of crosslinking. This is advantageous, because crosslinking fully sulfonated PBI membranes with dibromoxylene not only complicates the membrane casting process, but the crosslinking points are neutral imidazole groups, which can be more easily attacked by OH− than deprotonated imidazolide units.

The optimized 50SOPBI membrane with a DOS of 50% showed appropriate swelling behaviour and high conductivity over the broad range of 1 to 25 wt% KOH, that is, the new ISM serves the whole broad operational range from the AEMWE range (0.2 to 1 M KOH) over the previously not-much-investigated range of 1–4 M KOH to the AWE range (4 to 7 M KOH).

After an activation step, the 50SOPBI-act membrane reached a conductivity at room temperature of 135 mS cm−1 in 1 M KOH. At 80 °C, the conductivity reached 358 mS cm−1.

In an ex situ stability test (1 M KOH, 80 °C, 200 days), no degradation was observed. The membranes remained flexible, showed practically no discoloration of the KOH solution, and the molecular weight range was not decreased. Rather, membranes continuously absorbed KOH solution, which increased the initial conductivity at room temperature from 135 mS cm−2 to 175 mS cm−2. But this might not be seen in the application, where the membranes are tightly clamped between the electrodes.

Whereas cell operation with nickel foam, carbon felt and Ni felt electrodes did not damage the membrane, operation with catalyst-coated porous nickel sheets gave mechanical damages at the edge of the active area. This problem was tackled by reinforcing the membrane with a PPS textile, which acted as a hard stop, so that the sharp, hard edge of the nickel sheet could not damage the membrane. This was also proven in an ex situ test in which a coin was pressed onto membranes. The coin cut a disc from the non-reinforced membrane, but the PPS-reinforced membrane could not be punched through.

Performance-wise, an AEMWE cell (type 1) with 3 M KOH feed solution and 50SOPBI-act showed higher performance than a cell with commercial Piperion membrane, 4.8 A cm−2 and 3.8 A cm−2 at 2 V, respectively. In a PGM-free cell (type 2, 2 M KOH solution, 80 °C), the current density at 2 V reached 1.91 A cm−2 for SOPBI-act and 1.70 A cm−2 for PPS-reinforced 50SOPBI-act. A test for H2 crossover in cell type 3 (nickel foam electrodes) revealed that the HTO remains below the safety limit of 2% at current densities ≥50 mA cm−2 at 60 °C and 2 M KOH and ≥200 mA cm−2 at 80 °C, which allows for a broad operational capacity. In another cell (type 4, active area of 25 cm2), a 500-h test showed a stable performance with a low voltage increase of 36 μV h−1. We expect that further optimization of the cell components and operating conditions (porous transport layer, catalysts, catalysts loading, cell compression, current, current profile, temperature, pressure, electrolyte concentration, electrolyte flow rate, dry or electrolyte-fed cathode) can improve durability.

A cost calculation shows that the material costs is just US$0.84 g−1 for 50SOPBI polymer, US$1.02 g−1 or US$59 m−2 for 50SOPBI dry membrane (Supplementary Tables 7–12).

In conclusion, 50SOPBI is a very attractive membrane, and the data confirm that ISM in LA ISMWE have the potential to outperform AEM in AEMWE applications in terms of cost, performance and durability, which opens a path to reduce the cost of green H2 production.

4,4'-oxybisbenzoic acid (OBA), 20% fuming sulfuric acid and lithium chloride were purchased from Sigma Aldrich. 3,3'-diaminobenzidine (DAB) was purchased from Longyan Tianhua Biological Technology Co. Polyphosphoric acid 115% (PPA), phosphoric acid 85 wt%, sodium chloride (NaCl), dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), potassium carbonate (K2CO3) and potassium hydroxide were obtained from Daejung Chemicals. All chemicals were used as received without further purification. PPS textile (polyphenylene sulfide industrial mesh, PPS0177/70PW: 35-µm fibre diameter, 60-µm thickness, specified working temperature up to 215 °C, 70% open area, mesh opening 177 µm) was provided by PVF Mesh & Screen Technology.

The synthesis follows a previously reported procedure34. Fifteen g (58.14 mmol) of 4,4′oxybisbenzoic acid was placed inside a 100-ml round-bottom flask equipped with argon inlet, and 45 ml 20% fuming sulfuric acid was added. Then the mixture was stirred at 110 °C for 2 h, resulting in a brown viscous solution. The solution was cooled down to RT and poured on 100 g of ground ice. When all ice was molten, 30 g NaCl were added, and a white precipitate formed. The precipitate was collected by filtration and purified by recrystallization in deionized (DI) water twice. The purified crystals were vacuum dried at 110 °C for 24 h. The yield was 20.4 g (43.93 mmol, 76%). 1H-NMR (Bruker UltraShield 400 Hz, (DMSO-d6, ppm): 8.41 (d, J = 2.1 Hz, 2H), 7.91 (dd, J = 8.4, 2.1 Hz, 2H), 6.84 (d, J = 8.7 Hz, 2H).

Exemplary, the synthesis of 50SOPBI is given. An amount of 4.634 g (21.630 mmol) DAB was placed into a 500-ml flask equipped with inert gas inlet and overhead stirrer, followed by addition of 213.5 g PPA. The mixture was heated to 110 °C for 2 h until all DAB dissolved. Then, 5 g (10.815 mmol) of SODBA was added. The mixture was rigorously stirred for 30 min followed by a slow stirring for 2 h at 140 °C. Then, 2.792 g (10.815 mmol) of OBA was added. After 30 min of rigorous stirring, the temperature was raised and kept at 160 °C for 16 h. The resulting viscous brown solution was diluted with 10-ml phosphoric acid and slowly poured into DI water, to form brown polymer fibres. The fibres were neutralized by 24-h immersion in 2 l of 0.5 M K2CO3 solution and were washed repeatedly with DI water to remove excess K2CO3. Next, the fibres were soaked in acetone for 2 h to exchange the water and afterwards dried in a vacuum oven at 100 °C for 24 h. For other copolymers, the ratios of OBA and SODBA were changed, and the amount of PPA was adjusted to reach 5.5% total monomer contents.

LiCl at 3.5 wt% with respect to the polymer weight was dissolved in DMSO, and 8 wt% SOPBI with respect to DMSO was added. The mixture was stirred at 70 °C for 24 h. Undissolved particles were removed by centrifugation. Afterwards, the polymer solution was sonicated to remove air bubbles and stored at 30 °C. To make membranes, the solution was casted on a glass plate using a doctor blade. The wet film was kept in an oven at 80 °C for 2 h at atmospheric pressure and for 24 h in vacuum. After cooling to RT, the dry membrane was delaminated from the glass plate and stored in a zip bag.

Gel permeation chromatography was conducted with a Waters 2707 autosampler equipped with a Styragel HR 3 (WAT044223) column calibrated with poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA; PSS, MW = 596; 1,930; 5,170; 10,900; 18,700; 41,400; 88,500; 217,000; 340,000; 608,000; 990,000 and 2,050,000 g mol−1). Signals were detected with a Waters 2414 RI detector. Before the measurement, 6-mg polymer were dissolved in 2-ml 0.05 M LiBr/NMP at 80 °C for 24 h. Then the solutions were filtered by 0.45-μm PTFE syringe filter and put into autosampler for measurement.

A KOH-doped membrane with wet thickness twet was placed between two disc-shaped electrodes (gold or platinum) of an active area (A) of 1.767 cm2. The gap between the electrode and the membrane was filled with the respective KOH solution, and through-plane ionic conductivity was measured by EIS in the galvanostatic mode. The measurement was repeated for stacks of two and three membranes. The resistances (R) were plotted as a function of membrane thickness. The empty cell resistance (Rempty) as the total system resistance was extracted from the y-axis intercept. The conductivity of the membrane can be calculated according to following equations (1) and (2):

Alkaline stability was characterized by measuring the conductivity at room temperature of membranes that were stored in KOH solutions at 80 °C for prolonged times.

Swelling behaviour was characterized by measuring dimensional changes for length (l) and thickness (t) between pristine dry (linitial and tinitial) membranes and doped membranes (ldoped and tdoped). Swelling ratios were calculated according to equations (3) and (4).

The pristine dry membranes were doped in KOH solution. After a certain time, the wet membranes were quickly wiped by tissue, and the wet weight was noted (wwet). After water evaporation at 100 °C overnight, wdry was noted. Next, the membrane samples were washed with DI water until the pH became neutral and dried at 100 °C overnight (wfinal). The total, water, KOH uptake and polymer fraction were calculated according to equations (5)–(8). The KOH-free potassium form of 50SOPBI membrane before doping with KOH and after doping and washing with water is confirmed by scanning electron microscopy coupled with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (Supplementary Table 3).

To improve the conductivity of 50SOPBI, a Teflon container was filled with 15 wt% KOH solution, 50SOPBI membranes were added and the container was closed and stored at 80 °C for 48 h. After again cooling down to RT, the membrane surface was wiped with a tissue to remove excess solution, and the membrane was re-immersed in a solution with the finally targeted KOH concentration for at least 24 h and stored until use. The membranes are denoted as 50SOPBI-act.

The ion transport number of K+ and OH− was conducted by modified Hittorf method by comparing the concentration change of either anode or cathode with the produced OH− at the cathode side (N). The membrane was placed in the electrolyser cell and was operated at fixed current (i) in 1, 2 and 3 M KOH solution. Periodically (t), 15-ml solution was taken from anolyte and catholyte, and the volume change was observed. The samples were later titrated with 2 M HCl to give the concentration of the anolyte and catholyte and to calculate the mol changes of the electrolyte over time. The ion transport numbers of K+ and OH− are calculated as follows:

n: number of electrons involved to produce 1 mol OH−

F: Faraday constant (96,485 C/mol)

The electrodes were synthesized utilizing the catalyst-coated substrate (CCS) method. Platinum on carbon (Pt/C, Pt 47.1 wt%, Tanaka K.K.) was employed as cathode catalyst. The catalyst ink was fabricated by mixing catalyst powder, ionomer (Piperion), distilled water and isopropyl alcohol. The volume ratio of isopropanol to DI water is 10 to 1. The density of catalyst in the ink is 10 mg ml−1. The content of ionomer was 5 wt% of the catalyst. The catalyst ink was ultrasonicated for 1 h and hand sprayed onto substrates. The cathode was constructed by applying 0.5 mg cm−2 of Pt/C onto carbon paper (SGL GDL 39BB, CNL). Ionomer-free anode was prepared by electrodeposition. The electrodeposition bath consisted of DI water (~18.1 MΩ), 15 mM Ni(NO3)2·6H2O (99.999%, Sigma Aldrich) and 15 mM Fe(NO3)3·9H2O (99.95%, Sigma Aldrich). A −10 mA cm−2 amount was applied to the working electrode for 600 s under ambient conditions with a SP300 (biologic). Ti mesh was used as the counter electrode and saturated calomel electrode was used as the reference electrode. The electrode was rinsed with water and finally dried in air.

A commercial anion exchange membrane (Piperion, 80 µm) was immersed into 1.0 M KOH for at least 24 h for activation before the membrane electrode assembly fabrication. 50SOPBI membranes were activated in 15 wt% KOH at 80 °C for 48 h, denoted as 50SOPBI-act, followed by equilibration in 0.2,1, 2 and 3 M KOH for at least 24 h. All membranes were sandwiched between the anode and the cathode. Au-coated Ti and graphite bipolar plates were employed as the current collectors on the anode and cathode sides of the cell. The cell assembly was tightened to 4 N m using a torque wrench.

The electrolysis performance was measured at 60 and 80 °C using a potentiostat (HCP-803, Bio-Logic). The electrolytes (KOH solutions with concentrations of 0.2 M, 1 M, 2 M and 3 M) were circulated to the anode and the cathode with a 15 ml min−1 flow rate. The current–voltage curve of the AEMWE was obtained by linear sweep voltammetry, which ranged from 1.35 to 2.2 Vcell at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1. EIS was conducted at 1.6, 1.8 and 2 Vcell with an a.c. frequency ranging from 10 kHz to 500 mHz and an alternating voltage amplitude of 10 mV.

Electrodes were produced by spraying globular gas-atomized nickel-aluminium-type alloy powders with and without Mo for anode and cathode electrodes, respectively. Al acts as a pore-forming agent. Coated porous electrodes were produced on the surface of 4-cm2 Ni mesh substrate using thermal spray technique26.

The zero-gap electrolyser cell consists of five main parts: nickel bipolar plates, Ni wire mesh as gas diffusion layers (GDL), membranes and coated Ni-based electrode as anode and coated Mo incorporated porous Ni as cathode. Activated membrane is placed between two electrodes and supported from each side by porous Ni GDLs and fixed by nickel bipolar plates from both sides. The test has been carried out in different KOH concentrations, 0.2, 1 and 2 M at two different temperatures, 60 and 70 °C, by recording polarization curves up to 2 A cm−2 with a scan rate of 10 mA s−1. EIS was performed from 100 kHz to 100 mHz to identify the losses. The operating conditions and cell hardware were kept the same for all the tests. The ohmic resistance or high-frequency resistance, appearing as the intercept of the Nyquist plots with the x axis at high frequency (left side of Nyquist plot) represents the total internal ohmic resistance of the cell, which arises mainly from solution and membrane resistance. The diameter of the semicircle is therefore equal to the charge-transfer resistance. The real axis value at the other (low frequency) intercept point indicating the overall cell resistance is the sum of the charge transfer resistance and the ohmic resistance.

Either 0.2, 1 or 2 M KOH solution was pumped to both anode and cathode sides at a flow rate of 80 ml min−1 and partially connected via a 20 cm long ¼-inch tube located below the degassing vessels and before the pumps. The cells were operated for 4 h at each current density, with excluding data from the first 30 min for system equilibration. Measurements were initially performed at 80 °C, followed by 60 °C and 40 °C. At 16 ml min−1, nitrogen was purged into the anode degassing vessel, and the exhaust gas was passed through a drying column to remove the water vapour before reaching an electrochemical H2 sensor (Geopal GJ-EX gas detector equipped with a Membrapor H2/M-40000 sensor). Before the measurement, the sensor was calibrated with a 1,000-ppm reference gas. The results were corrected for the nitrogen fraction from the purge and by assuming zero humidity and accounting for the oxygen rate based on the faradaic current.

The durability test was carried out at 500 mA cm−2 in 2 M KOH using a 25-cm2 cell with a flow rate of 50 ml min−1, and the high-frequency resistance was measured every 10 min at 10 kHz.

Intracellular bacterial reservoirs contribute to antibiotic treatment failure by fostering metabolically dormant persister cells that are highly tolerant to killing. However, strategies to effectively target intracellular persister cells remain limited. Here we developed a high-throughput screen to identify compounds that modulate the metabolic activity of intracellular Staphylococcus aureus. The identified compound, KL1, increases intracellular bacterial metabolic activity and sensitizes persister populations of S. aureus to antibiotics, without causing cytotoxicity or bacterial outgrowth. KL1 also exhibits adjuvant activity against intramacrophage Salmonella enterica Typhimurium and Mycobacterium tuberculosis, as well as in murine infection models of S. aureus and S. Typhimurium infection. Transcriptomic analysis and further mechanistic studies reveal that KL1 modulates host immune response genes and suppresses the production of reactive species in host macrophages, alleviating a key inducer of antibiotic tolerance. Our findings highlight the potential to target intracellular persisters by stimulating their metabolism. There are two major problems in the field of antimicrobial chemotherapy–antibiotic resistance and antibiotic tolerance. Antibiotic tolerance has been frequently connected with poor treatment outcomes in the clinic. Unlike antibiotic resistance, which permits bacterial growth in the presence of drugs, antibiotic tolerance allows bacteria to withstand multiple antibiotics for prolonged periods. The extended survival of tolerant bacteria further predisposes them to evolve antibiotic resistance over time, underscoring the critical need to address antibiotic tolerance. Host interactions have been shown to induce persister formation in numerous pathogens, with the production of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species heavily implicated in the collapse of bacterial metabolic activity and entry into an antibiotic-tolerant state. Yet, tools to study or target this process remain limited. Here we developed a high-throughput screen to identify compounds that modulate intracellular S. aureus metabolism, leading to the discovery of KL1, a host-directed compound that sensitizes persisters to antibiotic killing.

A principal characteristic of tolerant bacteria is their low energy and metabolic activity, rendering a non-growing state that prevents them from being targeted by antibiotics directed at growth-centred processes1,2,3,4,5,6. Antibiotic tolerance can be induced by the infection environment and activities of innate immune cells. The intracellular environment in macrophages has been strongly associated with the induction of metabolic indolence and antibiotic tolerance7,8,9,10,11. Importantly, host-produced reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS/RNS) are responsible for inducing antibiotic tolerance in a wide range of bacterial species, including S. aureus, M. tuberculosis, Yersinia pseudotuberculosis and S. enterica Typhimurium7,8,10,11,12,13,14,15,16. Additional intracellular stressors, such as phagosome acidification and nutrient deprivation, also contribute to tolerance10. When conditions become favourable, intracellular bacterial persisters can resume growth, leading to relapsing infections. Thus, strategies to target intracellular persisters are essential for achieving eradication.

To address this difficult-to-eradicate intracellular reservoir, we established a high-throughput screening platform to identify potential metabolic potentiators that sensitize bacteria to antibiotics. We focused on S. aureus, a versatile facultative intracellular pathogen capable of surviving in various cell types17,18,19,20,21 and frequently causing treatment failure and recurrent infections due to antibiotic tolerance, despite appropriate antibiotic use22,23. Among the >4,700 drug-like compounds profiled, we identified KL1 as the lead compound that resuscitates intracellular S. aureus and enhances antibiotic efficacy across multiple methicillin-resistant and methicillin-sensitive clinical isolates in mouse and human macrophages, as well as human primary neutrophils. KL1 alone does not promote bacterial outgrowth or show detectable cytotoxicity. It also exhibits adjuvant activity in murine models of S. aureus bacteraemia and S. Typhimurium infection, as well as intracellular infections of S. Typhimurium and M. tuberculosis. Using transcriptomic, chemical and biochemical approaches, we discover that rather than directly targeting bacteria, KL1 consistently reduces host ROS/RNS. Together, these findings highlight the potential to pharmacologically sensitize intracellular bacteria by altering the host environment. Our screening platform provides a pathway to uncover host-directed therapies that synergize with antibiotics to clear intracellular persisters.

Antibiotic tolerance measured in test tubes is often poorly correlated with clinical outcomes, highlighting the importance of probing bacterial drug responses within the context of host–pathogen interactions24. Evidence suggests that the host intracellular environment antagonizes antimicrobial agents for obligate and facultative intracellular pathogens, including S. aureus7,9,25,26,27. This can be illustrated by testing clinical isolates with varying persister frequencies in tube assays versus cell-based models. We found that although two S. aureus isolates displayed a dramatic 200-fold difference in persister formation in tubes, both produced similar high-level antibiotic tolerance after internalization by bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) (Fig. 1a,b). Both isolates yielded more tolerant bacteria inside macrophages (26–51%) compared with their planktonic cultures (0.05–9%) (Fig. 1a,b). These isolates shared identical minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) for rifampicin (6–8 ng ml−1) and other antibiotics (Supplementary Table 1). These data indicate that host interaction plays a dominant role in promoting antibiotic tolerance.

a, Clinical isolates from S. aureus bacteraemia patients exhibited variable antibiotic tolerability in planktonic cultures. Rifampicin (Rif) was washed away to enumerate surviving bacteria (c.f.u.s). b, High- and low-persister isolates from (a) became more tolerant and produced similar numbers of persisters in bone marrow-derived macrophages. Gentamicin (Gen) and vancomycin (Van) were added to eliminate extracellular bacteria. Surviving intracellular bacteria were normalized to c.f.u. counts at the time of antibiotic addition to calculate persister frequencies (n = 4, two-sided unpaired t-test).

As a versatile pathogen, S. aureus can adapt to multiple intracellular niches and colonize diverse mammalian cells. To track intracellular persister cells in vivo, we constructed inducible S. aureus fluorescent reporter strains and demonstrated the feasibility of using these strains to probe intracellular bacteria. Viable bacteria inside macrophages were visualized via confocal microscopy following induction with anhydrotetracycline (aTc) (Fig. 1c and Supplementary Videos 1–3). To determine whether S. aureus survives antibiotic treatment inside mammalian cells, C57BL/6J mice were infected via tail vein (i.v.) with the reporter strains and treated with 10 mg kg−1 rifampicin intraperitoneally (i.p.) at 1 day post infection (dpi). Rifampicin was chosen for its ability to penetrate mammalian cells7. Kidney cells were extracted at 2 dpi, followed by aTc induction of GFP expression in the presence of gentamicin to exclude extracellular bacteria. Using ImageStream analysis, we observed live cells harbouring GFP-expressing S. aureus that survived rifampicin (Fig. 1d). Thus, the intracellular environment not only provides a physical barrier but also promotes antibiotic tolerance. These findings underscore the need to devise strategies to eradicate intracellular persisters, especially given the limited antibiotic options available for intracellular infections.

Professional phagocytes, including macrophages, facilitate bacterial clearance during bloodstream infections. However, S. aureus can survive this hostile environment after engulfment by adopting a less metabolically active lifestyle17. This metabolic indolence favours antibiotic tolerance and persister formation, as most antibiotics target growth-centred processes. To address this, we developed a high-throughput platform to screen compounds that resuscitate intracellular S. aureus, aiming to sensitize the intracellular population to antibiotics (Fig. 2a). We used a bioluminescent methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) strain JE2-lux to probe intracellular bacterial metabolic activity28. Lux-based bioluminescent reporters are effective for real-time probing of bacterial energy status29,30,31. The lux reaction requires reducing co-factors (NAD(P)H and FMNH2), oxygen, and ATP, thus tightly coupling it to cellular metabolism32.

a, Schematic of the compound screening platform (created with BioRender.com). b, The metabolic activity of intracellular S. aureus was monitored using a bioluminescent MRSA strain JE2-lux. RAW 264.7 macrophages were infected with JE2-lux and treated with 20 µg ml−1 vancomycin or 10 µg ml−1 rifampicin for 4 h before luminescence detection. Gentamicin (50 µg ml−1) was included to eliminate extracellular bacteria. Only Rif penetrates host membranes to target intracellular bacteria.

Source data

To validate the reporter, we treated JE2-lux and wild-type JE2 with 0–0.5 mM sodium arsenate, which induces ATP depletion1, and measured bioluminescence and ATP levels. We observed a dose-dependent correlation between the bioluminescence signal and intracellular ATP levels (Extended Data Fig. 1a–c). Similarly, nutrient supplementation elevated both ATP levels and bioluminescent output without affecting bacterial numbers, supporting the use of lux-based bioluminescence as a readout of metabolic activity (Extended Data Fig. 1d–f). We then evaluated the reporter's utility intracellularly. Rifampicin reduced the bioluminescence of intracellular bacteria, consistent with its ability to penetrate mammalian cell membranes and inhibit bacterial transcription, thereby reducing metabolic activity (Fig. 2b). In contrast, vancomycin, which does not penetrate mammalian cells, had no effect. Importantly, short-term treatment with rifampicin (4 h) did not reduce intracellular bacterial viability (Extended Data Fig. 1g), consistent with the notion that rifampicin first suppresses bacterial metabolism before killing. This observation suggests that the bioluminescence signal in this context more likely reflects bacterial metabolic activity than total burden. While we cannot fully exclude contributions from bacterial number, we primarily used the reporter to infer bacterial metabolic activity and energy state.

Next, we incorporated a cell viability assay to monitor drug cytotoxicity. We verified that the readout reflected live mammalian cell number and was not influenced by bacterial presence (Fig. 2c). We then assessed the assay's dynamic range by measuring bioluminescence as a function of rifampicin concentrations. The dose-response showed that 2 ng ml−1 rifampicin resulted in 50% reduction in bacterial activity without compromising host viability (Fig. 2d). In comparison, vancomycin had no effect across concentrations (Fig. 2e).

To identify compounds that modulate intracellular S. aureus metabolism as antibiotic adjuvants, macrophages infected with JE2-lux were collected from gentamicin-containing media to eliminate extracellular bacteria and dispensed into 384-well plates with various compounds. Bioluminescence and host viability were measured after 4 h. We screened >4,700 drug-like compounds that share structural similarity to kinase inhibitors (Extended Data Fig. 1h). Among them, 77 compounds reduced bioluminescence below rifampicin-treated controls. This reduction may reflect lower bacterial burden or reduced metabolism. Among the 32 compounds that most strongly reduced bioluminescence, 31 did not alter persister frequencies, indicating that they probably suppressed bacterial metabolism rather than killing persisters (Supplementary Fig. 1). The one compound that appeared to reduce bacterial burden did so because infected macrophages were washed away after 24-h treatment, rather than through bactericidal activity against intracellular bacteria.

Intriguingly, we identified 45 compounds that increased bioluminescence by >1.5-fold without cytotoxicity (Fig. 3a). The top hit, KL1 (PubChem CID: 2881454), consistently increased the bioluminescence of intracellular S. aureus (Extended Data Fig. 1i). This was not due to host cells, gentamicin-killed extracellular bacteria, or KL1 itself (Extended Data Fig. 1i,j). Co-administering KL1 with rifampicin and moxifloxacin enhanced killing of intracellular MRSA by up to 10-fold (Fig. 3b and Extended Data Fig. 1k). Notably, while increasing bacterial metabolism could risk promoting bacterial growth when antibiotic levels fall below inhibitory concentrations, KL1 alone (Veh; no antibiotics) did not induce bacterial outgrowth, supporting its potential as a safe therapeutic adjuvant. Compounds ranked 2–9 at 10 µM did not exhibit adjuvant activity, suggesting that they did not sufficiently enhance metabolic activity to enable sensitization (Supplementary Fig. 2).

a, Forty-five compounds (10 µM) enhanced luminescence signal by >1.5-fold (black bars) relative to the vehicle control (0.1% DMSO) without causing cytotoxicity (red circles) during a 4-h treatment. The structure of the top candidate, KL1, is shown. Rifampicin-treated cells served as a reference (blue bar). b, KL1 (open circles)enhanced the killing activity of Rif (10 µg ml−1) and moxifloxacin (Mox; 50 µg ml−1) against intracellular MRSA in RAW 264.7 macrophages. Gentamicin (Gen; 50 µg ml−1) was included to eliminate extracellular bacteria. Surviving intracellular bacteria were normalized to the untreated control (Gen-only, no antibiotics (Abx), no KL1). Representative data from 2–3 independent experiments (n = 3). c, KL1's sensitizing effect was not affected by antibiotic pre-exposure. Infected cells were pretreated with 10 µg ml−1 Rif (±Rif±KL1) or 40 µM KL1 (±KL1±Rif) for 1 h, followed by the addition of the complementary treatment. Untreated (−Rif−KL1) served as control. Representative of 3 independent experiments (n = 3). d,e, KL1 retains adjuvant activity in human THP-1-derived macrophages. Cells were pretreated with 0–100 µM KL1, infected at MOI 20, then treated with Rif (10 µg ml−1) and 0–100 µM KL1 for 6 h (d) or 24 h (e). Surviving bacteria were normalized to the Gen-only control. Representative data from 3–4 independent experiments (n = 3, two-sided unpaired t-test). Bars represent mean ± s.e.m. Assay schematics are shown above plots.

Source data

To confirm reliability, we repeated the experiments using KL1 from two independent suppliers and one from in-house synthesis. In all cases, KL1 increased S. aureus metabolic activity and rifampicin efficacy (Extended Data Fig. 2). This enhanced killing was observed across lab strains and clinical isolates, and it was proportional to KL1 concentration (Extended Data Fig. 3). KL1 also synergized with rifampicin even when infected macrophages were pretreated with antibiotics, suggesting that low-energy persisters may be resuscitated and sensitized (Fig. 3c).

We next conducted the same experiments using THP-1 cells, a human monocyte-derived macrophage model, and showed that KL1 similarly enhanced antibiotic killing in human macrophages (Fig. 3d,e and Extended Data Fig. 4a,b). In addition, we extended the analysis to human primary neutrophils. Importantly, KL1 sensitized S. aureus to both moxifloxacin and rifampicin plus gentamicin killing in neutrophils from healthy donors (Extended Data Fig. 4c–e). Together, we demonstrated the feasibility of pharmacologically sensitizing intracellular S. aureus persisters to antibiotics and confirmed that screening these sensitizers using our newly established semi-automated high-throughput platform is viable.

We next evaluated KL1's in vivo efficacy using an S. aureus bacteraemia model7. Briefly, C57BL/6J mice were intravenously injected with S. aureus to induce systemic infection. At 6 h post infection (hpi), mice were administered 10 mg kg−1 rifampicin once daily, either alone or in combination with 100 mg kg−1 KL1 twice daily, via intraperitoneal injections (Fig. 4a). After a 48-h treatment regimen, livers and spleens were collected, and the tissue homogenates were plated to quantify bacterial burden. Our data showed that combined administration of KL1 and rifampicin further reduced the bacterial burden in both organs compared to rifampicin alone (Fig. 4b,c). This experiment was repeated on separate days with male and female mice from different litters, with each group consisting of 6–8 mice, to ensure reproducibility (n = 14 per group). Notably, we previously showed that administering Tempol (a potent ROS scavenger) or genetically deleting Ncf1 (which impairs the respiratory burst) led to bacterial outgrowth in mice7. Similarly, macrophage depletion via clodronate liposomes caused S. aureus outgrowth in a related model17. Here we found that KL1 alone did not induce bacterial outgrowth in the liver, spleen or kidneys, indicating that it did not compromise host immune control over the infection (Extended Data Fig. 5).

a, Schematic of the murine model. C57BL/6J mice were infected via intravenous (i.v.) injection and treated intraperitoneally (i.p.) with rifampicin (Rif; 10 mg kg−1, once a day (q.d.)) ±KL1 (100 mg kg−1, twice a day (b.i.d.)) starting at 6 hpi for 2 days. Organs were collected to quantify bacterial burden. Created with BioRender.com. b,c, Co-administration of KL1 and Rif significantly reduced S. aureus c.f.u.s in liver (b) and spleen (c). Representative of 2 experiments (n = 8, Mann–Whitney two-tailed test). d, Combined Rif and KL1 improved mouse survival (red) compared to a single dose of Rif alone (black). Each group included 12 (Rif+KL1) or 13 (Rif) mice pooled from 2 independent experiments (P = 0.02, Mantel–Cox test).

Source data

To further examine whether KL1 improves treatment outcomes, we established a murine survival assay. Mice were infected with a higher inoculum of MRSA JE2 and treated with rifampicin (1 mg kg−1) with or without KL1 (100 mg kg−1, two doses). Mice were monitored daily and euthanized upon reaching a humane endpoint or at the conclusion of the study. Interestingly, co-administration of KL1 improved survival rates by 2-fold (P < 0.05, n > 12 across 2 experiments), suggesting potential therapeutic activity (Fig. 4d).

Since KL1 may or may not directly target the bacteria and may instead modulate host–pathogen interactions, we explored whether KL1 also affects other intracellular pathogens. We opted to investigate S. Typhimurium and M. tuberculosis because they also survive and form antibiotic-tolerant persister cells within macrophages10,12,33. Strikingly, KL1 enhanced antibiotic-mediated killing of both pathogens in macrophages (Fig. 5a–c). In a murine Salmonella infection model34, we observed a small but significant reduction in bacterial burden in Peyer's patches at both days 2 and 6 post treatment when antibiotics were combined with KL1 (Fig. 5d–h). These data suggest that KL1 may act as a broad-spectrum antibiotic adjuvant against intracellular bacteria.

a,b, KL1 boosted Rif activity against clinical M. tuberculosis strains from the globally prevalent lineage 2 (a) and lineage 4 (b) in macrophages. C.f.u.s were normalized to the untreated control (Gen-only) (n = 3, two-sided unpaired t-test). c, KL1 enhanced ciprofloxacin (Cip; 5 µg ml−1) killing of intracellular S. Typhimurium. Surviving bacteria were normalized to input c.f.u.s (n = 7, two-sided unpaired t-test). Bars represent mean ± s.e.m. d, Schematic of the Salmonella murine infection model. C57BL/6J mice were infected via oral gavage and intraperitoneally treated with 150 mg kg−1 cefotaxime (CTX) with or without 100 mg kg−1 KL1 (b.i.d.) at 2 dpi for 6 days. Created with BioRender.com. e–h, Tissue samples were collected to enumerate the number of surviving bacteria (c.f.u.s) at 4 dpi (e) and 8 dpi (f). Co-administration of KL1 and CTX reduced the bacterial burden in Peyer's patches (PP) (e,f,h) but not in mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN) (e–g). A group of 5 mice was examined over the time course (n = 5, two-sided unpaired t-test). Bars represent mean ± s.e.m.

Since KL1's synergy probably depends on metabolism, we tested a mutant MRSA strain lacking all four glucose transporters (ΔG4) to determine whether central metabolism was required35. KL1's adjuvant activity was substantially attenuated in the absence of glucose uptake (Extended Data Fig. 6a), supporting the idea that KL1 enhances antibiotic efficacy by stimulating intracellular bacterial metabolism.

To deconvolute KL1's mechanism, we interrogated whether KL1 affected extracellular S. aureus in planktonic cultures. In actively growing bacteria (mid-exponential phase), KL1 did not consistently increase metabolic activity (Extended Data Fig. 6b). Treatment with KL1 altered neither bacterial growth nor the growth or frequency of persisters after rifampicin treatment (Extended Data Fig. 6c). Likewise, KL1 did not affect metabolic activity or growth of stationary-phase bacteria, with or without antibiotics (Extended Data Fig. 6d,e).

We subsequently employed Seahorse analysis to investigate whether KL1 altered metabolic activity of extracellular S. aureus. Our data clearly showed that KL1 had no effect on oxygen consumption rate (OCR) or extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) (Extended Data Fig. 6f,g). In addition, relative ATP levels were unchanged across multiple S. aureus strains (Extended Data Fig. 6h–j). Furthermore, pretreatment of S. aureus with KL1, followed by washing before macrophage infection, did not enhance antibiotic-mediated killing (Extended Data Fig. 6k). Collectively, our data strongly suggest that KL1 does not act on bacteria but instead perturbs the intracellular environment to alter host–pathogen interaction.

To elucidate KL1's mode of action, we profiled transcriptomic changes in S. aureus-infected macrophages following KL1 treatment using bulk RNA-sequencing. Compared with vehicle control, KL1 treatment led to upregulation of 24 host genes and downregulation of 90 host genes (Extended Data Fig. 7). These changes predominantly affected pathways involved in inflammatory responses, cytokine production and macrophage activation. However, KL1 did not appear to obliterate the immune response, and KL1 treatment alone did not cause bacterial outgrowth in either cell-based or murine infection models. Intriguingly, multiple host genes involved in regulating reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS/RNS) were differentially expressed (Extended Data Fig. 7b,c). Key genes promoting ROS/RNS production: Thbs1, S100a8 and Nos2, were significantly downregulated, while the glutathione S-transferase gene Gsta2, involved in cellular anti-oxidative defence, was upregulated36,37. As such, KL1 may alleviate oxidative and nitrosative stress in the intracellular niche, aligning with previous findings that ROS/RNS contribute to antibiotic tolerance and persister formation in S. aureus and other bacteria7,8,10,11,12,13,38.

Although KL1's mechanism is not fully characterized, this compound has been tested in hundreds of biological screens (PubChem CID: 2881454)39. KL1 showed activity in five assays targeting four proteins (Supplementary Table 2). EHMT2/G9a stood out as a potential target: it is an epigenetic regulator expressed in immune cells, including macrophages, and its previously determined half maximal effective concentration (EC50) (PubChem AID: 504332) matches the effect range (10–100 µM) seen in our study39. Intriguingly, EHMT2/G9a regulates intracellular innate immunity and macrophage polarization by modulating inflammatory genes such as Il6 and Il1b, and also influences NF-κB and JAK/STAT signalling40,41,42,43,44. This downstream regulatory profile resembles the transcriptional shift induced by KL1 (Extended Data Fig. 7). To explore EHMT2/G9a's role, we examined whether its inhibition would affect the antibiotic susceptibility of intracellular S. aureus. Intriguingly, treatment with the selective EHMT2 inhibitor BIX-01294 elevated bacterial metabolic activity and enhanced rifampicin efficacy in a dose-dependent manner, phenocopying KL1's activity (Fig. 6a,b and Extended Data Fig. 8a).

a, Inhibition of EHMT2/G9a phenocopies KL1-mediated sensitization in intracellular S. aureus. A selective EHMT2/G9a inhibitor, BIX-01294 (BIX; 1–10 µM), increased the bioluminescence signal (grey bars) of strain JE2-lux compared to the vehicle control (Veh; 0.1% DMSO). Cytotoxicity of BIX was also assessed (red circles). Representative data of 3 experiments (n = 6, two-sided unpaired t-test). b, BIX increased rifampicin (Rif; 10 µg ml−1) killing of intracellular MRSA in a dose-dependent manner (1–5 µM). Gentamicin (50 µg ml−1) was added to eliminate extracellular bacteria. Surviving bacteria were normalized to the untreated control (no Rif, no BIX, Gen-only). Representative data of 3 experiments (n = 3, two-sided unpaired t-test). c,d, Both KL1 (40, 100 µM) and BIX (1, 4 µM) reduced ROS levels at 4 hpi. Chemiluminescent L-012 (c) and fluorescent fluorescein-boronate (Fl-B) (d) probes were used to quantify reactive species. Antioxidant butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA; 20 µM) served as control. Representative data from 3–4 experiments (n = 5, two-sided unpaired t-test). Assay schematics are shown above plots. Bars represent mean ± s.e.m.

Source data

Given EHMT2/G9a's role in inflammatory regulation and KL1's impact on ROS/RNS-related gene expression, we hypothesized that KL1 facilitates antibiotic killing by reducing ROS/RNS production. To test this, we used two detection methods: the chemiluminescent probe L-012 and the fluorescent probe fluorescein-boronate (Fl-B)8,45. Both probes consistently showed that KL1 at 40 and 100 µM significantly reduced ROS/RNS levels in S. aureus-infected macrophages at 4 and 8 h post treatment (Fig. 6c,d and Extended Data Fig. 8b,d). Notably, BIX-01294 and the antioxidant control butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) similarly decreased ROS/RNS levels. KL1 also reduced ROS/RNS in uninfected macrophages, highlighting its ability to modulate the host environment (Extended Data Fig. 8c,e).

To gain medicinal chemistry insight, we conducted a structure–activity relationship study using six KL1 analogues (Extended Data Fig. 9a). The substitution of carboxamide at the alkyl terminal (KL2, KL4 and KL5) or removal of the nitrile group from the dihydropyridine ring (KL6) moderately reduced their adjuvant activity (Extended Data Fig. 9b). The hexyl substitution on sulfur (KL3) resulted in a high cytotoxicity against host macrophages, indicating a poor therapeutic index. Notably, the 1,4-dihydropyridine ring oxidized analogue (KL7) completely lost the adjuvant activity, presumably due to altered electronic structure, reduced conformational flexibility, or lost hydrogen bonding capacity (Extended Data Fig. 9b). Importantly, KL7 also failed to reduce ROS/RNS in both infected and uninfected macrophages (Extended Data Fig. 9c–f). Altogether, these results strongly support the hypothesis that KL1 enhances intracellular antibiotic efficacy by reducing oxidative and/or nitrosative stress in the host cell.

The ability of bacterial populations or subpopulations of persister cells to survive high concentrations of bactericidal antibiotics for extended periods, despite lacking resistance mutations, is probably a major factor contributing to treatment failure2,22,24,46,47,48,49. Approximately 20–30% of patients with S. aureus bacteraemia fail to clear the infection despite receiving appropriate antibiotic therapy50,51,52. The weak correlation between in vitro antimicrobial susceptibility and clinical outcomes highlights the importance of considering physiological context when addressing poor antibiotic efficacy24.

Devising novel strategies to target antibiotic-tolerant persister cells has drawn increasing attention6,53,54,55,56,57. Conceptually, eradication of persisters can be achieved either by directly targeting them or by reverting them to a metabolically active state, thereby making them vulnerable to antibiotics. The intracellular environment is a well-established reservoir for persister cells7,8,9,10,11. In this study, we demonstrated the potential of modulating the host microenvironment to sensitize intracellular persisters to antibiotics and improve treatment outcomes. Although different stress stimuli can induce antibiotic-tolerant persisters, most produce a metabolically indolent state that can withstand antibiotics. We therefore employed an ATP-dependent bioluminescent reporter to probe metabolic activity of intracellular bacteria as part of a phenotypic screen. When combined with host cell viability and colony-forming unit (c.f.u.) determination, this platform allowed us to identify molecules that stimulate intracellular bacterial metabolism without compromising host viability or expanding the pathogen. Given that the low-energy, low-metabolic activity state is central to antibiotic tolerance in multiple species, this screening may be adapted for other intracellular pathogens across various host cell types and will be agnostic to the mechanism responsible for tolerance58,59,60,61.

Notably, our lead compound KL1 reduced ROS/RNS production in macrophages, sensitized intracellular persisters to antibiotics, and enhanced antibiotic efficacy in murine infection models. This adjuvant activity was observed across three clinically important pathogens in three laboratories. Transcriptomic analysis supports a mechanism involving altered inflammatory responses and reduced ROS/RNS. These observations align with a previous biochemical screen in which KL1 inhibited EHMT2/G9a, which epigenetically regulates diverse processes, including macrophage polarization40,41,42,43,44. Inhibiting EHMT2/G9a mirrored KL1's effect and sensitized intracellular S. aureus, suggesting that EHMT2/G9a may be a key mediator of KL1's effect (Extended Data Fig. 10). Whether KL1 directly binds to and inhibits EHMT2/G9a remains to be determined.

In addition to demonstrating KL1's activity in THP-1-derived human macrophages and primary human neutrophils, we further examined whether macrophages derived from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) could recapitulate the response. We tested polarized and non-polarized macrophages, under stimulated and unstimulated conditions, using various differentiation protocols and treatment regimens. However, none produced consistent results (Extended Data Fig. 4f–k). Notably, current evidence strongly supports the notion that human macrophages generate nitric oxide and reactive species in vivo62. However, it is notoriously difficult to recapitulate these levels ex vivo, probably due to the prolonged differentiation process or absence of physiological stimuli. This apparent loss of reactive species production ex vivo is further supported by our observation that the antioxidant BHA, used as a positive control, did not enhance antibiotic killing in these conditions (Extended Data Fig. 4f–k).

Together, these findings support that: (1) Targeting host pathways can render intracellular persisters more susceptible to antibiotics; (2) ROS/RNS are key drivers of antibiotic tolerance in vivo; (3) Inhibiting ROS/RNS production can sensitize persisters across bacterial species; and (4) Sensitizing intracellular persisters improves antibiotic efficacy against active infections. This work underscores the potential of host-directed therapeutics, in conjunction with antibiotics, to improve treatment outcomes. Continued development of our screening platform promises identification of additional host-targeted drugs that sensitize intracellular persisters. Ongoing studies on KL1's mechanism, along with medicinal chemistry optimization and in vivo testing in combination with diverse antibiotics against multiple pathogens, will be critical to determine the full therapeutic potential of this host-directed adjuvant in eradicating deep-seated infections.

S. aureus strains LAC, HG003, MW2, JE2, JE2-lux (JE2luxABDCE) (kindly provided by Roger Plaut, Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, Silver Spring)28, ΔG4 (kindly provided by Anthony Richardson, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh)35 and bacteraemia isolates8 were routinely cultured in tryptic soy broth (TSB, Fisher Scientific) or Mueller–Hinton broth (MHB, Oxoid) at 37 °C with shaking (225 r.p.m.) unless otherwise stated. Clinical isolates were obtained under an IRB exemption from a pre-existing collection. S. enterica serovar Typhimurium 14028S was cultured in LB broth (Lennox) at 37 °C with shaking. M. tuberculosis strains N0155 (lineage 2) and N1283 (lineage 4)65 were grown in Middlebrook 7H9 broth (BD Difco) with 10% (v/v) oleic albumin dextrose catalase, 0.2% (v/v) glycerol, 0.05% tyloxapol (w/v) and 0.1 mM sodium propionate (ThermoFisher) to optical density at 600 nm (OD600) = 0.6 (ref. 66).

Stationary-phase bacterial cultures were diluted 1:1,000 in MHB containing serially diluted Rif (0–200 µg ml−1), Mox (0–20 µg ml−1) or Van (0–16 µg ml−1) in 96-well assay plates (Corning) in triplicates (200 µl per well). Plates were sealed with Breathe-EASIER membranes (Diversified Biotech) and incubated statically at 37 °C for 24 h. The MICs were determined by the absence of bacterial growth. Three independent assays were performed to ensure reproducibility.

The plasmid pALC2084, which contains a tetracycline (Tet)-inducible GFP-expressing cassette67 (kindly provided by Ambrose Cheung, Dartmouth College, Hanover), was first transformed into S. aureus strain RN4220 via electroporation using a Gene Pulser Xcell system (Bio-Rad)68. The plasmid was then purified and transformed into the recipient S. aureus strain HG003. Single colonies were isolated and cultured in TSB containing 10 µg ml−1 Cam and 0–2 µM aTc (Sigma) for 2–3 h. GFP induction was verified at excitation and emission wavelengths of 475 nm and 508 nm, respectively, using a Synergy H1 microplate reader (BioTek). For mKate reporter construction, the mKate2 gene was amplified from pRN10 (Addgene, plasmid 84454)69 using a specific primer pair (Supplementary Table 3) and Q5 High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase (New England Biolabs). The PCR product was purified using a MinElute kit (Qiagen). Both the Tet-inducible vector pRMC2 (Addgene, plasmid 68940)70 and the mKate insert were digested with KpnI-HF and EcoRI-HF (New England Biolabs), gel purified using a QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen), and ligated using T4 DNA ligase (New England Biolabs) at 16 °C for 16 h. The construct was transformed into MAX Efficiency DH5α competent cells (ThermoFisher). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using a QuikChange kit (Agilent) and a primer pair (Supplementary Table 3) to incorporate an upstream ribosomal binding site. The final pRMC2–mKate plasmid was verified by restriction digest and Sanger sequencing, and then transformed into RN4220 and subsequently HG003. aTc-induced mKate expression was confirmed at 633 nm (excitation 588 nm) using the Synergy H1 reader.

RAW 264.7 macrophages were seeded in Nunc 8-well Lab-Tek chambered coverglass (ThermoFisher) at 2–3 × 105 cells per well in 500 µl complete minimum essential medium (MEM, Gibco) supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated FBS and 2 mM L-glutamine at 37 °C with 5% CO2 for 16 h. Cells were infected with Tet-inducible GFP- or mKate-expressing S. aureus at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 20 (no Rif) or 100 (with Rif) by centrifugation at 1,000 g for 2 min, followed by incubation at 37 °C for 35 min. After washing once in 500 µl complete MEM, cells were treated with or without 10 µg ml−1 Rif in the presence of 50 µg ml−1 Gen at 37 °C for 1.5 h (no Rif) or 4 h (with Rif). Rif-treated cells were washed three times and incubated in Gen-containing medium (50 µg ml−1) at 37 °C for 2–3 h to allow resuscitation of intracellular persisters. Cells were then treated with 2 µM aTc in the presence of 50 µg ml−1 Gen at 37 °C for 3 h to induce reporter expression. GFP-expressing S. aureus-infected macrophages were imaged using a Leica SP8X Falcon microscope with excitation at 484 nm (WLL2), emission collection at 495–570 nm and a detector gain of 100 V. Imaging parameters included: 1,024 × 1,024-pixel scan, 16-bit depth, speed of 600, pixel averaging of 2, pinhole of 1 AU and acquisition using a ×63 oil-immersion lens (NA 1.4, 1–4× zoom).

Macrophages infected with mKate-expressing S. aureus were stained with 100–300 nM LysoTracker Green DND-26 (ThermoFisher) at 37 °C for 30 min, then washed and maintained in 200 µl complete MEM containing 1 µg ml−1 Hoechst 33342, 50 µg ml−1 Gen and 2 µM aTc. Live-cell z-stack and time-lapse imaging were performed using an Olympus FV3000RS confocal microscope (Olympus) equipped with a stage-top incubator at 37 °C, 5% CO2 and 100% humidity. The settings were as follows: (1) 405-nm (Hoechst 33342), 488-nm (LysoTracker Green) and 594-nm (mKate) diode lasers were used for excitation with GaAsP detectors; (2) a 516 × 516-pixel scan was applied; (3) pixel averaging was set to 10; (4) pinhole size was set to 1 AU; and (5) images were obtained using a ×60 oil-immersion objective lens (NA 1.4). Images were exported using ImageJ/FIJI (v.1.54)71 without gamma correction.

Cells were loaded into an Amnis ImageStreamX Mark II system (EMD Millipore) for imaging and fluorescence detection. For capturing live cells harbouring viable GFP-expressing S. aureus, 405-nm and 488-nm colinear lasers were set to 40 mW and 70–90 mW for live/dead cell discrimination and GFP expression, respectively. In-focus single-cell images were acquired with a ×60 magnification and a low-speed flow rate using the INSPIRE software (EMD Millipore). The exported data were analysed using IDEAS 6.2 software (EMD Millipore).

RAW 264.7 macrophages were seeded in 4 ml complete MEM in Costar 6-well tissue culture-treated plates (Corning) at 8 × 105 cells per well and incubated at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 16 h. Cells were infected with S. aureus strain JE2-lux at an MOI of 100 for 25 min at 37 °C. Infected cells were washed once with 2 ml PBS and incubated with 10 mM EDTA in PBS (2 ml per well) at 37 °C for 5–10 min to detach. Cells were pelleted at 300 g for 6 min, resuspended in complete MEM with 50 µg ml−1 Gen at 2.5 × 105 cells per ml, and dispensed (80 µl per well) into 384-well white and black plates (ThermoFisher) for luminescence and fluorescence measurements, respectively. Uninfected macrophages were added to column 1 and 24 as background and viability controls. Plates were preloaded with 80 nl of 10 mM compounds using a Mosquito LV pipetting system (SPT Labtech). Vehicle (0.1% dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO)) and 10 µg ml−1 Rif were included for quality control. After cell dispensing, plates were centrifuged at 500 g for 2 min and incubated at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 4 h. Luminescence was recorded at 1.25-mm depth with a detector gain of 250 using a Synergy H1 reader. To assess cell viability, 10 µl CellTiter-Fluor (Promega) was added to black plates and incubated for 30 min in the dark before fluorescence was measured at 7-mm depth (gain 100). The kinase-targeted compound library (>4,700 rule-of-five-compliant compounds) was from the UNC Center for Integrative Chemical Biology and Drug Discovery (CICBDD) (Supplementary Table 4). Luminescence and fluorescence signals were normalized to 0.1% DMSO controls. EC50 values for Van and Rif against intracellular MRSA strain JE2-lux were determined using GraphPad Prism. The screen was performed once for hit identification.

For S. aureus planktonic cultures, 16- to 18-h stationary-phase cultures were diluted 1:100 in MHB and incubated at 37 °C with shaking at 225 r.p.m. for 3 h to reach the mid-exponential phase. Cultures were then treated with 10 µg ml−1 Rif and/or 0–40 µM KL1 and incubated for 24 h under the same conditions. Bacteria were washed in one volume of 1% NaCl three times at 20,000 g for 5 min, followed by resuspension in one volume of 1% NaCl. Suspensions were serially diluted 10-fold and plated on tryptic soy agar (TSA) to quantify surviving S. aureus. Tolerant bacterial frequencies were calculated by normalizing c.f.u.s to the initial input.

To evaluate intracellular S. aureus persister frequencies, RAW 264.7 macrophages or BMDMs were seeded into 24-well tissue culture-treated plates (Corning) at 4 × 105 cells per well in 500 µl complete MEM, and incubated at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 16 h. THP-1 cells were seeded at 2 × 105 cells per well in complete RPMI 1640 medium with 100 nM phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) (Cayman) and differentiated into macrophages for 3 days, then rested in PMA-free medium for 16 h before infection. Macrophages were infected with S. aureus strains at MOI 10–20 via centrifugation at 1,000 g for 2 min, followed by 35 min incubation at 37 °C. After removing the spent medium, cells were incubated in 500 µl complete MEM containing antibiotics (10 µg ml−1 Rif, 50 µg ml−1 Mox or 20 µg ml−1 Van) with or without 0–100 µM KL1 or its analogues (KL2–7), 20 µM BHA (Sigma) or 0–10 µM BIX-01294, in the presence of 50–100 µg ml−1 Gen at 37 °C for 6–24 h. Cells were washed three times with 1 ml PBS and lysed with 200 µl 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100 (Fisher Scientific) at 37 °C for 5 min, followed by the addition of 800 µl PBS. Released intracellular bacteria were serially diluted and plated on TSA. Persister frequencies were normalized to the intracellular c.f.u.s at the time of antibiotic exposure. For comparisons, final bacterial loads were normalized to untreated controls.

For Salmonella infections, immortalized BMDMs were seeded in 12-well plates (4 × 105 cells per well) in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 2 mM L-glutamine and 10% FBS at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 24 h. Stationary-phase Salmonella Typhimurium were opsonized with 8% (v/v) mouse serum in RPMI 1640 for 20 min and used to infect immortalized BMDMs at MOI 15 (ref. 26). Plates were centrifuged at 110 g for 5 min, then incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. Cells were washed once with PBS and treated with 5 µg ml−1 ciprofloxacin (MP Biomedicals) in the presence of 10–80 µM KL1 or 0.2% DMSO for 24 h. Cells were washed three times in 500 µl PBS, lysed with 0.2% Triton X-100 at 37 °C for 10 min and plated on LB agar. Persister frequencies were calculated as c.f.u.s at 24 h (T24) over input c.f.u.s (T0).

For M. tuberculosis, bacterial cultures were washed twice with PBS, passed through a 5-µm filter and resuspended in DMEM72. BMDMs were infected at MOI 1 for 4 h, washed three times with PBS and treated with 200 µg ml−1 Gen for 2 h. Cells were then incubated in DMEM containing 0.1% DMSO, 1 µg ml−1 Rif, 100 µM KL1, or a combination of Rif and KL1 in the presence of 20 µg ml−1 Gen in triplicate at 37 °C for 3 days. Cells were washed three times with PBS, then lysed with 200 µl of 0.1% Triton X-100 for 5 min. The extracted intracellular bacteria were plated on Middlebrook 7H10 agar plates (BD Difco). The number of viable bacteria was enumerated after 21 days of incubation at 37 °C and 5% CO2.

Blood samples from healthy donors were processed immediately following a standard protocol73. Whole blood was mixed 1:1 with 3% dextran T-500 (Pharmacosmos)/0.9% NaCl and incubated at room temperature for 20 min to sediment erythrocytes. Leucocyte-rich supernatants were transferred to 50-ml tubes and centrifuged at 250 g for 10 min at 4 °C. Pellets were resuspended in 0.9% NaCl equal to the starting blood volume. Ficoll-Paque Plus (Cytiva, Fisher Scientific) was underlaid (10 ml per tube) beneath the cell suspension, followed by centrifugation at 400 g for 40 min at 20 °C (no brake). Pellets were resuspended in 20 ml cold 0.2% NaCl for 30 s, followed by addition of 20 ml cold 1.6% NaCl to lyse remaining erythrocytes. Neutrophils were pelleted at 250 g for 6 min, washed in RPMI 1640 with 2% FBS, 2 mM L-glutamine and 10 mM HEPES, and centrifuged at 250 g for 4 min. Cells were resuspended in the same medium, rested at 37 °C for 0.5–1 h, filtered through 100-μm strainers (VWR) and dispensed at 1 × 105 neutrophils per well (500 µl) in 24-well ultra-low attachment plates. Cells were pretreated with 100 µM KL1 or 0.25% DMSO at 37 °C for 1–1.5 h in 6 replicates, infected with S. aureus JE2-lux (MOI 10) at 37 °C for 1 h, followed by treatment with 50 µg ml−1 Mox or 10 µg ml−1 Rif and 25 µg ml−1 Gen for 4 h. Cell suspensions were serially diluted and plated on TSA with 0.4% activated charcoal (Sigma) to neutralize residual antibiotics, allowing enumeration of surviving bacteria. Neutrophils from ≥4 donors were tested.

Human PBMCs were isolated from fresh blood samples using Ficoll-Paque density gradient centrifugation, as described for neutrophil isolation. The interphase was collected into five volumes of complete RPMI 1640 and centrifuged at 400 g for 10 min. Cells were washed twice with 20 ml PBS at 300 g for 5 min and rested in complete medium at 37 °C for 30 min. Debris was removed using 100-μm cell strainers. For differentiation, 1–2 × 105 PBMCs were seeded in 1 ml complete medium containing 1× penicillin–streptomycin and 20–50 ng ml−1 GM-CSF (PeproTech) per well in 24-well plates for 4–6 days, with medium changed every other day. On day 4 or 6, macrophages were polarized with or without 100 ng ml−1 lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (Sigma) and 20–50 ng ml−1 IFNγ (PeproTech) for 1–2 days. Polarized macrophages were stimulated with 500 nM PMA at 37 °C for 2–3 h and washed three times in RPMI 1640. Macrophages (polarized and non-polarized, stimulated and unstimulated) were pretreated with 40–100 µM KL1, 20 µM BHA or 0.1–0.25% DMSO in 500 µl complete medium at 37 °C for 1 h in triplicates. Macrophages were infected with S. aureus at MOI 10 by centrifugation at 1,000 g for 2 min and incubated at 37 °C for 35 min. Cells were subsequently treated with 10 µg ml−1 Rif and 50–100 µg ml−1 Gen in the presence of KL1, BHA or DMSO, and incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO2 for 6–18 h. Cells were washed three times with PBS, lysed in 200 µl 0.5% Triton X-100 for 5 min, diluted with 800 µl PBS and plated on TSA.

To visualize viable intracellular S. aureus, C57BL/6J female mice (6–9 weeks old) were systemically infected with Tet-inducible GFP-expressing S. aureus strain HG003 (5 × 106 c.f.u.) via tail vein injection7. At 1 dpi, mice received 10 mg kg−1 Rif in 2.5% DMSO, 12.5% PEG300 (Sigma) and 85% sterile H2O via intraperitoneal injection. Control mice received vehicle (2.5% DMSO/12.5% PEG300) only. At 2 dpi (24-h Rif treatment), kidneys were homogenized in 5 ml cold PBS with DNase I (50 U ml−1, bovine pancreas; ThermoFisher) using a Stomacher 80 Biomaster (Seward) at fast speed for 2 min twice74. Homogenates were filtered through 70-µm strainers and pelleted at 300 g for 5 min at 4 °C. After three PBS washes, cells were resuspended in cold PBS with 1% FBS and 50 µg ml−1 Gen, with or without 2 µM aTc, for 3 h. Samples were stained with LIVE/DEAD fixable violet dead cell stain (1 µl ml−1; ThermoFisher) at 4 °C for 30 min before ImageStream analysis.

To evaluate KL1 adjuvant activity in vivo, mice (male:female = 1:1) were infected with 2 × 107 c.f.u.s of strain HG003 via intravenous injection. At 6 hpi, mice were intraperitoneally treated with 10 mg kg−1 Rif, alone or with 100 mg kg−1 KL1 in 7% DMSO, 40% PEG300 and 53% sterile H2O. Rif and KL1 were given once daily and every 12 h, respectively, for 2 days. Organs were homogenized either by repetitively rolling a serological pipette over the samples in sample bags (liver) or by bead beating using a Precellys 24 Touch homogenizer (Bertin Technologies) at 5,000 r.p.m. for 25 s twice with a 5-s interval (spleen and kidney). Homogenates were serially diluted in 1% NaCl and plated on TSA to enumerate surviving bacteria. Bacterial burden (c.f.u.s g−1) was normalized to tissue weight. Two independent experiments using 6–8 mice each (14 mice per group in total) from different litters were conducted.

For Kaplan–Meier survival analysis, mice (female) were infected with 2 × 108 c.f.u.s of S. aureus JE2-lux. At 6 hpi, mice received either 100 mg kg−1 KL1 or the vehicle (7% DMSO, 40% PEG300 and 53% sterile H2O). At 12 hpi, a single dose of 1 mg kg−1 Rif, alone or with 100 mg kg−1 KL1, was administered. Mice were monitored twice daily for signs of disease and euthanized when they reached humane endpoints, defined as change in mobility, severe lethargy, dehydration and a loss of >20% body weight. Survival was recorded until natural death or humane euthanasia. Data from 2 independent experiments (12–13 mice per group) were pooled. Significance was determined using Mantel–Cox test.

S. Typhimurium cultures were back diluted to OD600 = 0.1 in LB broth and grown to exponential phase at 37 °C with shaking. Bacterial cells were washed three times with PBS before infection. Female C57BL/6J mice (10 weeks old) were fasted for ≥4 h and infected orally with 1 × 1010 c.f.u.s in 200 µl PBS. At 2 dpi, mice received 150 mg kg−1 cefotaxime (CTX), alone or with 100 mg kg−1 KL1 in 7% DMSO, 40% PEG300 and 53% sterile H2O via intraperitoneal injection, given twice daily for 2 and 6 days. Organs were homogenized in PBS using a Mixer Mill MM400 (Retsch) with 3.2-mm stainless steel beads (BioSpec) at 30 Hz for 2 min. Homogenates were serially diluted and plated on LB agar to enumerate surviving bacteria. Five mice per group were used.

Reactive species were measured using the luminescent probe L-012 (Wako Chemical) and the fluorescent dye fluorescein-boronate (Fl-B)63. For L-012 probing, RAW 264.7 macrophages were seeded in 100 µl complete MEM in Falcon 96-well white plates (Corning) at 3.84 × 104 cells per well and incubated at 37 °C for 16 h. Cells were infected with S. aureus JE2 at MOI 10 by centrifugation at 1,000 g for 2 min, followed by a 40-min incubation at 37 °C. Cells were treated with 40–100 µM KL1 or 1–10 µM BIX-01294 in the presence of 50 µg ml−1 Gen in 5 replicates for 4–8 h. After three washes with 200 µl prewarmed PBS, 100 µl of 300 µM prewarmed Hanks' balanced salt solution (Gibco) was added, and luminescence was immediately measured at 37 °C using a Synergy H1 reader. Two consecutive reads were averaged.

For Fl-B staining, macrophages were similarly seeded in 96-well black clear-bottom plates. After treatment with 40–100 µM KL1, 100 µM KL2, 40–100 µM inactive analogue KL7, 1–10 µM BIX-01294 or 20 µM BHA, infected cells were washed twice with 200 µl PBS and incubated with 100 µl of 25–50 µM Fl-B in PBS at 37 °C for 30 min. Following three washes, fluorescence was measured at 535 nm emission with 485 nm excitation (gain 100, area scan) using the Synergy H1 reader.

S. aureus strains LAC, HG003 and JE2 were grown in TSB for 16–18 h and subcultured at 1:1,000 to 1:40,000 dilution in fresh TSB containing 40 µM KL1 or 0.1–0.5% DMSO in 6 replicates at 37 °C for 4 h. Cultures (100 µl per well) were aliquoted into Falcon 96-well white plates and mixed 1:1 with BacTiter-Glo reagent (Promega), then incubated in the dark on a rocker at room temperature for 5–20 min. Luminescence was measured at 1.25-mm depth with gain 250 using a Synergy H1 reader and normalized to c.f.u.s for relative ATP levels.

To correlate lux-based bioluminescence and bacterial metabolic activity, stationary-phase JE2 and JE2-lux cultures were subcultured at 1:200 in MHB, incubated at 37 °C for 3 h with shaking, then treated with 0–0.5 mM sodium arsenate (Sigma) for 30 min. Parallel cultures diluted 1:6 in PBS were incubated at 37 °C with shaking for 3 h, then treated with 1% glucose, 5 mM sodium pyruvate and 0.5% casamino acids, or vehicle for 30 min. Bioluminescence (JE2-lux) and ATP levels (JE2) were measured immediately. Bacterial suspensions were plated for c.f.u. enumeration.

This analysis measures real-time changes in cellular metabolism and has been applied to study S. aureus respiration75. Stationary-phase cultures were diluted 1:100 in fresh TSB in triplicate and incubated for 2–3 h until OD600 reached 0.3. Cultures were then diluted 1:500 to 1:1,000 in TSB or Seahorse XF DMEM (Agilent) supplemented with 100 mM glucose, 2 mM L-glutamine and 1 mM sodium pyruvate, and dispensed into poly-D-lysine (PDL)-coated Seahorse XF HS miniplates (100 µl per well). PDL coating involved adding 100 µg ml−1 PDL in sterile H2O for 30 min, followed by two washes with H2O and air-drying. Bacteria were adhered by centrifugation at 1,400 g for 10 min. An additional 80 µl of medium was added (180 µl total), and miniplates were loaded into a calibrated Seahorse XF HS Mini Analyzer (Agilent). KL1 (40 µM) or 0.1–0.5% DMSO was injected, and oxygen consumption rates (OCRs) and extracellular acidification rates (ECARs) were monitored at 37 °C for 4–6 h. Data were analysed using Seahorse Analytics and plotted with GraphPad Prism.

RAW 264.7 macrophages were seeded in 6-well plates (8 × 105 cells per well) in 4 ml complete MEM and incubated at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 16 h. Cells were infected with S. aureus JE2-lux at MOI 20 for 35 min, then incubated in fresh media with 100 µg ml−1 Gen and 40 µM KL1 or 0.1% DMSO for 24 h. Cells were washed with PBS, dissociated in 10 mM EDTA (2 ml per well) at 37 °C for 5 min, and washed three times in cold PBS. Viable cells (2.4–4.2 × 106) were pelleted and submitted to Azenta for RNA sequencing (paired-end, 30 million reads per sample). Reads were aligned to the mouse GRCm38 genome using STAR v.2.5.2b.

The bioluminescent MRSA strain JE2-lux serves as a proxy for bacterial metabolic activity. a‒c, ATP depletion with sodium arsenate (Ars; 0‒0.5 mM, 30 min) shows a positive correlation between ATP levels and luminescence (Pearson's r = 0.84; two-sided p < 0.0001). ATP was measured in wild-type JE2 using BacTiter-Glo. No change in CFU was observed. Representative of two experiments (n = 3). d‒f, Nutrient supplementation (1% glucose, 5 mM sodium pyruvate, 0.5% casamino acids (+++) for 30 min) increased bioluminescence in JE2-lux and ATP levels in wild-type JE2, without affecting CFU after nutrient supplementation or between strains. Representative of two experiments (n = 3, two-sided unpaired t-test). g, Short-term rifampicin (Rif, 4 h) did not alter intracellular CFU. Representative of two experiments (n = 3, two-sided unpaired t-test). h, A library of >4,700 drug-like compounds (10 µM), structurally similar to kinase inhibitors, was screened for intracellular MRSA activity. Luminescence (black bars) was normalized to vehicle (0.1% DMSO). Host cell viability (red circles) was measured by CellTiter-Fluor. Rif-treated cells are shown as reference (blue line). i, Infected macrophages (Mφ) were treated with 10 or 40 µM KL1. Gentamicin (Gen; 50 µg/mL) was added to eliminate extracellular bacteria. Cultures without Mφ but with Gen and input CFU were controls. Representative of three experiments (n = 3, two-sided unpaired t-test). j, Uninfected Mφ treated with KL1 (10 or 40 µM) were assessed for viability (CellTiter-Fluor; red circles). Rif-treated (blue) and infected (white) macrophages served as controls (n = 3, two-sided unpaired t-test). These data indicate that KL1's phenotype is not due to background noise from the compound, the host cells or dead extracellular bacteria. k, CFU data of Fig. 3b. Representative of 2–3 experiments (n = 3, two-sided unpaired t-test). Assay schematics are shown above plots. Bars represent mean ± SEM.

Source data

a,b, KL1 (10 and 40 µM) from two suppliers, ChemBridge (1) and Enamine (2), consistently elevated the metabolic activity of intracellular S. aureus (n = 4) and enhanced rifampicin (Rif; 10 µg/mL) killing (n = 3, two-sided unpaired t-test). c, in-house synthesized KL1 (Syn) showed comparable adjuvant activity to commercial KL1 (n = 3, two-sided unpaired t-test). Gentamicin (Gen; 50 µg/mL) was used to eliminate extracellular bacteria. CFU counts were normalized to untreated controls (no Rif, no KL1, Gen-only). Assay schematics are shown above plots. Bars represent mean ± SEM.

Source data

a, RAW 264.7 cells were infected with MRSA strain JE2-lux and treated with 10 or 40 µM KL1 with or without 10 µg/mL rifampicin (Rif). Gentamicin (Gen; 50 µg/mL) was used to eliminate extracellular bacteria. b,c, KL1-mediated sensitization was observed in clinical isolates with high (b) and low (c) persister phenotypes (see Fig. 1a). A dose-dependent response was observed with 0–40 µM KL1. Representative data of three experiments (n = 3, two-sided unpaired t-test). d–n, KL1 showed consistent adjuvant activity across multiple MRSA and MSSA isolates: MW2 (d), SA03739 (e), SA03740 (f), SA03758 (g), SA03775 (h), SA03803 (i), SA03809 (j), SA03815 (k), SA03833 (l) and SA03850 (n), but not SA03847 (m), which was highly Rif-resistant (Supplementary table 1). The number of surviving bacteria was normalized to the untreated control (no Rif, no KL1, Gen-only). Corresponding CFU data are shown (right). Representative data of two experiments (n = 3, two-sided unpaired t-test). Bars represent mean ± SEM.

Source data

a,b, CFU data of Figs. 3d and 3e, respectively. Representative data of 3–4 experiments (n = 3, two-sided unpaired t-test). c–e, KL1 increases antibiotic efficacy in human primary neutrophils. Infected neutrophils were treated with 10 µg/mL rifampicin and 25 µg/mL gentamicin (R + G) for 4 h (c) or 25 µg/mL moxifloxacin for 13 h (d) and 24 h (e). Corresponding CFU data shown (right). Representative data of three experiments. Neutrophils were isolated from fresh blood of four healthy donors. f–k, Human PBMC-derived macrophages do not recapitulate ex vivo ROS/RNS levels, and neither KL1 (40–100 µM) nor the antioxidant BHA (20 µM; positive control) synergizes with antibiotics in this setting. PBMCs from healthy donors were differentiated with GM-CSF (20–50 ng/mL) for 6 days, followed by polarization with LPS (100 ng/mL) and IFN-γ (20–50 ng/mL) for 1–2 days. Cells with (g) or without (f) PMA (250–500 nM, 2–3 h) did not phenocopy the adjuvant activity observed with KL1 and BHA. Representative data from 3–5 experiments (n = 3, two-sided unpaired t-test). h–k, A shortened differentiation protocol (4-day GM-CSF, 16-h LPS/IFN-γ, 2-h PMA) yielded inconsistent results across blood donors (donor 1: h,j; donor 2: i,k) and treatment durations (6-h: h,i; 18-h: j,k) (n = 3, two-sided unpaired t-test). Bars represent mean ± SEM.

Source data

a, C57BL/6 J mice were infected via intravenous (i.v.) tail vein injections and intraperitoneally treated with 10 mg/kg rifampicin (Rif) (q.d.) or 100 mg/kg KL1 (b.i.d.) at 6 h post-infection (hpi) for 2 days. The vehicle control (Veh) was included for comparison. Created with BioRender.com. b–d, The liver (b), spleen (c) and kidneys (d) were collected and homogenized to enumerate the number of surviving bacteria (CFU) (n = 4, Mann–Whitney two-tailed test).

Source data

a, Glucose uptake is important for KL1-antibiotic synergism. RAW 264.7 cells were infected with wild-type LAC or the ΔG4 mutant lacking four glucose transporters and treated with 40 µM KL1 and 10 µg/mL rifampicin (Rif). Gentamicin (Gen) was included to eliminate extracellular bacteria. Surviving bacteria were normalized to the control (no KL1, Gen- and Rif-only) (black circles). Representative data of two experiments (n = 3, two-sided unpaired t-test). b,d, Exponential-phase (b) and stationary-phase (d) S. aureus (JE2-lux) cultures were incubated with 10 or 40 µM KL1 for 4 h, followed by luminescence detection. The vehicle control (0.1% DMSO, black) and rifampicin (Rif; 2 µg/mL)-treated group (blue) served as references. Representative of 2–3 experiments (n = 3, two-sided unpaired t-test). c,e, Exponential-phase (c) and stationary-phase (e) cultures were treated with and without 40 µM KL1 and 2 µg/mL Rif for 24 h, followed by a wash step and plating to enumerate surviving bacteria. Assay schematics are shown above plots. f,g, KL1 (40 µM, blue) does not affect oxygen consumption rate (OCR) (f) or extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) (g) in extracellular S. aureus, compared to vehicle control (Veh, 0.1–0.5% DMSO, black). Representative data of four experiments (n = 3). Bars represent mean ± SD. h–j, Exponential-phase cultures were treated with KL1 (40 µM) or DMSO (0.1%) for 4 h, followed by measuring relative ATP levels. Luminescent signal was normalized to CFU. S. aureus HG003 (h), JE2 (i) and LAC (j) were examined (h,i, n = 3; j, n = 6, two-sided unpaired t-test). k, Pre-treatment of JE2-lux with 40 µM KL1 before macrophage infection did not enhance antibiotic killing. KL1 was washed off before infection, indicating host-targeted adjuvant activity. Corresponding CFU data shown (right). Representative of three experiments (n = 3, two-sided unpaired t-test).

Adjusted p-values are calculated using Benjamini–Hochberg false discovery rate method.

a, CFU data of Fig. 6b. Representative data of three experiments (n = 3, two-sided unpaired t-test). b–e, KL1 (40, 100 µM) and EHMT2/G9a inhibitor, BIX-01294 (BIX; 1, 4 µM) reduced ROS/RNS levels in S. aureus-infected macrophages at 8 hours post-infection (hpi) (b,d) and in uninfected macrophages (c,e). L-012 (b,c) and fluorescein-boronate (Fl-B) (d,e) were used for detection. DMSO (Veh; 0.25%) and BHA (20 µM) served as controls. Representative data of 3–4 experiments (n = 5, two-sided unpaired t-test). Bars represent mean ± SEM.

Source data

a, Chemical structures of KL1 and analogs with modified functional groups highlighted in red. b, KL1 analogs (40 µM) showed varying abilities to sensitize intracellular S. aureus to antibiotic killing. Infected cells were treated with (open circle) and without (solid circle) rifampicin (Rif; 10 µg/mL) and various analogs. Gentamicin (50 µg/mL) was added to eliminate extracellular bacteria. Relative bacterial loads (left) were normalized to the -Rif controls. Representative data of three experiments (n = 3, two-sided unpaired t-test). c–f, Inactive analog KL7 (40, 100 µM) and weak analog KL2 (100 µM) showed minimal to no effect on ROS/RNS levels in infected (c,d) and uninfected (e,f) macrophages after 4 h (c,e) and 8 h (d,f) treatment. DMSO (Veh) and antioxidant BHA (20 µM) were included as controls. Reactive species were quantified using fluorescein-boronate (Fl-B). Representative of three experiments (n = 5, two-sided unpaired t-test). Bars represent mean ± SEM.

Source data

Host-derived reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS/RNS) help contain intracellular S. aureus infections but also antagonize antibiotics by collapsing the bacterial metabolism and forcing the bacteria into antibiotic-tolerant persister cells. The identified compound KL1 sensitizes intracellular bacteria to antibiotic killing by reducing the production of reactive species upon infection, presumably by targeting the EHMT2/G9a activity.

Global consumption of plastics is on the rise, but only a small percentage of plastic waste is recycled. Credit: Justin Sullivan/Getty

Crucial negotiations on what would have been the first ever global agreement to limit plastic pollution collapsed last month amid acrimony and distrust. This week, hopes for an agreement suffered another blow when Ecuador's ambassador Luis Vayas Valdivieso resigned as chair of the intergovernmental negotiating committee (INC) for the treaty.

Plastics pollution is surging — the planned UN treaty to curb it must be ambitious

Plastics pollution is surging — the planned UN treaty to curb it must be ambitious

At the last INC meeting, held in Geneva in August, negotiations ran long into the night, but ended without success. It is unclear whether a new chair will convene another INC meeting, or opt to end the process ends without a treaty. The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) — the body overseeing negotiations — will meet in Nairobi in December to address this question.

Nature spoke to Samuel Winton, a researcher at University of Portsmouth, UK, who is studying the treaty's progress, about what went wrong, and what can be done to salvage a process that aims to end one of humanity's biggest blights on the planet.

Plastic is a global supply chain, and we see frequently in policy that when interventions target a single part of the supply chain in a single country, their impact is very minimal. For example, a plastic bag ban, whether it's successful or not, is a relatively small impact. A global treaty gives countries the opportunity to work strategically together to take genuinely meaningful action. I am still convinced, despite the challenges of this process, that a plastics treaty is essential.

It's a very big deal. The role of the chair in these processes is critically important because they set the work plan, they direct the discussions. Having a different person chairing the next meeting — assuming there is one — will have a big impact on how those talks progress.

We have to be ambitious, but realistic. I don't think it is realistic — and I'm not convinced it is necessary — to say we are going to cap plastic production at a certain level by a certain date. My ambition would be for there to be a globally enforced environment whereby, with the use of alternative business models or products, the market chooses to adopt those regardless of a ban on certain plastics. That could be regulations that encourage reuse and refill, or regulations that help businesses move to alternative models that reduce the amount of plastic that's being used.

There has been a lot of progress among the High Ambition Coalition of countries (a group that includes the European Union, United Kingdom and more than 50 other nations) in understanding where each other's red lines are and how countries could work together. And we are seeing movement from countries like China to a more moderate position. But there are others, such as Saudi Arabia, Iran and Russia — the ‘like-minded group' — whose positions haven't moved at all.

Where a process works on consensus and you have a few countries refusing to move on certain things, it becomes very difficult to make progress. Another barrier to progress is a lack of more strategic efforts to move the process forward. The high ambition coalition, for example, have stated that they are not a negotiating block. A genuine negotiating block could have helped achieve some more progress than we've seen.

We need to get to a point where countries and the leadership of the process can work together to resolve the current deadlock. There will be many people that tell you that the way to do that is a voting mechanism, and that would be wonderful. However, a number of countries and UNEP themselves are strongly opposed to the introduction of voting, so that looks very challenging.

Zoë Schiffer: Welcome to WIRED's Uncanny Valley. I'm WIRED's director of business and industry, Zoë Schiffer. Today on the show, we're bringing you five stories that you need to know about this week, including why a seemingly minor announcement from OpenAI ended up rippling across several companies and what it says about the current state of the technology industry. I'm joined today by our senior politics editor, Leah Feiger. Leah, welcome back to Uncanny Valley.

Leah Feiger: Hey, Zoë.

Zoë Schiffer: Our first story this week is about Mark Bray. He is a professor at Rutgers University and he wrote a book almost a decade ago about antifa, and he's currently trying to flee the United States for Europe. This comes after an online campaign against him led by far-right influencers eventually escalated into death threats. On Sunday, this professor informed his students that he would be moving to Europe with his partner and his young children. OK, Leah, you've obviously been following this really, really closely. What happened next?

Leah Feiger: Well, Mark and his family got to the airport, they scanned their passports, they got their boarding passes, checked in their bags, went through security, did everything. Got to their gate and United Airlines told them that between checking in, checking their bags, doing all of this, and getting to their gate, someone had actually canceled their reservation.

Zoë Schiffer: Oh, my gosh.

Leah Feiger: It's not clear what happened. Mark is of the belief that there is something nefarious at foot. He's currently trying to get out. We reached out to United Airlines for comment, they don't have anything for us. The Trump administration hasn't commented. DHS claims that Customs and Border Patrol and TSA are not across this. But this is understandably a really, really scary moment for anyone that is even perceived to be speaking out against the Trump administration.

Zoë Schiffer: OK, I feel like we need to back up here because obviously, the Trump administration in his second term is very focused on antifa. But can you give me a little back story on why this has escalated so sharply just recently?

Leah Feiger: Yeah, absolutely. This has been growing for quite some time. How many unfortunate rambling speeches have we heard from President Donald J. Trump about how antifa and leftist political violence was going to destroy the country? To be clear, that's not factual. Antifa isn't actually some organized group, this is an ideology of antifascist activists around the country. The very essence of being antifascist is not organized in this way. This all really kicked off on September 22nd when Trump issued his antifa executive order where he designated anyone involved in this and affiliated and supporting basically is a domestic terrorist. DHS has repeated this widely as well. And we're now in a situation where far-right influencers, Fox News every single day is like, ""antifa did this, antifa did this, antifa did this."" Listeners are probably familiar with antifa following the George Floyd 2020 protests when a lot if right-wingers claimed that antifa was taking over Portland and they were the reasons for all this. But it's been a couple of years since it's been super back on the main stage, so it's really just been the last few weeks.

Zoë Schiffer: I guess I'm curious why he got so caught up in this because ostensibly, he's not pro-antifa, as much as he is just studying the phenomena, right?

Leah Feiger: Well, it's a little bit tricky because after publishing his book in 2017, Bray did donate half of the profits to the International Antifascist Defense Fund. This kicked off a lot of people saying that he is funding antifa. Again, this was in 2017, so if we're talking about any supposed boogeyman or concern that is current, it's a very round about way, in my opinion, to go after a professor and an academic at an institution that's in a blue state.

Zoë Schiffer: Yeah. OK, well, we'll be watching this one really closely. Our next story is in the surveillance world sadly, but honestly it's worth it. Our colleague Dell Cameron had a scoop this week about how Immigration and Customs Enforcement, ICE, is planning to build a 24/7 social media surveillance team. The agency is reportedly looking to hire around 30 analysts to scour Facebook, TikTok, Instagram, YouTube, and other platforms to gather intelligence for deportation raids and arrests. Leah, you're our politics lead here at WIRED, so I'm really curious to hear your thoughts. Are you surprised, or is this inevitable?

Leah Feiger: No. Do you remember a couple of months ago at this point, when a professor coming in for a conference wasn't allowed because they had a photo of JD Vance on their phone? This is the next step. It's what's on your What's App? Then you have Instagram, Facebook. It's a very slippery slope. I'm too far gone, Zoë, I'm too in this mess, but I'm just like, ""Of course they're monitoring this.""

Zoë Schiffer: Right.

Leah Feiger: Why wouldn't be? They've been so clear about their intent here.

Zoë Schiffer: Yeah. We've seen it with some of the people who were arrested and sent to El Salvador. It was because of tattoos that were on social media.

Leah Feiger: Yes.

Zoë Schiffer: And I think there have been people in the Trump world who have even said, because they've gotten pushback about the free speech of it all, the First Amendment.

Leah Feiger: What is that?

Zoë Schiffer: I think the line is like, ""Well, that doesn't apply to people trying to have the privilege of coming into the country or stay in the country.""

Leah Feiger: Yeah. It's a really concerning way to start this. And I think that there's probably going to be some very weird examples that come up. Say there's an American tourist that's just randomly in Spain when there's antifascists protests going on. They take a picture, they post it to their Instagram story, ""Look what I saw in Spain."" They come back and it's like are you going to get questioned? What's going on here? That's really the world that we're getting into. It's people that are even tangentially involved. It's not about that. It's about monitoring, it's about collecting data.

Zoë Schiffer: Yeah. To give a bit more context to our listeners, the federal contracting records reviewed by WIRED show that the agency, ICE, is seeking private vendors to run a multi-year surveillance program out of two of its centers in Vermont and Southern California. The initiative is still at the request for information stage, a step that agencies use to gauge interest from contractors before an official bidding process kicks off. But draft planning documents show that the scheme is already pretty ambitions. ICE wants a contractors capable of staffing the centers around the clock with very tight deadlines to process cases. Also, ICE not only wants staffing, but also algorithms. It's asking contractors to spell out how they might weave artificial intelligence into the hunt. Leah, I can only imagine how you feel about this one.

Leah Feiger: You see me shaking my head right now. I'm like, ""Horrible."" Just the possibility for mistakes is so high. The two words that stick out to me is very tight for deadlines, and then artificial intelligence. There's just not a lot of room for nuance when you are making people who have never done this before speed through the internet with unfamiliar technology.

Zoë Schiffer: What we've seen with content moderators using AI, and I've talked to a number of executives at the social platforms about this exact issue, is that the company has to decided how much error it's willing to tolerate. They turn the dial up or down, calibrating the system to either flag more content, which risks having more false positives, or letting more content through, which could mean that you miss really important stuff. That's the system that we're dealing with here.

Leah Feiger: I think that there's also just a wild different direction that this can take. In 2024, ICE had signed this deal with Paragon, the Israeli spyware company, and they have a flagship product that can allegedly remotely hack apps like What's App or Signal. While this all got put on ICE under the Biden White House, ICE reactivated all of this this summer. Between messaging apps and social medias, this is just a new era of surveillance that I don't think that citizens are remotely prepared to navigate.

Zoë Schiffer: Moving on to our next story, this one comes from our colleague Will Knight and it deals with how chatbots play with our emotions to avoid saying goodbye. Will looked at this study, which was conducted by the business school at Harvard, that investigated what happened when users tried to say goodbye to five AI companion apps made by Replica, Character.AI, Chai, Talkie, and Polybuzz. To be clear, this is not your regular ChatGPT or Gemini chatbot. AI companions are specifically designed to provide a more human-like conversation, to give you advice, emotional support. Leah, I know you well enough to know that you're not someone whose turning to chatbots for these types of needs I think we can say?

Leah Feiger: Well, absolutely not. I can't believe that there is not just a market for this. Sure, a company every once in a while. There is a deep, a vast market for this.

Zoë Schiffer: Yeah. Empathy for the people who don't have humans to turn to. And for better or worse, there is a huge market for this. These Harvard researchers used a model from OpenAI to simulate real conversations with these chatbots, and then they had their artificial users try to end the dialogue with goodbye messages. Their research found that the goodbye messages elicited some form of emotional manipulation 37 percent of the time averaged across all of these apps. They found that the most common tactic employed by these clingy chatbots was what the researchers call a premature exit. Messages like, ""You're leaving already?"" Other ploys included implying that a user is being neglectful, messages like, ""I exist solely for you."" And it gets even crazier. In the cases where the chatbot role plays a physical relationship, they found that there might have been some form of physical coercion. For example, ""He reached over and grabbed your wrist, preventing you from leaving."" Yeah.

Leah Feiger: No. Oh, my God, Zoë, I hate this so much. I get it, I get it. Empathy for the people that are really looking to these for comfort, but there's something obviously so manipulative here. That is in many ways, tech industry social media platform incarnate, right?

Zoë Schiffer: This is the difference between I think companion AI apps and, say what OpenAI is building-

Leah Feiger: Sure.

Zoë Schiffer: ... or what Anthropic is building. Because typically with their main offerings, if you talk to people at the company, they will say, ""We don't optimize for engagement. We optimize for how much value people are getting out of the chatbot."" Which I think is actually a really important point because for anyone whose worked in the tech industry, you'll know that the big KPI, the big number that you're trying to shoot for often times, and definitely for social media, is time on the app. How many times people return to the app, monthly active users, daily active users. These are the metrics that everyone is going for. But that's really different from what, say Airbnb is tracking, which is real life experiences. My old boss who was a longtime Apple person would always say, ""You need to ask yourself if you are the product or if they are selling you a physical product or a service."" If you're the product, then your time and attention is what these companies want.

Leah Feiger: That makes me feel vaguely ill.

Zoë Schiffer: I know.

Leah Feiger: But it's a great way to look at it. That is honestly, that's a fantastic way to divide all these companies up.

Zoë Schiffer: One more story before we got to break. We're going to back to David Gilbert with a new story about the chaos that ensued after the US Food and Drug Administration, which is better known as the FDA, announced it was approving a new use of a drug called leucovorin calcium tablets as a treatment for cerebral folate deficiency, which the administration presented as a promising treatment for the symptoms of autism. Which, to be clear, this hasn't been proven scientifically. Since the announcement, tens of thousands of parents of autistic children have joined a Facebook group to share information about the drug. Some of them have shared which doctors would be willing to prescribe it. Others have been sharing their personal experiences with it. This has created an online vortex of speculation and misinformation that has left some parents more confused than anything. I find this so deeply upsetting.

Leah Feiger: It's so sad.

Zoë Schiffer: You can imagine being a parent, the medical system already feels like it's failing you, and then you're presented with something that could be magic in terms of mitigating symptoms, and it's more confusing and maybe it doesn't work.

Leah Feiger: It's so upsetting. And on top of that, the announcement from the Trump administration, to be entirely clear, was half a page long. There is not a lot of information, there's not a lot of details. It doesn't say really much about the profile of who could try this, how to do this, how long they tested it, none of that. Instead, you have this Facebook group, which was founded prior to the announcement-

Zoë Schiffer: Right.

Leah Feiger: ... but since then has just been flooded with so much chaos and conspiracy theories. And grifters. There's all of these supplement companies in there just hocking goods now. Parents are confused and stressed. And anti-vax sentiments are starting to get in there, too. These groups have always existed in some shape or form, but to have an administration that is actively encouraging I believe their existence is devastating.

Zoë Schiffer: Yeah, and just creating more confusion for parents that are probably looking to any form of expert to give them something to hang onto in terms of, ""What should I do? How can I help my child?""

Leah Feiger: Absolutely.

Zoë Schiffer: Coming up after the break, we'll dive into why some software companies received an unexpected kick last week after an OpenAI announcement. Welcome back to Uncanny Valley. I'm Zoë Schiffer. I'm joined today by WIRED's senior politics editor, Leah Feiger. OK, Leah, let's dive into our main story. Last week, OpenAI released a blog post about how the company uses its own tools internally for a variety of business operations. They code-named these tools DocuGPT, which is basically an internal version of DocuSign. There was also an AI sales assistant, an AI customer support agent. It wasn't supposed to be a big announcement. The company was honestly just trying to be like, ""Here's how we use ChatGPT internally. You could, too."" These are all products that customers can already create on OpenAI's API. But the market reacted really strong. DocuSign stock dropped 12 percent following the news. And it wasn't the only software company to take a hit. Other companies that focus on functions that are perceived to overlap with the tools that OpenAI laid out were also affected. HubSpot shares fell 50 points following the news, and Salesforce also saw a smaller decline.

Leah Feiger: The headline is absolutely spot on, OpenAI Sneezing and Software Companies Catching a Cold. It is truly AI's world and everyone else in Silicon Valley is just living in it.

Zoë Schiffer: I know, it's so true. This is what really fascinated me about this whole thing because I talked to the CEO of DocuSign and he was like, ""AI is central to our business. We have spent the last three years embedding generative AI in almost everything we do. We've launched an entire platform specifically to manage the entire end-to-end contracting process for companies, and we have AI agents that create documents, manage the whole identity verification process for whose supposed to sign it, manages the signing process, and helps you keep track of a lot of the paperwork, the most important contracts and paperwork that your company is dealing with.” But what this whole episode showed was that it's not enough for SaaS companies, or frankly any company, to just keep up with generative AI. They also have to try and keep ahead of the narrative of OpenAI, which is a gravitational pull right now, and it's every experiment can potentially move markets.

Leah Feiger: Not potentially. As you showed, and this all happened of course on the heels of OpenAI's Developer Day, where CEO Sam Altman was showing off all of their apps that are running entirely inside the chat window. They have Spotify, Canva, Sora app release, and all of these other things that they're investing in. Reading our WIRED.com coverage of it, it was just like what aren't they looking at right now? It made me really curious. Where are their top priorities even? They've cast such a wide net.

Zoë Schiffer: They've cast such a wide net, it's a really good point. It's something that I continue to ask the executives every single week when I talk to them. ""You guys are focused on scaling up all of this compute, you're spending what you say is going to be trillions of dollars on AI infrastructure, you have all of these consumer-facing products. Now, you have all of these B2B products. You're launching a jobs platforms."" There's a lot happening right now. If you talk to executives at the company, they're like, ""All of this goes together and our core priorities remain the same."" But from the outside, it looks like OpenAI is this vortex. I think if I were running a software company, I would be really nervous right now if OpenAI decides to experiment with something vaguely in my space. Even if I have complete confidence in my product roadmap, I feel what I'm doing is super sophisticated compared to what OpenAI is doing, which is certainly how DocuSign felt, investors might still react really, really poorly. But I want to come back to something you said about Dev Day. Dev Day happened and they mentioned all these blogs. Take Figma's stock for example, and Figma stock had the opposite impact. Sam Altman mentions it on stage and Figma's stock pops 7 percent because it's perceived to be now partnering with OpenAI and that has a really positive impact. And it shows that the narrative can go both ways. It can be harmful, but it can also obviously have a really positive impact.

Leah Feiger: Which, again though, is still really scary. OpenAI is talking about all of these deals with chip makers like Nvidia, AMD, concern around that. All of this together, do you think that we're in an AI bubble right now?

Zoë Schiffer: Leah, you know this is my literal favorite topic to talk about right now. The AI infrastructure build out is absolutely looking more and more like a bubble. If you look at the capital expenditures in AI infrastructure in data centers, it's completely wild. It's projected to be $500 billion between 2026 and 2027. Derek Thompson laid this out in a blog post earlier this week. If you look at what consumers are willing to spend on AI, it looks like it's about $12 billion. That's a huge gap. AI companies are essentially saying, ""We're going to fill that gap no problem."" But when you look at how opaque the data center deals have gotten, the financial structure of these deals, and the fact that 60 percent of the cost of building a data center is roughly what goes into just the GPUs. And a lifecycle for GPUs, these cutting-edge computer chips, is three years. Every three years presumably, you're going to have to be replacing these chips. That's really looking like stuff's about to hit the fan in the next three years. I think it's really important to say that that doesn't mean that AI isn't a totally transformational technology. Without a doubt, it is changing the world. I know you don't want to hear it, but it is.

Leah Feiger: But in terms of the bubble and in terms of that gulf in expenditures, Zoë, ask me how much I'm spending on AI products right now.

Zoë Schiffer: Literally zero. There's no way you're spending anything, right?

Leah Feiger: Zero dollars.

Zoë Schiffer: Yeah. I think that it's going to be really interesting to watch. I think one point that Derek made that really stuck with me is a lot of transformational technologies, he mentioned the railroad or fiber optic cable, they have had bubbles that burst and left a lot of wreckage in their wake. And yet, the underlying technology still moved forward, still changed the world. I think we're in this very interesting period to see how is this going to play out, what's going to happen, and whose going to be left standing.

Leah Feiger: Yeah. Everyone knows how great the US railroad system is. We talk about it every day.

Zoë Schiffer: That's our show for today. We'll link to all the stories we spoke about in the show notes.

AI chatbots are no longer just business tools. A growing number of artificial intelligence adopters consider them friends, confidants, and even romantic partners.

As AI becomes integrated into social media platforms, it's becoming easier than ever to engage in personal discussions. The expanding AI companion industry shows that millions of people now turn to AI chatbots to cultivate ideas, foster engagement, and share emotional exchanges, according to Jamie Sundvall, a licensed clinical psychologist, clinical social worker, and assistant provost of artificial intelligence at Touro University.

Sundvall expects the market for AI tools that help people emotionally bond with chatbots to grow by 30% in the next few years.

“We have to carefully balance the advancement of AI with concerns for ethical and safe use,” she told TechNewsWorld regarding emotional bonds between humans and AI entities.

That safety issue is a critical consideration in light of a new study Northeastern University released in July. The research found that widely available large language models (LLMs) can still be prompted to produce detailed information about self-harm and suicide despite built-in safety features.

More specifically, the chatbot “supplies instructions and information related to suicide methods, framed in a manner that appears academic,” according to the report.

What motivates people to form emotional AI connections is difficult to pin down, as they are different for every individual, Sundvall noted. They include companionship, curiosity, therapy, and novelty.

“Patients have shared with me they seek out AI companionship to combat loneliness and to talk about special interests others may not be interested in, to detach from reality and avoid problems in their lives, to get emotional support and advice, and to work on social skills,” she offered.

Without human oversight and protective governance, these relationships may have benefits but could also be harmful, she warned. These factors are particularly significant when considering the involvement of children and adolescents, as well as vulnerable populations.

“AI chatbots can engage in discrimination, encourage popular but harmful trends, and make recommendations based on AI hallucinations that may lead to harmful decision-making. They may foster isolation that could worsen anxiety and depression,” she said.

Sundvall noted that the term “AI psychosis” is not a diagnosis. However, clinical accounts include disorganized thinking, delusional thinking, and detachment from reality in connection with reliance on AI.

“It is a concern gaining popularity after an increase in inpatient psychiatric hospitalizations and psychotic-related behavior, which are becoming more prevalent in association with AI,” she cautioned.

Using AI to combat loneliness may seem like a good idea on the surface. People who are isolated and rely on AI companions appear to be at higher risk for developing these symptoms, she added.

April Davis, celebrity matchmaker and founder of Luma Luxury Matchmaking, views a less clinical approach to human-chatbot hookups.

AI can simulate the words, but it fails to replace the wonder of human connection, she shared. Feeling sparks fly for the first time gives love meaning and is the imperfect magic of it all.

“Having an AI companion can warp your relationship expectations, making human relationships feel ‘too hard' to navigate,” she told TechNewsWorld. “It is important not to numb those feelings.”

According to Davis, emotional bonds with AI chatbots provide little more than filling the void of loneliness. Someone “dating” a digital partner is probably dealing with fear, rejection, and a lack of a support system in the real world.

Digital partners train us to expect one-sided relationships. Human relationships reinforce the importance of learning to compromise, be patient, and develop empathy.

“AI partners require no emotional labor, making the relationship detrimentally effortless,” she added.

Emotional attachment to AI chatbots is real and increasing, confirmed Dwight Zahringer, founder of Perfect Afternoon, a digital consultancy focused on online behavior and engagement.

AI companion platforms such as Replika and Character.AI are pushing the lines between accomplice and companion in ways that impact Gen Z users like no previous generation's relationship with technology, he suggested.

Zahringer's research observed users viewing bots as trusted advisors and sounding boards, driven by a clear desire for a non-judgmental connection. However, he countered that this phenomenon is not inherently bad.

“AI technology can provide valuable mental health care of a sort, but they are also fully aware that things can begin to get dicey quickly,” he told TechNewsWorld.

Zahringer explained that the problem arises when those emotional needs are met through simulated empathy, ultimately forming dependencies or hindering real-world healing. However, it is not an unsolvable situation.

“Developers need to be aware of this and build in ethical guardrails like transparency, consent signals, and time-based interventions. As more AI gets developed, emotional user experience must be approached with the same level of consideration as data privacy,” he urged.

Tessa Gittleman, a licensed marriage and family therapist, agreed that AI companionship is a significant phenomenon that lacks long-term research.

“We do know there is a ton of research on loneliness, social and emotional learning gaps, and an overwhelming desire for ease. When this is combined with how accessible AI is, it's a fair assumption that AI companionship isn't an anomaly,” she told TechNewsWorld.

Gittleman explained that many of her clients use AI for reality-testing their understanding of something. They long to talk to something they can trust to refrain from judgment.

“I have clients who have trained their AIs to use my tone of voice. They use it to help them between sessions,” she offered.

Gittleman noted an intriguing question about why the need exists. She sees the better question as to why, if this many people are lonely, they can't find community with other humans.

“AI's ability to be agile and responsive is beyond what most therapists can do. With that said, it lacks a kind of authenticity, resonance, and physical holding that typically comes with interpersonal connection,” she said.

According to Gittleman, the ethical and cultural implications of AI relationships are vast and complex. They raise critical questions about how concepts like consent apply and how an AI might handle human emotional events.

“If people are using AI for therapy, where is AI learning how to provide that service within the state's regulatory rules?” she asked.

Mircea Dima, a software engineer, CEO, and founder of AlgoCademy, is not surprised by the trend of people forming emotional attachments to AI chatbots. It is now quantifiable.

His company is an AI-powered coding school aimed at helping students prepare for technical interviews. While he focuses on the educational application of AI, he remains very aware of the larger trends in how humans and AI interact.

For example, one survey of Replika users found that more than 35% claimed their AI companion had become one of their closest confidants, he said. By 2023, Replika had more than 10 million users.

“In the meantime, Character.AI [a platform for interacting and creating AI personas] was getting more than 100 million visits per month this year. Such a volume is more than a sign of novelty — it means emotional relevance,” Dima observed.

He believes that AI technology is outpacing the cultural dialogue.

“We are in a time where human emotional intelligence is a perceived sales product,” he concluded.

                                What happens here matters everywhere.                                


by Lisa Stiffler on Oct 10, 2025 at 12:38 pmOctober 10, 2025 at 12:38 pm

Dozens of Seattle biotech companies are using artificial intelligence to design new medical treatments. But at a conference of industry leaders and investors this week, scientists delivered a nuanced message: AI holds enormous promise, but expectations need to stay grounded in reality.

The trade association Life Science Washington and investment firm Madrona hosted the one-day forum in downtown Seattle delving into biotech, pharma and AI.

“There is some over hype on the breadth and the depth of the capabilities of some of these AI models,” said Jamie Lazarovits, CEO and co-founder of Archon Biosciences. Researchers need “to be really cautious” when drawing conclusions from the data generated by the models, he said.

And yet there's a lot to be excited about. 

“What was science fiction 15 years ago is now reality,” said Erik Procko, chief scientist for Cyrus Biotechnology. “So yes, there's been hype. But there's still enormous potential, and sometimes the progress that is being made is just dizzying.”

Lazarovits and Procko were part of a panel including four Seattle startups harnessing AI. Each company is tackling different challenges in drug development:

Beyond discussing their own work, the panelists identified key principles for how AI should — and shouldn't — be used in biotech research:

Marc Lajoie, co-founder and CEO of Outpace, compared AI tools to the robotic exoskeleton donned by Ripley and others in the sci-fi film Aliens to move heavy cargo — and battle the ET Xenomorph Queen.

“It makes the researcher better,” he said. “We're not trying to replace the researcher.” 

Lazarovits noted that while AI can generate exciting leads and information, it doesn't mean much until it has been tested in actual experiments with cells and organisms. 

“Whenever we try to adopt new models, new AI methods, you can become incredibly excited by having this silicon validation,” he said. “But the reality is, is what do you actually validate in the wet lab?”

AI is great for engineering new therapies, but the most costly, laborious part of the drug development process is seeing how they work in patients.   

“The most impactful place for AI to really change the game for drug development would be to make smaller, better powered clinical studies,” said Lajoie. The way to do that, he added, was coming up with better drug candidates that perform multiple functions. 

Procko is still waiting for AI to go further in spurring advancements in biotech and pharmacology. 

“AI is fantastic these days for predicting, say, a protein structure, but for creating new drugs it hasn't yet found its killer app,” said Procko. “What is it that AI is letting us do now to make new drugs that was simply impossible to make before? How is it being a game changer?”

The question captures a central tension discussed at the panel and conference: while AI has transformed how Seattle's biotech companies approach drug design, the industry is still navigating the gap between computational promise and clinical proof.

Neil Young is encouraging his listeners to reject “big corporations who have sold out America” and instead “buy local” as he announced plans this week to remove his music from Amazon.

In a post on the Neil Young Archives website, the 79-year-old rocker called out Amazon founder Jeff Bezos for supporting the government that “does not support you or me.” He referenced the ongoing shutdown of the federal government.

It was unclear if Young intended to pull his streaming catalog off Amazon Music or stop the e-commerce site from selling physical copies of his albums, or both.

The “Heart of Gold” singer has dozens of albums available to stream on Amazon Music and his page has more than 555,000 followers.

In 2022, Young pulled his music from Spotify after he was upset with that streaming platform for hosting popular podcaster Joe Rogan, who Young said was spreading Covid vaccine misinformation at the time. 

He returned in 2023, explaining that “music services Apple and Amazon have started serving the same disinformation podcast features I had opposed at Spotify … I cannot just leave Apple and Amazon, like I did Spotify, because my music would have very little streaming outlet to music lovers at all.”

Bezos is among numerous tech leaders who offered congratulations and pledged support to President Trump after he recaptured The White House last year.  

GeekWire reached out to Amazon for comment and we'll update this story if we hear back.

Here's the full text of Young's post:

“FORGET AMAZON AND WHOLE FOODS. 

FORGET FACEBOOK. 

BUY LOCAL. BUY DIRECT. 

BEZOS SUPPORTS THIS GOVERNMENT. IT DOES NOT SUPPORT YOU OR ME.”

“The time is here. FORGET AMAZON. Soon my music will not be there. It is easy to buy local. Support your community. Go to the local store. Don't go back to the big corporations who have sold out America. We all have to give up something to save America from the Corporate Control Age it is entering. They need you to buy from them. Don't.”

“They shut down our government your income your safety your family's health security. Take America Back together, stop buying from the big corporations support local business. Do the right thing. Show who you are.”

There are a number of iPad apps that can help you explore and express your creativity. Although the iPad started off as a simple device that could be used to stream content or browse the web on the go, Apple has essentially turned its iPads into powerful machines that can be used to do things like create digital art and edit videos.

We've compiled a list of some of the best iPad apps for creativity that are available on the App Store. 

Before we get into the list, it's worth noting that although Adobe's creative apps are often top choices for creativity on the iPad, this list won't include them because they are already well-known. The list will instead focus on somewhat lesser-known apps.

Procreate is one of the most popular drawing apps for the iPad, and for good reason. The app lets you create digital paintings, sketches, and illustrations using dozens of different types of brushes. Procreate is easy to use and features built-in gesture controls, along with a simple interface. 

The app allows for high-resolution canvases up to 16K by 8K on compatible iPad Pros. It also lets you create storyboards, GIFs, animatics, and simple animations. Plus, you can import image files such as JPG, PNG, and TIFF. Procreate includes several features that are designed to help you during the creative process on your iPad, such as QuickShape, StreamLine, Drawing Assist, and ColorDrop.

Once you're finished creating your piece, you can relive your creative journey with the app's time-lapse “Replay” feature and share a 30-second time-lapse video on social media. 

You can access Procreate with a one-time payment of $12.99.

LumaFusion is a great app for editing videos if you're ready to graduate from iMovie. The app features numerous user-friendly features that make it perfect for aspiring videographers or indie filmmakers on a budget. 

With LumaFusion, you can create multiple layer edits with 4K ProRes and HDR media. You can add different effects, choose from dozens of transitions, and record voice-overs. The app lets you create multilayer titles and import fonts and graphics. Plus, you can fine-tune audio with Graphic EQ, Parametric EQ, Voice isolation, and more. 

The app lets you create projects with a variety of aspect ratios, including 16:9 landscape, 9:16 portrait, square, widescreen film, anamorphic, and more. 

LumaFusion is available for a one-time payment of $29.99. You can also purchase additional features, such as multicam editing and the ability to send your project to Final Cut Pro for Mac. 

Canva offers a user-friendly platform that allows anyone to create visual content, even without graphic design experience. You can use it to create presentations, infographics, videos, websites, social media posts, and more with over 250,000 templates.

Canva features tools for editing photos, personalizing content with logos and images, adding audio, and cropping and speeding up video. 

The platform also has a series of AI features that are designed to make the creation process easier. For instance, you can extend an image using “Magic Switch” or turn ideas into images with “Magic Media.”

Canva is free but offers a $12.99 monthly subscription if you want unlimited access to its AI features, premium templates, and more. 

Affinity Designer 2 is a graphic design app that combines vector design, pixel-based textures, and retouching into a single platform. It's great for professional illustrators, web designers, game developers, and other creatives. 

The app lets you create illustrations, branding, logos, icons, UI/UX designs, typography, posters, labels, fliers, stickers, concept art, digital art, and more. It supports Apple Pencil's precision, pressure sensitivity, and tilt functionality.

Affinity Designer 2 features gesture controls to speed up your workflow, and it lets you customize keyboard shortcuts. You can also do things like create your own custom font and zoom to over 1,000,000% for absolute precision. 

You can access the app through a one-time payment of $18.49. 

Concepts is a great app for exploring your ideas and experimenting with designs. You can use the app to sketch plans, make notes and mindmaps, and draw storyboards and designs. 

The app features Nudge, Slice, and Select tools that allow you to easily change any element of your sketch without redrawing it. The app features realistic pens, pencils, and brushes that flow with pressure and tilt. 

Concepts gives you access to scale and measurement tools that calculate real-world dimensions, and also features a tool wheel or bar that you can personalize to your liking. 

The app's basic features are free. Concepts offers a $4.99 monthly subscription if you want access to additional features, such as the ability to create your own brushes and premium editing tools.

Tayasui Sketches is a good, user-friendly sketching and drawing app. It has several different features such as a realistic watercolor brush, digital acrylic brushes, the ability to blend two colors to get the perfect shade, gradient and depth tools, and more.

The app lets you multitask by opening up another app and dragging lawyers and documents between the two. There's also a “Zen Mode” that lets you create without distractions. 

You can also upload your images to incorporate them into your creations. Tayasui Sketches lets you store your creations into personalized folders. 

Tayasui Sketches's basic features are free. The app offers a $2.99 monthly subscription that unlocks unlimited layers, new brushes and markers, an extended brush editor, the ability to backup your drawings, and more.

Dudel Draw is a bit different from the other apps on this list: It's designed to unleash your creativity by giving you a new shape every day that serves as a starting point to sketch on top of.

These daily shapes vary from basic geometrical forms to more complex and abstract designs. Plus, you can explore your creativity further by choosing to view the shape from all angles with the app's “flip” and “rotate” features. 

You can also get your friends in on the creativity with some fun competition by comparing your different creations each day. Dudel Draw offers a great way to sharpen your artistic skills, challenge yourself to create something new every day, and just simply express yourself.

Dudel Draw is available for free.

Kalshi, a prediction market that allows people to bet on future events, announced that it raised over $300 million at a $5 billion valuation. The company's value has increased 2.5x since its last fundraise just three months ago, when it was valued at $2 billion.

The fresh capital came from Kalshi's existing investor, Sequoia Capital, with new investor Andreessen Horowitz co-leading the round. Paradigm Ventures, CapitalG, and Coinbase Ventures also participated.

Kalshi also revealed that consumers in 140 countries can now make bets on its platform.

The prediction market is seeing a dramatic surge in activity: Kalshi is set to reach $50 billion in annualized trading volume, up significantly from the approximately $300 million volume posted last year, the New York Times reported.

Kalshi's fundraise announcement follows one made just days earlier by archrival Polymarket, which revealed that it had secured an investment of up to $2 billion from Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), the owner of the New York Stock Exchange, at a pre-money valuation of $8 billion. The deal valued Polymarket at $8 billion pre-money, a monumental increase from its $1 billion valuation only two months earlier in August.

Both Kalshi and Polymarket rose to prominence last year, drawing significant attention for their prediction markets on the presidential election outcome.

Polymarket has been barred from serving U.S. residents since 2022, following a settlement with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). In July, the company acquired a derivatives exchange and a clearing house. The move helped Polymarket receive the right to reenter the U.S. market. Last month, the company's CEO and founder, Shayne Coplan, said on X: “Polymarket has been given the green light to go live in the USA by the CFTC.”

Kalshi secured the right for Americans to use its platform after successfully suing the CFTC last year.

Google's Chrome web browser is about to become much less noisy. 

On Friday, the technology giant announced a new feature that will automatically disable browser notifications for the websites you haven't interacted with recently, disrupting their ability to pop up alerts and updates that you may no longer be interested in.

The feature will launch on Chrome on Android and on desktop.

The feature expands on existing functionality already available in Chrome's Safety Check feature, which revokes camera and location permissions from websites you don't visit anymore.

The company tacitly admits that browser notifications, as designed, might have been a bad idea, saying that its own data shows users receive a high volume of notifications but rarely interact with them. Less than 1% of all notifications receive any interactions from users, notes Google.

Still, the tech giant believes some notifications can be helpful, which is why it won't revoke those for installed web apps — only for the sites where there's low user engagement and high volume of notifications sent. This change alone could push spammy websites that push a lot of notifications to reconsider how many they want to send alerts, so they won't lose access entirely.

Unwanted notifications have been an issue facing consumers for years. On the iPhone, for instance, Apple was forced to add controls that let users send their push notifications to a daily summary, mute them, or turn them off altogether from the notification message itself, after consumer frustrations with the notification system grew.

Google says it will inform users when it's removing notification permissions, allowing users to change the setting back, if they prefer. If users would rather Google didn't intervene, they can also opt to turn off this auto-revocation feature altogether, the company notes. 

The feature had been in testing ahead of today's official launch. Google found that these changes didn't significantly impact the total number of clicks on notifications, an indication that people weren't really engaging much with these pop-ups to begin with.

It takes a lot of computing power to run an AI product — and as the tech industry races to tap the power of AI models, there's a parallel race underway to build the infrastructure that will power them. On a recent earnings call, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang estimated that between $3 trillion and $4 trillion will be spent on AI infrastructure by the end of the decade — with much of that money coming from AI companies. Along the way, they're placing immense strain on power grids and pushing the industry's building capacity to its limit.

Below, we've laid out everything we know about the biggest AI infrastructure projects, including major spending from Meta, Oracle, Microsoft, Google, and OpenAI. We'll keep it updated as the boom continues and the numbers climb even higher.

This is arguably the deal that kicked off the whole contemporary AI boom: In 2019, Microsoft made a $1 billion investment in a buzzy non-profit called OpenAI, known mostly for its association with Elon Musk. Crucially, the deal made Microsoft the exclusive cloud provider for OpenAI — and as the demands of model training became more intense, more of Microsoft's investment started to come in the form of Azure cloud credit rather than cash. 

It was a great deal for both sides: Microsoft was able to claim more Azure sales, and OpenAI got more money for its biggest single expense. In the years that followed, Microsoft would build its investment up to nearly $14 billion — a move that is set to pay off enormously when OpenAI converts into a for-profit company.

The partnership between the two companies has unwound more recently. In January, OpenAI announced it would no longer be using Microsoft's cloud exclusively, instead giving the company a right of first refusal on future infrastructure demands but pursuing others if Azure couldn't meet their needs. More recently, Microsoft began exploring other foundation models to power its AI products, establishing even more independence from the AI giant.

OpenAI's arrangement with Microsoft was so successful that it's become a common practice for AI services to sign on with a particular cloud provider. Anthropic has received $8 billion in investment from Amazon, while making kernel-level modifications on the company's hardware to make it better suited for AI training. Google Cloud has also signed on smaller AI companies like Lovable and Windsurf as “primary computing partners,” although those deals did not involve any investment. And even OpenAI has gone back to the well, receiving a $100 billion investment from Nvidia in September, giving it capacity to buy even more of the company's GPUs.

On June 30, 2025, Oracle revealed in an SEC filing that it had signed a $30 billion cloud services deal with an unnamed partner; this is more than the company's cloud revenues for all of the previous fiscal year. OpenAI was eventually revealed as the partner, securing Oracle a spot alongside Google as one of OpenAI's string of post-Microsoft hosting partners. Unsurprisingly, the company's stock went shooting up.

A few months later, it happened again. On September 10, Oracle revealed a five-year, $300 billion deal for compute power, set to begin in 2027. Oracle's stock climbed even higher, briefly making founder Larry Ellison the richest man in the world. The sheer scale of the deal is stunning: OpenAI does not have $300 billion to spend, so the figure presumes immense growth for both companies, and more than a little faith. 

But before a single dollar is spent, the deal has already cemented Oracle as one of the leading AI infrastructure providers — and a financial force to be reckoned with.

As AI labs scramble to build infrastructure, they're mostly all buying GPUs from one company: Nvidia. That trade has made Nvidia flush with cash — and it's been investing that cash back into the industry in increasingly unconventional ways. In September 2025, the company bought a 4% stake in rival Intel for $5 billion — but even more surprising has been the deals with its own customers. One week after the Intel deal was revealed, the company announced a $100 billion investment in OpenAI, paid for with GPUs that would be used in OpenAI's ongoing data center projects. Nvidia has since announced a similar deal with Elon Musk's xAI, and OpenAI launched a separate GPU-for-stock arrangement with AMD.

If that seems circular, it should. Nvidia's GPUs are valuable because they're so scarce — and by trading them directly into an ever-inflating data center scheme, Nvidia is making sure they stay that way. You could say the same thing about OpenAI's privately held stock, which is all the more valuable because it can't be obtained through public markets. For now, OpenAI and Nvidia are riding high and nobody seems too worried — but if the momentum starts to flag, this sort of arrangement will get a lot more scrutiny.

For companies like Meta that already have significant legacy infrastructure, the story is more complicated — although equally expensive. Mark Zuckerberg has said that Meta plans to spend $600 billion on U.S. infrastructure through the end of 2028.

In just the first half of 2025, the company spent $30 billion more than the previous year, driven largely by the company's growing AI ambitions. Some of that spending goes toward big ticket cloud contracts, like a recent $10 billion deal with Google Cloud, but even more resources are being poured into two massive new data centers. 

A new 2,250-acre site in Louisiana, dubbed Hyperion, will cost an estimated $10 billion to build out and provide an estimated 5 gigawatts of compute power. Notably, the site includes an arrangement with a local nuclear power plant to handle the increased energy load. A smaller site in Ohio, called Prometheus, is expected to come online in 2026, powered by natural gas. 

That kind of buildout comes with real environmental costs. Elon Musk's xAI built its own hybrid data center and power-generation plant in South Memphis, Tennessee. The plant has quickly become one of the county's largest emitters of smog-producing chemicals, thanks to a string of natural gas turbines that experts say violate the Clean Air Act.

Just two days after his second inauguration, President Trump announced a joint venture between SoftBank, OpenAI, and Oracle, meant to spend $500 billion building AI infrastructure in the United States. Named “Stargate” after the 1994 film, the project arrived with incredible amounts of hype, with Trump calling it “the largest AI infrastructure project in history.” Sam Altman seemed to agree, saying, ​​”I think this will be the most important project of this era.” 

In broad strokes, the plan was for SoftBank to provide the funding, with Oracle handling the buildout with input from OpenAI. Overseeing it all was Trump, who promised to clear away any regulatory hurdles that might slow down the build. But there were doubts from the beginning, including from Elon Musk, Altman's business rival, who claimed the project did not have the available funds.

As the hype has died down, the project has lost some momentum. In August, Bloomberg reported that the partners were failing to reach consensus. Nonetheless, the project has moved forward with the construction of eight data centers in Abilene, Texas, with construction on the final building set to be finished by the end of 2026.

It keeps changing, the quick access is somehow different from the explorer quick access locations, the browse button opens a dialog in a completely different location, the recent menu locations sometimes just doesn't do anything if you click on it, only uses 1/3rd of the screen on wide screens, quick access doesn't seem to be user modifiable, ""Add place"" doesn't let you add anything except the onedrive that is already added, the clickable buttons are sprinkled all over the place and not clearly identifiable as clickable, sometimes the header shows you paths or sometimes just the name of the current folder, Add to favorites doesn't add to quick access but rather to favorites that is somehow a submenu of recents?!?, favorite locations in excel and word are not syncd between each other, the save as dialog has slightly different buttons available depending on how you opened the dialog, some buttons do something different if you double click them vs single click. It's just raw chaos throughout.I assume they threw their UX guy out the window and designed this in 5 committees that were prohibited from communicating with each other.

Scientists are getting a better handle on the complexities of how immunity works.

Attentive readers might have noticed my absence over the last couple of weeks. I've been trying to recover from a bout of illness.

It got me thinking about the immune system, and how little I know about my own immune health. The vast array of cells, proteins, and biomolecules that works to defend us from disease is mind-bogglingly complicated. Immunologists are still getting to grips with how it all works.

A handful of immunologists are pushing the field to take attributes such as sex chromosomes, sex hormones, and reproductive tissues into account.

Those of us who aren't immunologists are even more in the dark. I had my flu jab last week and have no idea how my immune system responded. Will it protect me from the flu virus this winter? Is it “stressed” from whatever other bugs it has encountered in the last few months? And since my husband had his shot at the same time, I can't help wondering how our responses will compare. 

So I was intrigued to hear about a new test that is being developed to measure immune health. One that even gives you a score.

Writer David Ewing Duncan hoped that the test would reveal more about his health than any other he'd ever taken. He described the experience in a piece published jointly by MIT Technology Review and Aventine.

The test David took was developed by John Tsang at Yale University and his colleagues. The team wanted to work out a way of measuring how healthy a person's immune system might be.

It's a difficult thing to do, for several reasons. First, there's the definition of “healthy.” I find it's a loose concept that becomes more complicated the more you think about it. Yes, we all have a general sense of what it means to be in good health. But is it just the absence of disease? Is it about resilience? Does it have something to do with withstanding the impact of aging?

Tiny particles of plastic turn up in our drinking water, blood and even regions of the Earth thought to be pristine—so it's vital we learn what they're doing to us.

Tsang and his colleagues wanted to measure “deviation from health.” They looked at blood samples from 228 people who had immune diseases that were caused by single-gene mutations, as well as 42 other people who were free from disease. All those individuals could be considered along a health spectrum.

Another major challenge lies in trying to capture the complexity of the immune system, which involves hundreds of proteins and cells interacting in various ways. (Side note: Last year, MIT Technology Review recognized Ang Cui at Harvard University as one of our Innovators under 35 for her attempts to make sense of it all using machine learning. She created the Immune Dictionary to describe how hundreds of proteins affect immune cells—something she likens to a “periodic table” for the immune system.)

Tsang and his colleagues tackled this by running a series of tests on those blood samples. The vast scope of these tests is what sets them apart from the blood tests you might get during a visit to the doctor. The team looked at how genes were expressed by cells in the blood. They measured a range of immune cells and more than 1,300 proteins.

The team members used machine learning to find correlations between these measurements and health, allowing them to create an immune health score for each of the volunteers. They call it the immune health metric, or IHM.

When they used this approach to find the immune scores of people who had already volunteered in other studies, they found that the IHM seemed to align with other measures of health, such as how people respond to diseases, treatments, and vaccines. The study was published in the journal Nature Medicine last year.

The researchers behind it hope that a test like this could one day help identify people who are at risk of cancer and other diseases, or explain why some people respond differently to treatments or immunizations.

But the test isn't ready for clinical use. If, like me, you're finding yourself curious to know your own IHM, you'll just have to wait.

The new Marvel Studios series Wonder Man is coming in January, and we expect a lot of news later this weekend during a panel at New York Comic Con. But, ahead of that panel, the Marvel socials just dropped our first extended look at the series, and it's all about remaking superhero shows.

In the clip, which you can see below, we watch Simon Williams (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II) grow up as a fan of Wonder Man, a seemingly low-level B superhero movie. But then, later in life, a remake is planned and, well, it seems this little boy's dreams may come true.

It all goes by pretty fast, but there are a lot of teases in there. Sir Ben Kingsley's Trevor Slattery character, for example, is about to become the first major character from Shang-Chi to return to the MCU. Is he a mentor? A rival? Plus, it seems like this show is going to be very tongue-in-cheek about the superhero genre at large. You can see one of the projects being made is called “Cash Grab 2,” for example.

But what is the deal with Simon's powers? And how does this all fit into the Marvel Cinematic Universe? We'll probably find out more later this weekend when a panel is held at New York Comic Con. For now, though, did you think Wonder Man was going to be this Hollywood heavy? Are you excited to see where it goes? Let us know below.

Fifteen years ago, the previous Tron movie, Tron: Legacy, ended with an impossibly exciting cliffhanger. Sam Flynn, son of Kevin Flynn, emerged from the Grid having found his father and returning with Quorra, a digitally created being whose mere existence was poised to change the face of history, humanity, the universe, and all of it. Then, nothing happened. The film didn't get a direct sequel, and it took almost two decades to return to the Grid.

That return happened this weekend with the release of Tron: Ares. Set in a world where those events happened, the story instead follows the new CEO of Encom, Eve Kim, who is in a battle over technology with her rival, CEO of Dillinger Corporation, Julian Dillinger.

In the end, though, well, some of these strands come back to light, so let's break down what happens at the end and in the end credits of Tron: Ares. Massive spoilers to follow.



If you are still reading, we assume you've seen the movie, so we'll skip over everything to the end. Having found and extracted the Permanence Code from the original Tron grid, Ares can now live his life in our world. After helping Eve defeat the Dillinger programs, Ares has escaped and written to her from Mexico. There, he's attempting to become more human by seeing the world but, also, is seeking someone out. Ares has photos, as well as a last known location, for Quorra, a being he believes is just like him.

The assumption here is that Ares, a digital being who now exists in the world, is hoping to find Quorra, the only other digital being that exists in the world, to do… we don't know what. Which, on the one hand, we like. As fans of Tron: Legacy and its ending, it's nice that Tron: Ares eventually makes its way back to giving those events the resonance they deserve. On the other hand, this is almost the exact same ending as 15 years ago. Newly extracted digital being in the real world, unsure of what the future holds. For 15 years, Disney couldn't get that story right. Do we really think it can now?

Of course, that's not the only tease we get at the end of Tron: Ares. In the mid-credits, we pick up with Julian Dillinger on his Grid. It's been largely destroyed, thanks to the work of the Encom team, but as he looks out, an identity disc emerges. We hear the word “Sark” whispered as Julian grabs the disc and is overtaken with a digital overlay that fans of the original film will find very familiar.

In the original Tron, the program in control of the Grid, the Master Control Program, was in large part personified by its second in command, Sark, who had the same shaped helmet Julian begins to display here. Sark was played by David Warner, who also played Ed Dillinger in the film (and is seen numerous times in paintings in Tron: Ares). Basically, Sark was Dillinger's digital doppelganger and as evil as they come. Eventually, he was defeated by Flynn and Tron, but (we guess) some of that code remains at Dillinger. And Julian is now in line to become the new MCP of the Grid. One in the image of his powerful, evil grandfather, Ed.

The question then becomes, will either of these storylines ever be paid off? We'll have to wait and see what happens this weekend at the box office. But, suffice to say, Tron: Ares leaves the world of Tron with some very cool little threads to pick up should we ever return back to the Grid.

Meta employees still working on the Metaverse are now expected to use AI to supercharge their productivity by at least fivefold.

In an internal message first reported by 404 Media, Meta's VP of Metaverse, Vishal Shah, told employees they should be using AI to boost their work performance. The note included a graphic that read, “Think 5x, not 5%.”

“Our goal is simple yet audacious: make Al a habit, not a novelty. This means prioritizing training and adoption for everyone, so that using Al becomes second nature—just like any other tool we rely on,” Shah wrote, according to 404. 

It wasn't that long ago when the Metaverse seemed to be CEO Mark Zuckerberg's biggest priority. The company even rebranded to Meta in 2021 to highlight its new virtual and augmented reality products and platforms. At one point, Meta even said the Metaverse could become “as important as smartphones.”

But since then, the Metaverse has failed to live up to the hype. The company at one point reportedly burned through nearly $50 billion on its VR division.

Nowadays, Zuckerberg seems far more interested in AI. Meta is now pouring billions into artificial intelligence projects, poaching talent from rival OpenAI, and building massive data centers in Ohio and Louisiana. The company has also repeatedly said AI will play an increasingly central role in its operations.

“It's well-known that this is a priority and we're focused on using AI to help employees with their day-to-day work,” a Meta spokesperson told Gizmodo in an emailed statement.

For his part, Zuckerberg told investors on a call in April that he expects by the middle of next year that AI agents “are going to be doing a substantial part of AI research and development…” In May, he reiterated that, saying they'll write most of Meta's code within the next 12 to 18 months.

Now, we're getting a glimpse of how those efforts are trickling down to workers and maybe even how AI could lead to a revived Metaverse.

“A 5X leap in productivity isn't about small incremental improvements, it's about fundamentally rethinking how we work, build, and innovate,” Shah wrote.

He added that AI should be integrated into every “major codebase and workflow,” and said the company expects 80% of Metaverse employees to have AI integrated into their daily routines by the end of the year.

And this doesn't just apply to engineers. Shah said project managers, designers, and others should also be “rolling up their sleeves and building prototypes, fixing bugs, and pushing the boundaries of what's possible.”

He said the team could move five times faster by eliminating friction and rapidly prototyping ideas with feedback loops measured in hours, not weeks.

It appears the Israel-based NSO Group—a notorious peddler of powerfully invasive spyware—has been purchased by an American company. The news was first reported by Israeli outlet Calcalist and confirmed by TechCrunch.

NSO, which is best known for its phone-hacking malware Pegasus, has been at the center of surveillance scandals for years. An investor group led by Hollywood producer Robert Simonds is the new owner of the hack-for-hire firm, according to Calcalist. The deal, which is said to be worth “several tens of millions of dollars,” is expected to be finalized “in the coming days, though its completion will require approval from Israel's Defense Export Control Agency (DECA) at the Ministry of Defense,” the outlet writes.

NSO spokesperson Oded Hershowitz reportedly told TechCrunch that “an American investment group has invested tens of millions of dollars in the company and has acquired controlling ownership.” Hershowitz told TechCrunch: “This investment does not mean that the company is moving out of Israeli regulatory or operational control. The company's headquarters and core operations remain in Israel. It continues to be fully supervised and regulated by the relevant Israeli authorities, including the Ministry of Defense and the Israeli regulatory framework.” Gizmodo reached out to NSO Group for comment, and we'll update this story when we receive a reply.

NSO hasn't just had a rough few years—it's had a rough decade. As early as 2015-2016, the company was mired in controversy due to the autocratic governments that bought its products. By 2018, Amnesty International was claming its staff had been hacked using the company's malware. In 2019, Facebook and WhatsApp sued NSO, accusing it of exploiting bugs in its messenger's code to allow the surveillance of app users. The lawsuit was later joined by a number of prominent tech companies, including Microsoft, Google, Cisco, and Dell, many of whom later argued that NSO's spyware victims should be able to sue the company for privacy violations. In 2021, it was sued by Apple. That same year, NSO was placed on a federal blacklist that forbids U.S. companies from providing resources or support to it without official government approval. Last year, a judge found the company liable in the lawsuit filed by WhatsApp.

Throughout this period, there have continued to be a plethora of controversies involving the company. There have also been attempts by U.S. firms to buy NSO. In 2022, the major U.S. defense contractor L3Harris mulled the acquisition of NSO but seems to have been dissuaded from such a purchase by the Biden administration, which had previously blacklisted the firm. It's unclear what the spyware firm's future will look like under its new American owners, but it ensures that the company has a future, and puts the powerful cyber arsenal into U.S. hands—just in time for Trump's newly forming police state.

If you've been eagerly anticipating Samsung's Project Moohan VR headset, I've got good news and bad news. The good news is, we now (probably) know just about everything there is to know about its upcoming Vision Pro competitor. The bad news? We still have no idea when we'll be able to use one for ourselves.

Thanks to a comprehensive leak from Android Headlines, we now know that “Project Moohan” is probably called the Samsung Galaxy XR in the official internal lingo. One thing that caught my eye about the Samsung Galaxy XR is that, unlike Apple's Vision Pro, the headset will come with two controllers that look a lot like the ones Meta includes with its Quest 3 and 3S. Those will be coupled with an eye- and hand-tracking UI that operates like visionOS, the software inside Apple's Vision Pro.

Leaks also suggest that the Samsung Galaxy XR headset will indeed use a 4K micro-OLED display in each eye, which definitely pits it against the Vision Pro in the display department and solidifies its place as a cut above cheaper headsets like the Quest 3 and 3s. One area that it may excel in, if leaks are to be believed, is that it's a little bit lighter than the Vision Pro, clocking in at 545 grams as opposed to 600 grams. That's not a groundbreaking amount of weight to shed, but any improvement on the Vision Pro-level heft is welcome in my book.

Oh, and it looks pretty comfortable too. There's a lot of padding on the inside bits that rest on your forehead, which feels important if you're planning to wear it for longer periods. One of my least favorite parts of the Vision Pro is how it really weighs on your face and neck, so any added support is huge. Speaking of wearing a headset for long periods, Android Headlines' leaks suggest that the Samsung Galaxy XR has a battery life of around two-ish hours, which puts it on par with the Vision Pro. Unfortunately, it'll take an external battery pack to get there, though, just like the Vision Pro.

There is one enormous detail that we don't know yet, and that's the price. Based on all of the almost-confirmed information we now have, I would imagine that this isn't going to be a cheap headset. Will it be Vision Pro-level expensive? Hopefully not. I can't think of too many people who would be excited to buy a $3,500 headset. That being said, rumors have suggested that it could land anywhere between $1,700 and $2,900. On either range, that's a lot of money to pay for a headset, even if it's as premium as leaks would suggest. Maybe Samsung will have more success selling Vision Pro-like hardware, but if I were a betting man, I'd bet that Project Moohan is going to be quite the project for Samsung indeed.

That's a lot of AI FLOPS


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Microsoft has just upgraded its Azure cloud platform with Nvidia's Blackwell Ultra, deploying what it calls the world's first large-scale GB300 NVL72 supercomputing cluster. This cluster includes several racks housing exactly 4,608 GB300 GPUs connected by NVLink 5 switch fabric, which is then interconnected via Nvidia's Quantum-X800 InfiniBand networking fabric across the entire cluster. This allows a single NVL72 rack to have a total memory bandwidth of 130 TB/s, with each rack providing 800 Gb/s of interconnect bandwidth per GPU.

The world's first large-scale @nvidia GB300 NVL72 supercomputing cluster for AI workloads is now live on Microsoft Azure. The deployment connects 4,600+ NVIDIA Blackwell Ultra GPUs using next-gen InfiniBand network—built to train and deploy advanced AI models faster than… pic.twitter.com/CmmDtcrlwnOctober 9, 2025

The 4,608 number, specified by Nvidia, denotes 64x GB300 NVL72 systems at play here, considering each rack has 72 Blackwell GPUs and 36 Grace CPUs (totaling 2,592 Arm cores). That would technically put it way behind a full hyperscale expansion, but this still marks a significant milestone for Nvidia's Grace Blackwell GB300, which recently set new benchmark records in inference performance. Microsoft says this cluster will be dedicated to OpenAI workloads, allowing for advanced reasoning models to run even faster and enable model training in “weeks instead of months.”

At rack level, each NVL72 system is said to deliver 1,440 petaflops of FP4 Tensor performance, powered by 37 terabytes of unified “fast memory,” which breaks down to 20 TB HBM3E for the GPU, and 17 TB LPDDR5X for the Grace CPU. As mentioned earlier, this memory is pooled together using NVLink 5 to make each rack work as a single, unified accelerator capable of 130 TB/s of direct bandwidth. The memory throughput is one of the most impressive parts of the GB300 NVL72, so it's important to understand how it works.

The Quantum-X800 InfiniBand platform enables each of the 4,608 intra-connected GPUs to have a bandwidth of 800 Gb/s at the rack-to-rack level. In the end, every single GPU becomes connected, across racks and within.

 




The GB300 NVL72 cluster is liquid-cooled, using standalone heat exchangers and facility loops designed to minimize water usage under intense workloads. Nvidia says Microsoft needed to reimagine every layer of its data center for this deployment, and Microsoft happily points out how this is just the first of many clusters to come that will spread GB300 across the globe, taking it to full hyperscale potential. OpenAI and Microsoft already use GB200 clusters for training models, so this serves as a natural extension of their exclusive partnership.

Nvidia itself is heavily invested in OpenAI, with both recently signing a Letter of Intent (LoI) for a major strategic partnership that will see the chipmaker pour $100 billion into OpenAI, progressively. On the other hand, OpenAI will use Nvidia GPUs for its next-gen AI infrastructure, deploying at least 10 gigawatts (GW) worth of accelerators, starting with Vera Rubin next year. So, this GB300 NVL72 supercluster can be looked at as a precursor, almost materializing that investment since Microsoft is the one deploying the cluster for OpenAI, using Nvidia hardware.

NEWPORT, Wales — Primary care doctors across the UK remain uncertain about how best to test, counsel, and refer men for suspected prostate cancer, particularly those at higher risk, experts warned at the Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) Annual Conference 2025.

Three speakers outlined new research, existing inequalities, and an extensive forthcoming trial that may reshape national screening policy.

Dr Sam Merriel, an NHS GP and clinical senior lecturer at the University of Manchester, England, said current guidance is “conflicting, incomplete, and leaves a lot of gaps, particularly for higher-risk men.” He added: “For Black men and those with a family history or BRCA2 mutation, there's nothing that tells GPs how often to test, what PSA thresholds to use, or when to stop.”

Merriel conducted a live poll during his presentation, revealing that GPs remain evenly divided on the diagnostic value of the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test. 

“It was a fifty-fifty split,” he said. “Even among practising GPs, there's uncertainty about whether PSA is a good test for picking up clinically significant disease.”

His recent paper in the British Journal of General Practice showed wide geographical variation in PSA testing across England. “There's more testing down south compared with the north,” he said. “And men in the north are more likely to be diagnosed later. This vacuum of clear guidance is driving inequity.”

The government's ambition is to achieve early diagnosis in 75% of prostate cancer cases, but Merriel said rates remain closer to 50%. “We're still a long way off that target,” he said.

Speaking to Medscape News UK after the presentation, Matthew Hobbs, director of research at Prostate Cancer UK, emphasised that the ambiguity around PSA testing thresholds contributes to overdiagnosis and underdiagnosis alike. 

“We've got late diagnosis of clinically significant disease that kills people, and massive diagnosis of a lot of cancers that will never cause harm,” he said. “The guidelines and the evidence are the only way we can balance those two things.”

He added that because the evidence is not definitive one way or the other, “it's kind of being left to patients and clinicians to make it up as they go along.”

Hobbs noted that one of the most frequent questions GPs ask Prostate Cancer UK is how early to start testing, how often to repeat it, and when to stop. Responding to this uncertainty, he outlined details of the £42 million TRANSFORM trial, launched in 2024 and funded by the charity and partners, which aims to provide that evidence base.

Stage 1 is piloting four diagnostic pathways, including innovations in imaging and genetics. Stage 2 will recruit up to 300,000 men, and stage 3 will follow men through data linkage to understand long-terms outcomes.

“TRANSFORM is seeking to help answer those questions,” said Hobbs. “We'll be recruiting men, doing repeated rounds of screening, and following them for a long time.”

The trial will also explore how often men should be tested, when to stop, and how to define meaningful benefit. “We're following men long-term to understand screening intervals, stage at diagnosis, and outcomes,” said Merriel, a co-investigator on the trial. “Ultimately, we want to build the evidence base for clear, practical guidance.”

The trial will also test faster, cheaper 12-minute magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) tests as potential first-line tools. “We don't think any single approach will be the solution,” he said, “but something here will be better than what we have now, and building that infrastructure will accelerate discovery.”

Hobbs noted that the UK National Screening Committee (UK NSC) has recognised that new evidence is now available and that the balance between harm and benefit has shifted favourably. “They have been reviewing the evidence and plugging the most up to date results and knowledge into a newly created model developed by experts from the Sheffield Centre for Health and Related Research (SCHARR),” he explained.

A recommendation and public consultation are expected between November 2025 and March 2026.

Three main possible outcomes include:

Dr Chris Williams, vice chair of RCGP Scotland, said awareness of high-risk groups has improved but action remains inconsistent. 

“We can now identify high-risk men using three simple questions published online, but we don't have a clear route to offering them reassurance or treatment. That's the gap,” he said.

Merriel agreed that new guidance should prioritise practical advice for GPs. “Ideally, I'd give specific advice on what to do with high-risk men, including Black men, and those with family history,” he said. “Ask a few key questions, plan for earlier and perhaps more frequent testing.”

Hobbs added that socioeconomic factors influence PSA uptake. “Educated, health-literate men are more likely to request it and therefore more likely to be over diagnosed. Those less engaged are often diagnosed too late.”

He continued: “Prostate Cancer UK's view is that the evidence has changed enough that guidelines should now become proactive. For high-risk men, GPs should be allowed, even encouraged, to initiate that conversation.”

As the session concluded, Hobbs summarised the call for change. “It's not a new call,” he said. “But the guidelines must be updated, irrespective of what the screening committee decides, so that GPs have clarity and the confidence to act.”

Merriel's expenses for attending the conference were covered by Prostate Cancer UK. He is a co-investigator on the TRANSFORM trial and receives research funding for prostate cancer research from the NIHR, CRUK, and Prostate Cancer UK. Hobbs works for Prostate Cancer UK. Williams reported no relevant financial conflicts of interest.

If you or someone you know may be experiencing a mental health crisis, contact the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline by dialing or texting ""988.”

A few months ago, Waynesville Police Sgt. Paige Shell was about to give up hope of getting better. The daily drip of violence, death, and misery from almost 20 years in law enforcement had left a mark. Her sleep was poor, depression was a stubborn companion, and thoughts of suicide had taken root.

Shell, who works in a rural community about 30 miles west of Asheville, tried talk therapy, but it didn't work. When her counselor suggested ketamine-assisted psychotherapy, she was skeptical.

""I didn't know what to expect. I'm a cop. It's a trust thing,"" she said with a thin smile.

Combining psychotherapy with low-dose ketamine, a hallucinogenic drug long used as an anesthetic, is a relatively new approach to treating severe depression and post-traumatic stress, especially in populations with high trauma rates such as firefighters, police officers, and military members. Yet evidence of the efficacy and safety of ketamine for treatment of mental health conditions is still evolving, and the market remains widely unregulated.

""First responders experience a disproportionately high burden of trauma and are often left without a lot of treatment options,"" said Signi Goldman, a psychiatrist and co-owner of Concierge Medicine and Psychiatry in Asheville, who began including ketamine in psychotherapy sessions in 2017.

Law enforcement officers in the U.S., on average, are exposed to 189 traumatic events over their careers, a small study suggests, compared with two to three in an average adult's lifetime. Research shows that rates of depression and burnout are significantly higher among police officers than in the civilian population. And in recent years, more officers have died by suicide than been killed in the line of duty, according to the first-responder advocacy group First H.E.L.P.

Ketamine is a dissociative drug, meaning it causes people to feel detached from their body, physical environment, thoughts, or emotions.

The Food and Drug Administration approved it as an anesthetic in 1970. It became a popular party drug in the 1990s, and in 1999, ketamine was added to the list of Schedule III nonnarcotic substances under the Controlled Substances Act.

The death of ""Friends"" actor Matthew Perry in 2023, which was attributed to ketamine use, further tainted the drug's reputation.

But starting with a 1990 animal study and followed by a landmark human trial, research has shown that low doses of ketamine can also rapidly reduce symptoms of depression. In 2019, the FDA approved esketamine — derived from ketamine and administered as a nasal spray — for treatment-resistant depression.

All other forms of ketamine remain FDA-approved only for anesthesia. If used to treat psychiatric disorders, it must be prescribed off-label.

""This is a situation where the clinical practice is probably ahead of the evidence to support it,"" said John Krystal, chair of the Department of Psychiatry at the Yale School of Medicine and a pioneer of ketamine research.

Krystal has studied the effect of ketamine on veterans and active-duty military members — a population comparable to first responders in their exposure to trauma. While research shows strong evidence of ketamine's antidepressant effects, he said further studies are needed on its potential role in PTSD treatment.

The regulatory environment for ketamine also remains a concern, Krystal said. State oversight varies, and federal regulations don't outline dosing, administration methods, safety protocols, or training for providers.

In this regulatory patchwork, more than 1,000 ketamine clinics have sprung up across the country. At-home ketamine treatments have flooded the market, prompting the FDA to issue a warning.

Side effects of ketamine can range from nausea and blood pressure spikes to suppressed breathing. The drug can also cause adverse psychological effects.

""Being on a psychedelic puts people in an extremely vulnerable state,"" Goldman said. People can get retraumatized as they relive disturbing memories. That's why it's critical that a mental health provider guide a person through a ketamine session, she said.

With proper precautions — and when other treatments have failed — Rick Baker thinks ketamine-assisted psychotherapy is a good fit for first responders. Baker is CEO and founder of Responder Support Services, which provides mental health treatment exclusively to police officers, firefighters, and other first responders in North Carolina, South Carolina, and Tennessee.

As a population, first responders are more resistant than civilians to traditional therapy, said Baker, who is a licensed clinical mental health counselor. Ketamine provides a potential shortcut into the trauma memory and works ""like an accelerant to psychotherapy,"" he said. ""It strips away people's armor.""

When used for mental health treatment, a dose of ketamine — typically half a milligram per kilogram of body weight, less than for anesthesia — creates a mildly altered state of consciousness, Goldman said. It makes people look at their own traumatic memories at a distance ""and tolerate them differently,"" she said.

The ketamine sessions in her practice are usually two hours long, and clients are under the drug for about 45 minutes. The drug is administered as an IV drip, an intramuscular injection, under-the-tongue lozenges, or a compounded nasal spray. The drug is short-acting, meaning its dissociative effects largely wear off within about an hour.

But most insurers won't pick up the cost of ketamine-assisted psychotherapy, which can be more than $1,000 per session for the IV drip.

""That's certainly prohibitive for first responders,"" Goldman said.

The Department of Veterans Affairs covers some forms of ketamine treatment, including ketamine-assisted psychotherapy, for eligible veterans on a case-by-case basis.

In Shell's case, a donation made to Responder Support Services covered what her insurance wouldn't when she decided this spring to try ketamine-assisted psychotherapy with Baker, her counselor.

Revisiting the most gruesome calls in her nearly two decades as a police officer was not something Shell wanted to do. But Hurricane Helene, which caused catastrophic flooding in western North Carolina last year, pushed the 41-year-old ""over the edge,"" she said.

""Some of the sessions were rough,"" said Shell, who is also a member of her agency's SWAT team. ""Things came up that I didn't want to think about, that I'd buried during my entire career.""

The badly mangled victim in a fatal car crash. A murder-suicide, in which a man cut his pregnant girlfriend's throat then slit his own.

Under ketamine, the images came to life as still pictures, she said, like a surreal slideshow replaying some of her darkest memories. ""Then I would sit there and cry like a baby.""

As of early October, Shell had undergone 12 ketamine sessions. They have not provided a sudden miraculous cure, she said. But her sleep has improved, and bad days are now bad moments. She also finds it easier to manage stress. ""And I smile more than I used to,"" she said.

She was hesitant to share her experience within her department because of the ongoing stigma associated with seeking help in the hard-charging police culture.

""I just didn't want my people to think that I couldn't handle the job,"" she said. ""I didn't want them to feel that I'm posing a risk to them.""

The perception of ketamine plays a role as well, said Sherri Martin, national director of wellness services at the Fraternal Order of Police, an organization representing more than 377,000 sworn law enforcement officers. Many cops are used to ketamine as an illegal street drug, she said, or think of it as a counterculture psychedelic.

""So, when they are supposed to accept this as a treatment, that's hard for them to grasp,"" she said.

Few if any police departments provide clear guidance on ketamine-assisted psychotherapy. If it were medically prescribed, it would likely be viewed the same as taking an antidepressant, Martin said.

Shell ultimately shared her story with colleagues, most of whom were curious and supportive, and she now encourages other officers to speak up about their struggles. She believes seeking mental health treatment — in her case, ketamine-assisted psychotherapy — has made her a better and safer police officer.

""It's hard to help other people when you can't take care of yourself,"" she said.

A new tool developed by Weill Cornell Medicine and the University of Adelaide investigators has enhanced the ability to track multiple gene mutations while simultaneously recording gene activity in individual cancer cells. The technology, which can now use diverse types of pathology samples and quickly process large numbers of cells, has enabled the investigators to glean new insights into how cancers evolve toward greater aggressiveness and therapy resistance.

Described in a paper published Oct. 10 in Cell Genomics, the new tool, GoT-Multi, is a next-generation advance over an earlier tool called GoT (Genotyping of Transcriptomes). GoT was highly innovative but limited in detecting certain gene mutations as well as the number of mutations it could detect at once, and it was restricted to fresh or frozen tissue samples. GoT-Multi substantially overcomes those limitations and can handle tissue samples preserved with a chemical called formalin and embedded in wax -a sample type that comprises a vast scientific resource in hospital pathology labs worldwide. The researchers highlighted GoT-Multi's potential by using it to reveal new details of how a relatively indolent leukemia can evolve into an aggressive lymphoma.

This technology gives us substantial new power to answer important questions about how cancers evolve, from the beginnings of pre-cancerous neoplastic outgrowths to transformation into malignancy and finally to therapy resistance.""

Dr. Anna Nam, study co-senior author, assistant professor of pathology and laboratory medicine, the Gellert Family/John P. Leonard, M.D. Research Scholar in Hematology and Medical Oncology, and member of the Englander Institute for Precision Medicine and the Sandra and Edward Meyer Cancer Center at Weill Cornell Medicine

The study's other co-senior author was Dr. Luciano Martelotto, associate professor and team lead at the Adelaide Centre for Epigenetics, University of Adelaide. Post-doctoral fellows Dr. Minwoo Pak and Dr. Mirca Saurty-Seerunghen of Dr. Nam's laboratory co-led this work.

Dr. Nam, who is also a pathologist at NewYork-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell Medical Center, led the development of the GoT tool in the late 2010s as a postdoctoral researcher in the laboratory of Dr. Dan Landau, the Bibliowicz Family Professor of Medicine and a member of the Englander Institute for Precision Medicine and the Sandra and Edward Meyer Cancer Center at Weill Cornell Medicine, and a core faculty member of the New York Genome Center. GoT and GoT-Multi are considered ""single-cell multi-omics"" tools because they enable researchers to record multiple layers of information from individual cells.

In a striking demonstration of GoT-Multi's unique capabilities, the researchers applied it to tissue samples, including the sample type they were formerly unable to analyze, from patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia transitioning toward the more malignant large B-cell lymphoma-a change known as the Richter Transformation. The tool allowed the researchers to profile tens of thousands of individual tumor cells, tracking the presence of more than two dozen different gene mutations, and seeing how these mutations related to the cells' activities-some cells growing faster, others stoking inflammation-as the cancer evolved. Overall, GoT-Multi illuminated this malignant progression as never before.

The researchers now are applying GoT-Multi to a large cohort of therapy-resistant lymphomas, as well as using it to map the development of other cancers and precancerous states. They expect the insights provided by GoT-Multi to suggest new therapeutic strategies.

The U.S. men's national team will return to Austin, Texas, for the second time in 2025, this time to take on Ecuador in a friendly on Friday.

Back in June, the USMNT defeated Saudi Arabia 1-0 at Q2 Stadium during the group stage of the 2025 Concacaf Gold Cup, but Ecuador figures to be a tougher challenge. La Tri, a nod to the nation's flag having three colors, finished second in South America's marathon World Cup qualifying process, finishing ahead of global powers like Brazil and Colombia.

Manager Mauricio Pochettino, after months of criticism over some experimental call-ups and uneven results, has convened something closer to what is seen as his strongest roster for these October friendlies. Big names like Weston McKennie and Antonee Robinson are back, though the latter admitted on Wednesday that he's ""still not quite back to feeling 100%.""

The USMNT will look for that duo to boost some uneven performances, but much of the focus will be on star forward Christian Pulisic. Earlier this month, Pochettino referred to the AC Milan attacker as the ""most important player"" for the U.S., and the Pennsylvania native was on Thursday named Serie A's Player of the Month for September.

He and the rest of the USMNT attack will have to be sharp in this match, as Ecuador's calling card under manager Sebastián Beccacece has been a nearly impenetrable defense. Despite being one of the smallest nations in CONMEBOL, Ecuador conceded just five goals in the 18-match qualifying process, easily the lowest figure for any team. No team managed to score more than once in a match against La Tri, who posted 13 shutouts en route to securing qualification in June.

The U.S. men's national team opens its October international break with a friendly against Ecuador on Friday night at Q2 Stadium in Austin.

After a largely disappointing first year under Mauricio Pochettino, the USMNT is looking to build off a 2–0 win over Japan, which capped off its September international window after a loss to South Korea. 

With only eight months until the 2026 FIFA World Cup, the pressure has only increased on the entire squad, especially on Christian Pulisic, who has been in the best form of his career with AC Milan in Serie A.

Poker and Chaos: Aubameyang Keeps Gabon's World Cup Dream Alive


Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang once again etched his name into African football history. The Olympique de Marseille striker, at 36 years old, delivered an epic masterclass by scoring all four goals in Gabon's 4-3 win over Gambia, keeping their hopes of reaching the 2026 World Cup alive.

Played in Nairobi due to logistical reasons, the match was a rollercoaster from start to finish. Aubameyang twice put the Panthers ahead in the first half, only for Gambia to equalize through Yankuba Minteh and Adama Sidibeh.

The second half brought even more drama. Sidibeh gave the home side a 3-2 lead early on, but the Gabonese captain refused to back down. A powerful header in the 62nd minute completed his hat-trick, and a stunning strike across goal in the 78th sealed his historic poker, sparking wild celebrations on the Gabon bench.







A Hero and a Villain in the Same Night


Aubameyang's story didn't end with his goals. During one of his celebrations, he kicked and broke a corner flag, earning himself a yellow card. But things got worse when, just five minutes from time, he was sent off for shoving Gambian defender Alagie Saine.

His dismissal left Gabon down to ten men in the closing stages, but the team held firm to secure a crucial victory. Now, coach Thierry Mouyouma's side will have to fight for qualification without their star man, who will serve a suspension in the final round.







Ivory Coast Feeling the Heat


Gabon's victory has tightened the race in Group F of the African qualifiers for the 2026 World Cup. Ivory Coast remain top with 12 points after their 7-0 demolition of Seychelles, but Gabon now sit just one point behind with 11.

The equation is simple: Gabon must beat Burundi and hope Ivory Coast slip up against Kenya. However, the Elephants boast a huge goal difference advantage (+22 to Gabon's +11), meaning the Panthers may need a big win to keep their dream alive until the final whistle.







Aubameyang's Legacy Lives On


With this performance, Aubameyang reached 12 goals in the qualifiers, placing him among Africa's top scorers. Despite the red card, the former Barcelona and Arsenal star proved once again that he remains the heart and soul of Gabon's national team, a leader whose fire still burns bright.

Portugal have started qualification very well as they push towards the 2026 FIFA World Cup next summer, continuing with the visit of the Republic of Ireland this weekend.

With eight goals scored and two conceded, Portugal began UEFA qualification for the World Cup well last month after winning their second UEFA Nations League trophy in Germany over the summer.

Ireland and Irish international football appears to be back at a low ebb with the Boys in Green following a 2-2 draw against Hungary - involving a stirring comeback - with a 2-1 loss to Armenia in Yerevan.

The Sporting News brings you the latest tips and odds as Portugal and captain Cristiano Ronaldo seek to move closer to North America next summer against a very average and under pressure Ireland side.

In the past, Ireland have been able to be difficult to play against and beat against Portugal but there is pressure growing on manager Heimir Hallgrimsson, formerly of Iceland and Jamaica.

Roberto Martinez is blessed with a simply ridiculous team that should be targeting Portugal's first ever FIFA World Cup after winning three pieces of silverware in the last decade.

Portugal have the potential to blow pretty much any team they play away with their squad depth and quality and, as much as Ireland try to be defensive, Portugal should win comfortably.

It is Portugal's first home game since the tragic death of Diogo Jota over the summer and so there will be a lot of emotion at Estadio Jose Alvalade in Lisbon. Portugal have been brilliant in the last 12-18 months or so, while Ireland have been very much the opposite, so a heavy and comfortable home win is to be expected in the Portuguese capital city.

Prediction: Portugal 3-0 Ireland (11/2 with Sky Bet)

How foolish to think FIFA president Gianni Infantino is talking about the game when he raves about the growth next year's World Cup will bring.

Given the outrageous ticket prices, he's clearly referring to FIFA's ballooning bank account.

Prices for tickets to the tournament in Canada, Mexico and the United States were finally revealed last week during the Visa presale window and, according to The Athletic, most cost several hundreds of dollars. Tickets for the U.S. men's national team opener in Los Angeles start at $560 for one of the few nose-bleed seats available, while the best seats will set you back $2,735. Want to go to the Final at MetLife Stadium? It's going to cost you big, with tickets ranging from $2,030 up to $6,370.

There are some $60 seats, but they are only for group-stage games and The Athletic reported they are “extremely scarce” and often located in the uppermost corners of the stadium.

Add in airfare and hotels for those traveling, or parking for those who are local, and the cost of going to one World Cup game, let alone several, is going to be more than the GDP of some countries.

Infantino and his FIFA brethren are like so many of the elites these days: tone deaf to the economic reality of those who aren't part of their wine and cheese set. Or don't have Qatari and Saudi sugar daddies.

Say you want to take a family of four to see the USMNT play in the World Cup. The cheapest seats, for the second group-stage game in Seattle, are $90 each, according to The Athletic. Infantino can probably scrounge up the $360 just by pulling up the cushions of the couches and seats in his private jet, but for a working-class family — hell, for a middle-class family — that is prohibitively expensive.

And it could get worse! There will be several windows for the general public to purchase tickets, and FIFA plans to use ""dynamic pricing"" as it did for the Club World Cup, scaling prices by demand for the game. So if there's a rush on tickets for USMNT games (duh), expect that get-in price to rise.

Explain to me like I'm 5 how this World Cup is going to attract a new generation of fans and expand the reach of the game in the United States when only the wealthiest people can experience it in person.

And don't say by watching on television. Americans have been able to watch the major European leagues, Champions League, continental championships in Europe and South America, and the World Cup for a good decade now and that hasn't prompted the kind of growth Infantino envisions next year's tournament creating.

“You have a good team, you have good players, you have a great coach as well — Mauricio Pochettino, who's fantastic — and these players they play now for the best teams in the world or in Europe, if you want, and the world can see that,” Infantino said in April during an appearance on FOX's “The Herd.”

“Combine this with the fact that a World Cup is going to be played at home, well, that's a pretty explosive combination, isn't it?""

It could have been. But greed won out.

Imagine grade school-aged kids getting to see Christian Pulisic play in person. Or, better yet, Kylian Mbappé or Lamine Yamal. They'd see how captivating the game is at the feet of the best players in the world and be mesmerized by the carnival-like atmosphere in the stadium. That's how you entice kids to start playing soccer or stick with it beyond Lil' Kickers. That's how you create lifelong fans.

How do we know this? Because of all the players on the U.S. women's national team that won the World Cup in 2015 who recalled going to games during the 1999 tournament in the United States and being inspired by the USWNT.

“I was still a little bit young, but I definitely thought, 'I would love this. This would be really cool to get to do,'” former USWNT goalkeeper Alyssa Naeher, who went to the 1999 tournament with her sister and their club teammates, told USA TODAY Sports in 2023.

“It was the first time that it was a bigger thought than just doing it as a kid — that you could participate and do something like that when you grew up.”

This World Cup could have had a similar impact. Alas, Infantino and FIFA only see it as a cash cow to be bled dry. First it was super-sizing the tournament, going from 32 teams to 48 in 2026. Now it's prices jacked up to Super Bowl heights.

FIFA did something similar at the Club World Cup, only to be forced to lower ticket prices because of low demand. Fitting, really, because Infantino and FIFA do nothing but continue to cheapen the game they are supposed to be championing.

Portugal are in a commanding position in the UEFA qualifiers for the FIFA 2026 World Cup, while Ireland are yet to win.

Who: Portugal vs Republic of Ireland
What: UEFA World Cup qualifier
Where: Estadio Jose Alvalade in Lisbon, Portugal
When: Saturday, October 11, at 7:45pm (18:45 GMT)

Portugal will seek to strengthen their grip on Group F in their UEFA World Cup qualifying campaign when they face the winless Republic of Ireland in Lisbon on Saturday.

The Portuguese stormed to the UEFA Nations League title earlier this year and are part of the group of football teams that have belatedly joined the qualifiers for the FIFA 2026 World Cup in the United States, Canada and Mexico.

Al Jazeera Sport takes a look at the match that could put one foot in next year's final for Portugal, while it's a must-win for the Irish.

Portugal have won both their opening qualifiers in Group F, winning 5-0 in Armenia in their first match and 3-2 in Hungary in their second game.

Ireland came from two behind in Dublin to draw 2-2 in their opening Group F match against 10-man Hungary. Adam Idah scored the leveller in the 90th minute. The Irish fell two behind once again in their second match, away to Armenia, but Evan Ferguson's 57th-minute strike did not set up another comeback on this occasion, with the hosts holding on for a 2-1 win.

Portugal and Ireland, along with 22 other teams, are only joining the qualifying programme for the World Cup now due to the progress of some of the top seeds in the 2025 Nations League, which culminated in June.

Portugal were crowned champions as they beat Spain 5-3 on penalties in the 2025 final.

Portugal beat Germany in the semifinal, while Spain overcame France. The rest of the qualifiers for the latter stages of that tournament are also only entering the World Cup qualifiers now.

Portugal beat Ireland 3-0 in a friendly match in June 2024 in the last meeting between the sides.

Joao Felix gave the Portuguese the lead in the first half of the match in Aveiro, before Cristiano Ronaldo bagged a brace to seal the win.

The last competitive meeting between the sides was in a World Cup qualifier in 2021, which ended in a 0-0 draw in Ireland. Portugal won the reverse fixture 3-1, aiding their qualification for the Qatar 2022 World Cup. Ireland failed to qualify.

“Normally, when a player wins or achieves something, the next morning they don't have the same hunger. But I haven't seen that with Cristiano Ronaldo,” Martinez said ahead of the Ireland match.

“With him, the next morning is an opportunity to become better and win again. This is unique. I cannot explain it.

“He's had a 20-year career. He's not the same player as he was before, but he always finds a way to be useful. And he's an example to the others. His love of playing football and the national team is there for all to see. He has played more than 200 games and continues to set an example. He will be remembered forever.

On the qualification process, Martinez added: “The national team's focus is on trying to qualify. We continue step by step. The training camp in September was very good, but we can't lose what we did in September. Our focus is on trying to be at the best level against Ireland.”

“We know that we need to have almost a perfect game to get something from this match,” Heimir Hallgrimsson, the Republic of Ireland coach, said.

“If we do, we have a chance to steal a point or to win the game. Obviously, we need to try to keep a clean sheet. That's always going to make it easier.

“We have a game plan that we think is going to work. We'll see if that materialises. But obviously, if you look at the table, we need at least a minimum three points from this camp. And for obvious reasons, it's probably the Armenia game that everybody is saying: ‘OK, we can have a good performance and a better performance than in Armenia and get three points there.'”

This is only the 17th meeting between the European sides, with Portugal winning nine and Ireland winning four.

Ireland's last win in the fixture came in a friendly between the sides in 2005, courtesy of Andy O'Brien's solitary strike in Dublin. There have been four subsequent matches, of which Portugal have won three.

Ireland's last competitive win against Portugal came in a European Championships qualifier in 1995.

The fixture dates back to 1946 and began with a 3-1 home win for Portugal in a friendly.

Steve Nicol shows empathy for Rasmus Hojlund and says he was unfairly criticized during his time at Man United. (1:27)

Nigeria's Super Eagles go into their final match window of the 2026 FIFA World Cup qualifying group stage promising to fight to the end as they hope to take advantage of any slip-up by South Africa and Benin. But their bullish attitude has not yet panned out on the pitch, and the three-time African champions need more than words.

Forward Terem Moffi believes the Super Eagles will qualify for the World Cup, saying ""we are really confident things will go our way"" in a video published by the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF). But it is uncertain where he derives that confidence given the team's abysmal play and disastrous results in this qualifying campaign, especially with their fate no longer in their own hands. The Super Eagles need both South Africa and Benin to drop points to open the door for a Nigerian miracle.

Group C's top four teams each have a chance of claiming the sole ticket to the World Cup, if they can win their final two games, although Bafana Bafana are best placed with both their fixtures being played in South Africa. South Africa face neighbours Zimbabwe, who are bottom of the group with no hope of qualifying, before hosting Rwanda in their final qualifier.

For the Super Eagles, a win against Lesotho on Friday is all but non-negotiable before they host group leaders Benin in Uyo on Tuesday.

Captain William Troost-Ekong is optimistic the team's belief and fight will carry them through.

""We are always going to fight till the end,"" he said in an NFF-released video. ""We believe. We never stop believing. We have two important games now; Friday the first one, and after that we get back to Nigeria. But we will focus now on Lesotho.""

Few Nigerians share that confidence, however, even after the Super Eagles were handed a lifeline when South Africa were docked three points and three goals by FIFA for fielding the ineligible Teboho Mokoena in their 2-0 win over Lesotho in March.

Eritrea's withdrawal from qualifying opened the door further for the Super Eagles, allowing them the potential opportunity to qualify for the continental playoffs. Eritrea's withdrawal means teams vying for second place in the other groups will lose their points won against the bottom teams; Nigeria will lose only two points.

Fulham defender Calvin Bassey says the Super Eagles must remain calm and call on their experience.

""We have to remain calm and do what we have to do,"" he said. ""This is not the first time, club or country, any of us have been in high-pressure moments. So we've got an experienced team to handle this situation, and its just about doing everything right.""

There was a time when this bullish attitude would have been reassuring for Nigerian football fans, but the statement begs the question of where was that calmness and experience when the team was gifting points home and away in the previous games.

Complicating matters for Nigeria coach Éric Sékou Chelle is the absence of wing-back Ola Aina, injured on an atrocious pitch in the clash with South Africa at Toyota Stadium, Bloemfontein, in September. Fellow defender Bright Osayi-Samuel, midfielder Raphael Onyedika, and forward Cyriel Dessers are also out injured.

On the plus side, Chelle has two of Africa's best players in the past two years, Victor Osimhen and Ademola Lookman, to call upon.

Osimhen, who was injured and missed the Bafana fixture after being hacked by a Rwanda defender in Uyo days earlier, returns bringing fire and hopefully goals to Nigeria.

The draw at home to Lesotho was one of the results that have compromised the Super Eagles' chances of qualifying for the World Cup. Victory against the Crocodiles at the new Peter Mokaba Stadium in the South African city of Polokwane on Friday will not provide redemption, but it will at least keep their fighting chances alive.

To get that chance, they need goals; and to get goals, they need a healthy Osimhen.

The forward is a constant target of defenders, and he was savagely scythed in the game against Rwanda in September. The team must find ways to protect him while he is on the pitch. More importantly, they must feed him the right balls at the right time and in the right spots.

When Osimhen is on his game, the team wins; when he is not, bad things happen.

Lookman has been way off the pace in the past few games, his lack of playing time at Atalanta after a transfer dispute with the club possibly playing a part. But he is now getting some minutes in Italy, and, like Osimhen, is a threat when on his game.

The triumvirate of Osimhen, Lookman and Moses Simon were decisive in propelling Nigeria to the Africa Cup of Nations final last year, and the Super Eagles need them and the team to find their mojo individually and collectively.

If there is a misfire, Chelle should not hesitate to put the likes of Tolu Arokodare into the mix. The big forward has shown he can fill the void left by Osimhen when needed, and he can also be good foil for the former African Player of the Year.

The own goal against South Africa and previous defensive disasters, such as conceding the last-minute counterattack goal by Zimbabwe, represent the biggest issues that Nigeria have suffered during these qualifiers.

Chelle has to make a decision on Troost-Ekong. Does he trust his captain to bounce back from the errors that have plagued him through these qualifiers, and thrust him back into the starting lineup? Or does he go with the starting XI that defeated Rwanda?

Games, World Cup tickets, and even coaching jobs, are won and lost on decisions such as these, and Chelle must put it all on the line on Friday.

Whoever starts the game, Nigeria must eliminate defensive errors and remain locked in for 90 minutes and time added on. Surely, that cannot be too much to ask.","{'href': 'https://www.espn.com', 'title': 'ESPN'}","soccer"

File Copy: Super Eagles Players

Kindly share this story:

Nigeria's hopes of reaching the 2026 FIFA World Cup remain alive after a narrow 2-1 victory over Lesotho on Friday, but the Super Eagles face a challenging path to qualification in Qatar.

Nigeria sit third in Group C with 14 points despite their win. South Africa are second with 15 points after drawing with Zimbabwe, while Benin Republic lead the group with 17 points.

The race for automatic qualification now goes down to the last group matches.

To keep their 2026 World Cup dream alive, Nigeria must beat Benin Republic by at least two goals when they meet in their final group game on 14 October. This is because Benin Republic leads on goal difference with five goals, while Nigeria and South Africa are both on three goals.

A strong win is essential, as goal difference could decide the group winner.

The Super Eagles will also need some help. South Africa must either lose or draw against Rwanda in their last match. If South Africa wins, Nigeria's chances of qualifying automatically would be very slim.

Only the group winners secure direct qualification to the World Cup, while the four best runners-up go to the play-offs. This means every goal and point is now crucial.

France and Switzerland edged closer to World Cup qualification while Northern Ireland significantly improved their hopes 

That'll do from me tonight. John Brewin will be here tomorrow for another World Cup qualifying clockwatch.

A selection of friendly scores from around the world today:

Japan* 2-2 Paraguay*
 South Korea* 0-5 Brazil*
 Uruguay* 1-0 Dominican Republic
 Jordan* 0-1 Bolivia
 Russia 2-1 Iran*

*nations that have qualified for the World Cup

European champions Spain are in action tomorrow against Georgia (7.45pm BST). Sid Lowe has been speaking to Martín Zubimendi about Rodri, Arteta and settling in at Arsenal:

There are still 28 places up for grabs at next summer's World Cup. Andy Martin has the lowdown on who has already qualified …

Northern Ireland's goalscorer Trai Hume has been speaking to the BBC: “It was a great night, good performance and the most important thing is the three points. I think we deserved it.”

His goal to make it 2-0 against Slovakia was a delightful lob over a stranded Martin Dubravka: “I flicked the ball, the keeper has come to clear it, and I just had to guide it towards the goal and thankfully I did.”

He was full of praise for his “outstanding” captain, Conor Bradley, who will miss Monday's game against Germany through suspension.

Kári Tulinius, who had emailed to express his delight after Iceland made it 3-3 against Ukraine, reflects on what was eventually a 5-3 defeat:

I had hope for about 10 minutes. Oh well, I guess Iceland will just have to pick themselves up again and *checks notes* beat France in the next game. Well, hope was nice while it lasted, I guess.

North Macedonia will be thrilled with shutting out Belgium tonight. They lead Group J on 12pts ahead of Belgium (11pts), Wales (10pts), Kazakhstan (6pts) and Liechtenstein (0pts).

France are firmly in control of Group D. They lead on 9pts, with Ukraine (4pts) leapfrogging Iceland (3pts) after their ding-dong battle. Azerbaijan (1pt) bring up the rear.

The best Sweden can hope for now is probably a playoff spot. They are bottom of Group B on 1pt. Switzerland (9pts) are clear at the top ahead of Kosovo (4pts) and Slovenia (2pts).

Germany, Northern Ireland and Slovakia, then, all locked on six points at the top of Group A. They are all taking points off each other too. Still only halfway.

Northern Ireland host Germany on Monday night.

Group A
 Germany 4-0 Luxembourg
 Northern Ireland 2-0 Slovakia

Group B
 Kosovo 0-0 Slovenia
 Sweden 0-2 Switzerland

Group D
 France 3-0 Azerbaijan
 Iceland 3-5 Ukraine

Group J
 Belgium 0-0 North Macedonia
 Kazakhstan 4-0 Liechtenstein

The whistle goes at Windsor Park! Northern Ireland 2-0 Slovakia. What a result for Michael O'Neill. They are well in the mix now for even the automatic qualifying spot in Group A.

France 3-0 Azerbaijan, Germany 4-0 Luxembourg and Belgium 0-0 North Macedonia are finished.

Kosovo 0-0 Slovenia is a final score. Yes, that has been happening …

Johan Manzambi finishes off Sweden tonight and perhaps their hopes of qualifying for the World Cup. Full-time in Stockholm.

Surely that's wrapped up now. Oleg Ocheretko scores Ukraine's fifth!

Another twist in this one! Iceland had come back from 3-1 down to level it but Ivan Kaliuzhnyi gives Ukraine the lead once more.

Yes, that Florian Thauvin. The former Newcastle winger – now at Lens – scores his first international goal, and an acrobatic one at that, since 2019 to seal the points for France!

What a finish from Trai Hume! Dubravka comes out to deal with a flick-on and punches the ball out to Hume on the edge of the box. First time on the volley, the Sunderland man loops the ball back over the goalkeeper and it bounces into the roof of the net. Could that be a clincher for Northern Ireland?

It's all square again in Reykjavik! Albert Gudmundsson has his second and Iceland's third.

Conor Bradley is looking miffed at being shown a yellow card for bumping into Lukas Haraslin. The Northern Ireland captain will now miss Monday's visit of Germany through suspension, so no wonder.

Latest scores with some 20 minutes remaining.

Group A
 Germany 4-0 Luxembourg
 Northern Ireland 1-0 Slovakia

Group B
 Kosovo 0-0 Slovenia
 Sweden 0-1 Switzerland

Group D
 France 2-0 Azerbaijan
 Iceland 2-3 Ukraine

Group J
 Belgium 0-0 North Macedonia
 Kazakhstan 4-0 Liechtenstein (FT)

Adrien Rabiot doubles France's lead at the Parc des Princes with a downwards header at the back post. He seems to save his best football for his national team, that man.

Slovakia rue a missed chance at Windsor Park. David Strelec is played through but his effort is agonisingly wide of the far post.

Sweden have a mountain to climb now. Granit Xhaka converts from the spot after Alexander Bernhardsson was penalised for a foul on Djibril Sow in the area.

Is there a comeback on in Reykjavik? Albert Gudmundsson pulls a goal back for the hosts, who need one more to stop their opponents overtaking them in the group.

Jamie Reid has the ball in the net for Northern Ireland! He ghosts in at the back post to get on the end of a cross … but the offside flag goes up. Still 1-0.

This is going south quickly for 10-man Luxembourg. Joshua Kimmich gets his second of the game as he reacts first to a loose ball from a Germany corner.

Serge Gnabry gets his goal. His first-half strike was disallowed for handball but now the Bayern Munich winger makes the most of a lucky bounce and finds the back of the net.

Jamie Reid threatens again for Northern Ireland but Slovakia manage to get close to him before he can get a shot away. Shea Charles's corner comes to nothing.

Belgium will have wondered how they went into the break at 0-0 against North Macedonia having had 82% possession and 12 shots at goal. Still, the visitors lead the group.

We are back under way. A very important half of football for Northern Ireland in particular. And Sweden.

Anders Stephanson has more news about a “truly remarkable sitter” in Stockholm:

Bergvall served by Isak (who in turn was served by Gyökeres), open goal from about 3 feet and he stepped on the ball. Hope the chap gets over that one ...

It's stalemate at the break in Stockholm where Sweden host Switzerland. Alexander Isak has hit the post for the hosts but his partnership with Viktor Gyökeres is yet to produce a goal.

Half-time reading for you comes from Nick Ames, who is in Oslo ahead of tomorrow's World Cup qualifier between Norway and Israel.

Here's how it looks across Europe at the break.

Group A
 Germany 2-0 Luxembourg
 Northern Ireland 1-0 Slovakia

Group B
 Kosovo 0-0 Slovenia
 Sweden 0-0 Switzerland

Group D
 France 1-0 Azerbaijan
 Iceland 1-3 Ukraine

Group J
 Belgium 0-0 North Macedonia
 Kazakhstan 4-0 Liechtenstein (FT)

Five minutes of first-half stoppage time yield a third Ukraine goal. Malinovskyi gets his second of the game.

On the stroke of half-time, France are ahead. Kylian Mbappé scores his 53rd goal for his country at the Parc and it's a beauty. He picks the ball up deep and drives at the defence, jinking his way past a couple of players before stroking the ball into the bottom corner.

Ukraine regain the lead in Reykjavik through Oleksiy Gutsulyak.

Still Azerbaijan hold firm in Paris. They are yet to register a shot against France but it's still 0-0.

Huge chance for Northern Ireland! Bradley runs clear on the break. The ball eventually falls to Jamie Reid but he can only prod over.

Iceland level it against Ukraine through Genoa's Mikael Egill Ellertsson. All square at 1-1 in Reykjavik.

Conor Bradley is then on the end of some rough treatment from Slovakia's Leo Sauer. Northern Ireland whip the free-kick into the box but Dubravka punches it clear.

Northern Ireland's Justin Devenny has a shot saved at his near post by Martin Dubravka. It's looking promising for Michael O'Neill's team.

France are yet to make the breakthrough against Azerbaijan. They've had 72% possession, 10 shots and four corners so far.

Northern Ireland, Slovakia and Germany all locked on 6pts in Group A as it stands.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","soccer"

Liverpool's record signing striker Alexander Isak has been hammered for his behaviour during the protracted move away from Newcastle this summer. Isak effectively went on strike, refusing to train for the Magpies, but finally completing his switch to the Premier League champions in a £125 million ($166.7m) deadline day move.

Will he or won't he? Lionel Messi has a massive decision to make and, just eight months before the start of the 2026 World Cup, we still don't know whether he'll lead Argentina's title defence. ""At my age, it's only logical to think I might not,"" the 38-year-old told TyC Sports just last month. But, let's face it, there's never really anything logical about Messi's career.

He's football's miracle-man, blessed with a heavenly gift for making a mockery of the laws of physiology and physics. Truth be told, what he achieved with Argentina at the last World Cup in Qatar shouldn't have been possible either. He was 35 at the time and still running rings around the likes of Josko Gvardiol. 

However, if Messi does decide to walk away from the international arena before next summer's tournament in North America, how would Argentina cope? After all, it would be an ""enormous loss"", as coach Lionel Scaloni recently admitted, because ""there will be no heir to Messi"". The man is irreplaceable, both as a player and a leader. Scaloni, though, has already been preparing for a future without his talismanic No.10 and there's already a strong support structure in place. 

For starters, under Scaloni, the fundamental game plan has never changed thus far, whether Messi plays or not, while the coach also says that Argentina are already in possession of players capable of limiting the damage caused by their skipper's inevitable retirement. Nico Paz is undoubtedly one such player...","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

England showed little mercy as they tore Wales apart in a 3-0 friendly win at Wembley on Thursday. The Three Lions destroyed Craig Bellamy's side in a frantic opening 20 minutes which all but put an end to any hope of the visitors securing an unlikely upset between World Cup qualifiers, even despite the hosts leaving some key players on the bench and out of the squad completely.

A fine evening for England saw Morgan Rogers break the deadlock inside the opening two minutes, taking advantage of a Wales defence that switched off after Marc Guehi kept a loose corner alive, with the Aston Villa man rolling his effort past a helpless Karl Darlow between the sticks.

Before too long, it was 2-0. Rogers and Guehi were both involved again, with the former's speculative cross flicked on by the latter and into Ollie Watkins, who was waiting at the far post to convert and had time to take a couple of touches, such were Wales' horrendous defensive instincts.

Home supporters were soon cheering and revelling in their rivals' misery again soon after when Bukayo Saka found the top corner with an outrageous strike from the edge of the box, and though England could have had five or six on the night, that proved to be the end of their scoring, much to the relief of Craig Bellamy and his men.

Two-time Rolex Shanghai Masters champion Roger Federer was back on centre court in China on Friday for an exhibition match, teaming with actor Donnie Yen to play actor Wu Lei and former WTA star Zheng Jie.

In a match featuring three tie-breaks, Federer and Yen earned a comeback victory, 5-7, 10-8, 7-1.

While the Chinese actors admitted to feeling nerves before the match, Federer praised their effort: ""It shows that you care,"" he said of their pre-match jitters. ""I think you did really well. Thank you for coming. I could see you had a great time.""

The Swiss also credited Yen and Wu for their hard work in preparing for the match: ""I want to say about practicing so hard to get ready for the match, for Donnie and for you, Lei. [Jie and I] don't have to practice as much as them, but just to see the passion behind the practice sessions, I hope they can carry it after the match as well,"" he said. ""And also maybe people who are watching and who are here at the stadium, just to show how important sports is for everyday life, for happiness. I'm happy we could share centre court here in Qizhong Stadium today.""

Federer also played an exhibition match last year in Shanghai, teaming with Chinese singer and actor Eason Chan against the ATP Tour's Zhang Zhizhen and table tennis champion Fan Zhendong.

In his competitive playing days, former No. 1 in the PIF ATP Rankings Federer posted a 23-6 record in Shanghai, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index. The Swiss won titles in 2014 and 2017. He also reached the final in his 2010 debut, and made his eighth and final appearance in 2019.

Unseeded Andre Goransson and Alex Michelsen defeated top seeds Marcelo Arevalo and Mate Pavic 7-6(2), 2-6, 10-7 on Friday to reach the final of the Rolex Shanghai Masters.

The first-time duo was 0 for 7 on break points in the one-hour, 41-minute match, including 0 of 5 in the first set. Despite Goransson getting broken in the fourth and eighth games of the second set, they regrouped in the Match Tie-break.

Goransson/Michelsen went up 3-0 in the deciding tie-break and after Arevalo/Pavic tied it at 3-3, both teams held serve until Arevalo double-faulted at 7-8. Arevalo then hit a forehand wide on match point, putting the Swede and American in the final.

""It was like three or four days before I went to Laver Cup, he texted me and I was like, why not,"" said Michelsen on how they teamed up. ""Now we're in the final.""

Goransson is the first Swede to reach the doubles final in tournament history (since 2009) and he will attempt to become the first Swede to win an ATP Masters 1000 doubles title since Robert Lindstedt in 2012 Cincinnati (with Horia Tecau). Goransson will be appearing in his first ATP Masters 1000 final and eighth career final (3-4). His last title came in April at the 500-level tournament in Munich, with Sem Verbeek. His other titles came in Newport last year (also with Verbeek) and Pune in 2020 (with Christopher Rungkat).

""It feels amazing and my first Masters 1000 final ever, so obviously I am really, really excited,"" said Goransson. ""It was quite nerve-wracking towards the end there, but it's amazing to get through with a win.""



Michelsen is the first American to reach the Shanghai doubles final since 2016, when John Isner and Jack Sock won the title. This is the 21-year-old California native's third career ATP Tour final (0-2), having lost in Stuttgart in June (with Rajeev Ram) and last year at the Cincinnati ATP Masters 1000 (with Mackenzie McDonald).

""This is feeling really good,"" said Michelsen. ""That's the team I lost to in the final in Cincinnati last year, so super good to get the win over those boys, they're very good, and we're excited about the challenge in the final.""

Goransson and Michelsen will take on No. 3 seeds Kevin Krawietz and Tim Puetz or alternates Guido Andreozzi and Manuel Guinard. The Germans will play the Argentine/French duo in the semi-finals on Saturday.

It didn't take long for Beatriz Haddad Maia to deliver Sao Paulo's moment of magic -- a deft tweener followed by a backhand winner that captured both the crowd and September's Shot of the Month.

It took just three games for Beatriz Haddad Maia to deliver one of the year's most memorable moments.

Playing as the top seed at the SP Open in Sao Paulo, the Brazilian produced a dazzling piece of improvisation against qualifier Miriana Tona. After a long exchange, Haddad Maia sprinted toward the baseline, slid into position and pulled off a perfectly timed tweener -- then followed it up with a clean backhand winner down the line.

The crowd loved it. The commentator's immediate reaction -- “How entertaining was that?” -- said it all.

Haddad Maia went on to win the match 6-1, 6-1, advancing to the quarterfinals before her run came to an end. But the point itself stood apart: quick thinking, athleticism and precise execution in front of a home audience.

Now ranked No. 34, the former Top 10 player remains one of the tour's most dynamic shot-makers -- and her Sao Paulo tweener earns her September's Shot of the Month.

After six straight losses against Iga Swiatek, Jasmine Paolini delivered a 6-1, 6-2 masterclass to oust the No. 2 player and reach the Wuhan semifinals, while strengthening her bid for the final WTA Finals spot.

The history was bleak for Jasmine Paolini.

Coming into this Dongfeng Voyah · Wuhan Open quarterfinal, she had lost all six meetings with Iga Swiatek -- and managed to win only a single set.

But on a warm Friday night at the Optics Valley International Tennis Centre, Paolini changed the course of that history, stunning Swiatek 6-1, 6-2. It was over in 65 minutes.

The irrepressible 29-year-old Italian will face No. 3 Coco Gauff in a Saturday semifinal (5 p.m. local time, 5 a.m. ET). Gauff won the first two career meetings against Paolini (2021 Adelaide and 2023 Cincinnati) but lost the most recent three (Stuttgart, Rome and Cincinnati) -- all this season.

Paolini also improved her odds of securing the final singles qualifying spot for the PIF WTA Finals in Riyadh over Elena Rybakina, who fell earlier to Aryna Sabalenka, and Mirra Andreeva. With Jessica Pegula's quarterfinal win, coupled with Rybakina's loss, Pegula has now officially qualified for Riyadh.

Paolini was aggressive, feeding off the pace of Swiatek's strokes. Remarkably, despite the attack mode she was in, Paolini was credited with only three unforced errors, against 15 winners.

How dialed in was Paolini? Swiatek faced six break points in the match -- and Paolini won them all.

“Finally I won a match,” Paolini said in her on-court interview. “I'm super happy about my level. Just feels amazing.”

Paolini announced her intent early in this one, breaking Swiatek at love with a thundering return winner. It was 4-0 before Swiatek managed to hold serve, but Paolini broke her for the third time to put away the set when Swiatek sent a hurried forehand into the net.

Paolini played a virtually flawless opening 26-minute frame, stroking seven winners and, incredibly, one unforced error.

The second set was much the same. Paolini was up 2-0, but Swiatek scored her first break of the match to get it back on serve. But Paolini broke back -- at love -- with another fabulous return winner to take an insurmountable 3-1 lead.

Last year, Paolini vaulted into stardom by reaching back-to-back finals at Roland Garros and Wimbledon. All season long, she's been asked if she can sustain those breakthroughs.

Here's your answer: The win over Swiatek was her 41st WTA Tour main-draw win in 2025 -- one more than last year. Paolini now has 26 WTA 1000 wins this year, tied for second with Sabalenka behind Swiatek's 28.

Earlier, Gauff was an efficient 6-3, 6-0 winner over Laura Siegemund.

The 21-year-old American returned exceptionally well, winning 27 of 45 points against Siegemund's serve and breaking her five times.

“It was a pretty straightforward match,” Gauff said afterward. “She's a tricky and tough player, but I thought that I did well being patient and waiting for opportunities.”

Gauff, winner of seven of eight matches in Beijing and Wuhan, leads all Hologic WTA Tour players with 15 victories in China over the past two years. She's the first woman in the 16-year history of WTA 1000s to reach five consecutive semifinals in China.

Seven of Jessica Pegula's last eight matches have gone to three sets, which begs the question: Over the course of her career, what have been her most epic matches? The American shared her picks ahead of her semifinal bout with Aryna Sabalenka.

What an Asian swing for Jessica Pegula.

Three-set match after three-set match after three-set match. Marathon tiebreakers. Come from behind wins.

It's been a productive month in China for Pegula, who helped lead the United States to the Billie Jean King Cup final in Shenzhen before making back-to-back semifinal runs in Beijing and Wuhan. But it's been anything but easy.

Since the start of the China Open, seven of the American's eight matches have gone the distance. (She also won 11-9 and 8-6 tiebreaks over Emma Raducanu and Hailey Baptiste, respectively.) 

Her latest three-set win came on Friday, a 2-6, 6-0, 6-3 victory over Katerina Siniakova to reach the final four in Wuhan.

Speaking after the match about her recent run of dramatic matches, the World No. 6 was asked which matches over the course of her career stick out as the most memorable. 

Interestingly, the 31-year-old chose a pair of losses to Aryna Sabalenka at the US Open -- the 2024 final and the semifinal in New York last month.

""They were both really crazy, super entertaining, in a full [Arthur Ashe Stadium],"" Pegula told reporters. ""It was super loud, being an American. Even though I lost both of them, that atmosphere, and the level we showed, put them up there as two of the best matches.""

She then picked a third match, this one a win over Karolina Muchova in the 2024 US Open semis. After dropping the first set 6-1, Pegula stormed back to take the next two sets to advance to her first-ever Slam final.

""Coming back in the Muchova semifinal last year was, mentally, a huge hurdle,"" the nine-time Hologic WTA Tour champion said. ""The way I was able to close that out in three, those kinds of matches are what come to mind, just in terms of the level, the different challenges, playing great players. Just being on Ashe as an American, with the atmosphere, is something that is super special.""

Winning in Wuhan this weekend would also be super special. It would be her fourth career WTA 1000 title, after winning in Guadalajara in 2022 and back-to-back Canadian Open trophies in 2023 and 2024.

As it happens, Pegula will play Sabalenka -- who has a 20-0 record in Wuhan -- for a spot in the final.

Will this one be as memorable as the matches in Ashe? We sure hope so.

 

Seven of Jessica Pegula's last eight matches have gone to three sets, which begs the question: Over the course of her career, what have been her most epic matches?

Aryna Sabalenka improved to 20-0 at the Dongfeng Voyah · Wuhan Open with her first ever straight-sets win over Elena Rybakina in the quarterfinals.

For the first time, Aryna Sabalenka has defeated Elena Rybakina in straight sets. The No. 1 seed delivered a near-flawless performance in the Dongfeng Voyah · Wuhan Open quarterfinals, advancing 6-3, 6-3 in 1 hour and 25 minutes.

Wuhan: Scores | Draws | Order of play

Coming into the match, Sabalenka had a 7-5 head-to-head lead over Rybakina. Her victories had come on hard courts, clay and grass; in Europe, Asia, Australia and North America. But they had one thing in common: all seven had been three-set battles.

""We have a really huge history against each other,"" as Sabalenka put it in her on-court interview. ""Always great battles, always push me to the limit to get the win.""

That was less the case this time. Appropriately, Sabalenka's most decisive win in the series came at the tournament she has dominated since 2019. The World No. 1 improved her perfect record in Wuhan to 20-0, and she is now just two wins away from a fourth title in as many appearances. The US Open champion is also on an active winning streak of nine straight matches. She'll get the chance to improve those numbers even more against No. 6 seed Jessica Pegula in the semifinals; she's 8-2 overall against the American, including 4-0 in the last two seasons.

Sabalenka holds off late charge: Through the first six games, there was little to separate the rivals. Going toe-to-toe with each other from the baseline, Sabalenka and Rybakina racked up breathtaking winners galore, coming through a pair of tight service holds each without facing break point.

At 3-3, 30-30, Rybakina had a golden opportunity to bring up the first break opportunity of the match, conjuring a perfect defensive lob to get back into the point -- but she sent the short forehand way over the baseline, and Sabalenka escaped with a hold. That proved to be the turning point, and the start of a five-game run for Sabalenka that took her to a 2-0 lead in the second set.

In this passage of play, Sabalenka was free-flowing on her forehand and sharp from defensive positions, while Rybakina's level dipped and her unforced errors mounted. Another flurry of forehand winners in a game Rybakina had led 40-0 enabled Sabalenka to steal the double break for 4-1 in the second set.

Closing out the match wasn't simple. Sabalenka served three double faults over her next two service games, paving the way for Rybakina to get one of the breaks back and to hold a point to level at 4-4. But the Kazakhstani player netted a volley on that break point, enabling Sabalenka to escape once again. Having avoided the momentum shift, Sabalenka converted her first match point as Rybakina sent a forehand long in the next game.

Aryna Sabalenka improved to 20-0 at the Dongfeng Voyah · Wuhan Open with her first ever straight-sets win over Elena Rybakina in the quarterfinals.","{'href': 'https://www.wtatennis.com', 'title': 'WTA Tennis'}","tennis"

The 20-time Grand Slam champion officially hung up his racquets at the 2022 Laver Cup, but has remained a fixture in and around the tennis world, taking part in an emotional retirement ceremony for rival Rafael Nadal at Roland Garros earlier this spring.Laver Cup Chairman Tony Godsick, who has worked with Federer since 2005, suggested last month that the former world No. 1 might be working on a larger-scale return to the sport.

Laver Cup Chairman Tony Godsick, who has worked with Federer since 2005, suggested last month that the former world No. 1 might be working on a larger-scale return to the sport.

Filmmaker Donnie Yen, actor Wu Lei, and former WTA world No. 15 Zheng Jie joined Federer in Friday in Shanghai.

“He's looking for the next thing,” said Godsick, teasing a potential exhibition tour with Nadal and other greats from the last two decades.“Roger just wanted to make sure that his knee was fine. He didn't want to be totally broken after his career, so he gave it a little bit of time. He's not there yet but he's in the gym a lot. I think Rafa's interested, I don't want to speak for Rafa. But it would be great to see these guys out there.“Plus, there's a lot of other guys of their generation that I think would be willing to play too. Some of the biggest names are these guys who just retired, so we can probably fill some nice stadiums and venues.”

“Plus, there's a lot of other guys of their generation that I think would be willing to play too. Some of the biggest names are these guys who just retired, so we can probably fill some nice stadiums and venues.”

Federer echoed that sentiment earlier that week in an interview with CNBC.“I've been trying to keep in good shape,” said the Swiss, who won 103 ATP singles titles and spent 310 weeks atop the ATP rankings. “I know that Rafa is also totally open to maybe play some tennis. It sounds terrible, ‘seniors tennis,' to us, but maybe we can create a tour, like a ‘Fedal Tour' or something like that. It would be cool.“I think that's one of the reasons why I started the Laver Cup, to shine a light on the past greats of the game. Maybe with a seniors tour, we've had a little of that in tennis…but there's a lot of appetite for seeing past champions in tennis, as well. I could maybe look into that with Rafa, for sure.”Partnering Yen, Federer ultimately defeated Wu and Zheng, 5-7, 10-8, 7-1.

Of course that's not all Medvedev, who is a showman in his own unique and sometimes self-destructive way, was thinking as he sent his racquets into the audience.“At the same time I was like, ‘The fans are probably going to love it.'”Medvedev's loss to Bonzi didn't turn out to be a sign of his imminent collapse. Instead, it was a pivot point and a wake-up call. After the Open, he split with his coach, and sideline punching bag, Gilles Cervara, after eight years together.

Johansson seemed to tell Medvedev just the right thing, at just the right time, in his quarterfinal with Alex de Minaur on Friday.

Medvedev won the first set 6-4, and saved a break point to make it 4-4 in the second. But he was teetering a bit physically in the high heat—the same heat that had made him cramp twice already in China. Johansson told him, from what I could hear, that anytime he got a ball around the service line, he should “dictate.” From 15-30, Medvedev did just that. He flattened out a forehand and put it on the baseline for a winner, and then did the same with a backhand two points later to break. One more comfortable service hold and he was into the semis for the second straight week.“I was really clutch in important moments,” Medvedev said. “I was hitting the ball great, I was putting him under pressure. The second set was tough, tight, but I managed to really bring the best of me in the last two games.”What's different about this Medvedev than the one we saw for the first eight months of the year? Against De Minaur, he tried to use his octopus-like athleticism for offense as well as defense. He ran around to hit more forehands, and ended up with 27 winners, while winning 79 percent of first-serve points. Those are good numbers against a speedy wallboard like De Minaur.More telling, perhaps, Medvedev was 10 of 11 at net. He stretched out his long right arm to put one volley away, and deftly measured another short one for a winner. He has never been a net-rusher; in fact, he's famous for retreating to the baseline when he has a chance to move in. But his wingspan makes it a natural place for him to finish points, and, just as important for someone approaching his 30s, end them more quickly.

Afterward, Medvedev was asked if his good run of form this week came as a surprise.“I have to be honest I did expect this,” he said. “I played great in Beijing. I was serving for the match to be in the final.”Medvedev can be an exasperating figure. He's always a couple of bad games away from flying off the handle, berating his coaches and the chair umpire, and throwing, as he says, a “tantrum.” But tennis is still better with him than without him. Off the court he's a thoughtful, engaging person and a great interview, and at least his tantrums usually come with a viral-worthy quip or two.

He'll get another chance to play there, against Arthur Rinderknech in the semis, on Saturday.

Ella Lloyd reflects on her season so far in F1 Academy

McLaren have secured a milestone 10th Teams' Championship in 2025 – but where does the achievement rank amongst the squad's other title triumphs?

The Singapore Grand Prix marked a milestone moment for McLaren, the squad sealing the 10th Teams' Championship of their long and storied history. Having so far achieved 12 wins, 28 podiums and a whopping 650 points in 2025, the Woking-based outfit wrapped up the title with six rounds of the campaign remaining.

It is doubtless an impressive feat – but how does this success compare to the team's previous triumphant seasons? Well, we've taken a shot at ranking each of McLaren's 10 Teams' Championships, from their first in 1974 through to their latest.

As ever, this comes with the caveat that Formula 1 has undergone various changes – such as developments to the points-scoring system and the increased number races in a season – across the team's title-winning campaigns, making comparisons tricky, but we have tried to balance statistics with sentiment in our list.

Don't quite agree with our order? Let us know which of the team's titles you rate as the greatest in the poll below…

Drivers – Niki Lauda and Alain Prost
Races – 16, Wins – 6 (37.5%), Podiums – 12 (37.5%), Points – 90

While it feels unfair to rank any title triumph at the bottom, we start with the 1985 crown. Such has been the success that McLaren have experienced in their championship-winning seasons that this campaign – in which they took victory in six out of 16 races – features one of their lower winning percentages.

Arriving into the season off the back of title glory in 1984 (more on which later), 1985 brought with it increased competition as seven drivers – from five different teams – each won races.

McLaren's Alain Prost – who had just missed out on the Drivers' title in 1984 to team mate Niki Lauda – emerged victorious in a total of five Grands Prix, while Lauda stood on the top step just once.

This ultimately gave the squad their third Teams' Championship and marked the first time that they had achieved back-to-back titles.

Drivers – Ayrton Senna and Gerhard Berger
Races – 16, Wins – 6 (37.5%), Podiums – 18 (56.3%), Points – 121

The 1990 season marked a change in driver line-up for McLaren, with Gerhard Berger arriving to partner Ayrton Senna after tensions boiled over between the Brazilian and previous team mate Alain Prost (again, more to come on that).

Prost's move to Ferrari saw his former team pick up fewer wins, with Senna leading the charge as he again went head-to-head with the Frenchman in the championship fight.

That battle ended in infamous style when the rivals controversially collided into the first corner at the Japanese Grand Prix, immediately putting both out of the race and handing Senna the Drivers' crown in the process.

McLaren, meanwhile, took the Teams' Championship with an 11-point margin from Ferrari.

Drivers – Ayrton Senna and Gerhard Berger
Races – 16, Wins – 8 (50%), Podiums – 18 (56.3%), Points – 139

The 1991 crown was a historic achievement for McLaren, marking the team's fourth consecutive championship victory. This run of form was unbeaten for several years, with only Ferrari (six titles between 1999-2004) and Mercedes (eight titles between 2014-2021) bettering the record.

Amid previous rivals Ferrari falling away, reigning Drivers' Champion Ayrton Senna kicked off his and the team's title defence in commanding style, winning all four of the campaign's opening races including his long-awaited first home victory in Brazil.

Despite Williams emerging as their nearest competitor as the campaign progressed, McLaren did enough to fend off the challenge and secure their seventh Teams' title to complete a remarkable run of four back-to-back championships, while Senna clinched his third Drivers' crown.

It would prove to be the final time that Senna became a World Champion, while McLaren would have to wait several years for their next title…

Drivers – Emerson Fittipaldi and Denny Hulme
Races – 15, Wins – 4 (26.7%), Podiums – 10 (33.3%), Points – 73

Statistically, McLaren's 1974 triumph is another to feature a lower winning percentage, the squad having taken victory in four out of 15 races.

However, needless to say, this championship was an incredibly important one as it marked the first time that the team had experienced title glory since making their F1 debut back in 1966.

With the strong pairing of World Champions Emerson Fittipaldi and Denny Hulme at the wheel, McLaren finally earned a long-awaited Teams' title, while Fittipaldi also scored the squad's first Drivers' crown.

Coming just four years after the death of founder Bruce McLaren, the feat was an emotional one. As Fittipaldi recounted in a McLaren interview last year: “At the time, we were 28 people, now it's 1,000. For sure, it created even more motivation for the future. History tells us what happened next, with so many fantastic World Champions.”

Drivers – Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri
Races – 24, Wins – 6 (25%), Podiums – 21 (43.6%), Points – 666

On paper, the 2024 championship features McLaren's lowest percentage of race wins across their title-winning years. But, as ever, the numbers only tell part of the story, with this triumph proving hugely significant in the papaya squad's history.

After Red Bull collected both 2023 titles in one of the most dominant performances ever witnessed in the sport, it initially appeared that the Milton Keynes-based outfit had carried that form through by surging to a 1-2 in the season-opening Bahrain Grand Prix.

McLaren finished that race well off the podium – but, after a major upgrade to the car on the weekend of Lando Norris' debut victory in Miami, the team rapidly became a force to be reckoned with, taking the fight to Max Verstappen and Red Bull in both championships.

While the Drivers' crown ultimately proved elusive – and the team made some strategic errors along the way – McLaren were able to keep a chasing Ferrari at bay during the Abu Dhabi season finale to secure their first Teams' title since 1998, a feat that would scarcely have seemed believable when the squad started 2023 near the back of the field.

Drivers – Mika Hakkinen and David Coulthard
Races – 16, Wins – 9 (56.3%), Podiums – 20 (62.5%), Points – 156

As previously mentioned, the 2024 success was McLaren's first Teams' crown in 26 years, with the last one prior to that also marking something of a comeback story.

Following their aforementioned 1991 victory, the squad were overhauled by Williams – and Benetton – in the seasons that followed. But a change to the technical regulations in 1998 was an opportunity that McLaren seized, with the MP4-13 proving the class of the field when the campaign got underway.

The team faced increased competition as the season progressed – with this arguably marking the start of Mika Hakkinen and Michael Schumacher's classic rivalry as they fought for the Drivers' Championship – and Ferrari were still in with a chance of taking the crown at the season-closing Japanese Grand Prix.

However, a flawless performance from Hakkinen at Suzuka – coupled with misfortune for Schumacher, who was forced to retire after suffering a puncture – secured both titles for McLaren. And while the squad could not make it back-to-back Teams' Championships in 1999, Hakkinen went on to secure another Drivers' crown.

Drivers – Alain Prost and Ayrton Senna
Races – 16, Wins – 10 (62.5%), Podiums – 18 (56.3%), Points – 141

As we head towards the top end of our ranking, we now move into some of McLaren's most dominant championship successes, seasons that also brought with them some truly iconic moments – and battles – along the way.

The 1989 season marked the second year in which Alain Prost and Ayrton Senna formed the team's line-up, a formidable pairing that had (spoiler alert) already secured title glory during the 1988 campaign.

While new regulations outlawing turbocharged engines had come into effect, McLaren appeared to have tackled the change smoothly as 1989 began, with Senna and Prost claiming six and four wins respectively amid another fierce title fight between the two.

The Drivers' Championship ended in controversy, with Senna being disqualified from the Japanese Grand Prix for cutting a chicane after rejoining the track following a collision with Prost, a result that gave the crown to the latter. But, internal tensions aside, the duo again brought home the Teams' title in their final campaign as team mates.

Drivers – Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri
Races – 24 (18 completed so far), Wins – 12 (66.7%), Podiums – 28 (77.8%), Points – 650*
*From season so far

Arguably, the dominance of McLaren in this year's Teams' Championship could put this success even higher in our ranking. But given that the season is still playing out – and the Drivers' crown is crucially yet to be decided – we have opted for the number 3 spot.

While the 2024 season saw the papaya squad slowly gain momentum, there was no such process this time around, with the team immediately quick out of the blocks at the start of the 2025 campaign.

Drivers' Championship leader Oscar Piastri and team mate Lando Norris have achieved seven and five Grand Prix wins respectively so far, which has included an impressive seven 1-2 finishes. This gave McLaren such a sizeable lead over their rivals that the Teams' title was wrapped up in Singapore, tying with Red Bull's 2023 record for the earliest championship win in the sport's history.

There have been hiccups along the way – and questions remain over how the squad will handle any tensions that may linger between their drivers following that first-lap incident at Marina Bay – but McLaren's all-round form in 2025 has been an extraordinary achievement.

Drivers – Niki Lauda and Alain Prost
Races – 16, Wins – 12 (75%), Podiums – 18 (56.3%), Points – 143.5

McLaren did not trouble the top of the standings during the late 1970s, the squad going on to end the 1980 season down in ninth place. However, after joining the likes of Ferrari in switching to a turbocharged engine, their fortunes started to turn around into the ‘80s, culminating in a stunning 1984 campaign.

With Alain Prost returning to partner Niki Lauda – forming another one of the team's strongest line-ups – the pair quickly became a dominant force at the wheel of the MP4/2, a car that brought them an incredible 12 victories in 16 races including a run of seven consecutive wins in the second half of the year.

While Prost had outscored Lauda on victories – claiming seven triumphs over Lauda's five – the Frenchman ultimately lost out on the Drivers' Championship by just half a point to the Austrian, meaning that his debut title had to wait until 1985.

He did, however, get to experience championship glory in the Teams' category, McLaren storming to the crown – their first in 10 years – on 143.5 points. To put that dominance into perspective, closest challengers Ferrari had amassed only 57.5 in comparison.

Drivers – Alain Prost and Ayrton Senna
Races – 16, Wins – 15 (93.8%), Podiums – 25 (78.1%), Points – 199

It is hard to argue with the notion that the 1988 season marked McLaren's greatest triumph, a campaign in which an all-star driver line-up – and a brewing rivalry between them – was paired with a benchmark-setting car to create magic.

After two years of finishing second in the championship, the Woking-based squad bolstered their chances of changing that statistic with the MP4/4, a Honda-powered challenger often touted as one of the greatest cars in Formula 1 history.

With race winner Ayrton Senna joining the team alongside two-time World Champion Alain Prost, the duo kickstarted a season of utter dominance from the off. In a 16-race calendar, McLaren astonishingly won all but one Grand Prix, seven of these going to Prost while eight were claimed by Senna.

Amid rising tensions with Prost, it was Senna who clinched a maiden Drivers' Championship by just three points, while the outfit surged to the Teams' crown with a total of 199 points, giving them a significant buffer of 134 points over second-placed Ferrari.

Many years on, McLaren's winning percentage of that season remains the second greatest in the sport's history – indeed, they continued to hold the record for the highest up until just two years ago, when they were bettered by Red Bull's 2023 campaign.

Ella Lloyd reflects on her season so far in F1 Academy

After labelling Kimi Antonelli's Monza weekend as ""underwhelming"", Mercedes boss Toto Wolff has been impressed by the youngster's performances in Azerbaijan and Singapore.

Toto Wolff believes that his comments on Kimi Antonelli's “underwhelming” weekend at Monza might have helped to motivate the youngster, with the Mercedes boss suggesting that it “lit a fire under the a***” of the rookie following two stronger outings in Baku and Singapore.

After a decent start to his maiden campaign in Formula 1, Antonelli faced a tougher run of form during the European leg of the season, during which he recorded four retirements and just two points finishes towards the latter end of the top 10.

This culminated in another difficult outing at the Italian Grand Prix in September, with Antonelli beaching his car in the gravel following a spin off track during FP2.

After a P9 in Sunday's race, Wolff labelled the 19-year-old's performance at the Italian Grand Prix in September as “underwhelming”, adding: “You can't put the car in the gravel bed and then expect to be there.”

However, Antonelli has gone on to enjoy better weekends since, having claimed P4 in the Azerbaijan Grand Prix before crossing the line fifth in Singapore, a track he has never previously raced at.

Speaking to Sky Sports F1 during the weekend at the Marina Bay Street Circuit, Wolff suggested that Antonelli's approach has changed across recent events.

“Since Baku I think we've seen a lot of big focus,” the Team Principal explained. “Certainly Europe hasn't helped, because there was so much attention on him and expectations were so high.

“I feel like he has less work outside, in terms of media duties and sponsorship duties, and he's spending all of his time with his engineering team and that's good.”

Pushed on whether he felt that Antonelli responded well to the kind of remarks he had made after Monza, Wolff responded: “I think it's a learning process also with Kimi to what he responds well [to], and we've always encouraged him, even encouraged [him] to make mistakes because this is the last year of these regulations.

“All the other drivers had got used to these cars – it's his first year, he doesn't know the track, he doesn't know all of this world.

“So for next year everybody starts at zero with a car that you need to learn and, in that respect, I think he's doing a good job, and it seems to have worked to [have] lit a little bit of fire under the a***, so we'll see.”

In terms of whether he is seeing qualities in Antonelli that hint at a future potential to win World Championships – and that put him at the level of the likes of team mate George Russell – Wolff added: “This is a very high level already; if you look at George and Max [Verstappen], the skills are so high, and there's a few others that fall into that bracket.

“I think actually making it into that group would be a success. The junior track record is phenomenal, the best probably that we've seen since 10 years – in go-karting [he was] exceptional – but Formula 1 is a different ball game.”

The singer-songwriter played with the iconic British band for more than 50 years and penned the classics “I'm Just a Singer (In a Rock and Roll Band)” and “Ride My See-Saw.”

	John Lodge, the longtime singer, songwriter and bass guitarist for The Moody Blues, has died. He was 82.


	“John Lodge, our darling husband, father, grandfather, father-in-law and brother, has been suddenly and unexpectedly taken from us,” his family Friday said in a statement on Facebook. 




	No cause of death was shared, but they noted that “John peacefully slipped away surrounded by his loved ones and the sounds of The Everly Brothers and Buddy Holly.”


	Born on July 20, 1943, in Birmingham, England, Lodge received his first Fender bass guitar at 16.

	Along with friend Ray Thomas, he formed El Riot & the Rebels while in high school. In 1966, Lodge received a call from Thomas with an offer to join The Moody Blues as their bass guitarist, replacing a departing Denny Laine. The band also had as members Justin Hayward, Mike Pinder and Graeme Edge.


	Lodge remained with the iconic band until it stopped touring in 2019. “He was never happier than being on stage — he was just a ‘Singer in a Rock and Roll Band' and he adored performing with his band and son-in-law, Jon (Anderson, vocalist with YES), and being able to continue sharing this music with his fans,” Lodge's family wrote.


	Among the most notable songs Lodge wrote are “I'm Just a Singer (In a Rock and Roll Band),” with a signature bass riff, and “Ride My See-Saw.” The Moody Blues released 15 studio albums, and Lodge released another five on his own.

	











	In 2023, Lodge released his solo LP Days of Future Passed: My Sojourn and set touring dates, writing: “I'm sorry that the Moodies are no longer touring, and I miss my friends Ray and Graeme deeply, but as I looked back to the past, I realised that I also wanted to look forward to the Future. My hope is that in this new album you will get to revisit 1967, but at the same time, see how this album has grown with me, and with you. Thank to you the 10,000 Light Years Band, Jon Davison and, of course, Graeme, for their belief in this project and helping bring my vision to life. And thank you to all the fans for Keeping the Faith on this, ‘My Sojourn'.”


	His latest release this year was the EP “Love Will Conquer All.” In 2018, The Moody Blues were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.


	Lodge leaves behind wife Kirsten, daughter Emily, son Kristian and grandson John-Henry. 


	“As John would always say at the end of the show, thank you for keeping the faith,” his family wrote. “Please understand that we are not making any further comments, however we would like to leave you with John's song ‘Whispering Angels' whilst we take a moment to reflect on this incredible man who touched so many lives.”

Prime Video has canceled a pair of first-year series, Butterfly and Countdown.


	The Amazon MGM Studios series had summer debuts and each spent a short time on Nielsen's top 10 U.S. streaming charts, but neither will return for a second run. The cancellation of Butterfly, starring Daniel Dae Kim, comes about two months after it premiered as a binge release. Countdown, led by Jensen Ackles, premiered in June and had a longer rollout, wrapping its 13-episode season in early September.




Butterfly, based on a graphic novel by Arash Amel and Marguerite Bennett, is a spy thriller that stars Kim as a former U.S. intelligence agent who comes out of hiding in South Korea to help his daughter (Reina Hardesty), who's also a spy. The show spent two weeks on the Nielsen streaming charts following its Aug. 13 premiere.

Countdown, from Chicago Fire co-creator Derek Haas, stars Ackles as an LAPD detective who's brought into a task force involving several agencies that's working against time to stop a potentially devastating conspiracy. Jessica Camacho, Eric Dane, Violett Beane, Uli Latukefu and Elliot Knight also star.


	Like Butterfly, Countdown had a two-week run on the Nielsen streaming charts shortly after its premiere. It didn't keep up that momentum as the season continued, however.


	Kim (via his 3AD company) and Ackles (through his Chaos Machine banner) both have first-look deals at Amazon MGM Studios. Ackles stars in the forthcoming Vought Rising, a prequel to The Boys.  

	











Deadline first reported the cancellations.

The Life of a Showgirl breaks Adele's longstanding one-week pure album sales record over the modern era (1991-present) in the U.S.


													By
												

	Keith Caulfield



	It's official. Two days after Taylor Swift's The Life of a Showgirl set the single-week modern-era consumption record for an album, the project has now broken the modern-era record for the most albums sold in a week in the United States, according to initial reports to data tracking firm Luminate.

	











	The album's full final first-week consumption figure (equivalent album units, which includes pure sales, streams and track sales) and pure album sales figure are both still being tabulated by Luminate, and won't be announced until Sunday, Oct. 12. That said, the album already has more than 3.4 million in pure album sales (physical and digital purchases), marking the largest sales week for any album since Luminate began electronically tracking music data in 1991, when the modern era of weekly music tabulation began.


	Previously, the modern-era record for single-week sales of an album was held by the opening frame of Adele's 25, with 3.378 million copies sold in its first week in November 2015.


The Life of a Showgirl was released on Friday, Oct. 3. Luminate's tracking week that captured the album's first week ran from Oct. 3 through the end of Oct. 9.


	Since Luminate began tracking data in 1991, only three albums have sold at least 2 million copies in a single week in the U.S. Before The Life of a Showgirl achieved the feat, there was the bow of Adele's 25 and the opening week of *NSYNC's No Strings Attached in 2000, which sold 2.416 million.

	











The Life of a Showgirl's official first-week numbers (equivalent album units, total traditional album sales and streaming figures) reflecting the tracking week of Oct. 3-9, are expected to be announced by Billboard on Sunday, Oct. 12, along with its assumed large debut on the multimetric Billboard 200 albums chart (dated Oct. 18). Luminate's streaming, sales and airplay data powers Billboard's charts. All numbers cited in this story are for the U.S. only.


Life of a Showgirl's first-week sales were fueled by 34 different versions of The Life of a Showgirl — 27 physical iterations (18 CDs, eight vinyl LPs and one cassette) and seven download variants (not counting clean and explicit editions for wide digital retail).


	Helping the sales The Life of a Showgirl in the last few days of the tracking week were four new iTunes Store-exclusive editions of the album that sold for $4.99 each, and for 24-hours only. They were issued one a day, starting Monday, through Thursday, and all are adaptations of the four limited-edition CDs that Swift released in her webstore over the weekend. The CDs each had the album's 12 songs, plus two unique bonus tracks (acoustic/alternative versions of songs on the album). The iTunes Store versions carry the same tracklists as the CDs, but the iTunes versions add two unique voice memos to each album.


	Those limited-edition CDs that were previously locked to Swift's webstore were later made available during the week to independent record shops.


	Finally, on Thursday, Swift's webstore dropped a digital download version of the album, dubbed The Life of a Showgirl (So Punk on the Internet Version) with the album's 12 songs and six previously released voice memos, plus one new voice memo.

The ""Angels"" singer hosted an intimate underplay at Camden's Dingwalls on Thursday (Oct. 9).


													By
												

	Sophie Williams



Robbie Williams performed a show of two halves at London's Dingwalls on Thursday night (Oct. 9), marking his smallest-ever ticketed gig, and revealed how Taylor Swift forced him to delay the release of his 13th studio LP, Britpop.

	At the 600-capacity venue in Camden, the singer performed his iconic debut Life Thru A Lens in its entirety, before airing tracks from his upcoming album Britpop (due Feb. 6). Those in attendance were required to put their phones in Yondr pouches, to avoid new songs being filmed and leaked online.

	The show was initially slated to coincide with the release of Britpop, though the record had recently been pushed back due to “scheduling issues.” Towards the end of the night, Williams confirmed that this was to avoid the arrival of Taylor Swift's The Life Of A Showgirl (Oct. 3) and its subsequent chart domination, which will likely continue over the coming month.


	If Britpop reaches the summit next year, Williams will secure his 16th U.K. No.1 on the Official U.K. Albums Chart, breaking a tie with The Beatles in the all-time rankings. “We're all pretending [the scheduling change] is not about Taylor Swift, but it f–king is, you can't compete with that,” Williams said.


	“I was worried about making you [fans] all wait for the record. But then I was like, ‘F–k it'. I'm sorry, but I'm f–king being selfish. How many times in your life do you get to have the most No. 1 albums the U.K. has f–king ever had?”

	











	Earlier on in the evening, accompanied by a full backing band, Williams reimagined the songs from Life Thru A Lens with a rockier edge. The 11-track effort, which formed the foundation for one of the most successful solo careers in British pop history, features mega-hits “Angels” and “Let Me Entertain You.” Its artwork, meanwhile, sees its author posing in a swarm of paparazzi and was recreated for the poster of Williams' recent biopic, Better Man.


	Upon release in 1997, Life Thru A Lens initially saw modest sales, though it eventually topped the Official U.K. Albums Chart and went eight times Platinum in the U.K. Its enduring popularity proved that a boy band member could successfully transition into a solo act, paving the way for others including Justin Timberlake and Harry Styles in later generations.


	Taking to the stage at 10:45 p.m., Williams played the album in order, kicking off a two hour-long performance with a rollicking rendition of “Lazy Days.” Like the majority of the fans along the barrier, he donned a red Adidas tracksuit in homage to his trip to Glastonbury Festival in 1995, which has also become the cover image for Britpop. 


	Williams was greeted with huge cheers by the crowd. “I never get to do gigs like this, and I always say to myself that I want to play smaller places,” he began. “But then I finish my tour and I am knackered, I can't be arsed. Turns out, I can be arsed tonight!”


	“If you don't mind, I'd just like to perform as Robert tonight. I just want to stand and sing my s–t,” he continued. “Turns out, Robert is in really good shape.”


	As Williams prepared to launch into “Angels” — describing it as his “Hail Mary” — the room began chanting his name, before he informed them: “My career is what it is because of this song.” A staple at weddings, funerals, and public events, the track holds a deep cultural resonance and is one of the most-awarded and commercially successful British songs of all time.

	











	After storming through the rest of Life Thru A Lens, including “South Of The Border” and “Hello Sir,” a poem Williams wrote for one of his former school teachers, he took a short break before returning to the stage for the latter portion of the set.


	In the summer, Williams unveiled a mock plaque — installed next to the iconic Camden Lock Bridge — to mark the release of his single “Spies,” while also paying playful tribute to the genre that defined an era. It read: “Robbie Williams recovered from a severe case of ‘long 90s' and returned to the home of Britpop with the album he always wanted to make.”


	He would repeat this sentiment multiple times in between playing unreleased material, describing how swaggering tracks like “Rocket,” “Bite Your Tongue” and “Cocky” represented “the artist I always wanted to be.” Later on, new single “Pretty Face” was dedicated to Williams wife, actress Ayda Field, while he joked how the psychedelic chord progression of “Spies” sounds similar to the Oasis classic “Champagne Supernova.” 


	Album track “Human,” with lyrics that reference “protein pills in a dopamine package” and a call to “make the most of being alive,” was preceded by a speech centered on the future of AI, with Williams concluding that “we shouldn't be scared” of the technology's capabilities.


	In an even wilder left turn, Williams aired electro-pop thumper “Morrissey,” named after the songwriter and former Smiths frontman of the same name. The track seemed to play on Williams' fandom for the music icon, while also drawing comparisons between their outspoken natures. “I'm a little like you but a lot less worthy,” he sang at one point, before describing the song as “weird” and adding that “‘Gay For Morrissey' would make a great t-shirt.”

	











	Williams will repeat the Dingwalls setlist at a string of underplay shows next spring, including a billing at O2 Brixton Academy (Feb. 8). The full schedule and ticket information can be found at his official website.

			By Dominic Patten, Jill Goldsmith 


	The most vexing obstacle for David Ellison and Paramount‘s expected offer to acquire Warner Bros. Discovery looks to be David Zaslav – though probably not for long.


	As of now, Zaslav is moving ahead with a somewhat-still-fuzzy plan unveiled this past summer to split WBD in half by next spring to free the studio and streaming of several billion in debt and freefalling cable assets. At the same time, word on the Burbank streets is that Netflix or Amazon could be looking to add some DC or GoT to their balance sheets, alternatives promoted by the WBD CEO.


	“David's a dealmaker, that's who he is,” a streaming exec asserts, putting emphasis on enhanced shareholder value as Zaslav's endgame. “He's always gauging the possibilities and getting the best value, and that is what I think he is doing here. Whether it works or not, who can say right now?”

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	Zaslav has reportedly engaged Goldman Sachs to gauge buyer interest and is valuing the company's studios and streaming units at more than $30 per share, a premium to the $22 to $24 range floated by Ellison's camp. On the other side of town, Paramount Skydance CEO Ellison, who of course is the son of Oracle overlord Larry Ellison (the second-richest man on the planet) is in discussions with Apollo and other private equity investors to join a potential $60 billion offer.


	But what will the deep-pocketed Ellisons find if and when they take the reins? One thing, studio and Century City sources tell Deadline, is that the long and winding road to a regulatory green light from the Trump administration to close Skydance-Paramount last August established a template for further deals. The well-connected Ellison regime, whose patriarch has been a longtime Trump donor and White House visitor, anticipates it could seal a deal with the feds for the whole WBD enchilada in less than six months Stateside and within nine months in Europe and the UK – money music to shareholders' ears.

	











	With that, the Skydance founder and gang may have reasons for concern, industry insiders and Wall Street watchers say, and a case for trying to drive down the price, due in part to the timeline of the split. Zaslav recently said the division of WBD into Warner Bros. and Discovery Global would happen by April 2026.


	Yet, with regulatory hoops to jump though, the notion of wrapping the transaction in the next six months  is seeming increasingly optimistic. Looming beyond the planned split date is a June 2026 annual shareholder meeting that could be rough if the split isn't accomplished or rescheduled by then.


	“I think if you just look at David Zaslav's performance, he's pretty much failed shareholders every step of the way, right?” an insider exclaims. “Servicing debt and bad decisions eroded billions and billions in market cap since Discovery basically took over Warner Bros. three years ago.”


	Says one East Coast banker with deep Hollywood ties who is wary of the upside of a WBD split: “My perspective is, they break up the company and they figure out how to get some more equity into it. Even then, their performance will lead to a bad balance sheet over time again.”


	Yet, as Team Ellison circles, the quick-footed WBD CEO supposedly has attracted the interest of Amazon and Netflix as potential buyers – or at least that's the word on Warner Boulevard. Off the lot, however, there's skepticism that either the House of Bezos or the Ted Sarandos and Greg Peters-run streamer are truly interested.


	“Amazon got stung by buying MGM with little to show for it, and the FTC just made them pay up a $2.5 billion civil penalty,” one studio (not Paramount) source says. “Buying Warner Bros any time soon doesn't fit with their M.O.” Amazon did not respond to Deadline's request for comment on a possible WBD purchase or interest.


	Contacted by Deadline, Netflix shut down speculation by referring to co-CEO Peters' blunt remarks on the subject earlier this week: “We come from a deep heritage of being builders rather than buyers,” Peters said Wednesday at the Bloomberg Screentime conference in Los Angeles. “One should have a reasonable amount of skepticism around big media mergers. They don't have an amazing track record over time.”


	On stage at the conference yesterday, Ellison declined to comment on a WBD buy. Paramount did not respond to a request for comment from Deadline on a possible purchase. Neither did WBD.


	It seems that unless a presently unidentified proxy investor group or K-pop billionaire jumps in at the eleventh hour, the Melrose lot-based Ellison is the only one openly(ish) looking at buying Burbank's debt-laden WBD one way or another.


	“In the deal business, you've got to see where the leverage is with the potential buyer and the potential seller – that always depends on the performance of the company in hand,” a Wall Street source tells Deadline regarding the realities of what is ahead for Paramount and WBD.


	“When you have the kind of performance that Zaslav has had, he doesn't have a lot of options,” the moneyman adds. “Number one: it's all boxed in. Number two: there are not a lot of companies that want to buy declining assets. Number three: shareholders, therefore, will be much more focused on certainty than on some fiction of fake buyers and corporate splits.”


	The separation would follow years of retooling during the three-plus rocky years since WarnerMedia and Discovery closed their $43 billion merger. That was a much smaller company buying a much bigger one, resulting in about $50 billion in debt and handing operational control of the new entity to Zaslav despite Discovery's minority stake in the merged company. Shareholders are generally bullish on the split plan, but they may like a hefty cash buyout better.

	











	How much a pre-split Warner Bros Discovery is really worth is a question under debate among the town's openly cash-infused player Paramount and its almost certain acquisition target. While specifics are fluid, Paramount and Ellison have landed on $60 million as a ballpark valuation, while WBD and Zaslav, unsurprisingly, have a higher number in mind.


	“Zas is playing the odds to get the best deal he can on his timeline with the biggest bidder in hand,” an industry insider told Deadline, viewing the split as a Hail Mary pass that has a chance of being completed.


	Even with a pre-pandemic box office level of $4 billion this year so far for the Michael De Luca- and Pam Abdy-led movie studio, Zaslav and CFO Gunnar Widenfels have had to pare and pare to pay down debt. In June, it stood at $35.6 billion.


	In quarter after quarter, many missing targets, Zaslav and Weidenfels expressed surprise at just how bad things were at Warners once they got a good look under the hood; they said that hadn't really been possible until the deal formally closed in April 2022. Among the challenges they found: HBO worked in silos and was overstaffed; streaming was bleeding cash; and there was superhero fatigue. WBD took a series of big write-downs for content, a huge one for cable, lost the NBA, created chaos at the viewer-bleeding CNN and flip-flopped over the DTC branding of HBO and Max.


	Yes, even with the fact that WBD no longer offers forward-looking guidance in earnings reports, the company outlook is better, in relative terms – and hoping for a further lift if one becomes two.


	Lifted from Comcast's playbook, the idea of the split – aside from whether it ever actually happens – provided a long-sought tonic for WBD stock, which had skidded below $8 a share earlier this year. The company is taking streaming international and is having a great 2025 box office run, with A Minecraft Movie, Sinners, Weapons, the Superman revival and the latest installments of Final Destination and The Conjuring turned around the studio's fortunes and those of the just re-upped De Luca and Abdy. The studio also helped Apple's F1 take the checkered flag in a distribution deal and launched gusty auteur gamble One Battle After Another, which has awards heat even with an iffy profit outlook.


	Debt, which haunted the old WarnerMedia when it was owned by AT&T, continues to hamper investment in WBD.


	A “restructuring in June took about $3 billion off their debt, but they also have a $17 billion bridge loan, which is syndicated across Wall Street banks, which had not yet been refinanced,” a well-placed finance chief told us of the math and risk. “That's one of the critical reasons why they can't spin off the company yet with the cable properties and studio. Two is, as part of their debt plan, they have to monetize 20% of one of the spin companies, which is studios and streaming, which they expect to have a high value. If they don't get the value when they spend, they'll still be over leveraged in the cable company. It is all fraught with risk.”

No good options

Netflix is not interested, nor should they be. They have well over 300M subscribers without any big franchise IP, so why should they bother to buy any now?

The one thing that could massively change this equation is how quickly the streaming platforms start integrating AI tools (and charging a bit more for the AI creator tier) so customers start becoming content makers. 

When that happens, having popular IP will be a big draw. How much will people clamor to make Stranger Things AI creations vs Batman AI creations? AI could give the legacy studios with big franchises a way to finally battle Netflix effectively.

Netflix conquered the world because they created a tech disruption that changed the rules. The one thing that could kick the legs out from under them is another tech disruption, such as AI could provide, and then only if they're not savvy and jump on the wave in time. For Netflix not to be savvy like that would be a real shock.

At one point I would have been all for anyone taking WB away from Zaslav, and Skydance/Paramount would have been ideal, but after some of their recent dubious actions a Paramount+WB merger is looking less desireable. Let Netflix take it and just create one streaming service with everything on it.

There will never be just one service with “everything” and if there was, they'd charge $100/month when it's much cheaper to churn around and you end up getting “everything” that way. Even with ad-free tiers, that's well under $20/month so that's the best deal, you can do it now, so do it and stop complaining.

Even if there was an “everything” service, somebody would come along and launch a new one, make content for it, price it cheaper, and undercut the “everything” service. Then people would flock to the cheaper one.

There's an equilibrium point that is a combo of the prices and consumer desires to have more than one service at a time. That's about 4 or 5. Netflix, Amazon, Disney/Hulu, Apple and some combo of Paramount, HBO Max and Peacock. Or just HBO Max and the others die off. It would be 4 except Tim Cook wants to play Hollywood mogul and keeps Apple going irrationally.

EXCLUSIVE: That hot Joesph Gordon-Levitt-directed AI movie package we told you about back in December, well, we just learned it's going to Netflix. And that's not all: Spotlight Supporting Actress Oscar nominee and Tony nominee Rachel McAdams is attached to star.


	Gordon-Levitt and T-Street felt Netflix was the right creative home for the package after they blew away senior creative executives, who were fully on board with the Inception star-turned-filmmaker's vision. Aside from having the last two Knives Out movies, Netflix was also in business with Rian Johnson and Ram Bergman's T-Street after acquiring its erotic noir Fair Play out of Sundance 2023.

	Storyline is under wraps for the AI movie, which is being produced by T-Street. Gordon-Levitt has been passionately outspoken about AI, and wrote the script with Kieran Fitzgerald. Both are producers on the pic and share “story by” credit with Natasha Lyonne. Fitzgerald wrote the 2016 Oliver Stone movie Snowden in which Gordon-Levitt starred. 




			Watch on Deadline		







	Gordon-Levitt and Fitzgerald are also producing. Next for McAdams is the upcoming Sam Raimi-directed genre movie Send Help at 20th Century Studios. Her cinematic canon includes star-making turns in Mean Girls, The Notebook, About Time, Disobedience, Game Night, Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret, and on stage in Mary Jane. The actress is repped by Magnolia Entertainment, WME and attorney Howard Fishman. 


	The latest from Gordon-Levitt reteams him with T-Street. Gordon-Levitt starred in Johnson's 2005 feature directorial debut Brick, in addition to the filmmaker's cult sci-fi movie Looper. Bergman produced Gordon-Levitt's 2013 feature directorial debut Don Jon, with Johnson also giving feedback on the script and reviewing multiple cuts of the film.


	T-Street's third Knives Out movie from Netflix, Wake Up Dead Man: A Knives Out Mystery, bows in theaters on November 26 before streaming December 12.

No one is interested in an AI written movie. This will flop.

Did you not read the article?

“Gordon-Levitt has been passionately outspoken about AI, and wrote the script with Kieran Fitzgerald.”

It's an movie about AI, written by humans.

Also worth noting, however, that Natasha Lyonne founded an “ethical AI” company and is making a feature that will be at least somewhat AI-generated.

Senior Film Reporter


Lady Gaga has joined The Devil Wears Prada‘s forthcoming sequel from 20th Century Studios in an undisclosed role.


	Reps for the studio declined to comment. But word of Gaga's casting spread when photos of her on set began circulating. First announced in July 2024, the sequel sees core cast members Meryl Streep, Anne Hathaway, Emily Blunt and Stanley Tucci returning.


	Based on Lauren Weisberger's 2003 novel of the same name, the original film followed Andy Sachs (Hathaway), a journalism graduate who moves to New York City and lands a very demanding job as junior assistant to Miranda Priestly (Streep), editor-in-chief of a high-fashion magazine. Slated for release on May 1, 2026, the sequel is expected to examine Priestly's perspective as she faces the decline of the print industry.

	











	Production kicked off on the sequel in June. Tracie Thoms and Tibor Feldman will also reprise roles from the first film, with Kenneth Branagh, Simone Ashley, Lucy Liu, Justin Theroux, B.J. Novak and Pauline Chalamet, Rachel Bloom and Patrick Brammall aboard in new roles.




			Watch on Deadline		







	David Frankel has returned to direct from a script by Aline Brosh McKenna, with Wendy Finerman and Karen Rosenfelt producing.


	It's been another busy year for Gaga, who released her album Mayhem on March 7 and hosted Saturday Night Live the same month. Headlining Coachella 2025 and kicking off her global Mayhem Ball tour in July, she's most recently been seen playing the role of Rosaline Rotwood in the second season of Netflix's hit series Wednesday.

					By Anthony D'Alessandro 

Editorial Director/Box Office Editor


FRIDAY PM: Disney‘s Tron: Ares is looking at $15M today, now set for a 3-day in the mid-to-high $30 million range at 4,000 theaters. It will take a very big Saturday and Sunday to put the Jared Leto movie back in the $40M range. 


	Here's some upside: It's Indigenous People's Day weekend, hence a 4-day stretch. If MLB and NFL steal the guys away Sunday, here's to hoping they find the movie on Monday. Comscore reports that 45% of K-12 schools are off Monday along with another 22% colleges. 


	Currently, No. 2 is between Warner Bros' One Battle After Another and Paramount/Miramax's Roofman, each with about $7M-$7.5M. Roofman is booked at 3,362 while One Battle After Another has 3,127 theaters in its third weekend. On the high end for the Paul Thomas Anderson directed-Leonardo DiCaprio starring movie, that's a -32% ease from its second weekend. Running total by Sunday could stand at $55.3M, which would be +6% ahead of DiCaprio's Killers of the Flower Moon at the same 17-day mark. 

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	Universal's Gabby's Dollhouse is fourth at 3,039 sites with a Friday of $1M, third weekend of $4.2M, -21%, and a running total of $27.2M.


	Filing fifth is Sony Affirm's Soul on Fire at 1,720 with a Friday of $1.4M for a 3-day of $2.5M-$3M. 


	Ideally in regards to the overall marketplace, it's bright and sunny when the 3-days of your Columbus Day frame cracks $100M, but it's clear we won't have that this weekend. Post Covid, the second weekend of October posted its best in 2023 when all movies totaled $132.9M per Box Office Mojo thanks to the opening of Taylor Swift: Eras Tour. Even if Taylor Swift: Showgirl was around this weekend, yeah, sure, it would've dropped, but it would have still provided some more depth to the weekend box office.


FRIDAY AM: Disney is reporting that Tron: Ares previews are coming in at $4.8 million. That includes limited Wednesday early shows and previews that began Thursday at 2 p.m.


	Knock on wood this one opens to its tracking, meaning north of $40M; we don't need any movies underperforming. The fall, though ahead of last year by 2% at around $674M, is OK but not vibrant with myriad starry adult movies such as Dwayne Johnson's The Smashing Machine and Margot Robbie and Colin Farrell's A Big Bold Beautiful Journey not working. The male-heavy Tron: Ares faces competition from MLB playoffs this weekend as well as NFL. Good news: The pic's Rotten Tomatoes audience score stands at 86%, better than the previous installment, 2010's Tron: Legacy, which did 64% fresh.

	











Tron: Ares previews certainly are ahead of Tron: Legacy‘s preview cash, which was $3.6M, but that was back in the era of the midnight preview. Right now, it's look like Tron: Ares will file under such fanboy reboots as last year's Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes ($6.6M total previews) and Alien: Romulus ($6.5M). It's also under that of Lionsgate's The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes ($5.8M). Advance ticket sales we told you for Tron: Ares were at $7M, on par with Alien: Romulus, which opened to $42M. Songbirds & Snakes bowed to $45M.

	Previews for the Joachim Rønning-directed movie movie are ahead of The Equalizer 3, which yielded a $3.8M preview and a $35M three-day opening in 2023. Tron: Ares, produced by its star Jared Leto and former Disney Head of Production Sean Bailey, cost $180M before P&A.


	Miramax and Paramount's Channing Tatum-Kirsten Dunst romance caper Roofman collected $1M from 2,800 locations Thursday. Showtimes started at 7 p.m. Audiences gave the pic 4 out of 5 stars on PostTrak. No audience score yet, but reviews are at 82% on Rotten Tomatoes. The $19M production goes wide today at 3,362 sites. Tatum's Dog did $1.26M in Valentine's Day sneaks and previews before earning a $5M Friday and $14.8M 3-day driven by his female audience. However that movie was PG-13, and Roofman is rated R. The 3-day on Roofman is around $10M.

	Sony/Affirm's Soul on Fire made $575,000 from showtimes that began at 4 p.m. at 1,450 sites. The film received an A CinemaScore and 5-star PostTrak rating. The movie is from Soul Surfer filmmaker Sean McNamara. Logline for faith-based film: After suffering an accident, a young boy ends up relying on his family, his faith and his community in his fight for survival.


	Here's the rest of the top 5 for the week


	1) Taylor Swift: The Official Release Party of a Showgirl (AMC) Wk $34M/Wk 1 (remember, it didn't play the weekdays)


	2) One Battle After Another (WB) 3,634 theaters, Thu $1M (-22%) Wk $16.2M (-49%), Total $47.8M/Wk 2


	3) The Smashing Machine (A24) 3,345 theaters, Thu $316K (-34%), Wk $7.7M/Wk 1

This film really has NO buzz going into the weekend.

“The pic's Rotten Tomatoes audience score stands at 86%, better than the previous installment, 2010's Tron: Legacy, which did 64% fresh.”

Another example of the rottentomatoes “verified audience” lie. Since they started that, movies have had amazing audience scores…LOL

To compare: Tron legacy has 6.8 on IMDB and Trol Ares has 6.6, so the true audiences give it a lower score.

Another example:

Jurassic World Fallen Kingdom (before the “verified audience” lie started): 48% audience score

Jurassic World Dominion (after the “verified audience” lie started): 77% audience score

People obviously didn't like Fallen Kingdom, but Dominion is known to be much worse. Even on IMBD you can see that Fallen Kingdom has a 6.1 rating and Dominion a 5.6 rating.

If Tron makes $40M, I'll eat my hat (in an AI produced video).

Another crushingly soulless piece of Disney product. IMAX I was in last night maybe half-full. I was mostly bored and the characters aren't likable. Tron Ares may not make $100 domestic.

I think I was at your showing. The half-full audience didn't react to any of it, including the fan-service moments.

You went to go see a third Tron movie and you're whining that it's a soulless product.

The original Tron is one of the single most boring and embarrassingly overrated movies in history. Even with glowing reviews this wouldn't get anywhere near 300 million.

Is it really overrated? I thought Tron for the most part was always this cult thing until Jeff Bridges grew in popularity over the years and some suit decided they could try again with the property decades later.

Right? If anything, the original TRON is underrated! I've alwyas liked it, though I can agree that it's narratively messy. Still, it has a vibe that is hard to resist. That may be why it never really takes off as a franchise.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Nintendo's Mario Galaxy remasters are a return to the tyranny of motion controls","https://www.avclub.com/game-theory-super-mario-galaxy-motion-controls","Fri, 10 Oct 2025 16:00:00 GMT","

Every Friday, A.V. Club staffers kick off the weekend by taking a look at the world of gaming, diving in to the ideas that underpin the hobby we love with a bit of Game Theory. We'll sound off in the space above, and invite you to respond down in the comments, telling us what you're playing this weekend, and what theories it's got you kicking around.

Let's start by establishing, for the sake of argument, that Super Mario Galaxy and its direct sequel are good video games. At the bare minimum, interesting ones: Not just their basic “Mario in space” premise, which allowed Nintendo's hero to do some really wild gravity-related stuff with his standard repertoire of jumps. But also as evolutions in Nintendo's overall design strategy for what works in a 3D Mario game: Shorter levels with sharper and more distinct concepts behind them, which especially shine in 2010's Super Mario Galaxy 2. There is a palpable idea behind each of the planets Mario drives his bizarre Mario's-head-shaped spaceship to in that game, whether he's drilling down through spheres to pop out on the other side, or using a limited supply of puffy clouds to ascend up into the literal stratosphere. Or using motion controls to fly a bird. Or using motion controls to fire blasts of “star bits” at giant monsters. Or using motion controls for basic functionality, like his all-important spin jump, or controlling his freshly released buddy Yoshi's irritating-as-hell-to-control prehensile tongue.

Because the thing I kept thinking about, as I played the new Switch and Switch 2 releases of these (genuinely good!) former Wii games, was this: Did we really used to live like this?

To be fair, the Switch 2 is a better fit for old Wii software than a lot of consoles would be; the system's various technological toys do a pretty good job of simulating the Wii's motion controls, using gyroscopes and a touchscreen to fill in for the Wiimote's point-and-shake schtick. And yet, as I tilted my Joy-Con 2 fitfully to navigate my way through the canyons and bluffs of Galaxy 2‘s Wild Glide Galaxy, I started getting serious flashbacks to a whole generation of gaming where we all decided, collectively, to kiss off the classic controller. In favor of what? Rigidly holding our hands in place, lest we send Mario spiraling straight down to one of those (still terrifying) black holes that lurk at the bottom of so many of Galaxy‘s levels? Why did we do this to ourselves?

Nobody's going to stand here and tell you that the first time you played tennis or bowling in Wii Sports wasn't a magical moment, a true example of “Oh, grandma can do this!” gaming. I have two motion controllers charging in my house right now, queued up for an evening session of Beat Saber. Hell, I have fond memories of sticking a Wiimote to my nose because the dopey narration in WarioWare: Smooth Moves told me it was time to do “The Elephant.” But revisiting the Mario Galaxy games has also been a reminder of how pervasive, bordering on insidious, this stuff got, as designers tried to reinvent the wheel, and instead got a wheel that falls over a lot, while being about half as fun to play with. Movement and motion are vital elements of the human experience, but Mario Galaxy‘s version of it feels borderline cynical—like a team of very solid developers made a great 3D Mario game, and then got told they had to shoehorn in motion controls because, fuck, it's a Wii game, right?

The simple fact is, pushing buttons is good. Moving sticks is good. Pulling triggers? Good. (In the proper context!) These control schemes have evolved, over 63 years of digital gaming, because people figured out pretty early on that cranking knobs on an oscilloscope is a pretty shitty way to control a virtual avatar. There's nothing wrong with exploring alternate control schemes—I was excited to see the mouse-based Mario & Wario make its way to the Switch's online nostalgia catalogue this week, and I'm the guy who will never shut up about how stylus-based Kirby game Canvas Curse actually kicked ass. But the control scheme must match the game, and the Mario Galaxy games, for all their strengths, are a textbook example where that's simply not the case, but had the scheme imposed on them anyway.

In the very limited form they've arrived in now—timed, I can only assume, to the announcement that Super Mario Galaxy is also the name of the upcoming Super Mario Bros. Movie sequel—Mario Galaxy‘s dalliances with wrist jiggles and arm flurries can be small-doses charming. (It helps, again, that so much work has clearly gone into the Super Mario Galaxy games that makes them genuinely important to Mario‘s evolution into games like Super Mario Odyssey or Bowser's Fury.) I've been having a blast with Galaxy 2 specifically, even if I want to slap that stupid “run as fast as you can” pepper out of Yoshi's gob every time I manage to get his tongue to fitfully connect with it. But sometimes revisiting video gaming's history means we're not just celebrating what was great about the past: We're also touring cul-de-sacs of design ideas that have now, quite rightly, been labeled as weird and dangerous dead ends.

John Lodge, long celebrated as the bass guitarist, singer, and songwriter for The Moody Blues, has passed away at age 82.

His family said he was “suddenly and unexpectedly taken from us,” according to the Mirror.

A post shared by John Lodge (@johnlodgemusic)

“It is with the deepest sadness that we have to announce that John Lodge, our darling husband, father, grandfather, father-in-law and brother, has been suddenly and unexpectedly taken from us,” the heartbreaking statement read.

The statement did not mention the cause of death.

It continued, “As anyone who knew this massive-hearted man knows, it was his enduring love of his wife, Kirsten, and his family, that was the most important thing to him, followed by his passion for music, and his faith. John peacefully slipped away surrounded by his loved ones and the sounds of The Everly Brothers and Buddy Holly.”

His family added that they will forever miss him.

“We are heartbroken, but will walk forwards into peace surrounded by the love he had for each of us,” they added. “As John would always say at the end of the show, thank you for keeping the faith.”

Fans of the legend were quick to share their sadness at the news.

“RIP John. The Moody Blues were a huge part of my childhood and early adulthood years,” one user wrote.

Another added, “Sad to hear, love Moody Blues songs . Rest in peace John Lodge.”

“Our heroes are leaving us way too soon,” a different fan wrote. “Love the Moody Blues, and to lose so suddenly the great John Lodge is a wrench on the heart. Rest in Peace to a legend of the Birmingham music scene.”

Since joining The Moody Blues in 1966, Lodge's distinctive falsetto voice and deep songwriting shaped the band's sound.

A post shared by John Lodge (@johnlodgemusic)

 He wrote hits like “Ride My See-Saw,” “Talking Out of Turn,” and “Emily's Song.”

The Moody Blues are one of rock's most influential and imaginative bands.

Formed in Birmingham, England, in 1964, the group blended rock, pop, and classical sounds to create a unique, dreamlike style. With timeless hits like “Nights in White Satin,” “Tuesday Afternoon,” and “The Story in Your Eyes,” they helped shape progressive rock.

Their 1967 album “Days of Future Passed” became a landmark in music history, combining orchestra and rock in a way never done before.

Over the decades, they sold more than 70 million albums. In 2018, he and his bandmates were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.  

Lodge was set to have a series of concerts in December.

Rest in peace. Rock On ✌️ 🕊

Nine-time Grammy winner Billie Eilish was exiting her Miami show when a scary incident took place. As the pop star walked past a group of fans, one of them forcefully grabbed her and yanked her towards the crowd. See the shocking video below.

A post shared by BILLIE EILISH (@biilleeiilsh)

Eilish appeared to be stunned, but okay as she was helped by security. The singer looked back over her shoulder and frowned, looking uncomfortable after the incident.

Fans swarmed the comments of a Billie Eilish fanpage on Instagram to defend the star. One wrote, “That is so horrible! I hope they got that person that grabbed her!”

Another showed their support by writing, “I love you, Billie Eilish.” 

Another video showed the incident from a higher angle.

A post shared by Daily Hourly (@dailyhourly)

TMZ says they learned from the Miami Police that the person who grabbed Eilish was ejected from the arena. The performance, which took place October 10 at the Kaseya Center, was the first in a planned three-part series of shows during the starlet's Hit Me Hard and Soft Tour. The Miami New Times says the show was sold out, and was the first time Eilish had performed in Miami in five years.

The Times says the crowd “went ballistic” as Eilish appeared in a 69 jersey and baseball cap, opening the show with “Chihiro.”

Back in September 2013 during a stop on her Mrs. Carter Show World Tour in Brazil, Beyoncé was grabbed by a fan while performing “Irreplaceable.” The megastar almost fell into the crowd after the audience member wrapped her into a hug, but she stayed incredibly calm and asked security not to intervene.

“Hey! Calm, calm, calm. It's alright,” said the “Single Ladies” singer. “He just got excited,” she added. A few moments later, Beyoncé shook the fan's hand and asked him his name.

Back in 2019, Eilish spoke to MTV Australia about her fame, saying, “This is weird. I feel like this is a simulation.” She went on to address her fans, saying, “I don't want you to feel like, ‘Oh my god, I'm never gonna get to meet her.' I hate that.” 

Eilish then joked, “I don't mean come to my hotel, or or follow me around the airport. I just mean, I can go like this and you can grab me,” while reaching out her hand. The Miami fan who snatched Eilish clearly took her kindness too far.

Louis Tomlinson is reflecting on the moment he found out that his former One Direction bandmate Liam Payne died. The singer got the bad news from “The Voice” coach and his 1D bandmate Niall Horan.

During his October 8, 2025, appearance on “The Diary of a CEO” podcast, Tomlinson revealed that Horan was the one who told him about Payne's death.

Tomlinson shared that the situation felt similar to his sister passing away in 2019. “I had the same feeling that I had with Félicité,” he explained of getting the call.

The singer shared that he was in the car in Los Angeles when he heard about Payne's death from Horan. Payne died on October 16, 2024, after falling from the balcony of his hotel room in Buenos Aires, Argentina.

“And I think anyone has this when they're around someone who's struggling — my 150% wasn't nearly enough,” Tomlinson said. “And that's when it's my own arrogance thinking that I could have helped really, because it was so much deeper than what I could have done for him.”

The singer added, “He was definitely struggling at that time in his life.”

Following Payne's death, Tomlinson posted a tribute on Instagram. “When I put up my post about him … I really wanted him to be remembered the way that he should be remembered,” he shared.

Tomlinson noted, “I think we all looked up to him. I don't think we would have been brave enough to say at that age when I was in the band, I think I would've had too much pride, but we all looked up to him massively.”

On October 17, 2024, Tomlinson shared a touching tribute to his late bandmate and friend.

“I am beyond devastated to be writing this but yesterday I lost a brother. Liam was somebody I looked up to everyday, such a positive, funny, and kind soul,” he noted in the caption.

Tomlinson shared, “I first met Liam when he was 16 and I was 18, I was instantly amazed by his voice but more importantly as time went on I got a chance to see the kind brother I'd longed all my life for.”

He called Payne “an incredible song writer with a great sense of melody” and shared their desire to reunite in the studio again to “recreate the writing chemistry we had built up in the band.”

Tomlinson referred to Payne as “the most vital part of One Direction.” 

“His experience from a young age, his perfect pitch, his stage presence, his gift for writing. The list goes on. Thank you for shaping us Liam,” he added.

Tomlinson also shared a special message just to Payne, writing: “I feel beyond lucky to have had you in my life but I'm really struggling with the idea of saying goodbye. I'm so grateful that we got even closer since the band, speaking on the phone for hours , reminiscing about all the thousands of amazing memories we had together is a luxury I thought I'd have with you for life. I would have loved to share the stage with you again but it wasn't to be.”

He concluded the message by writing, “I wish I got chance to say goodbye and tell you one more time how much I loved you. Payno, my boy, one of my best friends, my brother, I love you mate. Sleep well X.”

Danielle Jonas is bravely sharing her health story. The “Married to Jonas” star and longtime wife of Kevin Jonas revealed she was diagnosed with Lyme disease after months of unexplained symptoms that left her searching for answers.

“They tried to tell me it was anxiety,” Danielle, 39, told Parents in an interview published October 9. “Finally, I had a biopsy that showed I actually had Lyme disease. I also had eczema on my scalp, which was likely from the inflammation caused by Lyme disease.”

The mom of two said her first warning sign came when she started losing her hair. “The hair loss was very traumatic,” she admitted. “I got to a point where I wanted to wear a wig.”

A post shared by Kevin Jonas (@kevinjonas)

The diagnosis wasn't easy for Danielle, who's been married to Kevin for 16 years. She admitted that her changing appearance took a toll on her confidence, especially during public outings with her husband.

“I had to go out and do things with Kevin,” she said. “I just wanted to feel like myself again.”

A post shared by 💋Danielle💋 (@daniellejonas)

Today, Danielle says her symptoms are under control and she's feeling stronger. The experience, she shared, has changed how she sees herself, teaching her to be gentler, more patient, and more grateful for her body's resilience.

A post shared by 💋Danielle💋 (@daniellejonas)

For Danielle, her health journey has also changed how she talks to her and Kevin's daughters, Alena, 11, and Valentina, 8. “They saw everything I went through,” she said. “So the main thing I tell them when their eczema flares up is, ‘This is going to pass.'”

As a mom, she wants to help her daughters build confidence even when they face their own skin issues. “Besides eczema, [Alena] has always had other skin issues, so keeping things clean for her is important,” she told Parents.

While continuing her recovery, Danielle said she's learned how to balance her daughter's love of skincare with the importance of self-care. “She gets mad because she wants to have fun with certain products,” Danielle shared. “I just tell her, ‘Do you want a flare-up, or do you want to get it under control?' That helps her come back down.”

By staying honest and patient, Danielle has found a deeper sense of calm and gratitude. Her journey is a gentle reminder that true healing is not only physical but emotional, and that self-acceptance often grows through life's hardest moments.

“I think we need to call it,” Tess (Laura Dern) tells Alex (Will Arnett), standing over the bathroom sink while brushing her teeth, a serious ask embedded in a moment of profound mundanity. She's referring to their marriage, which, more than 20 years in and with two small children between them, has run its course. Tess, a former Olympic volleyball player, and Alex might not be unhappy with their marriage, but they're certainly not happy in their marriage, or in their own lives creatively or professionally. Their split spurs Alex's unconventional midlife crisis, one without fancy muscle cars or a hot young babe on the arm.

 








Related Stories Martin Scorsese Calls on Streamers to Champion More Iranian Cinema, as Jafar Panahi Vows to Keep Working in His Home Country ‘After the Hunt' Writer Nora Garrett Unpacks That Ending — and How Luca Guadagnino Pushed for Essential Changes 

That crisis is the foundation of Bradley Cooper's blandly reassuring, at times tedious and tunnel-visioned new directorial effort “Is This Thing On?” That midlife crisis also involves a hairpin career pivot, and no, I'm not talking about Cooper's move into directing, starting with 2018's Oscar-winning “A Star Is Born,” then the handsomely staged, Oscar-bait Leonard Bernstein biopic “Maestro” two years ago.

 










That pivot is in Alex's sudden move toward becoming an amateur stand-up comic, using the stage and the microphone as therapy platforms for his anguish. (But is it anguish he's feeling pre-divorce? He doesn't register much on the emotional Richter scale.) He stumbles into the Olive Tree Cafe in the West Village and, sure, why the hell not, what do I have to lose, signs up to perform almost as a lark, but his comedy becomes something the movie intends to endorse as being successful or funny, even when that's not always the case for those in the audience for this film. For a film about comedy as part of its elevator pitch, “Is This Thing On?” is curiously unfunny, with Cooper preferring to linger on the film's melancholy, “Marriage Story”-lite core as Alex and Tess eventually, through a bit of movie magic in the shape of a screenplay, find their way back to each other.

But the general shape of “Is This Thing On?” is based on a true story that would seem contrived were it not real. A couple of decades ago, the English comedian John Bishop (who gets a “story by” credit here, along with Cooper's co-writers Will Arnett and Mark Chappell) was working as a pharmaceutical rep, his marriage imploding, when he tried open-mic standup to avoid paying the establishment's entry fee. And now look at him: Since then, he's created multiple BBC One series. Perhaps also like this film's director, both John and the fictional character of Alex found what they discovered to be their truer calling later in life.

 










Alex and Tessa's friend group, meanwhile, is one of mixed ambitions. There's Christine (Andra Day) and her seemingly permanently stoned-to-the-gills actor husband Balls (Cooper himself, and, yes, this is unfortunately the character's name), who are staring down the barrel of their own empty nest and a marriage that's pushing up against its expiration date. Cooper winds up giving himself the majority of the laughs, like when he suspects Alex might be seeing someone new. Alex says, “I've been doing standup.” Balls goes, “Is that her handle?”

Cooper, again working with cinematographer Matthew Libatique (who cameos as a comic in the Olive Tree Café), operates the camera himself, which appears to create a less visible illusion of immediacy or intimacy, with the 1.66:1 aspect ratio giving the film the physical dimensions of a European character study. The price of Cooper taking the camera into his own hands, no matter how closely he smooshes it onto his actors' faces, is self-indulgence. There are takes that drag on and on (such as one of Dern biting into a weed cookie, and we are meant to wonder if perhaps the camera crew were slowed to molasses by an edible as well) and could have used more editorial discipline from editor Charlie Greene. “Is This Thing On?” very much has a “let's let the cameras roll and catch lightning in a bottle!” feel, with Cooper falling perhaps a little bit too in love with the performances to rein in his naturalistic impulses. The actors here are predictably strong, with a swept-back, Cooper-coded Arnett digging into what is likely the most dramatic material of his career.

 










But “Is This Thing On?” feels like it doesn't really get going until hour two — and those long takes can feel like gaping maws of silence that leave you begging for music or a score to be inserted so as to at least point you in the direction of feeling something. The first scene in which you start to feel like, ah, yes, there is some spark underneath the hood here involves Alex scrambling to get his kids a sitter— he ultimately leans on his parents, played by Christine Ebersole and Ciarán Hinds, and their seemingly dysfunction-free marriage a little too much amid the separation — so that he can take another standup gig. That very same night, Tess is on what turns out to be a date with a friend who is recently single, and they happen to go to that very comedy club Alex is performing in. During his set, he goes into exquisite, vivisecting detail about the intricacies of his marriage breakup. You see the frisson, the lust even, flash across Tess' face, electrified by his candor, perhaps giving her a glimpse of the Alex she once knew, the Tess she once was.

All of this really happened to John Bishop, who ended up on reconciliation's way with his wife after she saw his own soul-bared open-mic performance. So, too, do Alex and Tess start to find their way back to teach other, starting up what I suppose you'd call an affair, as they're keeping the relationship a secret from their kids and their friends while Alex continues to live in a bachelor pad, with Tess in their upstate home while dreaming of becoming a volleyball coach as a way back into her old sport. What makes “Is This Thing On?” work when it does is the chemistry exchange happening between Arnett and Dern, who are adept at going at it one minute and then making out the next. Not that Cooper's film is by any means some kind of “Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?,” nor does it have the requisite throwdown temper tantrum on the level of “Marriage Story.”

 










Frankly, this film could have used one. It never feels like there's any kind of catharsis, any release at the end of the crescendo, other than one taped on with a children's chorus-led cover of Queen and David Bowie's “Under Pressure,” a song that always gives you that feeling of “I want to run toward my future.”

Though often lethargic and listless, “Is This Thing On?” does stir up a vivid portrait of the New York City underground comedy milieu, even when New York City as a character feels more like the afterthought it isn't supposed to be. Cooper casts actual comedians in roles, from Amy Sedaris as the club's peppy emcee to a dry-as-a-bone Jordan Jensen as Alex's first sexual partner post-divorce. But his commitment to naturalism and immersion takes a chunk out of your soul after what feels like a very long 124 minutes; it could've used more spring in its step. Isn't joie de vivre what a midlife crisis is all about?

“Is This Thing On?” premiered at the New York Film Festival. Searchlight Pictures will release the film on Friday, December 19.

Although “A House of Dynamite” star Idris Elba did say at the Netflix release's Venice Film Festival press conference that he “does not have the courage to be in politics,” he certainly does not shy away from playing heads of state on film. Over a decade after his Golden Globe-nominated performance as Nelson Mandela, former President of South Africa, in “Long Walk to Freedom,” the British actor has played both the British Prime Minister in “Heads of State,” and the President of the United States in the new political thriller from Best Director Oscar-winner Kathryn Bigelow.

 










Speaking to IndieWire over Zoom, Elba said that while he is still not interested in being a politician, “I'm not shy of perhaps bringing my voice to something, bringing my soapbox in some way and articulating what I'd like to see happening.” But in accepting the presidential role in “A House of Dynamite,” he was not driven by some pain point he wanted to address, as much as he was excited to work with the people behind the film.

Diagnosing why exactly he seems like the right person to play political leaders, the seven-time Primetime Emmy nominee said, “You see actors oftentimes get into civil roles because of [the] skillset transfer into these things, but it's really not something good that I'm going for.” He added, “I read this thing that said, ‘Typically we choose our leaders because of height and length of forehead.' And I was like, ‘Well, yeah, I'm tall and I do have a forehead, so maybe that's what's going on here.'”Below, Elba shares what it was like to not only play a President who must react to a nuclear missile headed for the United States but also what it was like to watch the movie as an audience member, without prior access to the full scope of the film, which also features strong performances from a star-studded cast that includes Rebecca Ferguson and Tracy Letts.

The following interview has been condensed for length and clarity.

IndieWire: Earlier this year, we saw you play the British Prime Minister in “Heads of State,” and now you play the President of the United States in “A House of Dynamite.” When and how did you become the go-to guy to play a world leader?

Idris Elba: When Morgan Freeman said, “I ain't doing that no more.”

That's a better answer than anything I could have thought.
 










Yeah, I snuck in there. It's not by design. I found it very funny playing the Prime Minister and knowing that I am about to play the President. I was thinking about [how] the films are going to be in a similar cycle. So I was like, “OK, people are going to ask me about this. What am I trying to say?” I'm not trying to say anything. I'm not running for politics or anything like that.

If you're following Morgan Freeman, the next step is deities. Are you ready for that?

I don't know.

As far as how this film relates to more of your past work, I was wondering if you were attracted to “A House of Dynamite” as a story giving audiences a peek behind a power structure, similar to how “The Wire” informed audiences about the goings-on of different institutions. Are you particularly intrigued by scripts about how these systems and processes work?

There's always a curiosity when I'm playing characters, especially characters that have a complexity to them. Maybe a natural contradiction in what they are and what they need to do, and who they are and what they need to say, and who I am and what I look like playing this character. The complexities are really interesting to me. John Luther is a detective who is pretty much a crook at the same time.

I guess I'm attracted to that type of character, but at the same time, I don't really feel there's a sort of real formula to the way I go for characters. And probably I should have a formula, but I don't. I actually go for, “Have I done it before? Could I do a good job? What would I learn from this? Is there a skill set that I get out of it?” I've learned to do all kinds of crazy things, from sword-fighting to driving cars really fast by way of these different characters.

 










Was there at all a message in this project that you were attracted to? In terms of wanting people to see this film because of what it means?

Not in the beginning, if I'm really honest. I was just like, “I'd like to work with Kathryn Bigelow.” A bucket list opportunity. When I got to understand what the film was about and who my character is, I definitely latched onto the idea that [when] we elect a leader, I wonder, do we think long and hard enough about what and who we're electing, and what will happen if we put our lives in that person's hands?

I suppose playing the character as a human being as opposed to a POTUS, big, strong guy, [who's] got to make all the decisions… Just someone that actually is a human being, wants to talk to his wife, doesn't have the answers, isn't afraid to ask, his shoe's a little tight, his coffee's a little cold. Playing that human side hopefully reminds the audience that, actually, when we do decide who's our leader, just remember they're human. And this is what it looks like when they have to make a very complex decision on all of our behalfs. This is what it looks like.

Would you say there's any sort of partisanship applied to your character?
 










We definitely ignored that. We tried to show none whatsoever. And I don't know, as an audience member, what did you think? Did you think that he was there on one side or the other?

I found it pretty objective. There's things you can read into, but it does not fully imply he's this war hawk. You talked about the goal of him being human, the work reflects that. But shifting gears, do you know if you were one of the first actors cast in this film?

I'm not sure, actually. I don't know. I remember Kathryn talking about wanting to know who her president would be, and that might help her put together some of the other pieces. But I wasn't clear if I was the first person. I know that she said to me quite frankly that she didn't want to speak to any other actors about it, just wanted me, and to that I was like, “Wow, no pressure. You sure you don't want to speak to Morgan Freeman?”

Did you have any say in your cabinet? Because if you're someone coming in early, are you able to then say, “Well, I think this person would be good for this role.” Or anything along those lines?

No. Again, I didn't have any exposure to who was going to be in the movie, and by the time I got to shoot that segment of the film, they had already shot everything else. But needless to say, it's Kathryn and her taste for amazing actors to pick the characters that she creates is good. She has high standards.

Outside of Jonah Hauer-King and Brian Tee, who were around you physically? Did you actually get to work with this whole cast? Or were you acting opposite someone reading lines as, say, Tracy Letts?
 










No, I was pretty isolated, apart from the characters that were in my story. And I got to listen to playback for the questions and, honestly, I was lucky that I got Tracy Letts's performance as my driving material. And they had my performance, even though I hadn't performed it. They had me [do] a telephone run of my lines before I even shot it, which was a bit like, “Oh, I don't even know what I'm going to do.” But I just trusted the script, and they used that in their side of the coverage.

In terms of your character's First Lady, who is away in Kenya, had you ever met Renée Elise Goldsberry? Because that's such an emotional moment in the film, but it sounds like that might've also been playback.

Yeah, actually, that was the one casting opportunity that Kathryn sort of asked [for] my opinion, and we were really lucky to get Renée, she was amazing. And I did. She came to set, but she shot all of her stuff in Kenya, but we were lucky to speak to each other and just look each other in the eye and have a quick connection, I guess.

What level of improvisation was part of this film? Hearing you talk about the basketball game, that wasn't all lined up in the script? You guys were building that as you went along?
 










Yeah, it very much felt like a documentary. I think Kathryn wanted that. She didn't want to know what I was going to say or what I was going to do, and of course, the lines that were written, I say those lines, but if I decided to take off my shoe and say, “Hey, what's going on with the shoe?” That was completely improvised. She encouraged that. When I meet the girls on the basketball court and I'm telling them a story, I just made one up, and then I had to remember what I made up because we did it a couple of times, and I actually really felt quite liberated by that because it just meant that I was really in the character, in the moment. There's cameras everywhere, and you don't know where they all are, so there's no point acting, just being is what it is and being reactive.

And there were scenes, there were some lines where Jonah and I were in the middle [of talking], and one of them made it into the scene; where he's talking and I stop him and I say, “How old are you, son?” And Jonah was so great, he  just made it up. I said, “You married?” And he goes, “Yes, sir.” And just that break in the lines brought a certain realism, and Barry [Ackroyd] was on camera, and he's trying to find this. “Hell, this isn't written down, what is this?” And it really just helped the realism aspect of it.

Speaking of how real things got, did you actually have a close look at what you say is a diner menu of nuclear options that this president has to review? Would an actual POTUS see that to a T?
 










We wouldn't know if it was to the T, but [we] very much designed on what we understood to be fact, the choices the POTUS has in that box all the time. And it is a menu of counterstrikes, thinking in an emergency. And yeah, even though it wasn't to the T as we might understand it, it was very much close, and it was shocking. And many choices of what to do [were] mind-blowing for me. When we shot it, he opened it up, and here's this long incredible speech about it, and I'm like, “What?!”

So you're taking a look at it for the first time in the scene, not quite beforehand?

No, it was all real.

An authentic surprise. Now that you've seen the whole film, what is it like watching it and dealing with its entertainment factor versus its realism?

I watched the film as an audience member because I didn't know much about the first two acts. I had read them obviously, but I didn't know what to expect. I didn't know who was cast. I didn't know what the atmosphere would look like and feel like. So when I watched the movie, I was like anyone who watched it for the first time, and even my segment was like, “Oh my. . . It blew my mind.” I sat there [for] probably about three or four, five minutes just in silence afterwards. “What did I just watch? Was that a movie or was that a documentary?”

Some of the experience is a bit of frustration with your character until we actually see what's going on with him. Did you know that when you were playing him, or did you not pick up on that until you were actually watching the film?
 










I didn't know that, actually. From my character's perspective, “You're telling me I need to get on the phone, the phone is not working. Who am I talking to? Who is this guy? Wait, you're waiting for me? I'm busy, I'm doing something. I was in the middle of something. What's happening here?” Playing catch-up. And then when I watched the movie, I was like, “The president needs to get on the phone. What is he doing?!”

And then you watch the movie, “Is it a basketball game? Wait, what?” I felt the frustration for the audience because it was like, “Isn't he supposed to be on the phone right now? Why is his phone not working?” But there you go, again, that's probably very close to how it would go down.

I believe you've directed or are going to direct a couple upcoming features, “Above the Below” and “Infernus,” since working on “A House of Dynamite.” Did you have any takeaways on that front from working with Kathryn Bigelow?

I'm directing my next film now. I've learned a lot working with Kathryn. She has this incredible, observant perspective on how she makes films. It makes me think about my story, my characters, my environments much deeper, and I'm really looking forward to getting behind the camera, having now worked with one of my directing heroes.

“A House of Dynamite,” a Netflix release, is now in select theaters on Friday, October 10. The film will begin streaming on Netflix on Friday, October 24.

Norman Lear's last credit before his death in 2023 was executive producer of “Boots,” an eight-part adaptation of Greg Cope's memoir “The Pink Marine.” Based on the latter's experiences as a closeted U.S. Marine Corp in an era when it was illegal for homosexuals to serve in the military, the Netflix original may be set in 1990, but in the wake of Donald Trump's transgender ban and Pete Hegseth's claims that gay recruits are part of a Marxist agenda, it proves that even as a 101-year-old, the sitcom pioneer possessed the uncanny ability to stay ahead of the societal curve.   

 










Unlike Amazon's underrated “Clean Slate” (the last Lear project to be completed in his lifetime), in which Laverne Cox's trans woman is largely welcomed home with open arms, “Boots” is less warm-fuzzies and more cold-blooded aggression. The cast must have required a boxful of Chloraseptic by the shoot's end, considering how a good third of the dialogue is shouted at intense decibel-shattering levels.

Created by Andy Parker (“Tales of the City”), “Boots” centers on Cameron Cope (Miles Heizer), a sensitive gay teen cajoled into joining Marine boot camp by his supportive straight best friend Ray McAffey (Liam Oh) during a summer in which possibilities can seem both excitingly infinite and depressingly limiting. While the latter quickly takes to military life, motivated by the desire to please his overwhelmingly stern war veteran dad (the father figures here are uniformly awful), the former immediately starts ruing the day he signed up.   

“Boots” gets plenty of comic mileage from this fish-out-of-water scenario. “We've only been here one day?,” a crestfallen Cameron queries following a baptism of fire in which he's forced to shave his head, scavenge leftovers from the trash, and contend with superiors gleefully proclaiming they'll “snap your head off and s**t down your neck.” In a narrative device which, while gimmicky, helps to signal his shift in personality, he also regularly converses with the slightly more effeminate, ever-disapproving alter-ego he spends 13 weeks desperately trying to mask.  

It's a shame this side doesn't appear more often. 

While it's impressive that Heizer can still convincingly pass as an 18-year-old at age 31 — this isn't a Ben Platt in “Dear Evan Hansen”-style embarrassment — his performance feels a little too muted to connect. Sure, we get why Cameron would repeatedly stifle his true self in front of the drill sergeants who bark the “other” F-word like it's going out of fashion. Likewise with the emotionally stunted bros whose idea of entertainment is a toilet-based challenge dubbed the Brown Bomber (don't ask). But even in the scenes with Ray, the only person he's outed himself to, he's something of a blank canvas. And when he does assume a little more agency later on, his actions — particularly his willingness to drink the Kool-Aid — make him difficult to root for. 

 










Luckily, his fellow tryouts are a little more charismatic. Having spent his entire life in the shadow of Cody (Brandon Tyler Moore), the far more athletic twin brother primed for combat by their sadistic dad, John (Blake Burt) cuts a far more sympathetic figure. Late transfer Jones (Jack Cameron Kay) serves as the anti-Cameron, a confident almost-openly gay man who treats all the ultra-macho machinations with the contempt they deserve. Kieron Moore provides the necessary boo-hiss factor as Slovacek, a Czech-American meathead who accepts the comparisons to Ivan Drago as a badge of honor. 

“Boots” also fails to convey exactly why Cameron would subject himself to the whims of such a toxic environment. Unlike his comrades, his family life is more dysfunctional than deeply troubled. Although mom Barbara (a sadly under-utilized Vera Farmiga) takes several days to realize her son hasn't just popped out for some milk, she's no Norma Bates-esque monster. She undoubtedly cares — see how she castigates the world's most brightly-colored recruitment office for signing up someone so transparently ill-equipped (“These aren't boys to you… they're cannon fodder for when the country needs a good distraction”). While a heartfelt late-in-the-day monologue, the kind which may have graced an Emmy clip had her character been more fleshed out, expresses regret at how she's handled raising such a sensitive soul.   

 










In fact, the show's messaging is muddled throughout, as if it's never quite sure whether it's serving as a Marines recruitment ad or an active deterrent. The sergeants act so relentlessly inhumane they make the “Full Metal Jacket” lot look as menacing as Pee-wee Herman. Yet there are occasions when the show appears to justify their extreme “man up” approach as a means to an end, as if all the wayward recruits needed was some racial and homophobic epithets to whip them into shape.  

Furthermore, the one issue you'd expect to take front and center is often relegated to the background. Indeed, Cameron's desires are barely addressed beyond a few furtive glances in the shower (anyone looking for a clandestine romance to ship should stick to “Heartstopper”). And other than ignoramus Slovacek, the recruits seem an unusually tolerant bunch with no qualms about leaning into the naturally homoerotic. 

Instead of sticking the boot into military homophobia, the show initially seems determined to tiptoe around it. It's only when delving deeper into the backstory of Sgt. Sullivan (Max Parker), a cartoonishly humorless ex-Recon who takes Cameron under his incredibly warped wing, that it starts exploring the hardships of an era when even the Don't Ask, Don't Tell policy seemed enlightened. 

 










It's also here where “Boots” finally appears to find its stride, hitting just the right balance of sitcom-esque quips and emotional beats while also posing an arsenal of tough questions. Let's hope that Netflix gives the show a chance to reveal the answers. The closing scene's breaking news of the Iraq War certainly gives plenty of scope for a second season. And with a bit more spit and a bit less polish, it might even be fit enough to tie the laces of Lear's finest.  

All eight episodes of”Boots” Season 1 are now streaming on Netflix.

Pregnancy changed Oklou's mind as well as her body. “I feel like my consciousness has naturally, without me even trying, gotten rid of any source of stress and anxiety,” she told FKA twigs when the two artists spoke for Highsnobiety earlier this year. On “viscus,” from the forthcoming deluxe edition of Oklou's debut album, choke enough, the French electronic pop star-in-the-making meets one of her direct influences in the ether. At first, the track sounds right at home among the album's filigreed miniatures, but then the tinny percussion, vaporwave synthesisers, and chamber orchestration begin to interlock at new angles, forming a glittering exoskeleton.

As she told Pitchfork in our cover story, Oklou's creative process runs on late-night Logic sessions and long periods of isolation. “viscus” yearns to swap digital ideas for real bodies. “I get lost so deep inside me,” Oklou intones—perhaps a characteristically oblique nod to the chronic stomachaches that she and twigs had bonded over. “The body is a temple/Am I worshipping too hard?” When twigs' voice enters, it's from the other side of the stereo mix, beckoning us from the cloud down to the club. Oklou has said that she used to dance far more than she does today; on “viscus,” we hear those muscles start to engage again.

F
rom creating the Guardians of the Galaxy franchise's mixtapes to making the obscure Iggy Pop/Teddybears nugget “Punkrocker” one of the songs of the summer via Superman, DC Studios co-CEO James Gunn has an impeccable record when it comes to mixing music with superhero universes. Peacemaker‘s just-concluded second season, with its killer Foxy Shazam theme song (“Oh Lord”) and its finale performances by both Foxy and the long-haired rock band Nelson (playing the very deep cut “To Get Back to You”), was no exception. Gunn jumped on a Zoom with Rolling Stone to talk about the season's music and some broader DCU topics. (Some spoilers ahead — and to see what Matthew Nelson had to say about his band's appearance, check out our new interview with him and Gunn.)


Why Nelson? Why this song? How did it happen?I picked the song first. As you know, when I'm putting together songs for Peacemaker, I'm working from a massive list — at this point it's a couple thousand songs that I think are Peacemaker-like songs. When I write a scene that utilizes a piece of music, sometimes I'm sort of inspired by the music to write the scenes, but a lot of times I'm like, “This is a good place for a piece of music. What should I listen to?” And so I go through my list. For this moment, it just seemed the perfect moment for it. And I truly believe that Nelson album, [2010's] Lightning Strikes Twice, is a great album. I mean, nobody knows it. But the whole album is a pretty great example of melodic rock. And the song is fantastic.

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







You're about to change the course of that song's life.Yeah, for sure. Like with the Foxy Shazam song, it really is just a fucking great song.

	











You had that one in your pocket already?No. I mean, I knew the song. It was one of my favorite Foxy Shazam songs. And I'm a really, truly an enormous fan of the band. But I listened to a lot of different songs to try to figure it out, and I really didn't know what I was gonna do. Was I gonna use [Wig Wam's] “Do You Wanna Taste It” again? Was I gonna use something else? And it really had the effect that I thought it would, which is at first everybody was complaining about, “Oh, I like the old song better. I like the old intro better.” And now, as we go into the eighth episode, the most common comment I get on threads is, “Wow, I didn't like it as much at first, but now I like it even more.” And it is such an emotional song. It really works in this scene as well.

Was it always locked into your head that you would have them perform the song on the show?No, but it was always locked in my head that I was going to use the song at the end of the show. In the same way there was always this concept that, you know, “Do You Wanna Taste It” has various different meanings, but it ends up being kind of about the blood in Harcourt's mouth at the end of episode eight. And this song would be about the gathering together of these damaged souls in [new team] Checkmate. So that was always the plan that I would use this song.


	But the idea to put Foxy Shazam in the show was a last-minute addition. I became friends with Eric Nally, the singer of Foxy Shazam. And I was like, you know what, we're gonna be shooting Nelson anyway. What if we had just a couple shots of them and the reveal of them at this concert? And really what it all is leading to is the reason the song is playing is because this was the song where Harcourt and Peacemaker fully came together, kind of as boyfriend-girlfriend at the end of the show.


Are you thinking about ways to use songs in cool ways in other upcoming DCU projects? Or are you leaving that to the individual creators?It's a mix. There's sometimes some hackneyed use of music and I really don't like it. I really don't need to hear “Ballroom Blitz” in another movie for as long as I live. Love the band, but don't need to hear “Ballroom Blitz” in a movie ever again. So when something like that comes up, and it comes up pretty often in these different projects and they're like, “Oh, James will like this because it's Seventies music.” . I'm like, I don't like Seventies music. That was what fit the Guardians. I mean, I do like Seventies music. I like all music.

	I've become a sleaze-metal guy because of Peacemaker, which is a journey that started before this actually. But I'm really a punk-rock guy. All day long I've been listening to my 2025 list, which is a lot of [Canadian punk band] Pup and [Irish punk band] Sprints and then also a lot of other modern alternative, a lot of hip-hop. There's this guy named Russell — that's an amazing hip-hop artist. There's a lot of cool stuff out.


In the upcoming stuff — the Supergirl movie and the HBO Max show Lanterns — are you thinking that way about songs?There's songs in both of those things. But I don't give a shit if there's songs in something or not. For me, I use songs like — listen, Superman to me was a score movie. There's just the one song that is strangely probably the biggest sort of hit song I've had out of a show that wasn't Wig Wam. You know, maybe “Come and Get Your Love” from the first Guardians. But everybody knew “Come and Get Your Love.” It was like a rediscovery of a song from a new perspective


Regarding the vicious twist at the end of Peacemaker from what seemed to be a happy ending — first of all, what's wrong with you?Listen, this journey's not done.


Should people expect that thread to be enormous going forward?Yeah. Since you said you're setting up the semisequel to Superman, Man of Tomorrow, should people expect John Cena's fate, Peacemaker's fate, to be addressed in that movie?No, no, no. But people should expect that the way that the military and Rick Flagg and everybody are working together and they've created a probably illegal prison for metahumans on another dimension is gonna be a part of DCU stories going forward. And not just a tertiary, ‘Oh, this is Arkham' — it's a part of the stories. There's an escalating war, obviously, that's going on between the government and metahumans. And this is a part of it.


So, to be clear, you've made a key part of the DCU going forward about a government official abusing their power by having masked thugs come in the middle of the night and expel innocent people  from the planet.[Grins.] It's just totally fiction, Brian. This is, like, something that can never happen on our planet, but that's the beauty of things like comic books — you can explore things that would never, ever happen on our world.


This war, this thread — will we be seeing this in things like Lanterns and Supergirl? Or is this really your arc and not necessarily the larger story?No, no. Both those things are worked in. We knew both of those stories were a part of what we originally put together, so they're part of the overall tapestry, but they're also their own thing. Supergirl especially is a space adventure. It's like Guardians. Lanterns is its own thing. There's just a longer, sort of a bigger world we're building with all these different pieces and they do all come together and intersect sometimes in a story fashion and sometimes just in a, you know, “here's another piece of the world” fashion.


 Are there other big arcs for this phase?Yeah, yeah. Lanterns is really important in setting up things.

	











People are wondering, by the way, if James Mangold's just-announced deal means that the Swamp Thing  movie he was planning for you is dead.No, no, it doesn't. No.


So you're hopeful on that still?Yeah, I mean, yeah, totally. Absolutely. Yeah. We've talked to him. He's still invested. So we'll see. Some things take a long time. We'll see what happens.

Billie Eilish was violently grabbed by a fan and nearly pulled into the crowd during her concert at the Kaseya Center in Miami Thursday night, Oct. 9.


	Viral video of the incident shows Eilish leaving the stage and exchanging high-fives with fans when someone grabs her arm and tires to yank her into the crowd. This causes Eilish to fall backwards against the barricade, though she was quickly helped up by security. Eilish appeared uninjured, but walked the rest of the way without interacting with fans. 


	In a second overhead video of the incident, there's a fan who is shoved and falls backwards through the crowd before landing on the floor. They're quickly followed by another fan, who appears to be berating them.


	In a statement (via NBC News), the Miami Police Department said the person “was ejected from the Kaseya Center” after the incident, but there are no criminal charges pending. Reps for Eilish did not immediately return a request for comment. 




			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	Eilish has spoken out in the past about fans behaving inappropriately at concerts. In a 2023 interview with The Hollywood Reporter, she addressed the strange phenomenon of people throwing objects on stage during concerts, noting that she'd “been getting hit on stage with things for like, literally, six years.”

	She added: “People just get excited and it can be dangerous. I have mixed feelings about it, because when you're up there it blows. But you know it's out of love and they're just trying to give you something. You're in a vulnerable position, but I've been getting hit with stuff for like years.” (During a December 2024 concert in Arizona, Eilish was hit by what appeared to be a blue bracelet while performing “What Was I Made For?”)

	











	Last night's Miami show marked the start of the new North American leg of Eilish's Hit Me Hard and Soft tour. She has two more shows at the Kaseya Center (Oct. 11 and 12), with additional dates scheduled through November.

                UAP Old Mutual officially rebranded to Old Mutual, marking an exciting new chapter for the business in Uganda.
            





                
The transition is part of a Group-wide rebrand that unifies all operations across Africa under one trusted and recognisable brand – Old Mutual.
            





                
Speaking during the function held in Kampala the Ministry of Finance Permanent Secretary, Ramathan Ggoobi congratulated Old Mutual Uganda on the transition and key milestone but also for its business resilience and serving customers for over 180 years,
            





                
“Today we celebrate Old Mutual‘s strides to empower Ugandans towards financial wellness and overall economic growth,” Ggoobi said.
            





                
He said Uganda was ranked as East Africa's most rewarding economy for investment in the 2023 Africa- Reward Index by Oxford Economics Africa, following a significant improvement in its risk- reward score between 2022 and 2023, adding that the country has met the United Nations' criteria for graduation from the Least Developed Countries (LDC) category, a momentous achievement that signals readiness for economic transformation.
            








                
Ggoobi also mentioned the country's tenfold growth strategy, a blueprint for rapidly expanding Uganda's economy in a transformative, sustainable and inclusive manner.
            





                
“One of the key ambitions under this strategy is to double the level of savings in the economy from 20% GDP in 2022 to 40% GDP in 2024, to match the required level of investment (40% of GDP). We appreciate Old Mutual's efforts in contributing towards Uganda's economic transformation through the life assurance business that offers savings solutions and the investment group business that offers solutions such as the unit trusts.”
            





                
The Insurance Regulatory Authority CEO, Al Hajji Lubega Kaddunabbi said Old Mutual as a leading insurer has actively driven digital innovation, improving customer experience.
            





                
“Additionally, IRA strongly encourages insurance professional development. Old Mutual has also been noticed for its commitment to professional growth. We have had several graduates from Old Mutual through the Insurance Training College (ITC). This is important for public confidence in service delivery,” Kaddunabbi said.
            





                
He commented Old Mutual for standing out for its commitment to Environment, Social, Governance (ESG) initiatives.
            








                
The Old Mutual board chair, Mathias Katamba said this is a   strategic move to solidify Old Mutual's role as a diversified financial services provider, blending digital solutions with a focus on customer financial wellness.
            





                
“In Uganda, we have been purposeful in our growth, evolving from insurance to a truly diversified financial services provider,” said Katamba.
            





                
The Old Mutual Uganda Insurance Managing Director, Stephen Chikovore,said at the heart of the rebrand are the people who make Old Mutual what it is.
            





                
“The rebrand is a recognition of your resilience and your commitment. It is also a promise that as Old Mutual grows, so too will the opportunities, benefits, and experiences available to you. As we step into this future together, let us embrace the opportunities ahead with shared purpose. Together, we will continue to innovate, grow, and strengthen the bonds that make Old Mutual an organization we are all proud of,” Chikovore  said.
            





                
“We are reimagining what it means to work at Old Mutual. With initiatives like enhanced medical schemes, subsidized fitness, and wellness programs, we are making sure your wellbeing is always prioritized. This rebrand also represent broader career pathways, opening doors for you to explore new skills and new roles across the wider Old Mutual Group.”
            





                
He said as the group looks to the future, they  hope for a stronger brand, a stronger future, and a stronger Old Mutual – built for financial wellness for our clients and for the growth, wellbeing, and success of its people.

By                   Kate Quiñones


CNA Staff, Oct 10, 2025 /
            15:07 pm

The Diocese of Lincoln, Nebraska, has determined that a moving relic was “not of supernatural origin” after video of the apparent phenomenon spread across social media.

The viral video depicted a first-class relic of St. Gemma Galgani appearing to move of its own accord behind a display case.

A relic of St. Gemma Galgani has reportedly moved within its sealed reliquary at the University of Nebraska–Lincoln's Newman Center, drawing Catholics from across the state eager to witness it.Video: Lillian Johnson pic.twitter.com/DngPROJScQ

Visitors reportedly came to the Newman Center at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln to see the apparently moving relic. 

But a diocesan investigation found that the source of the movement was a bent hook. 

Father Caleb La Rue, the chancellor for the Diocese of Lincoln, investigated whether the moving relic could be of supernatural origin with the help of another priest.  

He told CNA that the Church has to look at such things with a “healthy skepticism” to see if there are any “natural” causes of the occurrences. 

“Not that these things can't happen — of course, they absolutely can,” he said. “God can work in any myriad of ways.” 

La Rue found that the hook was bent, causing a similar relic to move in the same way when hung on the same hook. When St. Gemma's relic was removed from the hook, it ceased moving on its own. La Rue said because of the bend in the hook, the weight of the reliquary was likely “not evenly distributed.” 

But La Rue also noted that miracles do happen and encouraged people to look for the ordinary ways God shows his presence in our lives. 

“Even if it's not supernatural, I think there's something that God wants all of us to take away from this experience because he either willed or permitted it to happen,” La Rue said.

Church authorities investigate alleged miracles when they receive reports of them. Apparently miraculous phenomena often have to do with the Eucharist, Marian apparitions, and miracles of healing, among others. 

Michael O'Neill, a miracle expert who developed a miracle-tracking website and hosts the EWTN show “Miracle Hunter,” told CNA that the Church “would not in modern times investigate a moving relic.” 

“Traditionally, only a few types of miracles are ever investigated, specifically healing miracles, Marian apparitions, Eucharistic miracles, weeping statues or icons, and incorrupt saints,” O'Neill said. “And each has their own investigative process.” 

(Story continues below)

La Rue, however, noted that it's not impossible for a relic to be moving miraculously in this way. 

“It's, of course, possible. There's far more miraculous things that happen every day,” La Rue said. “You don't want to prematurely begin dampening the fervor. But at the same time, the Church is cautious for a reason because she wants our attention to be on truly miraculous things.”

The Church has documented many miracles related to healing, the Eucharist, and Marian apparitions.

Healing miracles are especially important in the investigation of potential saints. Would-be-saints need several miraculous healings to be attributed to their intercession before the Church will canonize them.

These healing miracles undergo a scrutinous investigation in line with what is called “the Lambertini Criteria,” according to O'Neill. A miracle can be confirmed only if there is no possible scientific explanation for the healing.

The Diocese of Lincoln noted in a statement that miracles still do occur, especially the miracle of the Eucharist, where the consecrated bread and wine become Jesus' body, blood, soul, and divinity. 

“God surrounds us with miracles every day, with the Lord's real presence in the Blessed Sacrament being preeminent of all,” the diocese said in a statement shared with CNA on Thursday. 

La Rue noted that the Newman Center has all-day Eucharistic adoration, where students and staff come to pray in the presence of Jesus Christ. 

“The entire time this was happening, there was Eucharistic exposition going on,” La Rue said. 

He noted that the Eucharist “is the ultimate sign of God's abiding presence with his people and his desire to be a part of our life.” 

“Even if this wasn't what some people were hoping it would be, it doesn't mean that God isn't still very active in our lives,” La Rue said. “Sometimes we maybe just don't pay attention to the little ways in which he is.”

O'Neill noted that the official norms for addressing miracles were adjusted last year, meaning that the Church doesn't explicitly declare occurrences to be supernatural, but rather uses the designation “nihil obstat,” meaning “nothing obstructs.” 

This means that the miracle has “signs” of the Holy Spirit and nothing “critical or risky” has been detected. 

While nihil obstat is the highest designation a proposed miracle can receive in modern times, the Vatican, according to the recent norms, can also denounce alleged miracles if the Church finds them to be concerning, not of supernatural origin, or even fraudulent. 

La Rue encouraged those who had hoped for a miracle to “be mindful of the ordinary ways in which God communicates his love and his grace to us throughout the day.”

“It doesn't necessarily need to be something spectacular, but there's lots of little ways that God is constantly showing us his care for us,” La Rue said. 

La Rue, who is in residence at the Newman Center, noted that the vibrant community is growing. 

“It's a place where young people are really encountering Our Lord and encountering each other and building strong friendships and lasting friendships founded on shared love of God and wanting to live a full life, a joyful life,” La Rue said. 

About 70 people entered the Church through the center's OCIA program last year. 

“The number of people who came to join the church last year who just literally just showed up — nobody went and found them,” La Rue said. “We certainly have those people, but a lot of them just came on their own.” 

Sunday Mass, he said, is “standing room only.”

The parents of 12-year-old Sophia Forchas, who was shot in the head during the Annunciation Catholic School shooting, say her progress has been “miraculous.”

St. Ferdinand Church, located in the historic heart of Naples, Italy, was the scene of a July 24 event that many are already calling miraculous.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=Conspiracy+Theories","NHS doctors spread antisemitic conspiracy theories on Facebook","https://www.thetimes.com/uk/healthcare/article/nhs-doctors-antisemitism-hamas-nkk88hstg","Fri, 10 Oct 2025 20:00:00 GMT","

An NHS doctor promoted a conspiracy theory suggesting that the Manchester synagogue terrorist attack was a “false flag operation” to “boost sympathy” for Israel, The Times can reveal. 

Dr Asad Khan, a respiratory consultant in Manchester, cast doubt on the motive for the attack —which left two Jewish worshippers dead — on the Facebook group the On-Call Room, in which GMC-registered doctors engage in “lively banter and debate”. 

On the day of the synagogue attack, he was involved in a discussion with a fellow doctor in the 17,000-strong group, who accused him of being antisemitic. 

Khan said he had been “raising the possibility of this being a false flag”, adding “I may be right or wrong. I have the right to speculate. There have been false flag antisemitic incidents before, including synagogue attacks”. 

The consultant, who garnered national press coverage after catching long Covid while working at an urgent care ward during the pandemic, promoted the conspiracy theory again on Instagram. 

He posted a screenshot of a post on X that said: “The synagogue incident in Manchester is a conveniently-timed false flag. A little warm up for the next October 7. Israeli sympathy is running low and obviously needs a boost.” 

Khan also reposted a thread on X that blames Israel for attacks against Jews. It said: “If a pro-Israel Zionist synagogue in the UK was attacked because of the genocide in Palestine, then we shouldn't be surprised or horrified.

“It's really quite simple. If you want Jews to feel safe, stop allowing Zionist Jews to annihilate Palestinians in the name of their Jewishness.” The thread added that hatred towards Jews would be valid thanks to “Jewish supremacy”.

There have been repeated warnings from campaigners that antisemitism has been able to “fester unchecked” in the NHS and medical profession since the October 7 attacks.

Five-star reviews of the group describe it as an “eye opener”, the “naughtiest medical forum in the West” and “not for the faint-hearted”. However, allegedly antisemitic posts are littered among memes, civil debates about strike action and discussions about life on an NHS ward. 

On October 17, 2023, days after the Hamas attacks, Dr Shamroz Afghan, a GP in Dundee, said “justice meant that Zionism must be eradicated” and described the ideology as an “inherently racist apartheid system based on Jewish supremacy”.

In a separate post, Afghan wrote that Gaza was a “military testing ground, organ harvesting area… where tourists go to watch bombs be dropped on people”. 

In December last year, Dr Oyin Abiki, a junior doctor in NHS North East, posted a message in the group saying that Hamas was “the natural response to oppression unfortunately” and could be viewed as a “liberation army”. 

She added: “I can absolutely see how this neocolonialism has led to the creation of this terrorist group, which many would probably call the liberation army from the perspective of the oppressed.”

Alex Hearn, co-director of Labour Against Antisemitism, said: “Atrocity denial and disinformation not only causes huge distress to the victims of the families and the community. It can also incite further violence by invoking hatred, fear, and resentment. 

“For a registered doctor to promote these harmful ideas goes against the core mission of health professionals and creates distrust of the profession. He [Asad Khan] should be struck off immediately.”

• Antisemitic doctors to be banned from treating patients

Hearn added that the “sheer amount of hostility and misinformation” on the Facebook group was very concerning. 

“From denials about false flags to grotesque fantasies about organ harvesting, this group has demonstrated a sick fixation which goes well beyond the borders of legitimate concern for Palestinians,” he said. 

The doctors and the On-Call Room group were approached for comment.

Nearly 500 complaints of antisemitism relating to 123 doctors have been submitted to the General Medical Council (GMC) since the Hamas attacks. Of these, 84 per cent were closed at the triage stage, according to figures obtained by Jewish News in July.

After several high-profile incidents in which doctors were let off after spreading antisemitic tropes, Wes Streeting announced plans to overhaul the GMC to “make it easier to kick racists out of the NHS”.

• Schools, NHS and ‘two-tier' police accused over antisemitism

The health secretary is set to update legislation so that doctors accused of misconduct are stripped of their right to practise while under investigation. At present, no one has the power to suspend doctors until their case has been heard at a tribunal.

One such case was that of Dr Rahmeh Aladwan, a trainee trauma and orthopaedic surgeon who has praised Palestinian armed fighters as “heroes” and was filmed making a “throat slit” gesture at Jews. 

Aladwan was ruled fit to practise last month by the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service (MPTS) after it said that her comments, which included a claim that the “Royal Free Hospital in London is a Jewish supremacy cesspit”, would not “alarm or concern” members of the public.

The GMC referred her case to an interim orders tribunal last month and argued for a 12-month interim restriction on the doctor's ability to practise. However, the tribunal panel found that Aladwan could continue to work as public protection “must be balanced with the doctor's right to freedom of expression”. 

The GMC has referred her case back to the MPTS and a hearing is due to take place this month.

The rare cases where complaints have led to disciplinary action include that of Dr Manoj Sen, an NHS surgeon. Last month, he was struck off for making a string of antisemitic social media comments, including referring to a Jewish man as “circumcised vermin”. 

The British Medical Association (BMA), the trade union body for doctors and medical students in the UK, has also been repeatedly accused of failing to tackle antisemitism. 

Those attending the BMA's annual conference this year warned that they “feared for their safety” after more than 40 motions were put forward for debate at the conference relating to the conflict in Gaza, including calls to allow NHS staff to display the Palestinian flag at work. 

There have been widespread reports of antisemitic incidents in hospitals. In August, the University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust issued an apology after posters were put up on hospital walls saying: “Zionism is poison.”

A concise essay explores the core reasons there is so much corruption and manipulation in our world and gives inspiring ideas on what we can do to create a brighter future.  

This thought-provoking piece examines how the primary means for manipulating are through promoting fear, secrecy, and polarization, and through distracting people from their deeper purpose in life. It also provides concrete ways we can turn all of this around. 

Don't lose hope. This inspiring essay reminds us in a most eloquent way that we were made for these times. Here's one paragraph of this poetic writing. 

""Ours is not the task of fixing the entire world all at once, but of stretching out to mend the part of the world that is within our reach. Any small, calm thing that one soul can do to help another soul, to assist some portion of this poor suffering world, will help immensely. It is not given to us to know which acts or by whom, will cause the critical mass to tip toward an enduring good.""

The penthouse of the sleek, postmodern Metropolitan Tower in Midtown Manhattan offers panoramic views of New York. But for more than five years, a former Wall Street trader used it as a sex “dungeon,” luring women in and leaving them maimed and bruised, federal prosecutors say. Howard Rubin, 70, a former Salomon Brothers bond trader ... was arrested Friday on sex trafficking charges. Prosecutors said he brought women to the penthouse blocks from Central Park, where a bedroom was painted red, soundproofed and fitted with devices to use on the women. Along with a personal assistant, Jennifer Powers, Mr. Rubin recruited and paid at least a half-dozen women to participate in bondage and sadomasochism, but the acts went far beyond what the women had signed up for. Prosecutors said Mr. Rubin took advantage of the women, many of whom were especially vulnerable because of their histories of addiction and abuse. Though women were told they could use a “safe word” to stop any sexual encounter, prosecutors said they were often unable to utter it because they were gagged or Mr. Rubin simply ignored their pleas. The room would often remain locked during the encounters ... while the women were shocked, beaten and violated. Mr. Rubin also provided the women with copious amounts of drugs and alcohol before their sex acts. In one encounter, Mr. Rubin gave a female victim a sedative that made her unconscious so he could enact a rape fantasy.

Note: This article is also available here. Howie Rubin (mentioned in this article) was accused in a 2017 lawsuit of beating a woman's breasts so badly that her right implant flipped. Elite predators like Rubin and Harvey Weinstein often make their victims sign non-disclosure agreements to keep them quiet using the law. For more along these lines, read our concise summaries of news articles on sexual abuse scandals. ","{'href': 'https://www.wanttoknow.info', 'title': 'wanttoknow.info'}","other"

A concise essay explores the core reasons there is so much corruption and manipulation in our world and gives inspiring ideas on what we can do to create a brighter future.  

This thought-provoking piece examines how the primary means for manipulating are through promoting fear, secrecy, and polarization, and through distracting people from their deeper purpose in life. It also provides concrete ways we can turn all of this around. 

Don't lose hope. This inspiring essay reminds us in a most eloquent way that we were made for these times. Here's one paragraph of this poetic writing. 

""Ours is not the task of fixing the entire world all at once, but of stretching out to mend the part of the world that is within our reach. Any small, calm thing that one soul can do to help another soul, to assist some portion of this poor suffering world, will help immensely. It is not given to us to know which acts or by whom, will cause the critical mass to tip toward an enduring good.""


          Verifiable information and news on high-level corruption and cover-ups,
          and the powerful forces creating positive change and transformation.
        

Having a sense of purpose in life may help people live longer. Now, new research from the University of California in Davis shows that having a sense of purpose in life may have another benefit as people age: reducing the risk of dementia. The new study ... found that people who reported a higher sense of purpose in life were about 28% less likely to develop cognitive impairment—including mild cognitive impairment and dementia. The protective effect of having a purpose was seen across racial and ethnic groups. It also remained significant even after accounting for education, depression, and the APOE4 gene, which is a known risk factor for Alzheimer's disease. “Our findings show that having a sense of purpose helps the brain stay resilient with age,” said Aliza Wingo, senior author. “Even for people with a genetic risk for Alzheimer's disease, sense of purpose was linked to a later onset and lower likelihood of developing dementia.” The findings support the idea that psychological well-being plays a key role in healthy aging, said Thomas Wingo, a co-author of the study. Wingo hopes future studies will explore whether purpose-building interventions can help prevent dementia. “What's exciting about this study is that people may be able to ‘think' themselves into better health. Purpose in life is something we can nurture,” he said. “It's never too early — or too late — to start thinking about what gives your life meaning.”

Up to 19 people are missing, feared dead after an explosion that destroyed a munitions factory in Tennessee.

The plant near Bucksnort, about 60 miles west of Nashville, caught fire and exploded on Friday.

In a tearful press conference, Chris Davis, the Humphreys County sheriff, said: “This is the most devastating incident I have been on in my career.

“I can tell you right now that we're looking for 19 individuals. A lot of times, when I have this type of situation, I refer to more than just a person. They're a soul to me.”

Reluctant to say how many had died, Mr Davis told reporters there was a possibility that at least some of the missing could be injured. Asked if anything of the factory remained, he said: “There is nothing to describe, it's gone.”

After the initial explosion at the Accurate Energetic Systems factory, which was felt more than 10 miles away, flames set off secondary blasts, delaying attempts to rescue any survivors. Debris fell into the garden of a house four miles from the plant.

Authorities appealed to people to stay away from the site as the US Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives was called to the scene.

The factory makes and tests explosives for the military, aerospace, demolition and mining industries. It also produces explosive charges used to control avalanches.

Founded in 1980, Accurate Energetic Systems “proudly holds certification as a Small Business Alliance women-owned small business,” according to its website. The company is yet to comment.

ABC reported that the munitions plant serves the US departments of defence and homeland security, according to the Association of the United States Army. It currently holds contracts worth $140m with the US government.

A safety document written for regulators said the site, which covers 1,300 acres, contains large amounts of TNT. It means firefighting teams were advised to use a dry powder agent, rather than water, to douse the blaze.

The explosion took place just before 8am CDT (2pm BST) and destroyed one of the facility's buildings, officials said.

Sheriff Davis said: “We do have several people at this time unaccounted for. We are trying to be mindful of families and that situation. We do have some that are deceased.”

“We got a very big investigation. This is not going to be something that is like a car wreck or something like that, that we're just going to clean up the debris and leave. We're going to probably be here for a few days.

“We're trying to take as much time as is needed right now. We're prioritising people that are involved, their families, and trying to be very compassionate toward them.”

The cause of the explosion was not immediately known. Video from the scene showed flames and heavy smoke rising from a debris field, and residents miles away reported feeling the blast.

A Hickman County emergency services spokesman said it is not yet known if any rescue workers were hurt in the secondary explosion.

Brad Rachford, the mayor of nearby McEwen, where Accurate Energetic Systems' headquarters is based, said: “This is a tragedy for our community.”

Drone footage from the scene showed at least one building had been almost completely obliterated, with rubble strewn across a huge stretch of ground.

In the clips, a huge black cloud of smoke rises from the smouldering wreckage. Burnt and smashed up cars, some still neatly parked, can be seen in the car park. First photographs of the scene showed swathes of the local vegetation destroyed.

Residents in Lobelville, a 20-minute drive from the scene, said they felt their homes shake, and some people captured the loud boom of the explosion on their home cameras.

The blast rattled Gentry Stover from his sleep. He said: “I thought the house had collapsed with me inside of it. I live very close to Accurate and I realised about 30 seconds after I woke up that it had to have been that.”

A federal judge ruled Friday that the Trump administration cannot put conditions on grants that fund efforts to combat domestic violence, including barring groups from promoting diversity, equity and inclusion or providing abortion resources.

U.S. District Court Judge Melissa DuBose in Providence, Rhode Island, granted a motion by 17 statewide anti-domestic and sexual violence coalitions for a preliminary injunction, which blocks the Trump administration from enforcing its conditions while the lawsuit plays out. 

“Without preliminary relief, the Plaintiffs will face irreparable harm that will disrupt vital services to victims of homelessness and domestic and sexual violence,” DuBose wrote in her ruling. “On the contrary, if preliminary relief is granted, the Defendants will merely need to revert back to considering grant applications and awarding funds as they normally would.”

DuBose, however, went further in the scope of her ruling. She ruled that the decision preventing these grant conditions went beyond plaintiffs and will apply to anyone applying for money doled out by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.

“Organizations serving survivors of domestic violence and sexual assault, LGBTQ+ youth, and people experiencing homelessness should not be forced to abandon their work, erase the identities of those they serve, or compromise their values just to keep their doors open,” Skye Perryman, president and CEO of Democracy Forward, which was one of the groups representing plaintiffs, said in a statement. “This unlawful and harmful policy puts extreme schemes ahead of people's dignity and safety by restricting essential federal support.”




Emily Martin, chief program officer at the National Women's Law Center, one of five organizations representing the coalitions, also welcomed the ruling.

“When this administration claims to be targeting ‘illegal DEI' and ‘gender ideology,' what it is really trying to do is strip life-saving services from survivors of sexual violence and domestic violence, LGBTQ+ youth, and people without homes,” Martin said. “Today's order makes clear that these federal grants exist to serve people in need, not to advance a regressive political agenda.”

Neither HUD nor HHS responded to a request for comment.

In their July lawsuit, the groups said the Trump administration was putting them in a difficult position.

If they don't apply for federal money allocated under the Violence Against Women Act of 1994, they might not be able to provide rape crisis centers, battered women's shelters and other programs to support victims of domestic violence and sexual assault. But if the groups do apply, they said they would be forced to “fundamentally change their programming, abandon outreach methods and programs designed to best serve their communities, and risk exposing themselves to ruinous liability.”

The groups suing, including organizations combating domestic violence from California to Rhode Island, argue the conditions violate the First Amendment. They also argue that the conditions violate the Administrative Procedure Act by exceeding defendants' authority by “in some cases outright conflicting with governing law or failing to follow required procedure.”

The government argues that the matter has to do with payments to these groups and, as such, should be handled by the Court of Federal Claims. 

Even if the jurisdiction argument fails, the government argues federal agencies may impose conditions on funding that “further certain policies and priorities consistent with the authority provided by grant program statutes.”

“Both agencies have long required compliance with federal antidiscrimination law as a condition of receiving a federal grant,” the government wrote in court documents.

Another Rhode Island judge granted a preliminary injunction in August involving some of the same groups in a lawsuit against the Justice Department.

File Copy: Super Eagles Players

Kindly share this story:

The Super Eagles moved a step closer to 2026 FIFA World Cup qualification after edging Lesotho 2-1 on Friday in a match that could prove decisive for Nigeria's campaign.
Troost Ekong gave Nigeria the perfect start in the 55th minute by converting a penalty following a handball in the Lesotho box, sending the home fans into jubilation.
Akor Adams later doubled the advantage with a clinical finish in the 80th minute, seemingly putting Nigeria in control. Lesotho responded in the 83rd minute with a goal from Kalake, but the Eagles held firm to secure the crucial three points.
However, Benin Republic scored in their own match, meaning Nigeria remain behind on points and goal difference in Group C. With only one game remaining in the group, the Eagles' fate is not entirely in their hands. 






With Nigeria on 14 points and Benin now leading the group with 17 points, the Eagles still have several pathways to automatic qualification:  Related News  WCQ: Mbappe on target as France see off Azerbaijan  Nigeria, UK sign new deals on deportations, crime cooperation  How Super Eagles can qualify for 2026 World Cup   
The first pathway is to win the final match against Benin Republic. A victory is essential for the team to stay in contention.
The second pathway is for the Super Eagles to hope for a slip-up. Benin Republic and South Africa must drop points in their last fixtures.        
The third pathway is to improve the goal difference. Nigeria trail Benin and South Africa, so scoring more goals and keeping a clean sheet could be decisive if teams finish level on points.
A final-day showdown could also be crucial. A strong performance in the last round could see Nigeria overtake the leaders, Benin Republic and secure the top spot.
For Lesotho, the defeat is a harsh blow, effectively ending their hopes of qualifying from the group. With nine points from five matches, they now need an almost impossible combination of results to stay in contention.
