                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>If you want to know where the best leaf peeping will be this year, climate science and weather can provide the answer A decade later the meteorologist and geospatial analyst set out to use his professional skills to predict where he could find the most striking reds, oranges, yellows and purples each year. Together with a college friend, Fisher began using data on temperature, daylight hours and precipitation to build a machine-learning model that could forecast where the first signs of autumn would appear and when the colors would reach their peak throughout the country. In 2023 the team launched Explore Fall, a public platform that is able to predict fall foliage progression across the continental U.S. Fisher and other experts agree that autumn foliage is arriving early this year.

During autumn, three main factors—day length, temperature and rainfall—influence when the leaves of various tree species change color, how long that takes and how vibrant the colors are. Reduced sunlight, for example, slows photosynthesis, which reorganizes leaf pigments and causes them to change color. Rainfall during the summer increases soil moisture, making leaves more vibrant when autumn arrives, whereas summer drought can mean dull foliage. Maple leaves, for instance, get their vivid reds and deep purples from anthocyanins, pigments that form when sugars accumulate after growth stops in fall. Cool nights trap these sugars, enhancing color, whereas warm nights deplete them, causing anthocyanins to fade and the leaves to lose their characteristic autumn brilliance.Meanwhile research has shown that warmer conditions delay leaf fall in oak and beech, whereas other studies find the opposite is true in birch and poplar. Extreme weather events such as early frosts, drought and high heat or rainfall also have a strong effect on the brightness and timing of leaf color, says University of Arizona plant phenologist Theresa Crimmins. Stress on trees can dull the display and, in some cases, cause leaves to drop without ever changing color. Across the West, severe drought will trigger early, less vivid foliage. The Explore Fall team trained its model to capture these patterns, using deep learning to process decades of data on temperature, daylight and rainfall. The system classifies regions into categories ranging from “Little to No Color” to “Peak Color” and can adjust predictions with satellite observations. Although leaf color change has remained stable over the past two years, data going further back in time show that peak color has been arriving earlier than before, which may be “a sign of what is still to come,” Fisher says. Research bears this observation out: A 2023 study that used satellite data, ground observations, measurements of atmospheric carbon and controlled experiments to separate the roles of temperature, photosynthesis and day length found that warming before the summer solstice tends to make senescence start earlier. Though a longer period of senescence might sound exciting for autumn enthusiasts, the downside is that leaves have less time to photosynthesize. “As soon as leaves lose their green color in autumn, they switch to producing CO2, and if that period gets longer, that can be a problem,” because it contributes to global warming, says ecologist Constantin Zohner of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich, who co-authored the 2023 paper.

Crucial negotiations on what would have been the first ever global agreement to limit plastic pollution collapsed last month amid acrimony and distrust. This week, hopes for an agreement suffered another blow when Ecuador's ambassador Luis Vayas Valdivieso resigned as chair of the intergovernmental negotiating committee (INC) for the treaty. Plastics pollution is surging — the planned UN treaty to curb it must be ambitious Plastics pollution is surging — the planned UN treaty to curb it must be ambitious Nature spoke to Samuel Winton, a researcher at University of Portsmouth, UK, who is studying the treaty's progress, about what went wrong, and what can be done to salvage a process that aims to end one of humanity's biggest blights on the planet. I am still convinced, despite the challenges of this process, that a plastics treaty is essential. I don't think it is realistic — and I'm not convinced it is necessary — to say we are going to cap plastic production at a certain level by a certain date. My ambition would be for there to be a globally enforced environment whereby, with the use of alternative business models or products, the market chooses to adopt those regardless of a ban on certain plastics. There has been a lot of progress among the High Ambition Coalition of countries (a group that includes the European Union, United Kingdom and more than 50 other nations) in understanding where each other's red lines are and how countries could work together. And we are seeing movement from countries like China to a more moderate position. But there are others, such as Saudi Arabia, Iran and Russia — the ‘like-minded group' — whose positions haven't moved at all. Where a process works on consensus and you have a few countries refusing to move on certain things, it becomes very difficult to make progress. The high ambition coalition, for example, have stated that they are not a negotiating block. A genuine negotiating block could have helped achieve some more progress than we've seen.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A 1.37-inch inscription could upend our understanding of the religion's spread. An 1,800-year-old silver amulet discovered buried in a Frankfurt, Germany grave, still next to the chin of the man who wore it, has 18 lines of text written in Latin on just 1.37 inches of silver foil. Every other link to reliable evidence of Christian life in the northern Alpine area of the Roman Empire is at least 50 years younger, all coming from the fourth century A.D. “This extraordinary find affects many areas of research and will keep science busy for a long time,” Ina Hartwig, Frankfurt's head of culture and science, said in a translated statement. Such a significant find here in Frankfurt is truly something extraordinary.” The amulet was found in what was once the Roman city of Nida at an archaeological site outside of Frankfurt in 2018. The wafer-thin silver foil was too brittle to roll out. In May 2024, a breakthrough came when using a state-of-the-art computer tomograph at the Leibniz Center for Archaeology in Mainz. Markus Scholz from Frankfurt's Goethe University was able to piece together the 18 lines. “Sometimes it took weeks, even months, until I had the next idea,” he said in a statement. “I called in experts from the history of theology, among others, and we approached the text together bit by bit and ultimately deciphered it.” Some edges were lost due to damage and some words remain open to discussion. The original inscription is entirely in Latin, unusual for a time that featured amulets written in Greek or Hebrew. During the third century A.D., association with Christianity was still dangerous, and identifying as Christian came with great personal risk, especially as Roman emperor Nero punished Christians with death or even a date in the Colosseum. That was no matter for this man in Frankfurt who took his allegiance to Jesus Christ to his grave. “As a result, the history of Christianity in Frankfurt and far beyond will have to be turned back by around 50 to 100 years. We can be proud of this, especially now, so close to Christmas.” Tim Newcomb is a journalist based in the Pacific Northwest.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A recent editorial in Biocontaminant reveals that Guangdong Province is now facing the largest chikungunya fever outbreak ever documented in China, with more than 4,000 confirmed infections reported since late July. Chikungunya fever spreads through bites from Aedes mosquitoes, the same insects that transmit dengue and Zika viruses. The illness, which causes fever and intense joint pain, does not pass directly between people, so reducing mosquito populations remains the most effective way to prevent transmission. The editorial notes that factors such as climate change, rapid urbanization, and increasing international travel are helping mosquito-borne viruses spread more widely, creating new public health challenges around the world. To address these growing threats, the World Health Organization has issued new clinical guidelines and strengthened its Global Arbovirus Initiative, which focuses on improving monitoring, prevention, and international coordination. While the disease rarely causes death, it can result in long-term arthritis-like symptoms, fatigue, and recurring pain that persist for weeks or even months after recovery.Most patients experience a sudden onset of fever, headache, muscle aches, rash, and joint swelling within a few days of being bitten by an infected mosquito. There is currently no specific antiviral treatment or licensed vaccine for chikungunya, so medical care focuses on relieving symptoms through rest, hydration, and pain management. These mosquitoes are highly adapted to urban environments and breed in small containers of stagnant water commonly found around homes, such as flower pots, discarded tires, and buckets. They are active mainly during the day, with peak biting times in the early morning and late afternoon.Scientists note that Aedes mosquitoes are expanding their range due to warmer temperatures, global trade, and increased urbanization, allowing diseases once confined to the tropics to appear in new regions.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Let's face it, cars have rapidly become extensions of our smartphones. This seamless integration—facilitated by software like Apple CarPlay and Android Auto—allows mission-critical phone apps to be displayed on the much larger infotainment screens of our cars. However, not all automakers have signed off on adding these services; Rivian, Tesla, and General Motors are among the few automakers that have yet to allow Apple and Google's services into their automobiles. EV Play is an Android-powered device that connects directly to the vehicle's infotainment system. The $399 device is currently available for pre-order, with a $99 refundable deposit required. There's also an optional $36 annual subscription that adds new feature updates and an extended warranty, along with priority tech support and access to developer forums. Once installed, the box itself features two USB ports that allow you to add dongles for wireless keyboards and WiFi, which you should also be able to use them for wired Apple CarPlay and Android Auto access. Once everything is installed, Amprocity includes a wireless one-button remote for switching between EV Play access and the vehicle's standard interface. Amprocity mentions Gen2 Rivian vehicles will revert to the standard system when reverse gear is engaged to retain use of the backup camera. The touch-screen controls also appear very responsive—unlike many of the CarPlay tablet add-on solutions we've seen previously, which were marketed as a one-size-fits-most approach. With pre-orders supposedly over, we're looking at hopefully evaluating an EV Play module ourselves in the near future.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Today, the ruins of the ancient Mexican city of Teotihuacan are a popular destination for tourists and archaeologists today, but 2,000 years ago, the site was called home by a population over 125,000. Magnus Pharao Hansen and Christopher Helmke believe that the symbols on Teotihuacan's colorful murals and artifacts may be more than pretty pictures—they may be a writing system. “If we are right, it is not only remarkable that we have deciphered a writing system,” Helmke said in a statement. Founded around 100 B.C.E., Teotihuacan served as a major cultural center in central Mexico for around 700 years, holding great cultural significance in ancient Mesoamerica. “There are many different cultures in Mexico,” Pharao Hansen said. “Some of them can be linked to specific archaeological cultures. That link may be about to become more clear, according to a study published by the researchers in the journal Current Anthropology. “We propose that Teotihuacan writing shared basic principles with other Mesoamerican scribal traditions,” the authors wrote, arguing that Teotihuacan culture encoded a specific and identifiable language, “namely, an Uto-Aztecan language immediately ancestral to Nahuatl, Cora, and Huichol.” The Teotihuacan written language uses a mix of logograms (where, for example, an image of a coyote directly translates to ‘coyote') and rebus (where the sounds of the objects must be merged to form a word—a more conceptual and difficult-to-decipher approach). “In Teotihuacan, you can still find pottery with text on it, and we know that more murals will turn up,” Pharao Hansen said. “It is clearly a limitation to our research that we do not have more texts. It would be great if we could find the same signs used in the same way in many more contexts. “No one before us has used a language that fits the time period to decipher this written language,” Pharao Hansen said. “Nor has anyone been able to prove that certain logograms had a phonetic value that could be used in contexts other than the logogram's main meaning. In this way, we have created a method that can serve as a baseline for others to build on in order to expand their understanding of the texts.” Tim Newcomb is a journalist based in the Pacific Northwest.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Babies Are Born with High Levels of Alzheimer's-Linked Proteins in Their Brains Alzheimer's disease is characterized by certain key changes in the brain. These changes can be identified in a few ways. Medical professionals and scientists can see the extent of these protein deposits in the brain using sophisticated and expensive neuroimaging. Another diagnostic option involves measuring amyloid beta and certain modified forms of tau in the cerebrospinal fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord, but collecting this fluid requires a lumbar puncture, which many people find too invasive. From the time this particular marker was identified, researchers realized it could help detect “preclinical Alzheimer's disease,” that is, the presence of amyloid beta brain pathology prior to any symptoms.

Normal tau protein is involved in binding and stabilizing the network of proteins that give a neuron its structure. In the new study, an international research team measured levels of pTau217 in blood samples from two groups of healthy newborns and compared them with levels found in teenagers, adults aged 18 to 25 and seniors aged 70 to 77. In many cases these children had even higher levels of blood pTau217 than babies born at the expected delivery date. Levels of pTau217 appeared to decrease as both preterm infants grew older and by about 20 weeks after birth reached the levels found among healthy young adults. Some people in this group had Alzheimer's dementia, others had what is called mild cognitive impairment of the Alzheimer's type (which is sometimes a precursor to the disease) while another group with no evidence of dementia or cognitive decline served as a control. The researchers found that people with either mild cognitive impairment or dementia had pTau217 levels that were higher than otherwise healthy adults but were still less than half of what was found among healthy newborns. This is consistent with earlier studies showing high levels of total tau in fetal brains with peak levels at around four to five months of gestation and then decreasing two-foldby the sixth month after birth. For example, the researchers also found lower levels of amyloid beta in blood samples from healthy newborns than in older study participants. And, curiously, a protein called neurofilament light chain, often linked to brain injury, was elevated in newborns compared with teens and adults—but not as high as what was found in elderly people. That last finding in babies may be explained by developmental processes in the newborn brain and by cranial compression during birth which, especially in the case of vaginal delivery, leads to increased levels of that protein. Significantly, there is no evidence that the same tangles arise in a fetus or newborn despite the occurrence of similarly modified tau proteins. The adult brain typically has six isoforms of tau, but the fetus has a distinct fetal isoform that may support important processes during development. It's possible fetal tau is somehow protective or resilient in ways that allow baby brains to avoid the formation of tangles linked to toxic outcomes in older adults.Thisstudy cannot fully determine that point, however, in part because the methods used do not discriminate between fetal tau and other isoforms—more research will be needed to explore that possibility. And there are still other circumstances where the hyperphosphorylation of tau is reversed. A more intrepid experiment found similar changes in hibernating black bears. The researchers speculated that phosphorylation in this context may be protective, essentially limiting cellular activity during periods of metabolic stress. In a separate research avenue, scientists have found that anesthesia in mice can induce tau phosphorylation through mechanisms at least partially related to hypothermia. This brain change is generally reversible unless the mice undergo repeated anesthesia—something that may itself increase the risk for Alzheimer's dementia in humans. A newborn child and a 60-year-old adult who is noticing forgetfulness or disorientation may both test positive for pTau217, but no one will conclude that the baby has Alzheimer's disease. Yet there is robust debate over whether or not it makes sense to define Alzheimer's disease in ways that emphasize these protein markers in adults, as opposed to leaning principally on clinical evaluation for diagnosis. The new finding doesn't settle this debate, but it does suggest that continued study of tau and the processes that reverse its buildup may reveal insights that Alzheimer's interventions can harness.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>For most, this is just a symptom of the fact that dogs are descended from wolves, but for one animal recently found in the wild, its part-wolf part-dog nature is very real. Wolves (canis lupus) and dogs (canis lupus familiaris) are thought to have  diverged sometime between 27,000 and 40,000 years ago, and the ancestor of domestic dogs is likely a long-extinct descendant of gray wolves. Wolf-dog hybrids have been controversially bred, but are rare in the wild. Wolves only breed once a year, and even if they encounter a lost or feral dog during that time, they are so territorial that they are more likely to chase or even kill it than allow it into their domain for mating. Still, the fragments of dog ancestry found in more than half of Eurasian wolf genomes show that interbreeding has occurred on its own. The hybrid was accidentally discovered by Greek wildlife group Callisto during an effort to trap a rogue wolf in nearby Halkidiki. While there have been claims of wolf-dogs on the prowl in Europe, they (along with similar sightings in the U.S. and Central Asia) have mostly been based on looks alone, so any stray that looks even remotely like a wolf could have been identified as a hybrid. When Callisto conducted DNA tests on 50 wolf samples from the Greek mainland, however, they revealed this one individual to be 55% dog and 45% wolf. Callisto has been tracking the wolf population in Greece, which has been flourishing since the Bern Convention (whose purpose is to study and protect endangered large carnivores like wolves and bears) banned hunting wolves in 1983. At least three packs of around 31 wolves each roam the Mount Parnitha range right outside Athens, and after recently concluding a six-year study on the Greek wolf population, Callisto has determined a total population of 2,075 individuals. The biotech company extracted DNA from ancient dire wolf samples and merged it with progenitor cells from existing gray wolves, which can differentiate into different types of tissues. Over 3 million stray dogs and cats are estimated to wander the streets of the country, often relying on restaurant scraps for food. It is possible that one of these dogs ended up in wolf territory, mated with a wolf, and emerged unscathed, with the wolf-dog being the result of that encounter.

Researchers who study trends in illicit drug use are concerned that sales of a potent class of synthetic opioids called nitazenes are on the rise globally. The first nitazenes were developed as painkillers in the 1950s, but were never approved for medical use because they carried a high risk of dangerous side effects such loss of consciousness, coma and death. In 2023, the report states, 20 different nitazenes were seized by authorities across 28 countries and reported to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) Early Warning Advisory on New Psychoactive Substances. This means that just a tiny amount can be deadly. And reports suggest that thousands of people might have died from nitazene overdoses in the United States since 2019. Most nitazene overdoses are unintentional, says Suzanne Nielsen, an addiction researcher at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>New Clues Suggest San Andreas and Cascadia Faults May Produce Synchronized Earthquakes The West Coast of North America is a geologically tumultuous zone where tectonic plates collide, subducting under and scraping past one another. Over the eons, this activity has regularly caused major earthquakes. Chris Goldfinger, an Oregon State University marine geologist and lead author of the new paper, compares the process to tuning an analog radio, in which the device's oscillators are synced up to convert incoming signals. “When you tune an old radio, you're essentially causing one oscillator to vibrate at the same frequency as the other one,” he says. “When these faults synchronize, one fault could tune up the other and cause earthquakes in pairs.” If you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing.

That fault extends south for 750 miles along a boundary where the North American and Pacific plates slide past each other. Chris Goldfinger, a marine geologist at Oregon State University, with seafloor sediment cores. Since 1999 Goldfinger and his team have been drilling into the seafloor at this tectonic crossroads, known as the Mendocino Triple Junction, to pull up cores that show a cross section of the sediments that have built up there. Many of the cores contained layered sediments known as turbidites, which are created by marine landslides that move large amounts of material around the ocean floor. Many of these landslides are caused by earthquakes, making turbidite layers a useful proxy for pinpointing past seismic events. This provides evidence of two separate earthquake events happening in quick succession—as the first earthquake was settling a layer of silt over the ocean floor, a second shock sent another avalanche of sand over top. Some of the layered turbidites are so closely spaced that these events could have happened anywhere from within minutes to decades of each other. Meng Wei, a marine geologist and geophysicist at the University of Rhode Island, says the idea that fault systems near each other could synchronize has been floating around for years and has been seen at smaller fault boundaries over short periods. But he says the new paper is impressive for illustrating that the phenomenon is possible with larger fault systems over thousands of years. Though the Cascadia and San Andreas systems have apparently been linked for millennia, there seems to be some variability when it comes to the timing between successive quakes. Wei, who was not involved in the new study, says it is possible that the two faults could produce shaking within a few years of each other at some point in the future, but more research is needed to gauge how one quake triggers another. “Even if these two faults are synchronized, the time interval between earthquakes can still be decades,” he adds. The two systems are also not in perfect sync. CT scan images of turbidites in deep sea sediment cores. On the right, from an earthquake about 1,500 years ago, the typical "inverted doublet beds" - a doubling or tripling of turbidite thickness. But if the two fault systems do end up producing major earthquakes in quick succession, it could cause major disasters all along the West Coast of North America. An initial quake along the Cascadia Subduction Zone would draw recovery resources up to the Pacific Northwest, which would make responding to a subsequent San Andreas earthquake difficult. Goldfinger hopes the new work will help influence seismic hazard planning for communities near both fault systems.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Pain may be unpleasant, but in most cases it plays a vital, even lifesaving, role. Short bursts of pain act as warning signals that protect us from harm. Their research points to a specific group of brainstem cells called Y1 receptor (Y1R)-expressing neurons, located in the lateral parabrachial nucleus (lPBN). These neurons are activated in persistent pain states, but they also process signals related to hunger, fear, and thirst. This suggests that the brain can adjust pain responses when other, more urgent needs demand attention. Working with the Taylor lab at the University of Pittsburgh, Betley's team used calcium imaging to visualize neuron activity in real time in animal models of both short-term and long-term pain. They observed that Y1R neurons did not simply react to quick bursts of pain; instead, they kept firing steadily during prolonged pain, a phenomenon known as “tonic activity.” Betley compares this to an engine left running even after you've parked the car. This ongoing neural activity may explain why some people continue to feel pain long after an injury or surgery. The research originated from an unexpected observation Betley made after joining Penn in 2015: hunger seemed to lessen chronic pain. Former graduate student Nitsan Goldstein found that other critical survival states—such as thirst and fear—can also suppress long-term pain. "That told us the brain must have a built-in way of prioritizing urgent survival needs over pain, and we wanted to find the neurons responsible for that switch," says Goldstein. When hunger or fear takes priority, NPY acts on Y1 receptors in the parabrachial nucleus to dampen ongoing pain signals. "It's like the brain has this built-in override switch," Goldstein explains. They found that Y1Rneurons didn't form two tidy anatomical or molecular populations. Instead, these neurons were scattered across many other cell types. "It's like looking at cars in a parking lot," Betley says. We don't know exactly why, but we think this mosaic distribution may allow the brain to dampen different kinds of painful inputs across multiple circuits." What excites Betley with this discovery is the further exploration of its potential to "use Y1 neural activity as a biomarker for chronic pain, something drug developers and clinicians have long lacked," he says. "Right now, patients may go to an orthopedist or a neurologist, and there is no clear injury. If we can target these neurons, that opens up a whole new path for treatment." This research also suggests that behavioral interventions such as exercise, meditation, and cognitive behavioral therapy may influence how these brain circuits fire, just as hunger and fear did in the lab. "We've shown that this circuit is flexible, it can be dialed up or down," he says. "So, the future isn't just about designing a pill. It's also about asking how behavior, training, and lifestyle can change the way these neurons encode pain." Nitsan Goldstein was a graduate student in the Betley Lab at Penn Arts & Sciences during this study. He is currently a postdoctoral researcher at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

Nature Genetics volume 57, pages 2482–2493 (2025)Cite this article Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) shows variable responses to immunotherapy, highlighting the need for biomarkers to guide patient selection. We applied a spatial multi-omics approach to 234 advanced NSCLC patients treated with programmed death 1-based immunotherapy across three cohorts to identify biomarkers associated with outcome. Spatial proteomics (n = 67) and spatial compartment-based transcriptomics (n = 131) enabled profiling of the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME). Using spatial proteomics, we identified a resistance cell-type signature including proliferating tumor cells, granulocytes, vessels (hazard ratio (HR) = 3.8, P = 0.004) and a response signature, including M1/M2 macrophages and CD4 T cells (HR = 0.4, P = 0.019). We then generated a cell-to-gene resistance signature using spatial transcriptomics, which was predictive of poor outcomes (HR = 5.3, 2.2, 1.7 across Yale, University of Queensland and University of Athens cohorts), while a cell-to-gene response signature predicted favorable outcomes (HR = 0.22, 0.38 and 0.56, respectively). This framework enables robust TIME modeling and identifies biomarkers to support precision immunotherapy in NSCLC. Patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) without targetable driver alterations generally face a poor prognosis, with only a minority responding to existing therapies. More than 50% develop resistance, and approximately 40% show primary resistance even with high programmed death 1 (PD-1) ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression1,2,3. Furthermore, immunotherapy can cause severe immune-related toxicities, including fatal events. These challenges highlight the urgent need for patient stratification to optimize therapeutic efficacy. Spatial multi-omics enhances our understanding of the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) by integrating various omics data in the context of the underlying tissue architecture. This approach combines protein cell phenotyping with gene expression profiling, delivering unique insights into cellular functions and disease mechanisms. Techniques such as codetection by indexing (CODEX)4 enable high-resolution protein mapping in intact tissues, revealing both cellular heterogeneity and spatial dynamics within the TIME. Similarly, Digital Spatial Profiling (DSP)-GeoMx Whole Transcriptome Analysis (WTA) enables spatial transcriptomic profiling at cellular compartment resolution, allowing direct correlation between gene expression and spatially localized cellular phenotypes5. Together, spatial proteomics and transcriptomics offer a comprehensive view of tissue organization, uncovering key molecular interactions and disease-associated changes6. This integrated strategy enables the identification of compartment-specific biomarkers and therapeutic targets for diagnostic and prognostic use7. Furthermore, machine learning approaches have shown that complex spatial molecular patterns can be linked to clinical outcomes8. Predicting the outcomes of first-line immunotherapy treatments is particularly important due to the absence of confounding from prior treatments. Tailoring models to predict treatment outcomes specifically for first-line immunotherapy aids in clinical decision-making by ensuring that assessments are unaffected by prior treatments, thereby enhancing treatment efficacy and enabling predictions for patients without multiple treatment exposures. Our study aimed to develop a robust machine learning approach for training spatial signatures to predict first-line immunotherapy outcomes, including progression-free survival (PFS) at 2 and 5 years, and overall survival (OS), in NSCLC using a multi-omics approach. We hypothesized that integrating cell types and gene expression data with spatial context would enhance predictive accuracy. We first constructed cell-type-based signatures, then derived gene signatures from outcome-associated cell types using a training cohort (Yale cohort; Fig. These resistance and response signatures were validated in two independent external cohorts from University of Queensland and University of Athens (UQ and Greek cohorts respectively; Fig. By integrating spatial omics and machine learning techniques (Fig. 1b), we aim to improve treatment decisions and patient outcomes. a, Flowchart of inclusion criteria for the Yale, UQ and Greek NSCLC cohorts is shown. It outlines the criteria and decision-making steps that determine whether a participant qualifies for inclusion in the research. Spatial proteomic profiling of advanced NSCLC tissues identified distinct cellular populations within tumor and stromal compartments. 1a,b illustrate cell phenotyping using a 29-marker panel, while Fig. 2b lists the markers used for identifying specific cell types. Representative tumor areas of interest (AOIs) are displayed in Fig. Tumor cells were most abundant in tumor AOIs, whereas M1/M2 macrophages and fibroblasts predominated in stromal AOIs. We then compared cell-type distributions as a function of PFS. In tumor AOIs from the training (Fig. 2f), granulocytes and proliferating tumor cells were enriched in patients with shorter PFS. 2g,h), M1 and M2 macrophages were more prevalent in patients with longer PFS. These trends were consistent across cohorts. We also analyzed cell composition in the Yale cohort using a 5-year PFS cut point. Due to limited follow-up, this analysis was not performed in the UQ cohort. The observed patterns aligned with earlier findings that granulocytes and proliferating tumor cells were enriched in progressors in the tumor compartment, while M1 and M2 macrophages were more prevalent in nonprogressors in the stromal compartment (Supplementary Fig. b, The specific markers used in CODEX for identifying various cell types within the samples are listed. c, A representative tumor compartment from a highlights the cellular composition and diversity of cell types within the tumor. To further explore associations between cell fractions and treatment outcome, we used a 2-year PFS endpoint and performed univariable Cox analyses for each cell type and compartment independently. In the tumor compartment, granulocytes, proliferating tumor and vessel cells were linked to increased risk of disease progression or death (Fig. These trends were observed across cohorts but did not reach statistical significance after Benjamini–Hochberg (BH) adjustment. Figure 3b shows a representative region of interest (ROI) from a patient with shorter PFS, enriched in granulocytes and vessel cells. In the stromal compartment, M1 macrophages, M2 macrophages and CD4 T cells were associated with improved PFS in both cohorts (Fig. While consistent trends were observed, for instance, granulocytes, vessels and proliferating tumor cells were linked to worse PFS, and M1 and M2 macrophages were associated with better PFS, none remained significant post-BH-adjustment. We also investigated associations with 5-year PFS in the Yale cohort (Supplementary Fig. 2c,d), which showed consistent patterns with the 2-year analysis across both tumor and stromal compartments. a, Univariable analysis of PFS at 2 years in relation to different cell types within the tumor compartment of the Yale cohort, using the median as a cut point. A total of n = 32 patients were analyzed using spatial proteomics. Spatial cell-type signatures were developed using spatial proteomic-derived cell fractions to predict outcomes to immunotherapy in advanced NSCLC patients. A schematic overview of the signature generation pipeline is shown in Extended Data Fig. 2, which is based on a previously established robust signature training approach5. The Yale cohort served as the training set, which was split multiple times into tenfolds. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO)-penalized Cox models were built to predict 2- and 5-year PFS, constrained to identify resistance-associated cell types by enforcing their coefficients to be non-negative (Methods). Each split generated a LASSO model using cross-validation, and a final Cox regression model was trained using cell types consistently selected across all splits, which identified proliferating tumor cells, vessels and granulocytes as high-risk features. In the tumor compartment of the training set, the resistance model was significantly associated with worse PFS (HR = 3.8, P = 0.004, two-sided log-rank test; Fig. Validation in the UQ cohort showed consistent predictive value (HR = 1.8, P = 0.05, one-sided log-rank test; Fig. In the stromal compartment, granulocytes and proliferating tumor cells were predictive in the training set (Supplementary Fig. 3a,b) but did not reach significance in the UQ cohort validation cohort (Supplementary Fig. These results highlight the role of granulocytes, vessels and proliferating tumor cells in resistance within the tumor compartment, underscoring the spatial specificity of these signatures. Spatial cell-type signatures were developed using spatial proteomics-derived cell fractions to predict response to immunotherapy in advanced NSCLC patients. As with the resistance model, the Yale cohort was used for training, using a robust signature training approach5. In the stromal compartment, M1 and M2 macrophages and CD4 T cells had negative coefficients, indicating reduced risk. These were significantly associated with improved outcomes in the training cohort for PFS-5 years (HR = 0.4, P = 0.019, two-sided log-rank test) and showed a similar trend for PFS-2 years (HR = 0.57, P = 0.12; Fig. In the UQ validation cohort, this signature remained predictive (HR = 0.49, P = 0.036, one-sided log-rank test; Fig. In contrast, the tumor compartment response model, which included tumor cells, M1 macrophages, M2 macrophages and DCs, was predictive in the training cohort (Supplementary Fig. 3d,e), but did not achieve significance in the validation cohort (Supplementary Fig. These results emphasize the importance of the stromal immune context in predicting immunotherapy benefit. We further evaluated the association of the resistance model with OS at 2 and 5 years (Supplementary Fig. 4a–d) and observed consistent trends with PFS across cohorts. Conversely, when we examined the association of the response model with OS at 5 years and 2 years, the response model showed no statistically significant association in OS at either time point in the UQ validation cohort (Supplementary Fig. This suggests that response-associated cell types are more reflective of early treatment dynamics and disease control rather than long-term survival. To explore spatial features linked to response and resistance models derived from cell frequencies, we analyzed spatial organization and interactions. Representative Voronoi diagrams illustrate the spatial distribution of cell types associated with the response (Fig. M2 macrophages predominated in response-associated regions, while the resistance Voronoi diagram shows an enrichment of vessels, PD-L1+ tumor cells and proliferating tumor cells. We identified ten distinct neighborhoods representing unique spatial architectures (Fig. These were annotated based on predominant cell-type enrichment, including M1 macrophage, vessel and immune cell, tumor cell, PD-L1+ tumor, granulocyte, tumor-adjacent stroma, immune-rich, M2 macrophage, proliferating tumor and stromal cell communities. Neighborhood frequencies were correlated with PFS. Proliferating tumor communities were more common in patients who progressed (P = 0.07, two-tailed t test), supporting the role of tumor proliferation in therapy resistance (Fig. Changes in neighborhood composition further revealed insights into the biology of therapy response. Within granulocyte-rich neighborhoods, higher levels of PD-L1+ tumor cells, B cells, and DCs were linked to progression (P < 0.0001, Ordinary Least Squares; OLS model F test), suggesting a protumor microenvironment (Extended Data Fig. Pairwise spatial interactions were analyzed to uncover cell-cell relationships (Fig. Proliferating tumor cells predominantly interacted with granulocytes and endothelial cells (vessels), implying roles in tumor proliferation and angiogenesis. In the response model, we examined interactions between M1/M2 macrophages, or CD4 T cells and other immune or tumor cells. B cells showed high interactions with M1 macrophages, suggesting a potential role in antitumor activity. M2 macrophages showed near-significant interaction with CD8 T cells (P = 0.06), highlighting a modulation of cytotoxic responses. Comparing interaction scores between progressors and nonprogressors revealed higher M2-CD4 T cell interactions and M2-CD8 T cell interactions in nonprogressors, (Fig. 4f), indicating an immune-supportive microenvironment in patients with better outcomes. a,b, The Voronoi diagrams for (a) a nonprogressed patient, illustrating the spatial distribution of cell types in the response model, and (b) a disease-progressed patient, illustrating the spatial distribution of cell types in the resistant model, are shown. c, Ten distinct cellular neighborhoods identified by the spatial interaction analysis are shown. d, Frequency of spatial neighborhoods within each patient sample in the Yale training cohort, stratified by progression status (nonprogressors, n = 13; progressors, n = 19). Whiskers extend to the most extreme data points within 1.5× IQR. Outliers are shown as individual points. A total of n = 32 patients were analyzed using spatial proteomics, with one biological replicate (ROI) per patient. Neighborhoods were defined via spatial clustering of CODEX data. e, Spatial interactions between pairs of cellular constituents are shown. * indicates statistical significance at P < 0.05 (OLS F test). f, Changes in the cellular constituents within neighborhoods and their association with therapy response are shown. h, A series of UMAP plots, each highlighting the expression levels of specific markers across the previously identified clusters is shown. Expression levels of PD-L1 on (i) tumor cells and (j) macrophages in the Yale training cohort are shown, stratified by progression status (nonprogressors, n = 13; progressors, n = 19). Violin plots show the distribution of expression values, with overlaid box plots indicating the median (centerline), IQR (25th–75th percentile; box), and whiskers extending to 1.5× IQR. Two-tailed t tests were used to compare groups, yielding P = 0.048 for tumor cells and P = 0.045 for macrophages. A total of n = 32 patients were analyzed using spatial proteomics, with one biological replicate (ROI) per patient. The response model, derived from spatial analysis, highlights the critical role of M1 and M2 macrophages and CD4 T cells in predicting response to PD-1-based immunotherapy. Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) visualizations of all 14 cell types (Fig. 4g), alongside expression dynamics of each marker, identified in spatial proteomic data, show higher PD-L1 expression on M1 (CD68+) and M2 (CD163+) macrophages compared to PanCK+Ki67+ proliferating tumor cells. In the Yale cohort, nonprogressors showed significantly higher PD-L1 expression in both tumor cells (Fig. However, comparative analysis revealed that PD-L1 expression on macrophages, unlike that on tumor cells, was consistently associated with longer PFS (Extended Data Fig. To address limitations due to sample size, we combined data from the Yale and UQ cohorts to enhance statistical power (Extended Data Fig. The pooled analysis confirmed a significant association between macrophage PD-L1 expression and PFS, while tumor cell PD-L1 remained nonsignificant. Notably, PD-L1 expression on tumor cells correlated with clinical response in only one cohort; however, this correlation was not replicated in the other, indicating inconsistency across datasets. Regression analysis further supported this trend. PD-L1 expression was strongly correlated with the mean proportions of M1 or M2 macrophages or CD14+ myeloid cells (P < 0.001, Spearman's rank), but not with PanCK+ tumor cells (P = 0.17, Spearman's rank; Extended Data Fig. These findings suggest that the presence of PD-L1 on macrophages could be indicative of a positive response to treatment. To validate the proteomic findings, we performed cell-type deconvolution using whole transcriptomic data. We used CIBERSORTx10 with the LM22 gene signature matrix, which profiles immune cell types enriched in the stromal region. Figure 5a shows a schematic of the deconvolution workflow applied to stromal gene expression data. Transcriptomic profiles were deconvolved into cell-type fractions, and patients were stratified by PFS at 2 years. Figure 5b demonstrates increased M2 macrophage fractions (red cells) in patients with longer PFS. To confirm this, we performed two-tailed t tests comparing groups with longer and shorter PFS. Results show a substantial increase in M2 macrophages in patients with better outcomes (P = 0.02; Fig. These transcriptomic results are consistent with our proteomic analysis, reinforcing the role of M2 macrophages in predicting favorable responses to immunotherapy. a, The diagram outlines the step-by-step workflow of RNA deconvolution used to estimate cell fractions from bulk RNA data. b, The proportions of deconvolved stromal cells in the Yale cohort are stratified by PFS outcome, with the LM22 signature matrix from CIBERSORTx used to determine cell fractions and quantify different stromal cell types. c, Comparison of stromal immune cell fractions between patients who progressed (n = 22) and those who did not (n = 16) in the Yale cohort, based on CIBERSORTx deconvolution of spatial transcriptomic data. The x axis represents patient groups (progressors versus nonprogressors); y axis represents stromal immune cell fractions. Of the 39 patients analyzed, 38 had available CD45+, CD68+ or combined stromal compartments. Statistical significance was assessed using two-tailed unpaired t tests without adjustment for multiple comparisons. Exact P values are shown above comparisons where relevant. We developed resistance-associated gene signatures from whole transcriptomic data in the same cohorts profiled proteomically, within the tumor compartment of advanced NSCLC. DSP-GeoMx WTA was performed across all cohorts, and one ROI was excluded from further analysis due to discrepancies across experiments (Supplementary Fig. The overall workflow for gene signature development is outlined in Extended Data Fig. For this purpose, we first isolated cell-type-specific genes based on CIBERSORTx and Lung Cancer Atlas (LuCA) cell-type signatures, focusing on granulocytes, vessels and proliferating tumor cells (~500 genes; Methods). Following an approach based on a previously established robust signature training framework, models were trained and tested on multiple splits of the training set to identify genes consistently associated with the highest performance, which were then included in the final resistance model. This approach selected eight genes with positive coefficients (indicative of resistance), KRT7, KRT18, EFNA1, SERINC2, FZD6, CD24, CCND3 and S100A9 (Fig. Higher signature scores were associated with worse outcomes across all cohorts. Using the tertile cut point established in the training cohort, high signature scores were linked to a hazard ratio (HR) of 5.3 (P < 0.001, two-sided log-rank test) in the Yale training cohort (Fig. Validation in the UQ and Greek cohorts confirmed these associations (HR = 2.2, P = 0.036; HR = 1.7, P = 0.042, respectively; one-sided log-rank test; Fig. Two-tailed log-rank tests were used in the discovery/training (Yale) cohort, whereas one-tailed log-rank tests were applied in validation cohorts, to test for effects in the same direction as observed in the discovery cohort. Multivariable analysis adjusting for clinical variables confirmed the signature's independent prognostic value (Supplementary Tables 4 and 5). However, limited heterogeneity in some covariates in the Greek cohort (which contained over 92% stage IV patients and 86% receiving first-line ICIs) and small sample size in the UQ cohort (in which some histologic subtypes were underrepresented) may limit the capacity of multivariable models to effectively control for confounding. Differential expression analysis showed upregulation of these genes in patients who progressed or died on immunotherapy (Extended Data Fig. Collectively, these genes are significantly associated with Gene Ontology (GO) biological processes related to epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), regulation of cell adhesion, regulation of locomotion and regulation of epithelial cell migration (P < 0.001, F tests; Extended Data Fig. 6b), supporting their role in tumor progression and metastasis. a, Genes included in the resistance signature model, derived from their enriched cell types. The listed genes, along with their signature coefficients, indicate the magnitude and direction of each gene's contribution to the prediction of PFS. b–d, KM plots showing PFS stratified by resistance gene signature scores in the tumor compartment of the Yale (b), UQ (c) and Greek (d) cohorts. Patients were divided into high and low groups using the upper tertile as the cut point. Statistical significance was assessed using two-tailed log-rank tests. No adjustments were made for multiple comparisons. The number at risk is shown below each curve. e, Genes included in the response signature model, derived from their enriched cell types. The listed genes, along with their signature coefficient, indicate the magnitude and direction of each gene's contribution to the prediction of PFS. Panels a and e were created with BioRender.com. Two-tailed log-rank tests were used in the discovery cohort (Yale), while one-tailed log-rank tests were used in the validation cohorts (Greek and UQ), with the direction of effect prespecified based on the discovery data. No adjustments were made for multiple comparisons. The number at risk is indicated below each curve. We developed a response gene signature based on response cell-type models within the stromal compartment using a similar approach to the resistance gene signature training. Gene sets were derived from immune cell types using CIBERSORTx's LM22 matrix and LuCA dataset, which were used to deconvolve stroma transcriptomics and compare profiles by PFS status at 2 years. We focused on the expression of genes associated with M1 and M2 macrophages and CD4 T cells (~200 genes) to construct response models. The final model contains eight genes with negative coefficients (indicative of response), SIGLEC1, TLR2, CXCL9, CD81, MRC1, CCL8, CCL13 and FCGR1A (Fig. High signature scores, defined by the upper tertile in the training cohort, were associated with improved outcomes. In the Yale training cohort, high scores were correlated with significantly better outcomes (HR = 0.22, P = 0.005, two-sided log-rank test). Validation in the UQ cohort confirmed the association (HR = 0.38, P = 0.034, one-sided log-rank test; Fig. 6f,g) and the Greek cohort showed a consistent trend (HR = 0.56, P = 0.041; Fig. Multivariable analysis, adjusting for clinical covariates, confirmed the signature's independent prognostic value in both validation cohorts (Supplementary Tables 6 and 7). Differential expression analysis showed these genes were significantly upregulated in nonprogressors (Extended Data Fig. 7a) and were enriched in immune-related processes, including leukocyte and lymphocyte activation (Extended Data Fig. 7b), supporting their role in mediating antitumor immune responses. We further assessed the association of the gene models with additional clinical endpoints, including 5-year PFS, 5-year OS and 2-year OS. For the resistant model, we applied a tertile cut point for 5-year PFS and median cutpoints for OS endpoints, all established in the Yale training cohort (Extended Data Fig. 8a–f) and used consistently across UQ (Extended Data Fig. 9a,b) and Greek (Extended Data Fig. In the Yale cohort, both resistance and response gene models were significantly associated with longer 5-year PFS. The resistance model was also significantly associated with both 5-year and 2-year OS, while the response model showed only a trend with P values of 0.06 (HR = 0.34) for OS at 5 years and 0.09 (HR = 0.37) for OS at 2 years. These findings suggest that the resistance gene model more robustly predicts both PFS and OS, whereas the response gene model appears specific to PFS. This underscores the importance of selecting appropriate clinical endpoints when evaluating the efficacy of these models. The stronger association of the resistance model with OS highlights its potential utility in identifying higher-risk patients and guiding long-term treatment strategies. Although the resistance model showed a trend toward worse PFS (HR = 2.3, P = 0.06), significance was not reached. The response model showed no validation, likely due to insufficient follow-up time. In the Greek cohort, high resistance scores were significantly associated with worse 5-year PFS (HR = 1.8, P = 0.029). OS showed a similar trend, with HR = 1.6 (P = 0.06) at 5 years and HR = 1.5 (P = 0.14) at 2 years. For the response model, higher scores trended with improved outcomes for PFS at 5 years (HR = 0.61, P = 0.06), OS at 5 years (HR = 0.67, P = 0.11) and OS at 2 years (HR = 0.62, P = 0.12). Our study presents a spatial multi-omic framework for developing biomarkers associated with PD-1-based immunotherapies in solid tumors. In this study, rather than directly generating protein-based signatures, we transformed protein expression into phenotypic cell states and then derived cell-type signatures linked to immunotherapy outcomes. Genes were subsequently extracted from these cell types to construct transcriptomic signatures associated with immunotherapy outcomes. The rationale behind this approach lies in the difficulty of directly combining proteomic and transcriptomic data, which is challenging due to the nonlinear dependency between protein and RNA expression. Incorporating spatial context further strengthens this approach by enabling the identification of not only relevant cell types and genes but also their localization within the TIME. Spatial coordinates embedded in outcome models provide a layer of evidence, capturing interactions shaped by tissue architecture. We first developed resistance and response cell-type models from spatial proteomic data. These models identified distinct cell-type distributions associated with PFS and enabled the creation of a hierarchical map of gene signatures within the same spatial locations. The resistance signature (comprising proliferating tumor cells, granulocytes and vessels) was enriched in the tumor compartment, forming a resistant niche that promotes cancer progression. In contrast, the response signature, enriched in M1 and M2 macrophages and CD4 T cells, was prominent in the stroma, highlighting the importance of the stromal immune environment in mediating treatment responses. To validate these findings, we conducted orthogonal validation using transcriptomic data and the CIBERSORTx deconvolution, confirming a higher abundance of M2 macrophages in patients with longer PFS, consistent with the response stromal signature. Spatial mapping of PD-L1 expression further clarified its role, showing PD-L1-positive macrophages contribute to a favorable TIME and enhance PD-1-based immunotherapy efficacy. Current companion diagnostics in NSCLC, such as pembrolizumab eligibility, rely on the tumor proportion score (TPS), which measures PD-L1 expression on tumor cells alone11,12,13. In contrast, the combined positive score (CPS), which includes immune cells, has shown better correlation with treatment response, aligning with our findings14,15. 16,17 showed that PD-L1 expression on macrophages enhances CD8+ T cell proliferation and cytotoxicity, supporting the use of CPS. Neighborhood and cell interaction analysis revealed key spatial dynamics underlying therapeutic outcomes. Patients with disease progression had elevated communities of proliferating tumor cells, granulocytes and vessels, indicating their collaborative roles in tumor proliferation and angiogenesis. In contrast, interactions among M1 macrophages, B cells and CD4 T cells in responders point to effective immune regulation. Increased interactions between M2 macrophages and both CD4 and CD8 T cells in nonprogressors suggest a role in favorable outcomes. Macrophage plasticity, specifically repolarization from M2 to M1 phenotype, can enhance antitumor immunity, making macrophages attractive therapeutic targets18,19,20. A recent study shows that targeting MS4A4A on M2 macrophages can restore CD8+ T-cell-mediated antitumor immunity and improve anti-PD-1 therapy efficacy21. Our findings support the critical role of M2 macrophages in modulating the TIME and their potential to enhance immunotherapy responses, supporting the value of comprehensive markers such as CPS. Building upon the cell-type signatures, we developed gene-based signatures using a cell-to-gene modeling approach. S100A9 and CD24 are associated with immune suppression. The response signature includes genes such as SIGLEC1 and CXCL9, which mediate immune activation. SIGLEC1 is crucial for macrophage differentiation and immune responses29, while CXCL9 attracts immune cells and promotes T cell infiltration30. TLR2, highly expressed on M1 macrophages, supports innate immune activation31. Elevated CD81 on CD4 T cells enhances migration and adhesion, aiding antitumor responses32. MRC1 (CD206), a marker of M2 macrophages33, typically associated with immune suppression, may adopt a more proinflammatory role when co-expressing high PD-L1, potentially enhancing the immunotherapy response. CCL8 and CCL13 facilitate immune cell recruitment to inflammation sites34, potentially improving immunotherapy outcomes. FCGR1A, expressed on macrophages, enables antibody-dependent phagocytosis35, supporting tumor clearance in the presence of opsonizing antibodies. These resistance and response gene signatures collectively highlight distinct spatial patterns. The tumor compartment fosters resistance through EMT, cell migration and angiogenesis, while the stromal compartment contributes to therapeutic response via immune cell activation and differentiation. These spatial gene signatures offer valuable insights into mechanisms underlying immunotherapy outcomes in advanced NSCLC. While our findings provide strong support for the utility of multi-omics profiling in predicting outcomes, we acknowledge several limitations. Notably, differences in the proportion of disease stages, treatment regimens and line of immunotherapy in the validation cohorts, constrain the interpretability of multivariable results. The UQ cohort had limited representation of certain subtypes. The Greek cohort predominantly included stage IV patients treated with first-line immunotherapy, intentionally selected to test our signatures in this setting. We acknowledge that the broad generalizability of our signatures in highly heterogeneous cohorts requires further testing. Furthermore, we acknowledge that, due to the reduced number of patients in certain covariate subgroups in the validation cohorts, the multivariable analysis may not be able to quantify the effects of all covariates with high accuracy. Therefore, an accurate determination of the effect sizes would benefit from testing on larger cohorts. Finally, PD-L1 expression, tumor mutation burden and performance status were not consistently available and thus excluded from our models. Due to the small number of patients who received only first-line immunotherapy in the UQ validation cohort, we included patients treated with first, second and third line or beyond immunotherapy, introducing some heterogeneity. The ability of our models to achieve statistical significance in this setting adds credibility to their broad potential clinical utility, although, as noted above, the generalizability of the signatures as prognostic models requires further validation in more heterogeneous datasets. Future retrospective studies with extended follow-up and prospective validation will be essential to strengthen clinical relevance. Ultimately, the development of cell-to-gene signatures, augmented by spatial information, represents a substantial step forward in personalized medicine for NSCLC. We studied three independent cohorts of patients with NSCLC who were treated with PD-1-based immunotherapies in the advanced or metastatic setting. This cohort comprises 113 tissue samples collected between 2012 and 2019 (Fig. Tissue microarray (TMA) master blocks were created using nonadjacent tumor cores, each with a diameter of 0.6 mm, from each patient's biopsy. To represent tumor heterogeneity, 5 µm-thick cuts from four independent blocks per TMA, each containing a different core (ROI) from the same patient tumor, were used for transcriptomic profiling using the DSP-GeoMx WTA or CTA (cancer transcriptome atlas, Bruker Spatial Biology, US) platforms and single cores were used for proteomic profiling using the PhenoCycler fusion (PCF) platform (Akoya Biosciences, US). The GeoMx WTA platform and two ROIs per TMA from the same patient tumor were used for proteomic profiling using the PCF platform. These samples were collected and used under the authorization of the Yale Human Investigation Committee (protocol 9505008219), with assurances filed with and approved by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The Yale cohort TMA is designated as YTMA-471. TMAs were constructed from resected NSCLC tissue specimens from patients who subsequently recurred and were treated with PD-1-based immunotherapies in the advanced or metastatic setting. This cohort contained 42 tissue samples collected between 2009 and 2018 (Fig. The third cohort, serving as a second validation dataset, was obtained from Sotiria General Hospital, Medical School, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Greece. It comprised 79 patients who received PD-1-based therapy between 2019 and 2023 and was used to validate the generalizability of the findings from the Yale training cohort. The study was conducted under HIC protocol 16760/23-06-2023. Written informed consent or waiver of consent was obtained from all participants before enrollment. A schematic of the workflow is shown in Fig. As stated above, the Yale cohort served as a training set, while the UQ cohort and the University of Athens (Greek cohort) served as validation sets. To minimize biases from prior therapies, the study focused solely on patients receiving first-line immunotherapy. As a result, the Yale cohort was narrowed down to 41 patients. The clinical endpoint was set to 2-year PFS, consistent with prior real-world and clinical trial data supporting this timeframe as a clinically meaningful surrogate for durable benefit in advanced/metastatic NSCLC. Major immunotherapy trials that led to regulatory approval, such as KEYNOTE-189 and KEYNOTE-407, implemented a 2-year cap on treatment duration2,11. In real-world clinical practice, treatment duration beyond two years was common due to the absence of data defining optimal therapy length. However, recent retrospective evidence from over 1,000 patients showed no significant OS benefit beyond two years36. Furthermore, approximately 20% of patients in that study discontinued treatment at two years despite the absence of progression. Taken together with the toxicity and financial burdens of prolonged therapy, these findings support a shift toward 2-year treatment as a clinical standard. Therefore, adopting 2-year PFS as an endpoint enhances the real-world relevance and interpretability of our findings37. Exclusion criteria for each cohort are depicted in the CONSORT diagrams (Fig. A schematic of data acquisition and analysis workflow is shown in Fig. We began with data acquisition using the PCF platform and validated findings using the DSP-GeoMx platform. The final analysis focused on findings based on cell types identified through the PCF-derived proteomic data. The CODEX staining method was used for Yale, UQ and Greek cohorts, using the Phenocycler Fusion platform. Staining and imaging were performed by the Akoya Biosciences Spatial Tissue Exploration Program (STEP) following the manufacturer's instructions38. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded TMA sections were mounted on SuperFrost charged slides, rehydrated and subjected to heat-induced epitope retrieval. A 26-antibody cocktail (190 µl per section) was incubated for 3 h at room temperature in a humidity chamber. The list of antibodies is provided in Supplementary Table 3. This was followed by several cycles of washing and fixation. Details on antibody barcoding, dilution and imaging cycles are provided in Supplementary Data 3. Imaging was performed using the PCF platform and registered qptiff files were exported for image analysis. Images were imported into QuPath (version 0.4.2)39 and segmented using the Cellpose plugin (version 2.0)40 on the DAPI2 channel with the nuclear pretrained model (‘.cellExpansion = 4 µm' and ‘.cellConstrainScale = 1.5'). Segmentation quality was visually inspected, and TMA cores with poor quality, such as those that were fragmented, folded, necrotic, or exhibiting high nonspecific fluorescence, were excluded. An artificial neural network pixel classifier was trained on PanCK (pan-cytokeratin) signals to define a tumor/stroma mask, capturing PanCK+ pixels as tumor. Cell metrics, including universally unique identifier (UUID) codes, spatial coordinates, nuclear size and median cell expression per channel, were exported for analysis in Python. Cell classifications from subsequent unsupervised clustering were re-imported into QuPath and matched by their UUIDs for visual inspection and quality control. A detailed image analysis workflow is illustrated in Extended Data Fig. Raw fluorescence intensity data (16-bit) underwent arcsinh transformation to normalize and reduce skewness, followed by marker scaling across cells. CD45 was used to illustrate preprocessing effectiveness (Extended Data Fig. Expression matrices and cell metadata were imported into Anndata for quality control, preprocessing, clustering and phenotyping41,42,43 in Python 3.10. Data were first subset into canonical lineage markers (CD45, CD3e, CD4, CD8, CD20, CD14, CD68, CD11b, CD11c, CD31, CD34, SMA, Vimentin, E-cadherin, PanCK, nuclear size). Each slide was preprocessed individually by arcsinh transform (cofactor 150), marker-wise scaling, and cell-wise normalization, following recommended CODEX workflows44. Preprocessed data were concatenated and integrated using Scanpy's Harmonypy (version 0.0.5)45 by slide, and adjusted principal components were used for clustering via Phenograph (version 1.5.7)46. Multiple Leiden resolutions (0.1–0.5) were tested across k = 15–30 and r = 0.2, with k = 15 empirically chosen to best resolve canonical cell types. Further classification in QuPath defined functional subsets, including CD4 TFH (PD-1+, ICOS+), Treg (FOXP3+), exhausted CD8 (PD-1+), cytotoxic CD8 (granzyme B+), M2 macrophage (CD163+), proliferating tumor (PanCK+Ki67+) and PD-L1 tumor (PD-L1+; Fig. 2a), using an object classifier trained on representative images. Labeled cells were then merged into 14 final cell types (Fig. For the analysis of PD-L1 expression in progressors and nonprogressors in tumor cells and macrophages, PanCK+ cells above the median were used to compute mean tumor PD-L1 per patient. Similarly, cells expressing CD68 and CD163 above the threshold were used to quantify macrophage PD-L1. Cell proportions were calculated by normalizing the number of each cell type within a TMA core or tumor/stromal region to the total number of cells within that region, yielding cell percentages. Spatial interactions were analyzed using the ‘spatial_interaction' function in Scimap (https://github.com/labsyspharm/scimap) with the radius method (radius = 30 µm, k-nearest neighbor = 10) for all pairwise combinations. Group means were compared between PFS groups. Cellular neighborhoods were defined using the Neighborhood Identification Pipeline (https://github.com/nolanlab/NeighborhoodCoordination)9. For each cell, the types of its ten nearest neighbors were recorded as features, which were then clustered into ten groups using a k-nearest neighbor unsupervised algorithm. Each cell was assigned to a ‘neighborhood', based on the most frequent nearby cell types, and these clusters were manually annotated by their dominant phenotype. Differential enrichment of cell types across neighborhoods was assessed using an ordinary least squares linear model from the same pipeline9, measuring fold change significance based on binary PFS outcome. For the Yale cohort, TMA slides were processed using the DSP-GeoMx manual slide preparation protocol (MAN-10150-01) as described in our prior study5. Briefly, four different ROI containing distinct tumor areas of the same tumors were used to enhance reproducibility. Antigen retrieval of the formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue was conducted for 20 min, followed by deparaffinization and rehydration. The slides were then exposed to proteinase K for 20 min, after which RNA probes were applied to the tissues for in situ hybridization. The following day, stringent washes were performed to remove off-target probes. Scanning, AOI selection and probe collection were performed as per the user manual (MAN-10088-03). Each AOI representing a compartment, such as tumor region, macrophage region or leukocyte region from a patient tumor core was collected in a 96-well plate. Next, a GeoMx-next-generation sequencing (NGS) readout library was prepared according to the user manual (MAN-10117-01). Sequencing was performed by Yale Center for Genome Analysis, and the sequencing data were processed with the GeoMx-NGS Pipeline (MAN-10153-01), converting FASTQ files to digital count conversion (.dcc) files for read counts. Quality control was conducted on each ROI to ensure accurate analysis of the approximately 18,000 genes targeted using the WTA panel. For the UQ cohort, pretreatment TMA slides were processed using the DSP-GeoMx CTA manual slide preparation protocol. This methodology was adapted from ref. 5, which profiles approximately 1,800 genes (Cancer Transcriptome Atlas Panel). After antigen retrieval and deparaffinization, proteinase K treatment was performed, followed by in situ hybridization using CTA RNA probes. The stringent washes were then performed to remove off-target probes. The slides were loaded onto the DSP-GeoMx instrument, and scanning, AOI selection, and probe collection were conducted per the DSP-GeoMx user manual. A GeoMx-NGS readout library was prepared following the DSP-GeoMx user manual (MAN-10117-01). PCR reactions were pooled into two mixtures for the tumor and stromal compartments. Sequencing was performed by the Australian Genome Research Facility, and data were processed using the GeoMx-NGS Pipeline (MAN-10153-01) to convert FASTQ files to digital counts conversion (.dcc) files for read counts. Quality control was performed according to preset thresholds to ensure accurate and high-quality profiling. We conducted univariable analysis to assess the association between cell-type fractions and treatment outcomes for 14 cell types in both tumor and stromal compartments. Cell fractions were derived using the PCF platform. HRs and two-sided log-rank test P values were calculated using Cox proportional hazards models to evaluate the impact of each cell type on 2-year PFS. BH correction was applied for multiple hypothesis testing. We developed cell-type signatures for both tumor and stromal compartments using a robust signature training framework based on a prior study5. The input consists of matrices \({M}_{{ij}}^{\,\mathrm{tumor}}\) and \({M}_{{ij}}^{\,\mathrm{stroma}}\) containing cell fractions for each patient i and cell-type j in tumor and stroma compartments, respectively, where there are 14 distinct cell types across tumor and stromal compartments. For each patient, we have PFS data (time in months and an event indicator: 1 = progression/death and 0 = alive/progression free). For each compartment, we generated n splits of the training data into tenfolds, generating M LASSO-penalized Cox models. For each split, tenfold cross-validation was used to select penalty parameter λ, and a LASSO model was trained using the optimal penalty for that split by pooling all tenfolds. We set lower.limits = 0 in R glmnet (version 4.1-9) for resistance models (positive nonzero coefficients) and upper.limits = 0 for response models (negative nonzero coefficients). This yielded M coefficient sets \({\beta }_{m,j}\), where \({\beta }_{m,j}\) is the coefficient of cell type j in model m. Cell types with a nonzero coefficient in at least t of the models were retained. A final unpenalized Cox model was fit using these selected cell types to obtain coefficients \({\beta }_{j}^{\mathrm{final}}\). Hence, the final signature is a Cox regression model trained on LASSO-selected cell types. This pipeline was applied to both tumor and stromal compartments to derive resistance and response signatures, where we set M = 50 for stroma and M = 100 for tumor, since we observed that these values were sufficient to identify a stable set of nonzero predictors for each compartment, and the threshold t was set to the maximum value such that each signature contained at least three cell types. We computed the final signature scores for resistance and response models in both tumor and stromal compartments. Each patient received a final score, indicating their predicted risk of progression based on the specific compartment and cell-type signature. We assessed out-of-sample accuracy by evaluating HR and survival probabilities in the validation cohorts. In resistance models, positive coefficients predicted increased risk \(\mathrm{HR} > 1.0\); in response models, negative coefficients predicted reduced risk \(\mathrm{HR} < 1.0\). Statistical significance of HRs was assessed using Cox proportional hazards models. P values were calculated using a two-tailed log-rank test by binarizing the scores at the median and refitting Cox models. The quantile-normalized matrix was deconvolved with CIBERSORTx, using the leukocyte gene signature matrix (LM22), which defines reference gene expression profiles for 22 immune cell types. This enabled estimation of stromal cell fractions for each patient. The deconvolution model solved for the cell fractions \({F}_{{ji}}\) using: \(B\times {F}_{i}\approx {M}_{i}^{\mathrm{DSPGeoMx}}\), where B is the LM22 signature matrix, \({F}_{{ji}}\) is the fraction of cells belonging to cell type j in patient i, and \({M}_{i}^{\mathrm{DSPGeoMx}}\) is the stromal compartment matrix for patient i. We compared cell fraction distributions between patients with different PFS outcomes (alive versus dead) using two-sided t tests. This analysis identified stromal cell types enriched in either group. By cross-validating our compartment-specific signatures against DSP-derived CIBERSORTx results, we confirmed the consistency and predictive relevance of the spatial proteomic cell-type features. We developed compartment-specific gene signatures based on the proteomics-derived cell-type signatures using a robust signature training framework based on the approach developed in a prior study5. Gene expression reference profiles were obtained from CIBERSORTx, and a public lung cancer scRNA-seq dataset (LuCA) focusing on CD4 T cells, macrophages, granulocytes and malignant cells. Reference gene lists for both models are provided in Supplementary Data 4. Using the mastR (version 1.8.0) R package48, 892,296 cells from LuCA were aggregated into 2,215 pseudobulk samples (>50 cells each), spanning 14 cell types. Marker genes were identified using differential expression and a ranked product permutation test with default parameters. We constructed matrices \({M}_{{ij}}^{\,\mathrm{tumor}}\) and \({M}_{{ij}}^{\,\mathrm{stroma}}\) containing gene expression counts for each patient i and gene j in tumor and stroma compartments, respectively, where genes were restricted to those associated with cell types occurring in the associated proteomics cell-type signatures. Each patient had PFS data (time in months and event indicator—1 = progression/death, 0 = progression free). In each training split, differentially expressed genes between progression-free and nonprogression-free patients (P < 0.05, negative binomial exact test) were identified. For each split, 100 LASSO Cox regression models were optimized with different random seeds, by first using tenfold cross-validation on the current training split to select the penalty λ, and then fitting a final LASSO Cox regression model with the best value of λ using the current training set. Any gene appearing in at least one of these models was retained; a signature for the current data split was then trained by fitting an unpenalized Cox regression model on the current training split restricted to the selected genes, and the HR of the signature was estimated on the current test set. To constrain coefficient directions, we set lower.limits = 0 for resistance models (positive nonzero coefficients) and upper.limits = 0 for response models (negative nonzero coefficients). Each data split m thus produced a coefficient set \({\beta }_{m,j}\) and an associated HR estimate. Genes with nonzero coefficients in at least 0.05 of the models having \(\mathrm{HR} > 1.5\) (resistance) or \(\mathrm{HR} < 0.7\) (response) were selected for inclusion in the final signatures. These thresholds were set so that the number of genes included was at most ten. Final Cox regression models were then refit without the penalty using the entire discovery cohort (not split into train/test), and only the selected genes, to derive the final signature coefficients, \({\beta }_{j}^{\mathrm{final}}\). For training the resistance gene model, we used genes from cell types in the resistance cell-type signature models (for example, proliferating tumor, granulocytes and vessels), and for training the response gene model, we used genes from the cell types in the response cell-type signature models (for example, M1 macrophages, M2 macrophages and CD4 T cells). This approach was applied uniformly across tumor and stromal compartments to define gene-level resistance and response signatures derived from cell-type-level proteomic signatures. To validate the gene signatures, we calculated gene expression matrices for tumor and stromal compartments in both the UQ cohort and the Greek cohort. Sequencing and data processing for the UQ cohort were performed by the UQ research team. For the Greek cohort, sequencing and data preprocessing were conducted by the Yale team. Each matrix contained expression counts per patient and gene in the respective compartments. We computed final resistance and response signature scores for both tumor and stromal compartments, with each score indicating the predicted risk of progression. Out-of-sample performance was evaluated using HRs of the signature scores evaluated in the validation cohorts. Genes with positive coefficients in the resistance signature predicted increased risk \(\mathrm{HR} > 1.0\), while genes with negative coefficients in the response signature predicted reduced risk \(\mathrm{HR} < 1.0\). Statistical significance was assessed using Cox proportional hazards models, with two-sided log-rank test P values derived from each model to test the out-of-sample accuracy of our signatures. We also conducted a multivariable analysis adjusting for clinical factors when available (age, sex, disease stage, prior treatment, type of immunotherapy, line of immunotherapy, histology and smoking status). Cox multivariable regression and Chi-square tests (Supplementary Tables 4–7) were used to evaluate associations between gene signatures and outcomes. This validation step is designed to test the generalizability of the spatially defined compartment-specific gene signatures. No statistical method was used to predetermine sample size. One ROI was excluded from transcriptomic analysis due to pre-identified operator inconsistencies, as documented in Supplementary Fig. The remaining data were included in all analyses. The investigators were not blinded to allocation during experiments and outcome assessment.

(a) The image workflow begins with exporting multiplex imaging data to QuPath, where cell segmentation is performed using the CellPose plugin. Resulting single-cell expression data is then exported as a .csv file and converted into an Anndata format. Selected markers are subsetted, and an arcsinh transformation (cofactor = 150) is applied independently to each dataset. Both row-wise (cells) and column-wise (markers) scaling are then conducted to standardize the data matrix (markers on the x-axis, cells on the y-axis). Multiple Anndata objects are concatenated across samples, and batch correction and image alignment are performed using Harmony after principal component analysis (PCA) via Scanpy. A nearest-neighbor graph is then constructed, and clustering is conducted using the sc.external.tl.phenograph function, tuning parameters such as the number of neighbors (K) and Leiden resolution (r), resulting in distinct cellular phenotypes. Cell type annotations are appended as metadata columns in the Anndata object. For specific populations such as CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, and macrophages, sub-clustering and classification are further refined within QuPath. Final annotations are enriched using forward-fill (‘ffill') methods to ensure completeness of subtype labels. (b) Raw fluorescence intensities (8-bit scale) are normalized using an arcsinh transformation to reduce skewness and handle the broad dynamic range. Expression values are subsequently scaled across both markers and cells. As shown using CD45 as an example, this preprocessing step prepares data for downstream analysis and comparison. To ensure robust model development, we generated M cross-validation splits and used these to train M models (1), each utilizing a LASSO Cox regression framework to predict 5-year progression-free survival (PFS). We set M = 50 for stroma and M = 100 for tumor, since we observed that these values were sufficient to identify a stable set of non-zero predictors for each compartment. Subsequently, we refit each signature using cell types with a non-zero coefficient in at least t of the models (2), where t was set to the maximum value such that each cell-type signature contained at least 3 cell types. The validated model was then tested using the UQ validation cohort (4), thereby assessing its generalizability and predictive performance. Differential cell type enrichment within each neighborhood is shown. (a) PD-L1 expression on tumor cells in the UQ cohort, comparing progressors and non-progressors. (b) PD-L1 expression on macrophages in the UQ cohort. (c) PD-L1 expression on tumor cells in the combined Yale + UQ cohorts. (d) PD-L1 expression on macrophages in the combined Yale + UQ cohorts. One-tailed t-tests were employed in cases where the direction of the effect was hypothesized a priori. The correlation between PD-L1 expression and (e) M1 macrophages, (f) M2 macrophages, (g) CD14+ myeloid cells and (h) panCK+ tumor cells within the TIME, are shown, assessed using Spearman's rank correlation method. We generated 50 splits of the cohort into training (80%) and validation (20%) subsets (1). To ensure robust model development, we generated intermediate signatures to predict 5-year progression-free survival (PFS) on each of these data splits: in each training split, (2) differentially expressed genes between progression-free and non-progression-free patients were identified, 100 LASSO Cox regression models were optimized with different random seeds, by first using 10-fold cross-validation on the current training split to select the penalty and then fitting a final LASSO Cox regression model with the best value of using the current training set, generating 50 intermediate signatures (3). The final signatures were then generated by selecting genes occurring in at least 0.05 of the models having HR > 1.5 (resistance) or HR < 0.7 (response) in their respective validation sets (4) and refitting the model using unpenalized Cox regression on the whole training set. Subsequently, we tested the consolidated model on 100% of the training cohort to predict 2-year PFS (5). The validated model was then tested using the UQ and Greek validation cohorts (6), thereby assessing its generalizability and predictive performance. Genes within the final resistance signature are shown. Enriched GO terms are biological processes. Genes within the final response signature are shown. Enriched GO terms are biological processes. The performance of the resistant gene signature in the Yale cohort was evaluated for predicting (a) PFS-5 years, (b) OS-5 years and (c) OS-2 years in the tumor compartment, with KM survival curves illustrating its prognostic significance. Similarly, the response gene signature was tested in the stroma compartment of the Yale cohort for predicting (d) PFS-5 years, (e) OS-5 years and (f) OS-2 years, showing its predictive value for long-term and short-term survival outcomes. The performance of the resistant gene signature in the Greek cohort was evaluated for predicting (a) PFS-5 years, (b) OS-5 years and (c) OS-2 years in the tumor compartment, with KM survival curves illustrating its prognostic significance. Similarly, the response gene signature was tested in the stroma compartment of the Greek cohort for predicting (d) PFS-5 years, (e) OS-5 years and (f) OS-2 years, showing its predictive value for long-term and short-term survival outcomes.

Ion solvating membranes based on polybenzimidazole (PBI) are alternatives to diaphragms in alkaline water electrolysers but can typically only operate with electrolyte concentrations of 15–30 wt% KOH. Sulfonation of the membrane broadens the operational range to 0.1 wt%–30 wt%; however, the swelling of sulfonated para-PBI means that crosslinkers are needed, complicating membrane fabrication and decreasing alkaline stability. Here we report a non-crosslinked PBI membrane with a 50% degree of sulfonation that shows a high room temperature conductivity in 1 M KOH of 135 mS cm−1. We did not observe degradation in a 6-month alkaline stability test at 80 °C. Using this membrane in an anion-exchange membrane water electrolyser, we report a current density of 4.8 A cm−2 at 2 V (3 M KOH at 80 °C; Pt and NiFe electrode catalysts); the H2 crossover to the O2 side remained <2%. Using non-platinum group metal electrodes and a polyphenylene sulfide-reinforced membrane, a cell operated for >1,000 h without failure. Industrial alkaline water electrolysers (AWE) use a concentrated KOH solution (4–7 M ~ 20–30 wt%) as electrolyte. The electrodes are separated by porous diaphragms such as Zirfon to prevent the mixing of hydrogen (H2) and oxygen (O2)1. Whereas cost-effective non-platinum group metal (PGM) materials such as nickel-based electrodes can be used as catalysts2,3, AWE has a narrow operational window. At too low currents, the amount of H2 crossed over to O2 exceeds the explosion limit4. Additionally, Zirfon's low bubble point of 2 bar prevents operation at differential pressures, complicating efforts to reduce H2 compression costs7,8. Proton exchange membrane water electrolysis uses dense membranes and typically reaches current densities of 1–2 A cm−2, and even 6 A cm−2 were reported9. However, the acidic pH necessitates the use of expensive titanium-based bipolar plates10 and platinum and iridium catalysts, which are scarce metals11. Furthermore, Nafion 212 costs around US$225 m−2 (ref. 12), and governments seek to ban fluorinated materials because their toxicity and longevity raise environmental concerns13,14. Anion exchange membrane water electrolysis (AEMWE) uses membranes with cationic moieties and combines the advantages of AWE (cheap catalysts) and proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (differential pressure)15. However, most AEMs have a conductivity below 80 mS cm−1 (for example, FAA3: 45 mS cm−1 in 1 M KOH)16,17,18, and their quaternary ammonium groups degrade by nucleophilic substitution and Hoffman elimination19, limiting operation to diluted alkaline solutions, which improves stability but increases solubility of H2 and thus permeation20. Acid-doped polybenzimidazole (PBI) is used in PEM fuel cells21,22 and flow batteries23,24,25, and recently, KOH-doped PBI membranes, so-called ion-solvating membranes (ISM), have been investigated for use in AWE4. Depending on the doping process, conductivities of 100–200 mS cm−1 were achieved in 25 wt% KOH solution26,27,28, and an AWE with a reinforced gel meta-PBI membrane exhibited 1.7 A cm−2 at 1.8 V, 80 °C (ref. However, when meta-PBI, the most well-investigated ISM, is immersed in solutions containing ≤1 M KOH, the range relevant for AEMWE, the conductivity decreases strongly. Introduction of N-alkylsulfonic acid side chains to PBI increases water and KOH absorption29, but this type of functionalization consumes imidazole NH groups, and without negative charge, the imidazole C2 position is susceptible to OH− attack30. Recently, we reported the use of sulfonated para-PBI (MS-PBI), which has 50% more ionic groups per repeat unit and thus reaches very high conductivities, even in 1 M KOH, but needs to be crosslinked to avoid dissolution31. Although this material showed excellent alkaline stability over 6 months in 1 M KOH at 80 °C, the crosslinked neutral imidazole units might act as breaking point. Furthermore, chemical crosslinking is difficult to scale up, because casting solutions could gel during membrane fabrication. Previously, a PBI copolymer (SOPBI, a PBI that contains sulfonated and non-sulfonated diphenyl ether moieties; Fig. 1) was reported for use in PEM Fuel Cells32. Whereas phenyl ethers substituted with quaternary ammonium groups are avoided in AEM, sulfonated poly(ether ether ketone) was stable over 41 days test in 5 M NaOH at 60 °C (ref. In SOPBI, the negatively charged imidazolide groups should further stabilize the ether groups. Sulfonation of OBA, synthesis of SOPBI, its doping with KOH solution and illustration that negatively charged imidazolide ions resist OH− attack on the C2 position. aq indicates an aqueous solution. In this work, SOPBI properties are optimized by copolymerization of sulfonated and non-sulfonated monomers. Sulfonated units with locally high electrolyte uptake promote conductivity, whereas less sulfonated regions provide stability. Therefore, no crosslinking is needed. The absence of quaternary ammonium and neutral imidazole groups promises high alkaline stability, and in 1 M KOH solution, SOPBI demonstrated a conductivity above that of over 30 membranes that were recently reported in the literature (Supplementary Tables 4 and 5). 4,4′-oxybisbenzoic acid (OBA) was sulfonated to sodium 6,6′-oxybis(3-carboxybenzenesulfonate) (SODBA), as proven by 1H-NMR (Supplementary Fig. Copolymerization of SODBA with diaminobenzidine (DAB) and OBA gave a series of partially sulfonated polymers (Fig. As also observed by others34, polymerizations targeting DOS > 70% give a gelled reaction mixture within 3 h of reaction. Simultaneously, Friedel–Crafts-type crosslinking reactions may gain importance. 2) confirmed that polymers with DOS of 50%, 60% and 70% were successfully synthesized (50SOPBI, 60SOPBI and 70SOPBI, respectively). All polymers formed strong, flexible membranes, indicating that high molecular weights were obtained (>92 kg mol−1; Supplementary Table 2). Across all KOH concentrations, 50SOPBI exhibits the lowest thickness swelling range of 7.5–63.2%. Because in-plane swelling is much lower, electrolyte uptake (Supplementary Fig. Anisotropic swelling of PBI is known in both acidic and alkaline media and related to the preferred orientation of polymer chains, probably forming a lamellar-like structure23,36. It was reported that a freeze-dried gel PBI possesses nanofibrils, which aggregate into 28-nm-thick nano-sheets, which are oriented parallel to the plane37. Whereas non-crosslinked MS-PBI swells excessively and eventually dissolves31, SOPBI copolymers remain dimensionally stable, indicating that the strategy to have regions of high and low ion density on the polymer chain works well. Whereas 50SOPBI swells only 63% in thickness in 20 wt% KOH solution, state-of-the-art meta-PBI swells 175% (ref. Presumably, the non-sulfonated OBA units are more hydrophobic than the meta-phenyl linked units and show a higher degree of π-stacking. a–f, Swelling of 50SOPBI (a), 60SOPBI (b) and 70SOPBI (c) membranes in KOH solutions at RT; internal KOH concentration, polymer, water and KOH weight fraction inside 50SOPBI (d), 60SOPBI (e) and 70SOPBI (f) membranes. All data points are average values over three samples. For 0.11% to 20 wt% KOH solutions, 50SOPBI shows an internal concentration range from 11.9 to 24.3 wt% and from 15.3% to 30.4 wt% for 60SOPBI. 70SOPBI shows lower values of 11.7% to 23.6% KOH. The reason is a strongly increased water absorption (Fig. 4b), which results in 338% water uptake in 10 wt% KOH and excessive total uptake (Supplementary Fig. Whereas a high hydration number may improve chemical stability and conductivity of membranes39, excessive water uptake results in large swelling or even dissolution (Fig. 2c) and promotes creep under compressive forces. 3a, the through-plane conductivity at room temperature (RT) increases with the concentration of the external KOH solution and then decreases again, similarly to the uptake data presented in Supplementary Fig. Unlike meta-PBI and 5MS-PBI31, which have the highest conductivity in 25 wt% and 20 wt% KOH solution, respectively, SOPBI membranes reach their highest conductivity in 10–15 wt% KOH solution. a–f, Conductivity of KOH solutions43 and SOPBI at RT (a), of 50SOPBI before and after 48 h activation in 15 wt% KOH at 80 °C (b), of 50SOPBI-act at different temperatures (c), contribution of K+ and OH− to the total conductivity of 50SOPBI-act at 80 °C (d), the effect of anode concentration on the transference numbers (e) and conductivity of 50SOPBI-act in comparison to 60 literature data (f; Supplementary Tables 4 and 5), all in ≤1 M KOH, gas or water47. AEMWE uses electrolyte concentrations of 0.2–1 M KOH4 to mitigate ionomer oxidation at the anode and loss of interfacial contact40. For comparison, commercial FAA3-50 has a conductivity of 46 mS cm−1 in 1 M KOH17. 70SOPBI shows a conductivity of 129 mS cm−1 in 1 M KOH, which correlates with its strong swelling and water uptake (polymer weight fraction below 31%, 21% swelling in length and 61% in thickness, Fig. 2c; water uptake of 338%, Supplementary Fig. 4b) and raises concerns about its dimensional stability at elevated temperatures. Because the targeted operation temperature for ion solvating membrane water electrolysis (ISMWE) is 80 °C, the stability of all membranes was tested in 1 M KOH at 80 °C for 48 h. 70SOPBI almost completely dissolved, whereas 60SOPBI swelled 150% in thickness and 30% in length. Noticeably, 50SOPBI remained stable, with only a slight yellowish discoloration of the solution. Therefore, 50SOPBI appears to be the most promising membrane. For use in flow batteries, meta-PBI membranes showed improved conductivity in 3 M H2SO4 when they were pre-swollen at a higher concentration23. Similarly, pre-swelling in 4 M KOH (19 wt% KOH) increased the conductivity in 2 M H2SO4 from 5 mS cm−1 to 56 mS cm−1 (ref. Interactions between polymer chains are broken, and low molecular weight fractions leach out, resulting in higher solution uptake. Thus, to improve the conductivity of 50SOPBI, it was activated for 48 h at 80 °C in 15 wt% KOH (50SOPBI-act), where conductivity and volumetric swelling (Fig. Additionally, pre-swelling may increase the degree of deprotonation. For gel PBI, X-ray diffraction data and molecular modelling suggested that only 50% of imidazole units are deprotonated in 25 wt% KOH at RT27. 6d,e shows that 48-h activation increases the KOH weight fraction and strongly increases total uptake. Activation increased the room temperature conductivity in 15 wt% KOH to 182 mS cm−1 (Fig. Figure 3c displays the temperature effect on the conductivity of 50SOPBI-act in 0.2 and 1 M KOH solution. The inflection point at 40 °C may indicate a change in the degree of deprotonation. This is supported by an increased membrane thickness (Supplementary Fig. In 1 M KOH, volume swelling increases from 94.2% at RT to 114% and 149% at 60 and 80 °C. In 2 M KOH, the volume swelling increases from 94% at RT to 114% and 140% at 60 and 80 °C. In 3 M KOH, the volume swelling is less than in 1 and 2 M KOH, from 88.4% at RT to 97.3% and 100% at 60 and 80 °C, respectively. Furthermore, the total uptake levels off above 1 M KOH (Supplementary Fig. Because ISM absorbs electrolyte, the measured conductivity values are the sum of K+ and OH− conductivity (Supplementary Fig. However, OER consumes OH−, and movement of K+ ions results in a net transport of KOH from anode to cathode. 3b shows that the transport number of K+ ions decreases as the electrolyte concentration increases. This concentration difference creates an osmotic pressure difference, and water diffuses towards the cathode. In electrolysis systems, this is countered by degassing and mixing anolyte and catholyte. In 1 M KOH at 80 °C, the conductivity of K+ and OH− ions is 151 and 207 mS cm−1 (Fig. Figure 3e summarizes the effect of anode concentration on the ion transport numbers. This indicates that the membrane's properties gradually change from anode to cathode and that the side that is in contact with the lower concentrated alkaline solution determines the overall selectivity. 3f, we are not aware of AEMs that have higher conductivity than 50SOPBI-act. In 15 wt% KOH, a conductivity of 592 mS cm−1 at 80 °C was measured (Supplementary Fig. For comparison, the measured conductivity of hydroxide exchanged 80-μm-thick Piperion in water at 80 °C is 151 mS cm−1, and an AEMWE performance of 13.39 A cm−2 at 2 V was achieved with an optimized AEM showing a conductivity of 208 mS cm−1 in DI water at 80 °C (ref. For 50SOPBI-act, the Arrhenius plot (Supplementary Fig. 5b) reveals an activation energy in 0.2 M KOH of 14.57 kJ mol−1, 1.6 times higher than that of the solution (9.08 kJ mol−1) (ref. In 1 M KOH, the membranes show an activation energy of 18.76 kJ mol−1, almost twice higher than that of the solution (9.45 kJ mol−1); in 2 M KOH, the activation energy is 17.58 kJ mol−1 (1.8 times higher than for 2 M KOH solution). In 3 M KOH, the membranes show an activation energy of 19.32 kJ mol−1 (1.9 times higher than for 3 M KOH solution)43. Physically, a higher activation energy indicates that ion transport by vehicle mechanism contributes more than transport by structural diffusion, for example, because of a reduced water concentration or because narrow passages between polymer chains interrupt the hydrogen-bonded network needed for the Grotthus mechanism. X-ray diffraction analysis of the peak at 5–10° shows that the inter-chain distances increase with the KOH concentration and correlate with the volume swelling (further discussion in Supplementary Information)23,44. The ex situ alkaline stability of 50SOPBI-act was tested by immersing samples in 0.2, 1 and 2 M KOH solutions at 80 °C and periodically measuring conductivity at RT (Fig. In 0.2 M KOH, 50SOPBI-act showed no substantial dimensional changes and a stable conductivity of 86 ± 6 mS cm−1 for over 200 days. In 1 M KOH, conductivity increased linearly from 135.4 to around 170 mS cm−1 after 200 days (0.17 mS cm−1 d−1). In 2 M KOH, a steeper increase rate of 0.47 mS cm−1 d−1 was observed from 180 to 270 mS cm−1 for 200 days. Most importantly, all membranes remained visibly unchanged in 0.2, 1 and 2 M KOH solutions at 80 °C, and no discoloration of the KOH solutions was observed, implying that the polymer remained stable. a, RT conductivity versus time in 0.2, 1 and 2 M KOH for over 200 days. b, FTIR spectra of pristine 50SOPBI and aged 50SOPBI-act. c, Number average molecular weight (Mn), weight-average molecular weight (Mw) and polydispersity index (PDI) of pristine and aged membranes. * indicates that a different polymer batch was used. A potential attack of OH− ions would occur at the ether groups and at the imidazole C2 position of non-deprotonated benzimidazole units30. The latter reaction would open the ring and form amides and carboxylic acids. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy did not show any new band in the carbonyl region (1,600–1,750 cm−1; Fig. This further supports that hydrolysis of imidazole rings is not observed as depicted in Fig. Gel permeation chromatography analysis showed that ageing did not reduce the weight-average molecular weight (Mw) of 50SOPBI (Fig. Whereas pristine 50SOPBI had a Mw of 92 kg mol−1, 50SOPBI-act immersed in 0.2 M and 1 M KOH had Mw of 111 and 99 kg mol−1, respectively, with a similar polydispersity index (PDI). PDI and Mw of pristine *50SOPBI (132 kg mol−1) were similar to those of *50SOPBI-act aged in 2 M KOH (120 kg mol−1). Because OH− attack on imidazole or phenyl ether would result in chain scission and decreased Mw, it can be deducted that 50SOPBI did not experience chain scission. Negatively charged imidazolide groups should increase the electron density on the ether carbon atoms and by this stabilize the aromatic ether against alkaline hydrolysis. DFT calculations support that an increased activation barrier reduces the risk of nucleophilic attack by OH−. A detailed discussion is provided in the Supplementary Information. To achieve high performance, the cathode contained Pt/C on carbon paper, and the anode NiFe on Ni felt (cell type 1). 50SOPBI-act showed much higher performance than Piperion (Fig. Piperion's similar performance in 2 and 3 M KOH is expected because the conductivity of AEMs typically levels off at higher KOH concentrations17. The performance of the 50SOPBI-act membrane is compared with literature data in Supplementary Table 1. a–f, Current–voltage (iV) curves measured at 60 °C are shown for cells with 80-μm Piperion (curves for 1 M and 2 M overlap) (a), 97-μm 50SOPBI-act (b), Nafion 212 (curves for Nafion overlap) (c), 10-μm (dry state) and 40-μm (dry state) mPBI and 500-μm Zirfon; and at 80 °C for 80-μm Piperion (d), 97-μm 50SOPBI-act (e), Nafion 212 (f), 10-μm (dry state) and 40-μm (dry state) mPBI and 500-μm Zirfon. 50SOPBI-act was also compared with the cation exchange membrane Nafion 212, a 10- and a 40-μm-thick commercial meta-PBI (mPBI) membrane activated at 80 °C (resulting in 13- and 58-μm thickness in 2 M KOH and 16- and 70-μm thickness in 3 M KOH) and 500-μm Zirfon (Fig. In ≥ 2 M KOH, at 60 and 80 °C, all membranes showed lower performance than 97-μm-thick 50SOPBI-act. However, this is due to the membrane's very low thickness, which sacrifices its mechanical integrity and increases hydrogen crossover, which is impractical for real applications. For durability, mPBI would need to be reinforced, but the thinnest-available polyphenylene sulfide (PPS) mesh at the moment is >60 μm thick. However, 40-μm-thick mPBI (58 μm in 2 M KOH; 70 μm in 3 M KOH) showed a much lower performance than 50SOPBI-act. A commercial mPBI membrane, activated at 80 °C and immersed in 2 and 3 M KOH for 2.5 months at room temperature, disintegrated (Supplementary Fig. 10), whereas 50SOPBI-act membranes that were stored at 80 °C in 2 M KOH for 15 months and in 3 M KOH for 9 months showed excellent stability. 50SOPBI-act remained flexible and did not break even when stretched by tweezers. Mechanical properties are shown in Supplementary Table 6. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis (Supplementary Figs. 9 and 11) reveals that 50SOPBI-act has lower high-frequency resistance (HFR) in 0.2, 1, 2 and 3 M KOH than Piperion at both 60 and 80 °C, because the thicker 50SOPBI-act has higher conductivity than Piperion. This is unexpected because the conductivity of OH− exchanged Piperion in water at 80 °C (151 mS cm−1) is lower than that of 50SOPBI-act in 0.2 M KOH (216 mS cm−1) and 1 M KOH. The reason is that the cell with 50SOPBI-act has lower HFR but significantly higher polarization resistance than the cell using Piperion, similar to our previous observation for sulfonated para-PBI31. The exact reason will be investigated in future work but could be related to loss of active catalyst area by membrane entering the electrode pores, gas entrapment within the porous electrodes, catalyst poisoning, KOH depletion, oxidation of PBI in contact with anode catalyst or ion pair formation between cationic Piperion binder and anionic ISM. Another electrolyser with 98-µm-thick 50SOPBI-act membrane and PGM-free electrodes based on Raney Ni-type catalysts was operated with 1 and 2 M KOH electrolytes at 60 and 80 °C. The polarization curves indicate currents above 1 A cm−2 at 2 V in all conditions (Fig. The performance improves with increased KOH concentration, probably due to reduced ohmic and charge transfer resistance, as evidenced by EIS measurement (Supplementary Fig. Presumably, higher KOH concentration improves the catalyst activity, membrane conductivity and availability of hydroxide ions. With 0.2 M feed solution, higher total cell resistance led to low performance. Increasing the temperature has a similar effect as increasing the KOH concentration. As the temperature rises from 60 to 80 °C, performance improves from 1.04 to 1.30 A cm−2 at 2 V in 1 M KOH and from 1.52 to 1.91 A cm−2 in 2 M KOH, implying that 50SOPBI-act exhibited excellent performance with PGM-free electrodes. As shown in Supplementary Fig. 12, this can be attributed to reduced ohmic and charge transfer resistance. a,b, iV curves are shown for operation with 0.2, 1 and 2 M KOH solution at 60 (a) and 80 °C (b). c,d, Comparison of 98-µm 50SOPBI-act and 150-µm PPS-reinforced 50SOPBI-act in 2 M KOH at 60 (c) and 80 °C (d). To protect the membrane against compressive forces and sharp edges of nickel-based substrates, it was reinforced with a 60–70-µm-thick PPS textile (Supplementary Fig. When a coin was pressed on the membranes, it only cut through the non-reinforced 50SOPBI membrane (Supplementary Fig. Although PPS fibres themselves are not ion conductive, the PPS-reinforced 50SOPBI-act membrane still had a high ionic conductivity of 399 mS cm−1 in 2 M KOH at 80 °C (Supplementary Fig. An AEMWE cell with PPS-reinforced 50SOPBI-act showed slightly lower performance due to increased ohmic resistance (Supplementary Fig. The durability of cells with PPS-reinforced 50SOPBI-act in 2 M KOH was evaluated at constant current density of 0.5 A cm−2 at 80 °C (Supplementary Fig. Though the voltage increased, no failure was observed over 1,000 h. A repeat experiment demonstrated high reproducibility (Supplementary Fig. 15), and the cell was stopped after 400 h. When the cell was restarted again, voltage decreased by about 90 mV and the voltage loss rate decreased. Because the ex situ stability test showed that the membrane does not lose its conductivity (Fig. 4a), the voltage increase could stem from factors such as bubble management or loss of contact between membrane and electrode, which would not be directly a membrane issue. With 1 M KOH, the HTO at 40 and 60 °C stays below the safe level of 2% when a cell with 50SOPBNI-act is operated at ≥100 mA cm−2, whereas a current density of 400 mA cm−2 is needed at 80 °C. An 80-μm-thick Piperion membrane showed a higher HTO than 50SOPBI (Fig. To reach HTO below 2% in 2 M KOH at 40, 60 and 80 °C, Piperion needs to be operated at current densities above 150, 270 and 410 mA cm−2, respectively. In summary, the 50SOPBI-act membrane can be safely operated over a wider current range than the Piperion membrane. a,b, HTO levels with 102-µm-thick 50SOPBI-act using 1 M KOH (a) and 2 M KOH solution (b). c, HTO levels with an 80-μm-thick Piperion membrane. Shaded area indicates a safe gas composition (50% below the lower explosion limit). 17) with 2 M KOH feed solution at 80 °C and a current density of 500 mA cm−2 for 500 h (Fig. The use of separate electrolyte chambers resulted in a net movement of KOH from anode to cathode. To minimize this effect, the electrolyte volumes were manually rebalanced every 24 h. Every five days, the electrolytes were renewed. The voltage almost fully recovered (Fig. 18), implying that the voltage increase is not due to membrane degradation, but rather due to the KOH-depleted anolyte. 19 reveals a negative linear correlation between voltage and anolyte concentration. Further experiments with different anode and cathode concentrations confirmed that the cell performance is strongly influenced by the anode concentration (Supplementary Fig. On the basis of the voltage values after each electrolyte replacement, a voltage increase rate of 35.6 μV h−1 was observed (Fig. After that, HFR decreased 10.9%, presumably due to increased electrolyte uptake or some morphological changes over time, which is supported by Fig. The test was done at 80 °C, at a constant current density of 500 mA cm−2, and with 2 M KOH feed solution (50 ml min−1); cathode was Pt/C/carbon paper, NiFe electrodeposited on Ti mesh was used as anode. Sulfonated OPBI, which was originally synthesized by others for use in PEM fuel cells, can perform excellently as an ISM in alkaline electrolytes. By optimized partial sulfonation of OPBI, it was possible to control the swelling in KOH solution without the need of crosslinking. This is advantageous, because crosslinking fully sulfonated PBI membranes with dibromoxylene not only complicates the membrane casting process, but the crosslinking points are neutral imidazole groups, which can be more easily attacked by OH− than deprotonated imidazolide units. The optimized 50SOPBI membrane with a DOS of 50% showed appropriate swelling behaviour and high conductivity over the broad range of 1 to 25 wt% KOH, that is, the new ISM serves the whole broad operational range from the AEMWE range (0.2 to 1 M KOH) over the previously not-much-investigated range of 1–4 M KOH to the AWE range (4 to 7 M KOH). After an activation step, the 50SOPBI-act membrane reached a conductivity at room temperature of 135 mS cm−1 in 1 M KOH. At 80 °C, the conductivity reached 358 mS cm−1. In an ex situ stability test (1 M KOH, 80 °C, 200 days), no degradation was observed. The membranes remained flexible, showed practically no discoloration of the KOH solution, and the molecular weight range was not decreased. Rather, membranes continuously absorbed KOH solution, which increased the initial conductivity at room temperature from 135 mS cm−2 to 175 mS cm−2. Whereas cell operation with nickel foam, carbon felt and Ni felt electrodes did not damage the membrane, operation with catalyst-coated porous nickel sheets gave mechanical damages at the edge of the active area. This problem was tackled by reinforcing the membrane with a PPS textile, which acted as a hard stop, so that the sharp, hard edge of the nickel sheet could not damage the membrane. This was also proven in an ex situ test in which a coin was pressed onto membranes. Performance-wise, an AEMWE cell (type 1) with 3 M KOH feed solution and 50SOPBI-act showed higher performance than a cell with commercial Piperion membrane, 4.8 A cm−2 and 3.8 A cm−2 at 2 V, respectively. In a PGM-free cell (type 2, 2 M KOH solution, 80 °C), the current density at 2 V reached 1.91 A cm−2 for SOPBI-act and 1.70 A cm−2 for PPS-reinforced 50SOPBI-act. A test for H2 crossover in cell type 3 (nickel foam electrodes) revealed that the HTO remains below the safety limit of 2% at current densities ≥50 mA cm−2 at 60 °C and 2 M KOH and ≥200 mA cm−2 at 80 °C, which allows for a broad operational capacity. In another cell (type 4, active area of 25 cm2), a 500-h test showed a stable performance with a low voltage increase of 36 μV h−1. We expect that further optimization of the cell components and operating conditions (porous transport layer, catalysts, catalysts loading, cell compression, current, current profile, temperature, pressure, electrolyte concentration, electrolyte flow rate, dry or electrolyte-fed cathode) can improve durability. A cost calculation shows that the material costs is just US$0.84 g−1 for 50SOPBI polymer, US$1.02 g−1 or US$59 m−2 for 50SOPBI dry membrane (Supplementary Tables 7–12). In conclusion, 50SOPBI is a very attractive membrane, and the data confirm that ISM in LA ISMWE have the potential to outperform AEM in AEMWE applications in terms of cost, performance and durability, which opens a path to reduce the cost of green H2 production. 4,4'-oxybisbenzoic acid (OBA), 20% fuming sulfuric acid and lithium chloride were purchased from Sigma Aldrich. 3,3'-diaminobenzidine (DAB) was purchased from Longyan Tianhua Biological Technology Co. Polyphosphoric acid 115% (PPA), phosphoric acid 85 wt%, sodium chloride (NaCl), dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), potassium carbonate (K2CO3) and potassium hydroxide were obtained from Daejung Chemicals. All chemicals were used as received without further purification. PPS textile (polyphenylene sulfide industrial mesh, PPS0177/70PW: 35-µm fibre diameter, 60-µm thickness, specified working temperature up to 215 °C, 70% open area, mesh opening 177 µm) was provided by PVF Mesh & Screen Technology. The synthesis follows a previously reported procedure34. Fifteen g (58.14 mmol) of 4,4′oxybisbenzoic acid was placed inside a 100-ml round-bottom flask equipped with argon inlet, and 45 ml 20% fuming sulfuric acid was added. Then the mixture was stirred at 110 °C for 2 h, resulting in a brown viscous solution. The solution was cooled down to RT and poured on 100 g of ground ice. When all ice was molten, 30 g NaCl were added, and a white precipitate formed. The precipitate was collected by filtration and purified by recrystallization in deionized (DI) water twice. The purified crystals were vacuum dried at 110 °C for 24 h. The yield was 20.4 g (43.93 mmol, 76%). Exemplary, the synthesis of 50SOPBI is given. An amount of 4.634 g (21.630 mmol) DAB was placed into a 500-ml flask equipped with inert gas inlet and overhead stirrer, followed by addition of 213.5 g PPA. The mixture was heated to 110 °C for 2 h until all DAB dissolved. Then, 5 g (10.815 mmol) of SODBA was added. The mixture was rigorously stirred for 30 min followed by a slow stirring for 2 h at 140 °C. Then, 2.792 g (10.815 mmol) of OBA was added. After 30 min of rigorous stirring, the temperature was raised and kept at 160 °C for 16 h. The resulting viscous brown solution was diluted with 10-ml phosphoric acid and slowly poured into DI water, to form brown polymer fibres. The fibres were neutralized by 24-h immersion in 2 l of 0.5 M K2CO3 solution and were washed repeatedly with DI water to remove excess K2CO3. Next, the fibres were soaked in acetone for 2 h to exchange the water and afterwards dried in a vacuum oven at 100 °C for 24 h. For other copolymers, the ratios of OBA and SODBA were changed, and the amount of PPA was adjusted to reach 5.5% total monomer contents. LiCl at 3.5 wt% with respect to the polymer weight was dissolved in DMSO, and 8 wt% SOPBI with respect to DMSO was added. The mixture was stirred at 70 °C for 24 h. Undissolved particles were removed by centrifugation. Afterwards, the polymer solution was sonicated to remove air bubbles and stored at 30 °C. To make membranes, the solution was casted on a glass plate using a doctor blade. The wet film was kept in an oven at 80 °C for 2 h at atmospheric pressure and for 24 h in vacuum. After cooling to RT, the dry membrane was delaminated from the glass plate and stored in a zip bag. Gel permeation chromatography was conducted with a Waters 2707 autosampler equipped with a Styragel HR 3 (WAT044223) column calibrated with poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA; PSS, MW = 596; 1,930; 5,170; 10,900; 18,700; 41,400; 88,500; 217,000; 340,000; 608,000; 990,000 and 2,050,000 g mol−1). Signals were detected with a Waters 2414 RI detector. Before the measurement, 6-mg polymer were dissolved in 2-ml 0.05 M LiBr/NMP at 80 °C for 24 h. Then the solutions were filtered by 0.45-μm PTFE syringe filter and put into autosampler for measurement. A KOH-doped membrane with wet thickness twet was placed between two disc-shaped electrodes (gold or platinum) of an active area (A) of 1.767 cm2. The measurement was repeated for stacks of two and three membranes. The resistances (R) were plotted as a function of membrane thickness. The conductivity of the membrane can be calculated according to following equations (1) and (2): Alkaline stability was characterized by measuring the conductivity at room temperature of membranes that were stored in KOH solutions at 80 °C for prolonged times. Swelling behaviour was characterized by measuring dimensional changes for length (l) and thickness (t) between pristine dry (linitial and tinitial) membranes and doped membranes (ldoped and tdoped). Swelling ratios were calculated according to equations (3) and (4). The pristine dry membranes were doped in KOH solution. After a certain time, the wet membranes were quickly wiped by tissue, and the wet weight was noted (wwet). After water evaporation at 100 °C overnight, wdry was noted. Next, the membrane samples were washed with DI water until the pH became neutral and dried at 100 °C overnight (wfinal). The total, water, KOH uptake and polymer fraction were calculated according to equations (5)–(8). The KOH-free potassium form of 50SOPBI membrane before doping with KOH and after doping and washing with water is confirmed by scanning electron microscopy coupled with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (Supplementary Table 3). To improve the conductivity of 50SOPBI, a Teflon container was filled with 15 wt% KOH solution, 50SOPBI membranes were added and the container was closed and stored at 80 °C for 48 h. After again cooling down to RT, the membrane surface was wiped with a tissue to remove excess solution, and the membrane was re-immersed in a solution with the finally targeted KOH concentration for at least 24 h and stored until use. The membranes are denoted as 50SOPBI-act. The ion transport number of K+ and OH− was conducted by modified Hittorf method by comparing the concentration change of either anode or cathode with the produced OH− at the cathode side (N). The membrane was placed in the electrolyser cell and was operated at fixed current (i) in 1, 2 and 3 M KOH solution. Periodically (t), 15-ml solution was taken from anolyte and catholyte, and the volume change was observed. The ion transport numbers of K+ and OH− are calculated as follows: n: number of electrons involved to produce 1 mol OH− Platinum on carbon (Pt/C, Pt 47.1 wt%, Tanaka K.K.) was employed as cathode catalyst. The catalyst ink was fabricated by mixing catalyst powder, ionomer (Piperion), distilled water and isopropyl alcohol. The catalyst ink was ultrasonicated for 1 h and hand sprayed onto substrates. The cathode was constructed by applying 0.5 mg cm−2 of Pt/C onto carbon paper (SGL GDL 39BB, CNL). Ionomer-free anode was prepared by electrodeposition. The electrodeposition bath consisted of DI water (~18.1 MΩ), 15 mM Ni(NO3)2·6H2O (99.999%, Sigma Aldrich) and 15 mM Fe(NO3)3·9H2O (99.95%, Sigma Aldrich). A −10 mA cm−2 amount was applied to the working electrode for 600 s under ambient conditions with a SP300 (biologic). Ti mesh was used as the counter electrode and saturated calomel electrode was used as the reference electrode. The electrode was rinsed with water and finally dried in air. A commercial anion exchange membrane (Piperion, 80 µm) was immersed into 1.0 M KOH for at least 24 h for activation before the membrane electrode assembly fabrication. 50SOPBI membranes were activated in 15 wt% KOH at 80 °C for 48 h, denoted as 50SOPBI-act, followed by equilibration in 0.2,1, 2 and 3 M KOH for at least 24 h. All membranes were sandwiched between the anode and the cathode. Au-coated Ti and graphite bipolar plates were employed as the current collectors on the anode and cathode sides of the cell. The cell assembly was tightened to 4 N m using a torque wrench. The electrolysis performance was measured at 60 and 80 °C using a potentiostat (HCP-803, Bio-Logic). The current–voltage curve of the AEMWE was obtained by linear sweep voltammetry, which ranged from 1.35 to 2.2 Vcell at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1. EIS was conducted at 1.6, 1.8 and 2 Vcell with an a.c. frequency ranging from 10 kHz to 500 mHz and an alternating voltage amplitude of 10 mV. Electrodes were produced by spraying globular gas-atomized nickel-aluminium-type alloy powders with and without Mo for anode and cathode electrodes, respectively. Al acts as a pore-forming agent. Coated porous electrodes were produced on the surface of 4-cm2 Ni mesh substrate using thermal spray technique26. The zero-gap electrolyser cell consists of five main parts: nickel bipolar plates, Ni wire mesh as gas diffusion layers (GDL), membranes and coated Ni-based electrode as anode and coated Mo incorporated porous Ni as cathode. Activated membrane is placed between two electrodes and supported from each side by porous Ni GDLs and fixed by nickel bipolar plates from both sides. The test has been carried out in different KOH concentrations, 0.2, 1 and 2 M at two different temperatures, 60 and 70 °C, by recording polarization curves up to 2 A cm−2 with a scan rate of 10 mA s−1. The ohmic resistance or high-frequency resistance, appearing as the intercept of the Nyquist plots with the x axis at high frequency (left side of Nyquist plot) represents the total internal ohmic resistance of the cell, which arises mainly from solution and membrane resistance. Either 0.2, 1 or 2 M KOH solution was pumped to both anode and cathode sides at a flow rate of 80 ml min−1 and partially connected via a 20 cm long ¼-inch tube located below the degassing vessels and before the pumps. The cells were operated for 4 h at each current density, with excluding data from the first 30 min for system equilibration. Measurements were initially performed at 80 °C, followed by 60 °C and 40 °C. At 16 ml min−1, nitrogen was purged into the anode degassing vessel, and the exhaust gas was passed through a drying column to remove the water vapour before reaching an electrochemical H2 sensor (Geopal GJ-EX gas detector equipped with a Membrapor H2/M-40000 sensor). The durability test was carried out at 500 mA cm−2 in 2 M KOH using a 25-cm2 cell with a flow rate of 50 ml min−1, and the high-frequency resistance was measured every 10 min at 10 kHz.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>What It's like to Be the President's Doctor Being a doctor is challenging enough, but imagine having a patient whose health has direct implications for national security and global politics. Presidential physicians face unique medical challenges, from preparing for gunshot wounds to managing the health care of someone with a grueling schedule. He also held other medical roles at the White House, like Director of the White House Medical Unit, White House Physician and Senior Medical Officer for the Marine One squadron, for more than a decade before that. His recent book Transforming Presidential Healthcare offers a rare inside look at what it takes to keep commanders in chief healthy. He recently chatted with Scientific American associate editor Lauren Young. If you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today. Lauren Young: Tell me how you became a physician to the president. How does one find themselves in such an important medical role? I would say it probably started a decade earlier or two. I was a high school senior, March 30, 1981, and I heard on the radio, “Shots fired,” for President Reagan—his code sign was “Rawhide,” so: “Rawhide down”—and they had taken him to the hospital, to George Washington [University Hospital]. And that's where they treated him like a trauma patient instead of like a VIP and saved his life. And I had hardship tours in Pearl Harbor and in London for Naval Forces Europe, and then I found myself being assigned to the president's helicopter squadron in Quantico, Virginia. And President [Bill] Clinton, his second term, he was in a little trouble at home, so he spent lots of time going overseas, so I did 18 foreign trips that time. We take care of everyone that's on those trips. And that's when the White House physicians at the time were just extremely glad that I was taking care of everyone and said, “You're gonna work here,” so they actually sent me orders. I was privileged to take care of five and a half presidents, and about a decade later I wrote a book, recently out, Transforming Presidential Healthcare, and basically, it's ensuring continuity of the presidency to the commander in chief. So it goes through: President Clinton—I got to the White House at the tail end of his presidency, in his last months. President Clinton, even though I just met with him a couple times for, like, a minute or two, he has a presence about him that, at that moment in time, he makes you feel like you're the most important person in the world, that he's focused on you. And then when I interacted with him 10 years later he remembers your name. He remembers, like, the family if you brought that up. And so he has that gift of connecting with people personally. Then I was there for President George W. Bush. I don't know if it's my monologues. Some people think it might be just how I'm built—my white hair or my protruding jaw. And it just stuck, that a lot of people wouldn't even know my name. They would just say, you know, “Doc Leno.” And it continued on with President [Barack] Obama. I took care of him, like, at Camp David, Kennebunkport, Prairie Chapel Ranch, and he was the most gracious person I've ever met. And at Camp David he would come play volleyball with us, which is pretty good as an 80-year-old. And President Obama kind of said, “I don't really need a doctor, but Michelle and the girls do, and so I'm going with you,” which I thought, you know, it's probably the highest compliment a father can give you. And then during that time Vice President [Joe] Biden was around, so that's who I'd call the fifth president. And then also, when Hillary Clinton was first lady, we would take care of her. She had some medical conditions on some of the foreign trips that we went on—she was often present—and so I rendered help to her. A really interesting theme that seemed to come out of the book and, you know, your work is how the president's care is not, quote, unquote, “VIP care.” Can you elaborate a little bit on that? Kuhlman: So what I found in life is, often, those that you think have the best access to care—Michael Jackson, Steve Jobs, you know, celebrities, rock stars, ultrahigh-net-worth individuals—they have horrible access to care. They don't have the time in their schedule. And then they tend to be surrounded by sycophant doctors that just wanna please them. The first full-time doctor was a Navy doctor, Presley Rixey, and he had taken care of the McKinley family. So when Teddy Roosevelt came in he actually made Dr. Rixey full time: “You're gonna be the White House doctor.” And that's when they started calling it the White House, 'cause before that it was the Executive Mansion. So that's basically what we try to do, is private, secure, and what I told each president is: “For me, no politics, no policy, just trusted medical advice. Luckily, if you are red or blue as a president, luckily, you're all the same inside, so I could take care of the biology.” You know, the number-one threat to an adult is a out-of-hospital cardiac arrest; we know every day in the U.S. [roughly] 1,000 Americans drop dead. So if we can get an AED [automated external defibrillator] on them—it helps to have a trained individual but, more importantly, start defibrillating with equipment that works and that you've trained with. And so that's the number-one threat to a president of the U.S., so that's why the doctor is within two minutes at all times: every minute that you wait their survival drops by 10 percent. The second set of hands is a critical care nurse and he or she with equipment that, like, compliments the AED. And then the other occupational hazard is gunshot wounds, knife stabbings. So in our history, if we've had, you know, 47 presidents, maybe there's 45 individuals of that 47, but four of them have been assassinated. And then knowing, with Secret Service, they're gonna get us there, but we're gonna keep the blood in the body, we're gonna get to that trauma center, and then they're gonna save the president's life. Kuhlman: But 911 doesn't really work when you're traveling with the president. The other thing that we are prepared for is—what I laid out in Transforming Presidential Healthcare is asymmetrical threats, so think about chemical, biologic attacks. And then if you get to the kind of the more routine: you know, they're human, so they're gonna have upset stomach or different basketball injuries that—maybe they get their lip cracked open or teeth broken or something. Young: I know, too—and I'll just chime in for the audience—I know that you mentioned that basketball injury to the lip. Kuhlman: So it was, actually, on Black Friday, the day after Thanksgiving, and I actually happened to be at the White House evaluating other family members of the first family. What's the injury?” And so he told me a, a lacerated lip and wanted to know what he should do with him. And I said, “Bring him back here to the White House.” And so they came back to the White House. And I probably had 100 people contact me that day telling me why they were the experts in the world to sew up somebody's lip. Kuhlman: And luckily, we did it right; he later took his daughters to, I think, a Georgetown basketball game. Young: I feel like you have to be ready for absolutely anything that gets thrown at you in this position. So when I look back at history James Madison was 36 years old when he submitted his final draft of the Constitution; he was the lead author. And, you know, the first president, George Washington, he was considered an elder statesman, and he was president from age 57 to 65. During the late 1700s very few of them lived to age 60. So when the Constitution was written it doesn't list any physical or mental qualifications to be president. We have the oldest person ever elected to be president as the current president, and he'll be 82 when he completes his second term. New York Times invited me to write an essay about neurocognitive assessment. It is a fact of science, it's not a political attack, that humans past the age of 60, [nearly] every single human starts to have cognitive decline—now, some people faster than others, but every single human past the age of 60 they start to have decline with memory, reasoning, speed of processing, spatial visualization. Those are the four parts of cognitive decline. My opinion would be—President George W. Bush, he's probably the fittest president in history. He could run three miles in [about] 18 and a half minutes during his first term. And when it was President Biden against former President Trump, he famously said, “I'm younger than both of them, and I'm too old for the job,” so he knows the physically demanding part of the job. That's where we would benefit from neurocognitive assessment on a periodic basis. And maybe you don't release every result to the public, but you at least give it to the president, their family, the doctors taking care of them, so that you can see over time. The current president, who's 79, he would benefit from a neurocognitive assessment. So it just needs to be [a] more comprehensive assessment for these senior citizens that are in elected positions of great decision-making in the world. Kuhlman: What I always told each of the presidents is: “I will do my best to respect your personal privacy and your medical privacy.” For example, the annual physical: with President Obama we were at Martha's Vineyard the first year, and I said, “Hey, your physical's coming up. We're gonna do it to take advantage of you getting assessment of the proper medical [condition] of a 48-year-old male.” So we did his first colonoscopy and released that, but he said to me—we were standing by a golf cart, and he said, “I've learned: never lie to the American people; they're gonna find out the truth in the end anyway.”So that was the approach that we took. Kuhlman: So I laid out, “Here are the things that we like to assess during your physical,” and the report that I wrote up, I did submit it to him and submitted it to the press secretary at the time, and they both read through it, and they did not change one word. When is it beneficial for a president or, you know, any political leader, to be transparent about a medical diagnosis? On the one hand, I'm sure, you know, there's circumstances in which, you know, a leader opens up about a condition, it could bring positive awareness to it. I'm curious what your thoughts are on that. Kuhlman: I think it comes down to: Can you do the job? And so how I would assess that is: if you have an impairment—like you're hard of hearing; you have trouble seeing; maybe one of your body organs don't work; you have trouble walking, ambulating—we've had presidents throughout history that have had all of those things. We can make reasonable accommodation, and so then those don't become a disability to be president or to whatever office they're holding. The only impairment that we cannot compensate for is critical decision-making, so we've had history of people covering that up. Kuhlman: So Woodrow Wilson had a massive stroke, he stayed up in his bedroom for months, and it was covered up by his wife, and it was covered up by his doctor, Cary Grayson, who had introduced the two of them. And so Cary Grayson was that young, dashing lieutenant doctor that all of a sudden became a rear admiral because of his friendship with President Wilson. And some historians would say, you know, World War II grew out of some of the problems from that. Young: And my last question for you: What advice would you give to the current physician to the president? There's a famous saying in history that, you know, if you have yourself as your doctor, then you have a fool not only as the doctor, but as the patient. So Dr. [Sean] Barbabella, I think if he sticks to “no politics, no policy, just trusted medical advice,” that will be what's best for the president and best for the American people.
