Of course that's not all Medvedev, who is a showman in his own unique and sometimes self-destructive way, was thinking as he sent his racquets into the audience.“At the same time I was like, ‘The fans are probably going to love it.

Johansson seemed to tell Medvedev just the right thing, at just the right time, in his quarterfinal with Alex de Minaur on Friday. But he was teetering a bit physically in the high heat—the same heat that had made him cramp twice already in China. Johansson told him, from what I could hear, that anytime he got a ball around the service line, he should “dictate.” From 15-30, Medvedev did just that. One more comfortable service hold and he was into the semis for the second straight week.“I was really clutch in important moments,” Medvedev said. He ran around to hit more forehands, and ended up with 27 winners, while winning 79 percent of first-serve points. Those are good numbers against a speedy wallboard like De Minaur.More telling, perhaps, Medvedev was 10 of 11 at net. He stretched out his long right arm to put one volley away, and deftly measured another short one for a winner. But his wingspan makes it a natural place for him to finish points, and, just as important for someone approaching his 30s, end them more quickly. “I was really clutch in important moments,” Medvedev said.

Medvedev on new coaches Afterward, Medvedev was asked if his good run of form this week came as a surprise.“I have to be honest I did expect this,” he said. He's always a couple of bad games away from flying off the handle, berating his coaches and the chair umpire, and throwing, as he says, a “tantrum.” But tennis is still better with him than without him.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Unseeded Andre Goransson and Alex Michelsen defeated top seeds Marcelo Arevalo and Mate Pavic 7-6(2), 2-6, 10-7 on Friday to reach the final of the Rolex Shanghai Masters. Goransson/Michelsen went up 3-0 in the deciding tie-break and after Arevalo/Pavic tied it at 3-3, both teams held serve until Arevalo double-faulted at 7-8. Arevalo then hit a forehand wide on match point, putting the Swede and American in the final. "It was like three or four days before I went to Laver Cup, he texted me and I was like, why not," said Michelsen on how they teamed up. Goransson is the first Swede to reach the doubles final in tournament history (since 2009) and he will attempt to become the first Swede to win an ATP Masters 1000 doubles title since Robert Lindstedt in 2012 Cincinnati (with Horia Tecau). His other titles came in Newport last year (also with Verbeek) and Pune in 2020 (with Christopher Rungkat). "It feels amazing and my first Masters 1000 final ever, so obviously I am really, really excited," said Goransson. "It was quite nerve-wracking towards the end there, but it's amazing to get through with a win." This is the 21-year-old California native's third career ATP Tour final (0-2), having lost in Stuttgart in June (with Rajeev Ram) and last year at the Cincinnati ATP Masters 1000 (with Mackenzie McDonald). "This is feeling really good," said Michelsen. Goransson and Michelsen will take on No. © Copyright 1994 - 2024 ATP Tour, Inc. All Rights Reserved.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Seven of Jessica Pegula's last eight matches have gone to three sets, which begs the question: Over the course of her career, what have been her most epic matches? What an Asian swing for Jessica Pegula. It's been a productive month in China for Pegula, who helped lead the United States to the Billie Jean King Cup final in Shenzhen before making back-to-back semifinal runs in Beijing and Wuhan. Her latest three-set win came on Friday, a 2-6, 6-0, 6-3 victory over Katerina Siniakova to reach the final four in Wuhan. Speaking after the match about her recent run of dramatic matches, the World No. 6 was asked which matches over the course of her career stick out as the most memorable. "They were both really crazy, super entertaining, in a full [Arthur Ashe Stadium]," Pegula told reporters. "It was super loud, being an American. Even though I lost both of them, that atmosphere, and the level we showed, put them up there as two of the best matches." She then picked a third match, this one a win over Karolina Muchova in the 2024 US Open semis. After dropping the first set 6-1, Pegula stormed back to take the next two sets to advance to her first-ever Slam final. "Coming back in the Muchova semifinal last year was, mentally, a huge hurdle," the nine-time Hologic WTA Tour champion said. "The way I was able to close that out in three, those kinds of matches are what come to mind, just in terms of the level, the different challenges, playing great players. Just being on Ashe as an American, with the atmosphere, is something that is super special." Winning in Wuhan this weekend would also be super special. As it happens, Pegula will play Sabalenka -- who has a 20-0 record in Wuhan -- for a spot in the final. Seven of Jessica Pegula's last eight matches have gone to three sets, which begs the question: Over the course of her career, what have been her most epic matches?</p>

'Never seen anything like this before," she wrote.She topped it off by singing her heart out at a karaoke bar. Zheng is famously a karaoke queen, first telling reporters at the 2023 US Open that karaoke and rollercoasters are two of her favorite off-court pursuits.“Mostly I sing Chinese songs, slower songs,” she said.

The 20-time Grand Slam champion officially hung up his racquets at the 2022 Laver Cup, but has remained a fixture in and around the tennis world, taking part in an emotional retirement ceremony for rival Rafael Nadal at Roland Garros earlier this spring.Laver Cup Chairman Tony Godsick, who has worked with Federer since 2005, suggested last month that the former world No. 1 might be working on a larger-scale return to the sport.

It sounds terrible, ‘seniors tennis,' to us, but maybe we can create a tour, like a ‘Fedal Tour' or something like that.

"And also maybe people who are watching and who are here at the stadium, just to show how important sports is for everyday life, for happiness. I'm happy we could share centre court here in Qizhong Stadium today."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After six straight losses against Iga Swiatek, Jasmine Paolini delivered a 6-1, 6-2 masterclass to oust the No. Coming into this Dongfeng Voyah · Wuhan Open quarterfinal, she had lost all six meetings with Iga Swiatek -- and managed to win only a single set. But on a warm Friday night at the Optics Valley International Tennis Centre, Paolini changed the course of that history, stunning Swiatek 6-1, 6-2. 3 Coco Gauff in a Saturday semifinal (5 p.m. local time, 5 a.m. Gauff won the first two career meetings against Paolini (2021 Adelaide and 2023 Cincinnati) but lost the most recent three (Stuttgart, Rome and Cincinnati) -- all this season. Paolini also improved her odds of securing the final singles qualifying spot for the PIF WTA Finals in Riyadh over Elena Rybakina, who fell earlier to Aryna Sabalenka, and Mirra Andreeva. Paolini was aggressive, feeding off the pace of Swiatek's strokes. Swiatek faced six break points in the match -- and Paolini won them all. “Finally I won a match,” Paolini said in her on-court interview. Paolini announced her intent early in this one, breaking Swiatek at love with a thundering return winner. Paolini played a virtually flawless opening 26-minute frame, stroking seven winners and, incredibly, one unforced error. Paolini was up 2-0, but Swiatek scored her first break of the match to get it back on serve. But Paolini broke back -- at love -- with another fabulous return winner to take an insurmountable 3-1 lead. Last year, Paolini vaulted into stardom by reaching back-to-back finals at Roland Garros and Wimbledon. Paolini now has 26 WTA 1000 wins this year, tied for second with Sabalenka behind Swiatek's 28. Earlier, Gauff was an efficient 6-3, 6-0 winner over Laura Siegemund. The 21-year-old American returned exceptionally well, winning 27 of 45 points against Siegemund's serve and breaking her five times. “It was a pretty straightforward match,” Gauff said afterward. “She's a tricky and tough player, but I thought that I did well being patient and waiting for opportunities.” Gauff, winner of seven of eight matches in Beijing and Wuhan, leads all Hologic WTA Tour players with 15 victories in China over the past two years. After six straight losses against Iga Swiatek, Jasmine Paolini delivered a 6-1, 6-2 masterclass to oust the No.</p>

It took just three games for Beatriz Haddad Maia to deliver one of the year's most memorable moments. Playing as the top seed at the SP Open in Sao Paulo, the Brazilian produced a dazzling piece of improvisation against qualifier Miriana Tona. After a long exchange, Haddad Maia sprinted toward the baseline, slid into position and pulled off a perfectly timed tweener -- then followed it up with a clean backhand winner down the line. The crowd loved it. The commentator's immediate reaction -- “How entertaining was that?” -- said it all.

"I've known him for last couple of years," Djokovic said. He's playing for Monaco, which is a really great success, the biggest historical success for Monaco. We know we have one of the nicest and biggest tournaments in our sport there in Monaco. He kind of plays quite similar to Rinderknech, you know. And I see that they're quite close. The serve particularly reminds me of Arthur as well.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Arthur Rinderknech earned the biggest win of his career on Friday at the Rolex Shanghai Masters, where he moved past Felix Auger-Aliassime to reach his first ATP Masters 1000 semi-final. 19 Jiri Lehecka to advance to his maiden Masters 1000 quarter-final, and ensured his run would not end against World No. The Frenchman produced a high-quality display of aggressive striking and closed out the match with authority, sealing a dominant 6-3, 6-4 victory on his second match point after 87 minutes. Read more about the cousins' dream tournament. First of all, I followed my cousin," Rinderknech said, referencing qualifier Vacherot, who is set to break the Top 100 after becoming the first Monegasque player to reach a tour-level semi-final. "The whole family is following from home. We are in our own little world here. It has been incredible and today was a good performance from myself and I am happy it was straight sets, so I am not too tired for tomorrow." 37 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings and is set to rise to a career-high ranking on Monday. Rinderknech will next meet Daniil Medvedev in the last four. Auger-Aliassime had lost his serve just once all tournament before he played Rinderknech, but lost serve twice against the Frenchman. The Canadian gave Rinderknech an opening on his serve in the first set when he struck two unforced errors off the forehand and hit a double fault. The 30-year-old took his chance with a forehand pass to break and finished off a clean first set, in which he hit nine winners to just three unforced errors, on his first set point. The 30-year-old continued to play front-foot tennis in the second set and battled hard on serve, crucially saving three break points at 2-1, 0/40 to maintain his break advantage. He struck 20 winners in the match and won 85 per cent of his first-serve points, according to Infosys ATP Stats, to improve to 1-2 in his Lexus ATP Head2Head series against Auger-Aliassime. "I was stressing so much yesterday during his whole match," said Rinderknech, who watched Vacherot's three-set win against Holger Rune courtside. "I am not used to watching guys play on court and I wanted him to win so much. I didn't want to stress him. Today was a lot calmer for me on court." Vacherot was in Rinderknech's guest box and afterwards said: "It's really nice that it's happening here. I was thinking yesterday it will have been special to maybe be a bit closer to home so maybe some family would have get to come or anything. We're just not many at all, and I think we're in our little bubble doing our thing. So I am really happy that it's happening here, and we're having a lot of fun all together." Texas A&M University coach Steve Denton has been getting up in the early hours of the morning back in College Station to watch both of his former players. "As their college coach I couldn't be more proud of these two," said Denton. "A dream week for both of them and it is a testament of what college tennis can do to young players if they are all in and trust the process of just trying to improve. I have always believed in both of them that they will eventually put it together.

For the first time, Aryna Sabalenka has defeated Elena Rybakina in straight sets. Coming into the match, Sabalenka had a 7-5 head-to-head lead over Rybakina. "We have a really huge history against each other," as Sabalenka put it in her on-court interview. That was less the case this time. 1 improved her perfect record in Wuhan to 20-0, and she is now just two wins away from a fourth title in as many appearances. The US Open champion is also on an active winning streak of nine straight matches. She'll get the chance to improve those numbers even more against No. Going toe-to-toe with each other from the baseline, Sabalenka and Rybakina racked up breathtaking winners galore, coming through a pair of tight service holds each without facing break point. In this passage of play, Sabalenka was free-flowing on her forehand and sharp from defensive positions, while Rybakina's level dipped and her unforced errors mounted. Another flurry of forehand winners in a game Rybakina had led 40-0 enabled Sabalenka to steal the double break for 4-1 in the second set. Closing out the match wasn't simple. Sabalenka served three double faults over her next two service games, paving the way for Rybakina to get one of the breaks back and to hold a point to level at 4-4. But the Kazakhstani player netted a volley on that break point, enabling Sabalenka to escape once again. Having avoided the momentum shift, Sabalenka converted her first match point as Rybakina sent a forehand long in the next game.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Jessica Pegula's recent stretch of six three-set wins in seven consecutive three-set matches over the past two weeks has left many wondering how far she can go while sustaining this style of play. While that remains to be seen, a 2-6, 6-0, 6-3 win over qualifier Katerina Siniakova on Friday has carried her to the Wuhan semifinals for the first time, where she'll face Aryna Sabalenka. Jessica Pegula's recent run in China -- six three-set wins in seven consecutive three-set matches -- may not rival Wilt Chamberlain's 100-point game or Serena Williams' 39 straight Grand Slam victories, but it's impressive, nonetheless. On Friday at the Dongfeng · Voyah Wuhan Open, Pegula dropped the first set 6-2 to qualifier Katerina Siniakova in just over 30 minutes. After logging more than 15 hours on court over the past 13 days, she looked spent. She then sealed a 2-6, 6-0, 6-3 victory in 1 hour and 36 minutes to reach her first Wuhan semifinal. “I don't know,” Pegula said after the match. I definitely don't think I need to play anymore matches or work on any physical stuff because I've been able to battle through these matches and play really well. After the past couple weeks, she might want to be careful what she wishes for -- because at this rate, it just might happen. Dialing back her serve: Early in the match, Pegula appeared to be pressing more than usual. Fatigue likely played a role, as did the inspired play of Siniakova, but nerves may have crept in as well. In the first set, Pegula dropped only one point on her first serve but landed just 46% of them. In the second set, that number jumped to 80%. She lost only two points on her first serve and didn't face a single break point, compared to three in the opening set. 1, who was chasing her first WTA 1000 semifinal in singles. Siniakova earned her first pair of break points while leading 1-0 in the final set, but Pegula saved both, rallying from 15-40 down to level the set at 1-all. Pegula then reeled off 11 straight points to go up a break, but Siniakova fought back. Trailing 4-3, she had a prime opportunity to even the score. Pegula gave her another look, but Siniakova followed with an unforced error that all but sealed her fate. From a set down 🔥@JPegula reaches the final four, beating Siniakova 2-6, 6-0, 6-3.#WuhanOpen pic.twitter.com/oZoEiIOHGh It marked Pegula's 18th consecutive win against qualifiers and lucky losers, having last lost to Taylor Townsend in Rome in 2023. What's next: Pegula will compete in her third straight semifinal, following final four runs in Beijing last week and at the US Open last month. It's her eighth semifinal of 2025, with a 5-2 record in the previous seven. However, she's dropped her last two after starting the year 5-0. Pegula enters the matchup with a 2-8 career record against the singles world No.1, having lost four straight and eight of their last nine meetings. In three of the last five tournaments where Pegula has faced Siniakova, she's gone on to win the title -- including earlier this year in Bad Homburg. One thing is certain: if Pegula is to make it four out of six, she'll likely need to survive at least one more three-set battle along the way.
