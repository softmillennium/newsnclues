                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It appears the Israel-based NSO Group—a notorious peddler of powerfully invasive spyware—has been purchased by an American company. NSO, which is best known for its phone-hacking malware Pegasus, has been at the center of surveillance scandals for years. An investor group led by Hollywood producer Robert Simonds is the new owner of the hack-for-hire firm, according to Calcalist. The deal, which is said to be worth “several tens of millions of dollars,” is expected to be finalized “in the coming days, though its completion will require approval from Israel's Defense Export Control Agency (DECA) at the Ministry of Defense,” the outlet writes. NSO spokesperson Oded Hershowitz reportedly told TechCrunch that “an American investment group has invested tens of millions of dollars in the company and has acquired controlling ownership.” Hershowitz told TechCrunch: “This investment does not mean that the company is moving out of Israeli regulatory or operational control. The company's headquarters and core operations remain in Israel. It continues to be fully supervised and regulated by the relevant Israeli authorities, including the Ministry of Defense and the Israeli regulatory framework.” Gizmodo reached out to NSO Group for comment, and we'll update this story when we receive a reply. By 2018, Amnesty International was claming its staff had been hacked using the company's malware. In 2019, Facebook and WhatsApp sued NSO, accusing it of exploiting bugs in its messenger's code to allow the surveillance of app users. The lawsuit was later joined by a number of prominent tech companies, including Microsoft, Google, Cisco, and Dell, many of whom later argued that NSO's spyware victims should be able to sue the company for privacy violations. That same year, NSO was placed on a federal blacklist that forbids U.S. companies from providing resources or support to it without official government approval. Throughout this period, there have continued to be a plethora of controversies involving the company. There have also been attempts by U.S. firms to buy NSO. It's unclear what the spyware firm's future will look like under its new American owners, but it ensures that the company has a future, and puts the powerful cyber arsenal into U.S. hands—just in time for Trump's newly forming police state.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Neil Young is encouraging his listeners to reject “big corporations who have sold out America” and instead “buy local” as he announced plans this week to remove his music from Amazon. It was unclear if Young intended to pull his streaming catalog off Amazon Music or stop the e-commerce site from selling physical copies of his albums, or both. The “Heart of Gold” singer has dozens of albums available to stream on Amazon Music and his page has more than 555,000 followers. In 2022, Young pulled his music from Spotify after he was upset with that streaming platform for hosting popular podcaster Joe Rogan, who Young said was spreading Covid vaccine misinformation at the time. He returned in 2023, explaining that “music services Apple and Amazon have started serving the same disinformation podcast features I had opposed at Spotify … I cannot just leave Apple and Amazon, like I did Spotify, because my music would have very little streaming outlet to music lovers at all.” Bezos is among numerous tech leaders who offered congratulations and pledged support to President Trump after he recaptured The White House last year.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Dozens of Seattle biotech companies are using artificial intelligence to design new medical treatments. But at a conference of industry leaders and investors this week, scientists delivered a nuanced message: AI holds enormous promise, but expectations need to stay grounded in reality. The trade association Life Science Washington and investment firm Madrona hosted the one-day forum in downtown Seattle delving into biotech, pharma and AI. And yet there's a lot to be excited about. “What was science fiction 15 years ago is now reality,” said Erik Procko, chief scientist for Cyrus Biotechnology. Lazarovits and Procko were part of a panel including four Seattle startups harnessing AI. Lazarovits noted that while AI can generate exciting leads and information, it doesn't mean much until it has been tested in actual experiments with cells and organisms. AI is great for engineering new therapies, but the most costly, laborious part of the drug development process is seeing how they work in patients. “The most impactful place for AI to really change the game for drug development would be to make smaller, better powered clinical studies,” said Lajoie. “AI is fantastic these days for predicting, say, a protein structure, but for creating new drugs it hasn't yet found its killer app,” said Procko. “What is it that AI is letting us do now to make new drugs that was simply impossible to make before?

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The good news is, we now (probably) know just about everything there is to know about its upcoming Vision Pro competitor. Thanks to a comprehensive leak from Android Headlines, we now know that “Project Moohan” is probably called the Samsung Galaxy XR in the official internal lingo. One thing that caught my eye about the Samsung Galaxy XR is that, unlike Apple's Vision Pro, the headset will come with two controllers that look a lot like the ones Meta includes with its Quest 3 and 3S. Those will be coupled with an eye- and hand-tracking UI that operates like visionOS, the software inside Apple's Vision Pro. One area that it may excel in, if leaks are to be believed, is that it's a little bit lighter than the Vision Pro, clocking in at 545 grams as opposed to 600 grams. That's not a groundbreaking amount of weight to shed, but any improvement on the Vision Pro-level heft is welcome in my book. There's a lot of padding on the inside bits that rest on your forehead, which feels important if you're planning to wear it for longer periods. One of my least favorite parts of the Vision Pro is how it really weighs on your face and neck, so any added support is huge. Speaking of wearing a headset for long periods, Android Headlines' leaks suggest that the Samsung Galaxy XR has a battery life of around two-ish hours, which puts it on par with the Vision Pro. Unfortunately, it'll take an external battery pack to get there, though, just like the Vision Pro. Based on all of the almost-confirmed information we now have, I would imagine that this isn't going to be a cheap headset. I can't think of too many people who would be excited to buy a $3,500 headset. On either range, that's a lot of money to pay for a headset, even if it's as premium as leaks would suggest. Maybe Samsung will have more success selling Vision Pro-like hardware, but if I were a betting man, I'd bet that Project Moohan is going to be quite the project for Samsung indeed. New reports suggest Samsung's first-ever smart glasses might be around the corner. It's been an underwhelming year for VR headset enthusiaists, but Valve might spice things up soon. Sorry, Vision Pro lovers, looks like smart glasses are sucking up all the air. Another impressive use case for VR at a time where interest feels to be waning. Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 will be powering many flagship Android phones next year, and it has a few surprises beyond its silly name.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Meta employees still working on the Metaverse are now expected to use AI to supercharge their productivity by at least fivefold. In an internal message first reported by 404 Media, Meta's VP of Metaverse, Vishal Shah, told employees they should be using AI to boost their work performance. The note included a graphic that read, “Think 5x, not 5%.” This means prioritizing training and adoption for everyone, so that using Al becomes second nature—just like any other tool we rely on,” Shah wrote, according to 404. It wasn't that long ago when the Metaverse seemed to be CEO Mark Zuckerberg's biggest priority. The company at one point reportedly burned through nearly $50 billion on its VR division. Meta is now pouring billions into artificial intelligence projects, poaching talent from rival OpenAI, and building massive data centers in Ohio and Louisiana. The company has also repeatedly said AI will play an increasingly central role in its operations. “It's well-known that this is a priority and we're focused on using AI to help employees with their day-to-day work,” a Meta spokesperson told Gizmodo in an emailed statement. For his part, Zuckerberg told investors on a call in April that he expects by the middle of next year that AI agents “are going to be doing a substantial part of AI research and development…” In May, he reiterated that, saying they'll write most of Meta's code within the next 12 to 18 months. Now, we're getting a glimpse of how those efforts are trickling down to workers and maybe even how AI could lead to a revived Metaverse. “A 5X leap in productivity isn't about small incremental improvements, it's about fundamentally rethinking how we work, build, and innovate,” Shah wrote. He added that AI should be integrated into every “major codebase and workflow,” and said the company expects 80% of Metaverse employees to have AI integrated into their daily routines by the end of the year. He said the team could move five times faster by eliminating friction and rapidly prototyping ideas with feedback loops measured in hours, not weeks. So long as Lee is president of DC Studios, the company will not have its heroes drawn or written by AI. Nvidia previously claimed you needed its GPUs to achieve multi-frame generation. Valuations appear stretched especially for AI companies, the bank said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Instagram head Adam Mosseri said AI will change who can be creative, as the new tools and technology will give people who couldn't be creators before the ability to produce content at a certain quality and scale. However, he also admitted that bad actors will use the technology for “nefarious purposes” and that kids growing up today will have to be taught that you can't believe something just because you saw a video of it. On Threads, MrBeast had suggested that AI-generated videos could soon threaten creators' livelihoods and said it was “scary times” for the industry. Mosseri pushed back a bit at that idea, noting that most creators won't be using AI technology to reproduce what MrBeast has historically done, with his huge sets and elaborate productions; instead, it will allow creators to do more and make better content. “If you take a big step back, what the internet did, among other things, was allow almost anyone to become a publisher by reducing the cost of distributing content to essentially zero,” Mosseri explained. In addition, the exec suggested that there's already a lot of “hybrid” content on today's big social platforms, where creators are using AI in their workflow but not producing fully synthetic content. I think there's gonna be actually more in the middle than pure synthetic content for a while,” he said. As things change, Mosseri said Meta has some responsibility to do more in terms of identifying what content is AI generated. But he also noted that the way the company had gone about this wasn't the “right focus” and was practically “a fool's errand.” He was referring to how Meta had initially tried to label AI content automatically, which led to a situation where it was labeling real content as AI, because AI tools, including those from Adobe, were used as part of the process. While he didn't elaborate on what that newly added context would be, he may have been thinking about Meta's Community Notes feature, which is the crowdsourced fact-checking system launched in the U.S. this year, modeled on the one X uses. Instead of turning to third-party fact checkers, Community Notes and similar systems mark content with corrections or additional context when users who often share opposing opinions agree that a fact-check or further explanation is needed. It's likely that Meta could be weighing the use of such a system for flagging when something is AI generated but hasn't been labeled as such. (That seems like a heavy mental load for young children, but alas.) In the discussion, Mosseri also touched on other topics about the future of Instagram beyond AI, including its plans for a dedicated TV app and its newer focus on Reels and DMs as its core features (which Mosseri said just reflected user trends), and how TikTok's changing ownership in the U.S. will impact the competitive landscape. On the latter, he said that, ultimately, it's better to have competition, as TikTok's U.S. presence has forced Instagram to “do better work.” As for the TikTok deal itself, Mosseri said it's hard to parse, but it seems like how the app has been built will not meaningfully change.” Founders: Your next big connection and investor are here.Investors: Meet startups that align with your investment goals.Innovators & Visionaries: See the future of tech before everyone else.Register now and save up to $444 (or up to 30% on groups).

Microsoft has cancelled its initial plan of building a data center in Caledonia, Wisconsin, after residents and elected officials objected to the plan. “Based on the community feedback we heard, we have chosen not to move forward with this site,” Microsoft said to the publication. Microsoft's plan for the original Caledonia site, called Project Nova, was to build a 244-acre facility containing three data center structures and a 15-acre electrical substation. Data Center Dynamics reports that the company planned to construct it a little over a mile west of the We Energies Oak Creek Power Plant. Data centers are notorious for causing spikes in power bills. “I commend Microsoft for listening to the community,” Village Trustee Fran Martin told Data Center Dynamics. Microsoft is already moving forward with another data center project just south of Caledonia in Mount Pleasant. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said that it will have more performance than the current fastest supercomputer, which is likely a dig at Musk's Colossus. Given that the xAI site in Memphis, Tennessee, already uses 300 MW of power, with plans to hit 1 GW in the near future, it's safe to say that Microsoft's Wisconsin data centers could use even more electricity.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Trevor Noah is worried about where things are headed with controversial AI video generators. The comedian and former Daily Show host said AI video apps like OpenAI's Sora could be “disastrous” if they continue to use people's likenesses without permission. “But I don't think it'll end well when they're not dealing with permissions.” We caught up with Noah — Microsoft's “chief questions officer” — on Thursday after his appearance at the company's headquarters in Redmond, where he helped launch a new AI education initiative in Washington state. OpenAI last week rolled out Sora 2, a new version of its AI video-generation system that creates hyper-realistic clips from text prompts or existing footage. The new version adds a “Cameo” feature that allows users to generate videos featuring human likenesses by uploading or referencing existing photos. It's also drawn intense pushback from major Hollywood talent agencies that have criticized the software for enabling the use of a person's image or likeness without explicit consent or compensation. Meanwhile, AI-generated videos depicting deceased celebrities such as Robin Williams and George Carlin have sparked public outrage from their families. Noah told GeekWire that “this could end up being the most disastrous thing for anyone and everyone involved.” He referenced Denmark, which recently introduced legislation that would give individuals ownership of their digital likeness. “I think the U.S. needs to catch up on that ASAP,” Noah said. Kraig Baker, a Seattle-based media attorney with Davis Wright Tremaine, said the problem isn't likely to be deliberate misuse by advertisers but rather the flood of casual or careless content that includes people's likenesses, now made possible by AI. He added that the issue could be especially thorny for deceased public figures whose estates no longer actively manage image rights. But in an update, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said that the company now plans to give “rightsholders more granular control over generation of characters” and establish a revenue model for copyright holders. The surge of attention on AI video generators is creating opportunity for startups such as Loti, a Seattle company that helps celebrities, politicians, and other high-profile individuals protect their digital likeness. He said Loti's business is “booming right now,” with roughly 30X growth in signups month-over-month. Explore the latest tech, discover breakthrough solutions, and take your cloud journey further.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. According to the announcement by the Ministry of Commerce [machine translated] (via Bloomberg), TechInsights and all the other companies in its list organizations and individuals within China are prohibited “from engaging in transactions, cooperation, and other activities with the aforementioned entities, especially transmitting data or providing sensitive information to these entities.” There's also a smattering of anti-drone companies, like Dedrone and Epirus, which developed the Leonidas microwave system that can take down drone swarms. “Foreign entities such as Dedrone by Axon and TechInsights and their affiliates have defied China's strong objections to engage in activities such as so-called military-technical cooperation with Taiwan, made malicious remarks concerning China, and assisted foreign governments in suppressing Chinese companies,” China said in another statement. However, TechInsights isn't a military or defense contractor — it's primarily a semiconductor intelligence firm that specializes in reverse engineering and teardowns, plus market analysis. Although the country's semiconductor industry has taken strides in recent years, TechInsight's investigations in 2023 and 2024 revealed Huawei's reliance on technologies and chips from TSMC, Samsung, and SK hynix, which might've contradicted Beijing's strategic push for semiconductor self-reliance. Because it's located outside of China, TechInsights will likely still be able to make teardowns of Chinese tech it can acquire and publish its findings. Still, we're unsure how China's announcement will affect its business operations, especially as the company has not released any statement at the time of writing.

That would technically put it way behind a full hyperscale expansion, but this still marks a significant milestone for Nvidia's Grace Blackwell GB300, which recently set new benchmark records in inference performance. Microsoft says this cluster will be dedicated to OpenAI workloads, allowing for advanced reasoning models to run even faster and enable model training in “weeks instead of months.” At rack level, each NVL72 system is said to deliver 1,440 petaflops of FP4 Tensor performance, powered by 37 terabytes of unified “fast memory,” which breaks down to 20 TB HBM3E for the GPU, and 17 TB LPDDR5X for the Grace CPU. In the end, every single GPU becomes connected, across racks and within. The GB300 NVL72 cluster is liquid-cooled, using standalone heat exchangers and facility loops designed to minimize water usage under intense workloads. Nvidia says Microsoft needed to reimagine every layer of its data center for this deployment, and Microsoft happily points out how this is just the first of many clusters to come that will spread GB300 across the globe, taking it to full hyperscale potential. OpenAI and Microsoft already use GB200 clusters for training models, so this serves as a natural extension of their exclusive partnership. Nvidia itself is heavily invested in OpenAI, with both recently signing a Letter of Intent (LoI) for a major strategic partnership that will see the chipmaker pour $100 billion into OpenAI, progressively. On the other hand, OpenAI will use Nvidia GPUs for its next-gen AI infrastructure, deploying at least 10 gigawatts (GW) worth of accelerators, starting with Vera Rubin next year.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Now it's one of the largest industrial employers in the world with massive Unions and solidarity movements (which are good imo).Mainstream Hollywood can't use genAI in a way that doesn't get push back because like every other intentionally built industry, it's primarily focused on maintaining labor infrastructure for people who join the “entertainment industry.”Indonesia doesn't have an entire multi million person “entertainment industry” to protect, and “technology” has now lowered the barrier of entry to “hollwood style” movies.The question you should be asking is: Do movie consumers, ultimately representing the voting public for entertainment labor supply, support the industry of entertainment or do they not care and just want something to distract them?History indicates that transactional consumers don't care about any supply chain, value steam etc…or labor share of a market. This is the entire goal of transactionalisn - alienating consumers from producers through intermediaries.So if using generative technology genuinely shifts consumer preferences then thats what's going to happen.The only way out of all of these problems is if the plurality of people choose to consume based on the holistic approach to understanding externalities, system dynamics and human community development.Never going to happen.I'll be interested to see what these Indonesians come up with.

There was something on here about how anime is popular because it's actually doing new franchises instead of the same rehashed stuff, and it was absolutely right.GenAI, in the sense of being something used by financed producers, assuming it gets good enough for people to not notice too much, will much more easily fall into that trap.The real future is me, in 2045, signing on to Netflix, providing a couple inputs like talking about the type of movie I want to see, maybe a webcam recording me demonstrating some things in addition to just speaking what I want, and a GenAI generates one for me right then and there. Real people as celebrites won't exist anymore, memes will be the new celebrites: they'll all be characters other people request to see in generated movies, and their lifecycle will be about the same as Tiktok memes today. Theaters by this time will be bulldozed and have become mini nuclear power plants, with big NVIDIA logos on them. > it's primarily focused on maintaining labor infrastructure for people who join the “entertainment industry.”Draconian IP laws are part of this.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>At the Hexacon offensive security conference in Paris on Friday, Apple vice president of security engineering and architecture Ivan Krstić announced a new maximum payout of $2 million for a chain of software exploits that could be abused for spyware. In addition to individual payouts, the company's bug bounty also includes a bonus structure, adding additional awards for exploits that can bypass its extra secure Lockdown Mode as well as those discovered while Apple software is still in its beta testing phase. “We are lining up to pay many millions of dollars here, and there's a reason,” Krstić tells WIRED. Apple says that there are more than 2.35 billion of its devices active around the world. The company's bug bounty was originally an invite-only program for prominent researchers, but since opening to the public in 2020, Apple says that it has awarded more than $35 million to more than 800 security researchers. In addition to higher potential rewards, Apple is also expanding the bug bounty's categories to include certain types of one-click “WebKit” browser infrastructure exploits as well as wireless proximity exploits carried out with any type of radio. And there is even a new offering known as “Target Flags” that puts the concept of capture the flag hacking competitions into real-world testing of Apple's software to help researchers demonstrate the capabilities of their exploits quickly and definitively. Apple's bug bounty is just one of many long-term investments aimed at reducing the prevalence of dangerous vulnerabilities or blocking their exploitation. Known as Memory Integrity Enforcement, the feature is a big swing aimed at protecting a small minority of the most vulnerable and highly targeted groups around the world—including activists, journalists, and politicians—while also adding defense for all users of new devices. “You can say, well, that seems like a very large effort to protect only that very small number of users that are being targeted by mercenary spyware, but there is just this incontrovertible track record described by journalists, tech companies, and civil society organizations that these technologies are constantly being abused,” Krstić says. “And we feel a great moral obligation to defend those users. Despite the fact that the vast majority of our users will never be targeted by anything like this, this work that we did will end up increasing protection for everyone.” In your inbox: Our biggest stories, handpicked for you each day Meet the guys betting big on AI gambling agents WIRED may earn a portion of sales from products that are purchased through our site as part of our Affiliate Partnerships with retailers.
