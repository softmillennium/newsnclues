                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A research team at CiQUS (University of Santiago de Compostela, Spain) has unveiled an innovative molecular approach that enables anticancer drugs to reach the nucleus of tumor cells, where they can exert their therapeutic effect. The study focused on doxorubicin, a widely used chemotherapy agent. Prolonged exposure to this drug often leads to the emergence of resistant cells, a major clinical challenge that this strategy successfully overcomes while preserving the drug's antitumor activity. The approach builds on a simple but powerful concept: the ability of cyclic peptides -small amino acid rings- to stack and self-assemble into hollow cylindrical structures (nanotubes) on the surface of cancer cell membranes. Compared with healthy cells, cancer cell membranes contain higher levels of negatively charged lipids. The cyclic peptides used in this study display a strong affinity for these anionic surfaces, facilitating their interaction with tumor cells. As a result, the peptide–drug conjugates enter resistant cells and travel towards the nucleus, where doxorubicin intercalates with DNA to trigger its cytotoxic effect. Experimental studies confirmed that the chemical structure of the cyclic peptide is key to the formation of stable nanotubes, which in turn enhances their ability to penetrate malignant cells. Drug resistance remains one of the main obstacles in cancer therapy. Many tumors develop mechanisms to actively expel drugs, greatly limiting the efficacy of available treatments. In this context, cyclic peptides act as highly efficient delivery vehicles, capable of introducing doxorubicin into cells that would normally reject it. By combining selectivity, efficient transport, and controlled drug release, this strategy paves the way for new combination chemotherapies in which peptide-based nanotechnology could become a powerful ally against cancer.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new tool developed by Weill Cornell Medicine and the University of Adelaide investigators has enhanced the ability to track multiple gene mutations while simultaneously recording gene activity in individual cancer cells. The technology, which can now use diverse types of pathology samples and quickly process large numbers of cells, has enabled the investigators to glean new insights into how cancers evolve toward greater aggressiveness and therapy resistance. Described in a paper published Oct. 10 in Cell Genomics, the new tool, GoT-Multi, is a next-generation advance over an earlier tool called GoT (Genotyping of Transcriptomes). GoT was highly innovative but limited in detecting certain gene mutations as well as the number of mutations it could detect at once, and it was restricted to fresh or frozen tissue samples. GoT-Multi substantially overcomes those limitations and can handle tissue samples preserved with a chemical called formalin and embedded in wax -a sample type that comprises a vast scientific resource in hospital pathology labs worldwide. The researchers highlighted GoT-Multi's potential by using it to reveal new details of how a relatively indolent leukemia can evolve into an aggressive lymphoma. Dr. Anna Nam, study co-senior author, assistant professor of pathology and laboratory medicine, the Gellert Family/John P. Leonard, M.D. The study's other co-senior author was Dr. Luciano Martelotto, associate professor and team lead at the Adelaide Centre for Epigenetics, University of Adelaide. Post-doctoral fellows Dr. Minwoo Pak and Dr. Mirca Saurty-Seerunghen of Dr. Nam's laboratory co-led this work. GoT and GoT-Multi are considered "single-cell multi-omics" tools because they enable researchers to record multiple layers of information from individual cells. Overall, GoT-Multi illuminated this malignant progression as never before. The researchers now are applying GoT-Multi to a large cohort of therapy-resistant lymphomas, as well as using it to map the development of other cancers and precancerous states. They expect the insights provided by GoT-Multi to suggest new therapeutic strategies. Co-mapping clonal and transcriptional heterogeneity in somatic evolution via GoT-Multi.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>If you or someone you know may be experiencing a mental health crisis, contact the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline by dialing or texting "988.” Paige Shell was about to give up hope of getting better. The daily drip of violence, death, and misery from almost 20 years in law enforcement had left a mark. Shell, who works in a rural community about 30 miles west of Asheville, tried talk therapy, but it didn't work. When her counselor suggested ketamine-assisted psychotherapy, she was skeptical. Combining psychotherapy with low-dose ketamine, a hallucinogenic drug long used as an anesthetic, is a relatively new approach to treating severe depression and post-traumatic stress, especially in populations with high trauma rates such as firefighters, police officers, and military members. "First responders experience a disproportionately high burden of trauma and are often left without a lot of treatment options," said Signi Goldman, a psychiatrist and co-owner of Concierge Medicine and Psychiatry in Asheville, who began including ketamine in psychotherapy sessions in 2017. Law enforcement officers in the U.S., on average, are exposed to 189 traumatic events over their careers, a small study suggests, compared with two to three in an average adult's lifetime. Research shows that rates of depression and burnout are significantly higher among police officers than in the civilian population. And in recent years, more officers have died by suicide than been killed in the line of duty, according to the first-responder advocacy group First H.E.L.P. Ketamine is a dissociative drug, meaning it causes people to feel detached from their body, physical environment, thoughts, or emotions. The Food and Drug Administration approved it as an anesthetic in 1970. But starting with a 1990 animal study and followed by a landmark human trial, research has shown that low doses of ketamine can also rapidly reduce symptoms of depression. In 2019, the FDA approved esketamine — derived from ketamine and administered as a nasal spray — for treatment-resistant depression. All other forms of ketamine remain FDA-approved only for anesthesia. If used to treat psychiatric disorders, it must be prescribed off-label. Krystal has studied the effect of ketamine on veterans and active-duty military members — a population comparable to first responders in their exposure to trauma. While research shows strong evidence of ketamine's antidepressant effects, he said further studies are needed on its potential role in PTSD treatment. The regulatory environment for ketamine also remains a concern, Krystal said. State oversight varies, and federal regulations don't outline dosing, administration methods, safety protocols, or training for providers. In this regulatory patchwork, more than 1,000 ketamine clinics have sprung up across the country. Side effects of ketamine can range from nausea and blood pressure spikes to suppressed breathing. "Being on a psychedelic puts people in an extremely vulnerable state," Goldman said. People can get retraumatized as they relive disturbing memories. With proper precautions — and when other treatments have failed — Rick Baker thinks ketamine-assisted psychotherapy is a good fit for first responders. As a population, first responders are more resistant than civilians to traditional therapy, said Baker, who is a licensed clinical mental health counselor. Ketamine provides a potential shortcut into the trauma memory and works "like an accelerant to psychotherapy," he said. When used for mental health treatment, a dose of ketamine — typically half a milligram per kilogram of body weight, less than for anesthesia — creates a mildly altered state of consciousness, Goldman said. The ketamine sessions in her practice are usually two hours long, and clients are under the drug for about 45 minutes. The drug is short-acting, meaning its dissociative effects largely wear off within about an hour. But most insurers won't pick up the cost of ketamine-assisted psychotherapy, which can be more than $1,000 per session for the IV drip. The Department of Veterans Affairs covers some forms of ketamine treatment, including ketamine-assisted psychotherapy, for eligible veterans on a case-by-case basis. In Shell's case, a donation made to Responder Support Services covered what her insurance wouldn't when she decided this spring to try ketamine-assisted psychotherapy with Baker, her counselor. Revisiting the most gruesome calls in her nearly two decades as a police officer was not something Shell wanted to do. But Hurricane Helene, which caused catastrophic flooding in western North Carolina last year, pushed the 41-year-old "over the edge," she said. The badly mangled victim in a fatal car crash. Under ketamine, the images came to life as still pictures, she said, like a surreal slideshow replaying some of her darkest memories. "Then I would sit there and cry like a baby." As of early October, Shell had undergone 12 ketamine sessions. They have not provided a sudden miraculous cure, she said. She was hesitant to share her experience within her department because of the ongoing stigma associated with seeking help in the hard-charging police culture. Many cops are used to ketamine as an illegal street drug, she said, or think of it as a counterculture psychedelic. Few if any police departments provide clear guidance on ketamine-assisted psychotherapy. Shell ultimately shared her story with colleagues, most of whom were curious and supportive, and she now encourages other officers to speak up about their struggles. "It's hard to help other people when you can't take care of yourself," she said. Discover how Discovery Life Sciences enhances genomics research with cloud-based platforms like DNAnexus.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Recent research has revealed new information on genetic, environmental, and other factors that influence risk, and projects funded through the recently announced National Institute of Health's Autism Data Science Initiative (ASDI) could further clarify the disorder's complex origins. ASD continues to be more common in boys than girls (ratio 3.4:1). Children born in 2018 were more likely to be diagnosed by age 48 months compared with those born in 2014, suggesting increased early identification consistent with historical patterns. Together, these shifts mean children who may have been overlooked in previous decades are now being identified. Other potential drivers include increasing paternal age (and to a lesser extent maternal age), which is a known risk factor: older fathers tend to accumulate more de novo mutations in sperm. In addition, more preterm or low-birth-weight infants are surviving now than decades ago; prematurity is itself a risk factor for neurodevelopmental differences. One study cited in the Trump administration's report was a comprehensive review of 46 studies that showed that the overall body of evidence is consistent with an association between prenatal acetaminophen exposure and increased neurodevelopmental diagnoses, including ASD. However, the researchers noted that “observational limitations preclude definitive causation.” The report also pointed to results from a Johns Hopkins or NIH-funded study that measured cord-blood acetaminophen metabolites, which is an objective exposure marker. Researchers found higher metabolite levels were associated with an increased likelihood of subsequent attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or autism diagnoses but noted that the pattern was dose-dependent and highlighted that only one measurement of cord-blood acetaminophen levels, taken at birth, was used in the analysis. Meanwhile, the largest, most rigorous epidemiological study to date showed no effect of prenatal acetaminophen exposure and ASD risk after accounting for family confounding — factors shared within families, such as genetics and environment, that could potentially influence neurodevelopmental outcomes. This 2024 Swedish study of 2.4 million children (1995-2019) included sibling data to control for genetic and environmental factors. The researchers found no relationship between in utero exposure to acetaminophen and subsequent diagnoses of autism, ADHD, or intellectual disability. This suggests there is no causal link between acetaminophen and autism, they wrote. Methodological concerns also exist in studies that do report a link. In a practice advisory published in late September, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists highlighted recurring issues, including reliance on self-reported use (recall bias), inconsistent outcome measures, limited data on dose or timing, failure to fully control genetic or familial factors, and potential confounding by the indications for acetaminophen use, such as fever, infection, or pain — which themselves can influence neurodevelopment. Not using it judiciously and when needed may actually increase risks to pregnant women and their babies,” David Mandell, ScD, with the Coalition of Autism Scientists and Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, told Medscape Medical News. Decades of high-quality evidence has shown that vaccines do not cause autism. A large Danish cohort of 657,461 children showed no increased autism risk after measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine (fully adjusted hazard ratio, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.85-1.02), and no signal in children with autistic siblings and other high-risk subgroups or specific postvaccine time windows. A US claims-based cohort of roughly 95,000 children showed that even among children who have an older sibling with autism, MMR was not associated with ASD risk. After thimerosal was removed from nearly all US childhood vaccines, a study from California showed that autism diagnoses continued to rise in the state — contradicting the hypothesis that thimerosal was a contributing factor. Early symptoms of autism often emerge around the same age routine vaccines are administered. This claim was further fueled by a study from the 1990s which sparked widespread concern and eroded trust in vaccines. That study was formally retracted and exposed as fraudulent, but its narrative lingers. Recent research has identified four biologically and clinically distinct subtypes of autism, each with associated genetic signals. Children in all four classes had a significant burden of common and rare genetic variants, but researchers found differing signals that defined each autism subtype. These four subtypes also differed in terms of the genetic variants' effects on brain development. “With advances in genetic technology and analytic methods, hundreds of specific genetic changes have now been identified and are commonly accepted to cause autism,” Alexander Kolevzon, MD, clinical director of the Seaver Autism Center at Mount Sinai in New York City, told Medscape Medical News. Yet twin studies have shown that if one identical twin has autism, the other may not about 10% of the time, “leaving room for some environmental influence,” Kolevzon said. However, despite being an active area of study, no widespread environmental effects have been reliably established to date,” he added. In April 2025, a meta-analysis of 202 studies including more than 56 million mother-child pairs showed that children born to mothers with gestational diabetes were 25% more likely to be diagnosed with autism. Researchers have also linked autism risk to preterm birth and advanced parental age. It's thought that these exposures likely act as modifiers — influencing gene expression, immune activation, or neuronal development — rather than standalone causes. “There have been several studies showing that there is gut dysbiosis in autism, and that it correlates with autism symptoms,” Lisa Aziz-Zadeh, PhD, professor, Department of Psychology, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, told Medscape Medical News. “However, we know that any behavioral differences must be via gut microbiome or metabolite interactions with the human nervous system,” she said. This points to a “mechanistic model by which gut metabolites may impact autism,” she said. Interventions targeting gut imbalances — such as dietary changes, probiotics, prebiotics, or fecal transplants — could potentially be beneficial, said Aziz-Zadeh. More research must be done to answer this question, she added. As the recipients of ADSI grants begin their work, the initiative's $50 million investment holds promise for uncovering new insights into autism's causes and mechanisms. By supporting these diverse research projects, ADSI aims to deepen understanding of ASD and ultimately guide more effective strategies for diagnosis, intervention, and care. Among the 13 funded projects is one examining how causal inference – the use of data to examine causal relationships – can be used to study early-life factors that may cause autism, influence prevalence, or explain variations in traits and functioning among individuals with autism. “We are bringing in newer techniques from causal inference that do a better job of teasing apart cause from association,” principal investigator Amy Cochran, PhD, assistant professor, Departments of Population Health Sciences and Mathematics, University of Wisconsin-Madison, told Medscape Medical News. “We want to generate stronger evidence about the early-life factors that may — or may not — be contributing to autism, and how they shape the diverse experiences of autistic people, so we can better prioritize public health resources and interventions,” Cochran added. “If long-term clinical outcome of a genetic disorder is influenced by an environmental factor, that represents a condition that could be modified to improve outcomes,” principal investigator Jonathan Sebat, PhD, professor of psychiatry and cellular and molecular medicine, University of California San Diego (UCSD), told Medscape Medical News. Sebat's lab at UCSD has pioneered genetic approaches to identify autism genes. “We were one of two groups that first showed how a father's age causes mutations in sperm and we have since unraveled a variety of genetic factors that explain the effect of parental age on autism risk,” Sebat said. “So this grant gives us an opportunity to expand this work to rigorously determine which environmental factors have real causal effects, and what are the mechanisms.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Researchers have uncovered a surprising link between everyday soft drink habits and mental health, revealing that even moderate soda consumption could alter gut microbes in ways that heighten depression risk, especially among women. Study: Soft Drink Consumption and Depression Mediated by Gut Microbiome Alterations. Consumption of soft drinks is linked to obesity, diabetes, heart disease, stroke, and cancer. They are also associated with increased rates of depression. A recent study published in JAMA Psychiatry examined how soft drinks were related to depression. Soft drinks are wildly popular worldwide, especially among children and teenagers. They are loaded with empty calories, mostly simple sugars like glucose and fructose, which push up blood glucose levels. In addition, soft drinks present too much sugar for the intestine to absorb. Unabsorbed sugar promotes the proliferation of specific bacterial genera. The increased abundance of pro-inflammatory bacteria promotes systemic inflammation and neuroinflammation, which is linked to anxiety and learning deficits, especially among teenagers. Conversely, a diet that promotes the production of anti-inflammatory short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) by ‘good' gut bacteria protects the gut barrier and counters inflammation. A higher soft drink intake is linked to an increased risk of depression, as shown by prior studies. Surprisingly, this is not true of high-sugar solid foods. Fecal microbiota transplants from depressed people can induce depressive-like symptoms in rodents. Several bacteria, like Atopium, Eggerthella, and Bifidobacterium, have been reported to be more abundant in major depression than healthy controls. Further analysis has narrowed down the culprits to Eggerthella and Hungatella. Increased sugar in the gut may benefit Eggerthella by providing additional food. Eggerthella is a gram-positive anaerobic bacterium usually found at low levels in the healthy gut and associated with major depression. The German study included a group of 405 patients diagnosed with major depressive disorder (MDD) and 527 healthy controls. Multivariable regression and analysis of variance (ANOVA) models were used to identify associations between major depression, symptom severity, and soft drinks. Mediation analyses also explored the link between the gut microbes Eggerthella and Hungatella and soft drink consumption. The odds of major depression were about 8% higher per unit increase in soft drink intake. These associations were driven by women participants, who had ~16% higher odds of major depression. In contrast, men failed to show any association. Patients with depression had a higher mean body mass index (BMI) compared to controls. Interestingly, women who drank more soft drinks had a higher abundance of Eggerthella. An increase in Eggerthella abundance in female patients and controls partly mediated the association of depression with soft drink intake. Moreover, the gut microbiome in women with depression was less diverse overall and showed less evenness of species distribution, with some species dominating the others. This study is important in that it used a clinically diagnosed group of patients with depression, rather than including individuals who self-reported themselves as depressed. The authors noted that the observed effects were statistically small but may still be meaningful given how widely soft drinks are consumed. The effects attributable to soft drink consumption may be small but are easy to manipulate and wide-ranging in their reach. They also support policies restricting the marketing and availability of soft drinks since physical activity alone cannot compensate for soft drink intake. Notably, moderate consumption, one or two soft drinks daily, has been associated with poorer health outcomes. These drinks should not be advertised to children, but support policies limiting soft drink availability. Taxation has reduced soft drink consumption and obesity rates in the UK. However, it has driven up the sales of artificially sweetened drinks, which were not separately analyzed in this study and may also warrant further research. Still, these findings highlight the need to interrupt the cycle of soft drink consumption and depression, especially since both impair normal metabolism. It is cautioned that the relationship might be bidirectional; people with depression could consume more soft drinks, so causality cannot be confirmed from this observational study. “Education, prevention strategies, and policies aiming to reduce soft drink consumption are urgently required to mitigate depressive symptoms.” Further interventions that alter the gut microbiome should also be tested. However, the authors emphasize that more research, including randomized trials, is needed to establish whether reducing soft drink intake can directly lower depression risk. Dr. Liji Thomas is an OB-GYN, who graduated from the Government Medical College, University of Calicut, Kerala, in 2001. She has counseled hundreds of patients facing issues from pregnancy-related problems and infertility, and has been in charge of over 2,000 deliveries, striving always to achieve a normal delivery rather than operative.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Except for one key aspect, the setup is a familiar one in medicine: An expert diagnostician presents a particularly challenging case to a roomful of colleagues, carefully walking them through the patient's symptoms and initial test results. The physician explains her reasoning in detail as she breaks down the case and every possibility she considered, aided by a slide deck. This time, the physician in question is an artificial intelligence system called Dr. CaBot. Dr. CaBot's ability to spell out its "thought process" rather than focusing solely on reaching an accurate answer distinguishes it from other AI diagnostic tools. It is also one of only a few models designed to tackle more complex medical cases. "We wanted to create an AI system that could generate a differential diagnosis and explain its detailed, nuanced reasoning at the level of an expert diagnostician," said Arjun (Raj) Manrai, assistant professor of biomedical informatics in the Blavatnik Institute at HMS. Manrai created Dr. CaBot with Thomas Buckley, a Harvard Kenneth C. Griffin School of Arts and Sciences doctoral student and a member of the Manrai lab. Although the system is not yet ready for use in the clinic, Manrai and his team have been providing demonstrations of Dr. CaBot at Boston-area hospitals. Now, Dr. CaBot has a chance to prove itself by going head-to-head with an expert diagnostician in The New England Journal of Medicine's famed Case Records of the Massachusetts General Hospital, also known as clinicopathological conferences, or CPCs. The resulting medical case discussion, published Oct. 8 in NEJM, offers a window into Dr. CaBot's capabilities, showcasing its usefulness for medical educators and students - and hinting at its potential for physicians in the clinic. As the researchers continue to improve Dr. CaBot, they hope that it will serve as a useful model for other medical-AI teams around the world. The concept of CPCs dates back to the late 1800s, when physicians at Massachusetts General Hospital began using patient case studies for medical education. They're known to be extremely challenging, filled with distractions and red herrings." Arjun (Raj) Manrai, Assistant Professor, Biomedical Informatics, Blavatnik Institute, HMS Then, an expert not involved in the case is invited to give a presentation to colleagues at Mass General explaining their reasoning, step-by-step, and providing a differential diagnosis before homing in on the most likely possibility. The Oct. 8 NEJM article includes a typical case presentation along with a carefully reasoned differential diagnosis from expert diagnostician Gurpreet Dhaliwal of San Francisco Veterans Affairs Medical Center and the University of California, San Francisco, whom Manrai describes as "a real, modern Dr. Manrai and Buckley were encouraged to see that although Dr. CaBot reasoned through the case differently than Dhaliwal, it reached a comparable final diagnosis. During graduate school, Manrai became fascinated by how CPCs demystify the process that physicians use to arrive at a diagnosis. They reminded him of the mystery novels he enjoyed growing up. More recently, his lab and others have studied the accuracy of AI models for providing patient diagnoses. Manrai wondered whether it was possible to design a system that could go further. The core of Dr. CaBot is OpenAI's o3 large language reasoning model. One is Dr. CaBot's ability to efficiently search millions of clinical abstracts from high-impact journals, which helps it properly cite its work and avoid factual hallucinations. Dr. CaBot can also search its "brain" of several thousand CPCs and use these examples to replicate the style of an expert diagnostician in NEJM. The team is working closely with clinician collaborators at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and other Harvard-affiliated hospitals to continue refining the system. The presentations are "surprisingly lifelike," Buckley said, complete with filler words like "um," "uh," and "you know" as well as colloquial phrases. The other is a detailed written version of Dr. CaBot's reasoning and diagnosis. The researchers are eager for physicians to engage with Dr. CaBot and provide expert feedback. To this end, they are planning more demonstrations at local hospitals, and they published a paper describing the system on a preprint server. They see the NEJM CPC as another opportunity for input. Dr. CaBot is also available online, where users can test the system on new cases for educational and research purposes, and review presentations and write-ups for 15 existing cases ranging from "A Newborn Girl With Skin Lesions" to "An 89-Year-Old Man With Progressive Dyspnea." "We're really trying to stick our necks out," Manrai said. Although the primary use case for Dr. CaBot is as an educational tool, its ability to rapidly sift through millions of clinical abstracts could also make it a valuable research aid. According to Manrai and Buckley, the tool would need further improvement, validation, and the addition of patient privacy protections before it could be considered for implementation in real-world settings. However, the team noted that physicians are already expressing interest. The advantages of an AI system are that it is always available, doesn't get tired, isn't juggling responsibilities, and can quickly search vast quantities of medical literature, they said. Manrai added that there's evidence physicians are using AI tools "in amounts that I think would surprise a lot of folks," including ChatGPT and a physician-specific platform called OpenEvidence. "We're very nascent in human-AI collaboration," Manrai said, but the field is evolving rapidly. Eventually, Dr. CaBot might join the AI toolbox that physicians are already exploring as they determine how to best help their patients. Dhaliwal, G., et al.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Everywhere you go, you carry a population of microbes in your gastrointestinal tract that outnumber the human cells making up your body. This microbiome has important connections to health in your gut, brain and immune system. Some resident bugs produce vitamins, antioxidants, nutrients and other helpful compounds. Even those whose direct effects seem neutral take up space that makes it harder for harmful microbes to move in. New discoveries from a research team at the California NanoSystems Institute at UCLA, or CNSI, offer a promising step in that direction. The scientists investigated a known mechanism that changes genes in microbes, driven by what are called diversity-generating retroelements. Effectively, they accelerate evolution in their hosts, enabling microbes to change and adapt. DGRs are more common in the gut microbiome than any other environment on Earth where they've been measured. However, their role in the gut has not been investigated until now. They found that about one-quarter of those microbes' DGRs target genes vital for latching on to grow colonies in new surroundings. The researchers also demonstrated that DGRs travel well: They can transfer from one strain of bacterium to others nearby, and infants inherit DGRs from their mothers that seem to aid in starting up the gut microbiome. It's a highly dynamic system intimately connected with human physiology, and this knowledge about DGRs could one day be applied for engineering beneficial microbiomes that promote good health." Jeff F. Miller, Professor, Microbiology, Immunology and Molecular Genetics, UCLA Changes in the gut microbiome have been linked to inflammatory bowel disease, Crohn's disease, metabolic syndrome, colon cancer and - more distantly - conditions such as anxiety, depression and autism. "The developing microbiome is connected to our developing immune system, and that primes us for the rest of our lives," said first and co-corresponding author Ben Macadangdang, a UCLA Health neonatologist and an assistant professor of pediatrics at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA. "When the microbiome is disrupted, we see higher rates of chronic disease later in life. In a single spot in the genome, which varies from case to case, DGRs replace the letter A from the four-letter alphabet that makes up DNA, adding a C, G or T in that spot. Changes to binding proteins can expand their repertoire for interaction, so DGRs accelerate evolution in a way that expand microbes' capabilities. This system can be compared to a more-familiar method through which biology remixes proteins: the production of new antibodies by the human immune system to expand the roster of invaders it can recognize. But by contrast, each immune cell that recombines antibodies does so only once, while DGRs can introduce mutations over and over in the same cell. DGRs are also a far more powerful engine for broadening variety. By contrast, it would take 270 million Empire State Buildings to hold grains of sand equal to the unique variations of DGR-mutated proteins. In this population, DGRs were plentiful, with an average of one per strain and some strains carrying up to five. They were also varied, with more than 1,100 unique DGRs identified. Pili act together like the fibers in Velcro, enabling the bacteria to anchor themselves to other microbes or onto surfaces. This suggests DGRs have an important role in Bacteroides' adapting to new locations, including the unique environment of each person's gut microbiome. "A bacterium may be optimized for one person's gut, but if it goes out and tries to colonize someone else, it encounters a very different environment. Finding something new to bind to gives the bacteria an advantage, and we think that's why we see so many DGRs within the microbiome." The study also found that DGRs can hop from one strain of bacteria to another through a process called horizontal transfer. In that way, microbes seem to share their adaptive superpower within the larger community surrounding them. In offspring, the researchers pinpointed changes to DNA for Bacteriodes' pili proteins, indicating that DGRs altered the bugs to help set up shop in their new home. This finding suggests DGRs are one mechanism important for establishing the developing microbiome. They believe that the insights in the current study may be a jumping-off point for future discoveries that improve human health, or even yield new methods for genetic engineering. "There are so many questions that this raises, we're just realizing how much we don't know about DGRs in the microbiome, or what exploiting them for applications could yield. I've never been more excited about what's going to come next." Umesh Ahuja, a UCLA research associate, is co-corresponding author of the study. Other co-authors are Yanling Wang, Cora Woodward, Jessica Revilla, Bennett Shaw, Kayvan Sasaninia, Gillian Varnum and Sara Makanani, all of UCLA; and Chiara Berruto of Caltech.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Scientists have discovered that mental health patients who have skin conditions may be more at risk of worse outcomes, including suicidality and depression. This work, which may aid in identifying at-risk patients and personalising psychiatric treatment, is presented at the ECNP meeting in Amsterdam. The researchers looked at 481 patients with a first episode of psychosis (which is the first time an individual experiences a psychotic episode, such as loss of contact with reality, hallucinations and delusions). On testing, 14.5% were found to have dermatological symptoms (24% female, 9.8% male) such as rash, itching, photosensitivity, etc. We found that just 7% of the patients without the initial skin conditions had suicidal thoughts or attempts, in contrast, around 25% of the patients with initial skin conditions had suicidal thoughts or attempts. Initial skin conditions are also linked to greater depression and poorer well-being at follow-up. This discovery suggests that the presence of skin conditions indicates that these patients are more at risk for worse outcomes than patients who do not have skin conditions after a first episode of psychosis".The researchers note that, if confirmed, this finding has the potential to act as an advance marker for mental health risk, similar to the way, a blood test might indicate a greater risk of cancer or heart disease.The brain and the skin both derive from the same embryonic origin - the ectoderm - prompting the researchers to investigate the relation between the skin and mental health.Dr Galvañ continued:"It was already known that between 30% and 60% of people with skin conditions show psychiatric symptoms. What we have done is look at things from the opposite direction; do people with mental health problems have skin conditions, and if so, can this tell us anything useful? Our findings suggest that dermatological symptoms may represent a marker of illness severity and poor short-term outcomes in the early stages of psychosis, potentially identifying a subgroup of patients with a poorer clinical prognosis who may benefit from early tailored interventions. The reason for the connection is still unclear, but our working hypothesis is that this may be due to the skin and neurological systems having common developmental origins and inflammatory pathways; but this needs to be confirmed. As far as we know this is the first study to show this link in patients with psychosis, so we need follow-up studies to confirm the finding. We also need to understand if this link applies also to a range of other psychiatric conditions, such as bipolar disorder, ADHD, anxiety or depression".Commenting, Professor Eric Ruhe (Professor of Difficult-to-Treat Depression at Radboud University, the Netherlands) said:"This is an interesting association between skin problems and a first episode of psychosis. These results need replication in different cohorts but might indeed show a new link between skin and psychopathology.
