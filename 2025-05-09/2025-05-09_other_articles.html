When XYZ Films' Swedish sci-fi adventure movie "Watch the Skies" has its American debut on May 9, 2025, Hollywood and fans will also get a remarkable look at its AI-driven TrueSynch “visual dubbing” administered by the British startup firm Flawless AI. This nostalgic feature film is set in 1996 and focuses on a small town teenage girl named Denise, whose father mysteriously vanished one night years ago while investigating a flying saucer sighting in the nearby forested hills. Directed by Victor Danell for his Crazy Pictures production shingle, "Watch the Skies" will be the first flick to demonstrate this immersive technology, where the film's original Swedish-speaking cast has re-recorded their lines in English for AI tools to match lip movements. Once foreign films leave their home territory, an immediate language barrier exists. This pioneering new AI technology of "visual dubbing" opens up a whole new way to release and introduce their Swedish film (and countless others) to a far wider audience and helps retain the actors' screen performances. And that's something we wanted to bring into the movie, because it's a bunch of outsiders that want to solve this big mystery, but they also just want to be together having Fika, coffee, and tarts." "We all grew up in the '80s and '90s with these old-fashioned sci-fi movies as our base in our filmmaking," he adds regarding project influences. "Who doesn't love early Steven Spielberg and films like that? Breaking space news, the latest updates on rocket launches, skywatching events and more! "Not only that, but their headquarters are across the street from my apartment. So we just went down the street and knocked on the door and asked if we could come in to learn about their work. So we all sat down for Swedish Fika and they told us that they're a UFO investigation group and if you see something in the sky you can call them and they'll help find out what you saw. We just needed to find a story that could take these lovely guys out on an adventure larger than they usually went on." "Watch the Skies" is imbued with a heartfelt reality even though its story is rooted in paranormal events, and its striking cinematography enhances a certain retro appeal. "The cinematographer is Hannes Krantz, one of our partners in Crazy Pictures. Actually, I built the lenses for this movie myself. "Sweden doesn't do a lot of genre movies. We went into this thinking it would be quite hard to make a Swedish science fiction movie. I think the Swedish audience also is ready for one so it went quite easily. But it's still hard to make a good sci-fi movie. We're so excited to see what will happen with this movie. "Watch the Skies" stars Inez Dahl Torhaug, Eva Melander, Jesper Barkselius, Sara Shirpey, Håkan Ehn, Isabelle Kyed, Niklas Kvarnbo Jönsson, and Mathias Lithner.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The unusual claim comes from content creator Maverick Bailey, known for his unconventional takes, who believes major events have strangely coincided with the launch of certain Mountain Dew flavors. Bailey also connected other flavors to the Maui wildfires and the global CrowdStrike blackout that crippled millions of Windows devices last year. Now, he's sounding the alarm over Mountain Dew's upcoming flavor, Baja Midnight, set to launch this summer. 'This new flavor could be referring to the Witching Hour, which is at 12:00,' Bailey shared in an Instagram video. 'My guess is that we are going to see something very weird, on a paranormal level, or something that is going to make us question everything.' He added that it could even signal a devastating cyber blackout. Now, he's sounding the alarm over Mountain Dew's upcoming flavor, Baja Midnight, set to launch this summer Mountain Dew commented on Bailey's Instagram video discussing the wild theory, saying: 'Keep your voice down.' While Mountain Dew made a joke about the theory, there is no evidence to support any of Bailey's claims Bailey shared his latest update on The Maverick Files, where he outlined connections he's drawn between Mountain Dew flavors and major disasters. He pointed to Code Red that launched in May 2001, just months before the 9/11 attacks—an event widely referred to as a 'Code Red' emergency. In 2019, Mountain Dew introduced Maui Burst, a pineapple-flavored soda. Bailey claims it foreshadowed the 2023 wildfires that devastated Maui. While the devastating event happened in 2023, years after the flavor hit shelves, Bailey and other conspiracy theorists are sure there is a link. He pointed to Code Red that launched in May 2001, just months before the 9/11 attacks—an event widely referred to as a 'Code Red' emergency On August 8, 2023, high winds and dry weather caused wildfires to develop in Lāhainā, Upper Kula, Upper Makawao and Olinda on the island of Maui. These wildfires affected approximately 1,550 parcels and 2,200 structures and were one of the deadliest US wildfires in at least the past 100 years. At least 201 people were confirmed dead as a result. Bailey claims it foreshadowed the 2023 wildfires that devastated Maui.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>SCIENTISTS are studying a mysterious "UFO orb" which landed in Colombia and is said to be "alien". Boffins released X-ray images of the mind-boggling sphere, after witnesses claimed to have seen it flying over the town of Buga in March. It was said to have been zig-zagging through the skies in an unconventional flying pattern. The "UFO sphere" was reportedly recovered shortly after landing. It has since been analysed by scientists who have now revealed their groundbreaking research on the "extraterrestrial item". They discovered that it featured three layers of metal-like material and 18 micro-spheres inside which surrounded a central nucleus. Scientists are calling this core "a chip". A radiologist who examined the sphere Dr Joe Luis Velazquez said that they found "no welds or joints", which usually indicate human production. "More testing is needed to establish its origin." These included runes, Ogham and Mesopotamian writing systems. The object was recovered on March 2 by a group of people who said it weighed about four and a half pounds. He also said the man who found and touched it, Jose, felt sick for days after touching the alien sphere. Velez el Potro said: "When I poured water on it, it started to smoke and the water vaporised instantly." There are yet to be any official reports or scientific analysis to confirm claims of a sphere falling over Buga - only eyewitness reports. Velez el Potro added the government contacted him to hand over the sphere, but he refused, arguing that it would "never be seen again". Researchers found that the sphere had irregular edges which indicated "that it is a solid object". Perhaps the most striking was a video known as the 'Tic-Tac' – which showed an unidentified object being pursued by fighter planes. While flying off the coast of California 2004, two pilots from the USS Nimitz on a routine training mission spotted an object "shaped like a 40ft Tic Tac sweet". Then in 2005, a veteran pilot of an F/A - 18 fighter aircraft witnessed a raft of strange objects in the sky during a training exercise off the coast of Florida. Tragically the pursuit of UFOs has also claimed lives, notably that of US Air Force Captain Thomas Mantell. Other encounters with the air force include a claim that UFOs disabled weapons at a nuclear base. Captain Robert Salas said the bizarre incident unfolded in 1967 while he was the on-duty commander of a secret underground launch control facility at Montana's Malmstrom Air Force Base. Two airmen, Staff Sgt Jim Penniston and Airman John Burroughs, claim they got so close to a triangular craft they actually touched it. Earlier this year, US military documents were released showing how a warship was shadowed by two "ball of light" UFOs deepening the mystery around the case. But the scientists still need a full composition analysis to confirm this. Boffins are currently referring to the 18 points as "a chip" due to their precise arrangement and location within the spherical object. The team also observed a central band composed of a different material, which contained more small spheres. They think that these may have been placed inside before the object was sealed. But the X-rays did not reveal any visible signs of assembly techniques by humans.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Boys has been igniting rumors of a Supernatural reunion since Soldier Boy's inclusion in The Boys season 3, but now that they are confirmed, I'm amazed by how good it sounds. Kripke had secretly been one of TV's most hilarious writers and showrunners for decades, long before The Boys rose to prominence. Launching in 2005, Supernatural managed to run until 2020, presenting America's longest-running live-action fantasy TV show. Knowing that The Boys was due to end in season 5, I was watching season 4 anxiously for a sign of the Supernatural reunion I've been longing for since Jensen Ackles joined the cast. Kripke has confirmed to TV Insider that the Supernatural reunion of everyone's dreams will include not just Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki, but also Misha Collins. Some were even hoping for Collins to join the proceedings. Collins played Castiel, an angel who was the Winchesters' ally from Supernatural season 4 to its final, epic season, ending on November 19, 2020. In his interview with TV Insider, Kripke did not reveal the parts that Padalecki and Collins will play in The Boys season 4, but they will inevitably be wickedly appropriate. Ackles is incredible as Soldier Boy, and I can't wait to see his old chemistry with Padalecki and Collins fired back up. I'm even more intrigued to see which absurd subversion of American culture and superhero tropes Kripke will be pasting onto this trio. I can see Padalecki playing a supe opposite Ackles in The Boys. If anyone is capable of performing such blatant fan service in a way that slots perfectly into the plot of season 5, it is Kripke. Soldier Boy's appearance in Gen V proved his ongoing importance to the overall The Boys franchise, so Kripke clearly has no intention of sidelining him in season 5. Ackles' role will get bigger, as it seems that Homelander may wake him up from his slumber. The Boys franchise is a satirical and dark superhero series based on the comic book by Garth Ennis and Darick Robertson. It explores a world where superheroes, or "Supes," are corrupt, violent, and morally bankrupt, all controlled by the powerful corporation Vought International.

Share your opinions in the thread below and remember to keep it respectful. The Last of Us is back this week on HBO and Max with season 2, episode 5. Here's exactly when and how you can watch the show on TV or streaming. Doctor Who's villain arcs are often clear and quick, but Russell T. Davies has really taken his time with this very minor character's development. Jun-ho didn't have much to do after the beginning of Squid Game season 2, but he will now finally reach the island and confront his brother. The Handmaid's Tale season 6, episode 7 has introduced an all-new character, and here's who she is and why she is so important to the show. Piper ended up backing out of her original Thailand plans in The White Lotus season 3, which would have resembled a season 1 character's story. As Doctor Who season 15 returned to Earth in episode 4, "Lucky Day", the series may have addressed why humans can never remember alien incursions.</p>

Indeed, under the communist regime, citizens were removed from society before they could cause harm to it. This removal, which often entailed a trip to the labor camp from which many did not return, took place in a manner that deprived the accused of due process. In many cases, the mere suspicion or even hint that an act against the regime might occur was enough to earn a one way ticket with little to no recourse. The U.K. government has decided to chase this chimera by investing in a program that seeks to preemptively identify who might commit murder. Currently, the program is in its research stage, with similar programs being used for the context of making probation decisions. First, the output of such programs is not error free, meaning it might wrongly implicate people. Second, we will never know if a prediction was incorrect because there's no way of knowing if something doesn't happen — was a murder prevented, or would it never have taken place remains unanswerable? Third, the program can be misused by opportunistic actors to justify targeting people, especially minorities — the ability to do so is baked into a bureaucracy. In doing so, it offers the advantages of efficiency and fairness — no one is supposed to get preferential treatment. But mistakes happen, and navigating the labyrinth of bureaucratic procedures to rectify them is no easy task. The algorithm, in turn, was fueled by what could be easily measured (e.g., test scores) rather than the effectiveness of teaching (a poor performing student improved significantly or how much teachers helped students in non quantifiable ways). If a potential future murderer is preemptively arrested, "Minority Report"-style, how can we know if the person may have decided on their own not to commit murder? As such, the use of algorithms creates what journalist Dan Davies calls an "accountability sink" — it strips accountability by ensuring that no one person or entity can be held responsible, and it prevents the person affected by a decision from being able to fix mistakes. This creates a twofold problem: An algorithm's estimates can be flawed, and the algorithm does not update itself because no one is held accountable. But this is an idealistic view that does not even hold true in science; scientists can resist updating a theory or schema, especially when they are heavily invested in it. To use an algorithm in an attempt to predict who is at risk of committing murder is perplexing and unethical. Not only could it be inaccurate, but there's no way to know if the system was right. In other words, if a potential future murderer is preemptively arrested, "Minority Report"-style, how can we know if the person may have decided on their own not to commit murder? We're already seeing similar systems being used in the United States. In Louisiana, an algorithm called TIGER (short for "Targeted Interventions to Greater Enhance Re-entry") — predicts whether an inmate might commit a crime if released, which then serves as a basis for making parole decisions. In another case that eventually went to the Wisconsin Supreme Court (State vs. Loomis), an algorithm was used to guide sentencing. In essence, the technological opaqueness of the system was compounded in a way that potentially undermined due process. Worse, the dataset — compiled using data from the Ministry, Greater Manchester Police of Justice, and the Police National Computer — contains personal data, including, but not limited to, information on addiction, mental health, disabilities, previous instances of self-harm, and whether they had been victims of a crime. Indicators such as gender and race are also included. —Climate wars are approaching — and they will redefine global conflict —'It is a dangerous strategy, and one for which we all may pay dearly': Dismantling USAID leaves the US more exposed to pandemics than ever These variables naturally increase the likelihood of bias against ethnic minorities and other marginalized groups. In addition, the data overrepresents Black offenders from affluent areas as well as all ethnicities from deprived neighborhoods. Past studies show that AI algorithms that make predictions about behavior work less well for Black offenders than they do for other groups. Such findings do little to allay genuine fears that racial minority groups and other vulnerable groups will be unfairly targeted.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>And if you've ever cried during a courthouse wedding post, well—same hat, different tears. Celebrity clairvoyant and former Kardashian spiritual consultant (yes, that's a job) Tyler Henry just announced that he's officially off the market, having married longtime partner Clint Godwin in what can only be described as a gay millennial's dream ceremony: low-key, high-love, and very Beverly Hills. With a single understated Instagram photo and the caption, “Today, we are married! Life with you is an endless sleepover with my best friend and life's just getting started,” Tyler delivered the soft-launch of a lifetime. And yes, in case you were wondering, the sleepover line made half the internet dissolve into a mist of feelings and glitter. Real gay love in the time of reality TV. “He had seen me on [Keeping Up With the Kardashians]. But the moment they met, this wasn't just another booked session. While no public engagement was ever announced (psychics, they're just like us—secretive about proposals), Tyler told E! News back in 2019 that he'd likely be the one to propose. He didn't spill when or how, but we can only assume it involved candles, possibly crystals, and a sense of otherworldly knowing. The newlyweds didn't opt for a Kardashian-scale spectacle (no Versace tuxedos or drones), but the intimacy of their courthouse ceremony was perfectly on-brand. Coconut-covered and topped with two little men, because if gay weddings have taught us anything, it's that dessert can be political. The couple has been making us soft for years. On Valentine's Day, Tyler shared a photo of the two in wetsuits (the gayest beach uniform, no notes), writing: “We've grown up together and there's no one else I'd rather grow through time with. Whether I'm 29 or 92, this love will always be my guiding force, a reprieve from all of life's heaviness. In March, Clint's birthday got another loving tribute: “Hurtling toward 30 isn't so bad with coconut cake and good company.” Who said psychics can't be poets? We'll be here—ugly crying into our matcha lattes, scrolling back to their cake pic, and maybe DMing a psychic just in case our own love story is waiting in the stars… or the comment section. What kind of wedding story makes your inner queer romantic scream-cry the most?</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A Greek woman decided to divorce her husband of 12 years after ChatGPT told her he was having an affair, simply by “reading” the coffee grounds in his coffee cup. OpenAI's ChatGPT chatbot is great for a lot of things, but it can ruin your life if you blindly put your trust in it. One Greek man recently appeared on the Greek TV morning show To Proino to complain about ChatGPT destroying his marriage by painting him as an adulterer simply by interpreting the coffee grounds in a cup of coffee he had posed with for his wife. Allegedly following a social media trend, the man's wife thought it would be fun to have the world's most popular chatbot “read” their coffee cups in a sort of modern twist on the art of tasseography. The chatbot claimed that the woman's husband was having an affair with another woman, which made his wife furious enough to file for divorce without even asking him if it was true. That's when I realized this wasn't just a phase.” According to ChatGPT, the man was fantasizing about a mysterious woman whose name started with the initial “E”,  and with whom he was destined to begin a relationship. To make matters worse, the chatbot's interpretation of the wife's coffee cup revealed that her spouse was already cheating and that this mystery woman was hell-bent on destroying their family. However, his lawyer warned that they would contest the divorce actions because the claims made by an AI chatbot have no legal standing, and his client was innocent until proven guilty. The husband said that a few years ago, she visited an astrologer and became obsessed with astrology. After the bizarre divorce case went viral in Greece, seasoned tasseography practitioners explained that reading into a cup of coffee involves more than the grounds.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>But if you read the social media of Pakistan (as one cannot see their news channels in India), then Pakistan has already attained a massive victory over India by not only foiling the Indian attacks but also destroying its military installations in Punjab and Jammu and Kashmir and shooting down highly expensive fighter planes like Rafale and Su-30. According to a dispassionate and respected source, India is more systematic in the ongoing disinformation war than Pakistan. While New Delhi has ensured that Pakistani channels are not easily accessible to Indians, it is deliberately feeding all misinformation to Indian news channels that are watched by millions of Pakistanis. Interestingly, while Pakistan has banned many things Indian, including films, it has not done so effectively as far as Indian news channels are concerned. There is a theory that the Pakistani establishment needs Indian news channels the most when it launches a terrorist attack or wages limited wars against India. When Pakistan Army Lost 129 Elite Soldiers In One Of The Deadliest Avalanches & Pointed Fingers At India But Pakistanis still think that the Indian channels are sources of authentic information. IAF Jets Can Hit Pakistan From Central Asia; A Little-Known Overseas Base Emerges As Islamabad's ‘Big Nightmare': OPED Therefore, nobody can be sure what India is doing or will do. For instance, Indian media has been flashing reports about JF-17 shootdown, capturing F-16 pilot, hunting Pakistan's AWACS, bombing Karachi port, etc. This could well be an Indian strategy to unnerve Pakistan and pressure its ‘rogue' military. This big question still remains: “How should India deal with Pakistan?” So far, the standard Indian policy towards Islamabad is that “ a stable and secure Pakistan is in India's national interest.” Let us not forget that Pakistan is essentially an “Army with a country”. Come what may, it will continue to promote jihad in Kashmir and other parts of India. How India Used World's ‘Fastest' Fighter, MiG-25 Foxbat, To Outfox Pakistan During The Kargil War Indeed, it is a huge myth that Pakistan will shed its hostility to India if the Kashmir issue is resolved on Islamabad's terms. Even if Kashmir joins Pakistan, Islamabad will find another issue to trouble India. Pakistan's very existence as an entity depends on hostility towards India. So much so that many Pakistanis now suffer from some identity crisis — they are not sure whether they should retain their age-old cultural roots (that are influenced by Hinduism) or develop totally new “Arab identities”. It is he who orchestrated the latest terror attack on India at Pahalgam. Just days before that dastardly attack, General Munir had boasted of how Pakistan has a “superior ideology and culture” than that of India and how “our forefathers thought that we are different from the Hindus in every aspect of life. It is true that Pakistan was created as “a state for Muslims”. But for the likes of General Munir and hardliner Mullahs, Pakistan is an “Islamic state”. Not long ago, in one of his judgments, Pakistan's former Chief Justice Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry reportedly asked, “Should we accept if tomorrow Parliament declares secularism, and not Islam, as the state policy?” Another judge asked, “Will it be called a rightful exercise of authority if tomorrow parliament amends Article 2 of the constitution, which states that Islam will be the state religion?” However, this most unfortunate trend is spreading among the Pakistani intelligentsia as well. For instance, Majid Nizami, editor-in-chief of The Nation, one of Pakistan's leading newspapers, had once written that “Pakistan is destined to defeat India because our horses in the form of atomic bombs and missiles are far better than Indian ‘donkeys.' The day is not far off when we would once again conquer India.” They are taught that  “Previously, India was part of Pakistan.” As such, Pakistan remained safe for Islam… During the 16th century, ‘Hindustan' disappeared and was completely absorbed in ‘Pakistan'…Although Pakistan was created in August 1947, yet except for its name, the present-day Pakistan has existed, as a more or less single entity, for centuries.” Interestingly, Pakistani students are being taught that though Akbar was a great Mughal ruler, Islam declined during his rule as he was influenced by the Bhakti movement that began during the Sultanate period and propounded Hindu-Muslim unity. Thus, systematic attempts are being made by the Pakistani government to brainwash the students in schools and universities that there are irreconcilable differences between the Hindus and Muslims and that they, with their diametrically opposed world views and interests, could not have stayed together in an undivided country that India was until 1947. Unless this entrenched anti-India mindset of the Pakistanis is changed, India will remain their eternal enemy. Pakistan's war against India is no longer confined to Kashmir. Pakistan wants to Balkanise India by cutting off the country's northern, eastern (North-East), and southern (Kerala) wings. In fact, Mushahid Hussain, once a former information minister under Nawaz Sharif, has argued that Pakistan should work towards dividing India into three or four independent countries. Simultaneously, Pakistan's ISI machinery will concentrate on widening the Hindu-Muslim divide, spreading hatred, and destroying India's inherent ethos of communal harmony. This being the case, India needs to reappraise its fundamental policy towards Pakistan. Fortunately, India has a Prime Minister in Narendra Modi, who hails from the south of Vindya and can think rationally about Pakistan. It may be recalled that WikiLeaks documents revealed how the then Indian national security advisor M K Narayanan had once indicated to his American interlocutors, and that too, in the presence of the then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, that persons living in the south of Vindhyas were better placed to frame India's policy towards Pakistan. Invariably, we have seen that leaders hailing from North India, including those who were born in what is today Pakistan, are often more emotional rather than rational when dealing with Pakistan. No wonder Prime Ministers like Manmohan Singh, I K Gujral, or, for that matter, even Atal Behari Vajpayee always found virtues in Pakistani leaders' India-related “statements” by overlooking their India-related “activities.” Pakistan needs to be handled realistically, not emotionally, by India.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Batman is widely praised and well-known in the modern age as one of DC Comics' more grounded heroes. Blending the inherent fantasy of superheroes with grittier crime-noir elements makes for a winning combination, but James Gunn's DC Universe paves the way for more. Alongside co-CEO Peter Safran, the DCU, kicking off theatrically with this summer's Superman, is already promising sci-fi and fantasy aspects. What works for one character doesn't necessarily mean it will work for another, but there are plenty of ways the supernatural can be introduced in the DCU Batman's world. This is abundantly evident by looking at the Caped Crusader's extensive comic book history. While Dick Grayson's star continued to rise as Nightwing, hos start as the first Robin has been wonderfully explored in a few amazing Batman comics. One of the '00s most interesting Batman comic miniseries was Matt Wagner's Dark Moon Rising. This was broken into two story arcs, each remaking Golden Age comics to fit within the then-new mainline canon. Batman and the Mad Monk is one such arc, fleshing out one of the Dark Detective's earliest supernatural encounters. Telling Batman stories focusing on his early years is likely something the DCU (at least in film) should avoid, given earlier theatrical adaptations. It wouldn't need to be in his DCU debut movie, but a shadowy group of villains like this organically weaves in the otherworldly of DC's world into Batman's sandbox. Iconic Batman writer Dennis O'Neil and artist Norm Breyfogle created this one-shot comic to expand on the origin story for Batman villain Ra's al Ghul—Damian Wayne's eventual grandfather. Whatever way The Brave and the Bold develops story-wise, it's hard to imagine the DCU's iteration of Batman won't have a narrative connection to his son's grandfather or mother, Talia al Ghul. Borrowing from O'Neil and Breyfogle's Birth of the Demon would be an elegant way to weave in Ra's' origins tastefully through flashbacks in a present-day story. As the DCU will inherently have fantastical elements, this could be a chance to introduce the supernatural elements of Ra's al Ghul's lore rather than the grounded interpretation from Batman Begins. While something like Arkham Asylum: A Serious House on Serious Earth is more akin to a psychological horror movie, there are certainly elements capable of being adapted to the DCU. James Gunn has made a point to champion this DC cinematic universe for exploring different stories, tones, and corners of the world. With that stipulation, legendary Batman writer Grant Morrison and artist Dave McKean's surrealist Arkham Asylum comic presents a wealth of opportunities. For recent comics from the pages of DC's mainline Batman titles, Ram V's Gotham Nocturne is an engrossing odyssey. This arc is sparked by an unmistakable and unshakable sense of dread that slowly creeps into Bruce Wayne's mind. Ram V tells a tantalizing and slow-burning saga in Gotham Nocturne ​​​​​​that effortlessly makes its fantasy feel at home in Batman's world. With at least one aspect of the Ra's al Ghul family confirmed to debut in Brave and the Bold—Damian Wayne—the DCU could flesh out this side of Batman's rogues gallery to include their ties to the mysterious Orgham family. At the same time, this Detective Comics arc uses its premise to give it a distinctly gothic, operatic, and dark fantasy flair. This early-years vigilante faces the combined threat of Gotham's seedy underworld and super-powered threats when mobster Sal Maroni funds Strange's cruel experiments on Arkham inmates. Batman and the Monster Men is another tasteful modernization of a Golden Age comic. This combination feels right for a DCU movie, as it contains the gloomy tone most fans appreciate from the Dark Knight's world while fashioning it with an almost Dr. Frankenstein-style whimsy. Strange is another rogue who would be a perfect fit for Matt Reeves' world, but the genetic experiment angle can justify its place in the DCU. Many fans know the sinister Court of Owls villains from their debut in writer Scott Snyder and artist Greg Capullo's Batman ​​​​​​run. They added an exciting new dimension to Gotham City's history, but Christian Ward's City of Madness ​​​​​​gives them a new twist. City of Madness is a brilliant take on Batman's mythos and the Court of Owls' place in it from a cosmic horror perspective. It even combines a more vibrant art direction with the surrealism of McKean's Arkham Asylum ​​​​​​artwork. However, the way City of Madness cleverly toys with more abstract supernatural ideas could fuel the premise of a DCU Batman movie. Even concerning the World's Greatest Detective's street-level affairs, talented DC Comics writers find ways to let ominous, supernatural forces creep in. The Dark Detective isn't a stranger to sci-fi and fantasy elements, even before this. Even so, this arc is notable for directly incorporating occult, dark fantasy elements into Batman's mythos and backstory. DC Studios co-CEO James Gunn made it clear that Grant Morrison's influence is already baked into his DCU plans. Their work on All-Star Superman with artist Frank Quitely will be felt in Gunn's upcoming movie, and their epic Batman run will inspire Brave and the Bold. Beyond that, Morrison, DC Animated Universe writer Paul Dini, and more's Resurrection of Ra's al Ghul has the potential to be a DCU event and introduce the Dark Knight to the supernatural. Batman is often considered a loner, though he has gathered a close family of both biological and adopted children from across DC's entire multiverse. The syndicate attempts to strike at the core of what makes Bruce Wayne function as a man and Gotham's symbol. It would make a rousing sequel and event film that combines Batman storytelling approaches from mystery to supernatural thrillers, thanks to the enigmatic Dr. Simon Hurt, who seemingly has occult roots in Gotham's history. 's Black Glove and Hurt's potential roots in demonology, there's room for a DCU movie to be dark and zany simultaneously. There are certainly ways the pulpy, more realistic version of the first Clayface could cause problems for Robert Pattinson's Dark Detective. This one-shot comic takes a Killing Joke-like approach to the villain, exploring how Basil Karlo attempts to forge a new identity for himself away from Gotham—and how he psychologically unravels at the seams. One Bad Day: Clayface excels as a harrowing character profile of a tragic villain who's far more nuanced than his monstrous form would suggest. Director James Watkins is directing a Clayface movie written by Mike Flanagan for the DCU, and pulling from Collin Kelly, Jackson Lanzing, and Xermánico's short but impactful comic couldn't be more appropriate. Whether the filmmakers opt for an antihero or villainous approach, it lends itself beautifully to a body-horror-fueled movie delving into meta themes of self-obsession and Hollywood vanity. Batman is also one of DC comics' "Big Three" alongside Superman and Wonder Woman, and together the three help keep the earth safe as founding members of the Justice League. Get ready for a brand new DC experience! The DC Universe (DCU) is coming soon, bringing together familiar comic book heroes in a connected storyline across movies, TV shows, animation, and even video games. It is an upcoming American media franchise and shared universe based on characters from DC Comics publications. Share your opinions in the thread below and remember to keep it respectful.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Originating from Chicago, 69-year-old Cardinal Prevost's election is a momentous occasion as he becomes the first American to head the worldwide Catholic Church and its roughly 1.4 billion adherents, reports Daily Express US. US President Donald Trump wasted no time in offering his congratulations to the new Pope on Truth Social, stating, "Congratulations to Cardinal Robert Francis Prevost, who was just named Pope." Trump added with evident excitement, "It is such an honor to realize that he is the first American Pope. I look forward to meeting Pope Leo XIV. Yet amidst the fanfare, there are lingering doubts; writer Gareth More suggested possible clandestine maneuvers in his piece published two days earlier, on May 6 - before the Conclave's decision on Leo XIV. More referred to a significant photo showing Cardinal Juan Luis Cipriani Thorne, 81, paying respects next to the open casket of Pope Francis before the funeral. The 81-year-old, who is Opus Dei's first cardinal, represents a conservative stronghold within the Catholic Church that is accused of exerting significant influence. More weighed in on the controversy, stating: "Ultra-conservatives have spent the last 12 years quietly – and sometimes not so quietly – seething at Pope Francis' progressivism and his attempts to open up the Church." His analysis of Cipriani's bold move suggests turmoil ahead for the Vatican hierarchy. "They have longed for a return to tradition and have been emboldened in recent years by a resurgence in support for right-wing, traditionalist political parties across the globe. The time is ripe for a MAGA-style papacy, they argue," More asserted. American news program The Young Turks released a video on May 7, entitled MAGA lobbies Vatican with lavish gifts to pick the 'right' Pope. Reporter Yasmin Khan provided insights into the Papal Foundation, an exclusive Catholic nonprofit with a steep membership fee, sharing details from a recent gathering in Rome. Khan reported: "One guest did tell reporters, this room could raise a billion to help the church so long as we have the right Pope. " Its members attended a dinner at the prestigious Pontifical University of St. Thomas Aquinas, also referred to as the Angelicum or Collegio Angelico. Busch has previously lauded the Trump administration as "the most Christian" he's ever encountered, despite President Trump himself admitting to a deficiency in "charity."
