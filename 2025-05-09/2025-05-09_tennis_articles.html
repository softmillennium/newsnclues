                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Emma Raducanu produced an impressive 6-2 6-2 victory over lucky loser Jil Teichmann to reach the third round of the Italian Open in Rome. Raducanu originally was scheduled to play Ekaterina Alexandrova but the 21st seed pulled out before the match with a right shoulder injury, replaced by Switzerland's Teichmann, who lost in the last round of qualifying to Hailey Baptiste. The former US Open champion served well, hitting six aces and facing only one break point. "To be honest it was pretty mental, as I was warming up for my match against Alexandrova and, all of a sudden, I get told I'm playing Jil," Raducanu told Sky Sports Tennis. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Raducanu turned in a thoroughly accomplished performance to cruise past the Swiss. Although ranked 94th in the world she has been as high as 21 in the past but could not match Raducanu's power and tempo in a one-sided contest that saw the 22-year-old break twice in each set and hold her own increasingly impressive serve throughout. Raducanu defended resolutely from the baseline, hit a handful of line-hugging forehand winners and racked up six aces, including a fiery effort down the middle to seal the match in one hour and 22 minutes to set up a clash against world No 50 Veronika Kudermetova. Discussing how she has changed her service action, Raducanu said: "If you look at my serve now compared to Australia, compared to the Middle East, even Miami, I changed it after Miami with some tweaks and it's a completely different motion. "I feel there's so much more room to grow it. "I still don't really feel comfortable on clay but in a way it helps me because I have to be super focused on every single point, just getting my feet right and to try and not fall over, so it is a big challenge," she said. "The points are long, the balls do get heavier, and when I was serving it out, it was getting slower and slower, so it is physical but I'm slowly finding my feet." Without getting carried away it's a player just inside the top 100 who has already lost this week but Raducanu answered every question that was asked of her. "I think she's moving better which is crucial on clay. The surface is lively and you're sliding all over the place so you need to get your legs extremely strong. On her coaching set up, the former Wimbledon champion said: "Emma is probably looking for a coach who is not too technical. She will really need someone on the court with her every day if she wants to work on her technique. She's going to her box quite often with eye contact which means she trusts the people inside that box." Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Cameron Norrie had no answers for 10th seed Daniil Medvedev as he was knocked out in the second round in Rome. Norrie was handed a lucky loser lifeline after failing to make it through qualification and took his chance with a straight-sets victory over Christopher O'Connell in the opening round. But he was unable to keep pace with the 2023 champion on Friday afternoon, succumbing 6-4 6-2. The Russian broke his British opponent four times and wrapped up a clinical victory with back-to-back aces. He will now move on to face Australia's Alexei Popyrin in the last 32. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Having come from behind to beat Kimberly Birrell in her previous match, she fell 6-4 6-2 at the hands of 30th seed Linda Noskova. Kartal struggled consistently to hold serve, being broken five times across the two sets and clawing two back in response.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Sinner will play his first match since January on Saturday against Mariano Navone, and while his return has been met with a positive response, Daniil Medvedev has now shared his point of view. Three-time Grand Slam champion Sinner tested positive for clostebol at the 2024 Indian Wells Masters. This resulted in a suspension, and while some players criticised the decision for Sinner to be banned, others took an opposing view. “I honestly first of all did not speak to any other player about it. But tennis is such a strange sport where everything goes very fast and I really love what Casper said about the hamster in the wheel,” Medvedev told Sky Sports. “It is an individual sport, so I would even continue what he said. It is a hamster in the wheel but there are 100 of us near each other and unfortunately when you replace one of the hamsters they don't really care. During Sinner's absence he missed four Masters 1000 tournaments, in addition to some important 500 events such as the Rotterdam and Barcelona Open events. But Carlos Alcaraz as well as Alexander Zverev, who are closest to Sinner in the rankings, each won a title in the three-time major winner's absence. However, they were unable to produce the consistency to close in on or dethrone Sinner as the number one player. This surprised Medvedev, especially in the case of Alcaraz. But they played strong opponents and everyone wants to win,” Medvedev said. “Carlos said that it did put pressure on him but I would be a little bit surprised because Carlos is so strong. “I think he may just have had some bad days. It is a tough sport and we are all trying our best and sometimes it works out, but let's see what happens now he's back.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Brad Gilbert is one of the sport's most legendary tennis coaches, leading several players to Grand Slam glory. The American began his coaching career in 1994, working alongside Andre Agassi for eight years, helping him achieve great success. During the late 2000s and 2010s, the 63-year-old helped several players, including Alex Bogdanovic, Kei Nishikori, and Sam Querrey, before returning to full-time coaching in 2023. Gilbert coached American star Coco Gauff for over a year, helping her win the biggest titles of her young career. Now working in the media following Gilbert's departure from Gauff's team, he has highlighted the key differences between coaching Agassi, Roddick, and Murray. Especially going from Andre [Agassi] to coaching Andy,” he said. That is his bravado and how you would pump him up. “Andre, you could talk for three hours the night before. With Andy, you might get 10 seconds, like Mission Impossible, this message is going to implode. “Quite a few times with him, I would do my best coaching when literally I wanted him to play the forehand. Then he would look up at me in the stands and tell me how wrong I was when the guy was missing forehands. “But if I did that with Andre, he would be like don't come to the courts. Gilbert went on to explain what it was like coaching Murray and highlighted just how detail-oriented the three-time Major champion was. How did you come to this conclusion?, Where are your 1000 words? I am not going to get into too much detail. As one of the sport's most experienced coaches, Gilbert knows all too well how every player is different in how they approach the game. Sometimes your opponent has the answer,” said Gilbert. Gilbert enjoyed the majority of his coaching success working with Agassi between 1994 and 2002. Agassi won six Major titles during this period, enjoying multiple stints as world number one. Joining Roddick's team in 2003, the pair quickly found success together, as the big-serving star won his sole Major title in New York a few months later. Roddick beat Juan Carlos Ferrero to win the 2003 US Open title, ascending to number one in the world rankings shortly after. They qualified for one further Grand Slam final together at Wimbledon in 2004, before parting ways later that same year. Gilbert ended his 20-year wait for an eighth Grand Slam title as a coach when Gauff beat Aryna Sabalenka in the final of the 2023 US Open. The WTA star had enjoyed a fantastic summer on North American hard courts since Gilbert joined her team, winning in Washington and Cincinnati prior to her maiden Major victory at Flushing Meadows. Failing to defend her title in 2024, Gilbert and Gauff parted ways, with the 63-year-old now enjoying time away from the sport.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Following a clinical first-round victory (6-3,6-3) at the Rome Open, Carlos Alcaraz shared heartfelt praise for fellow rising star Jannik Sinner, highlighting the Italian's return to the tour as a major boost not just for him personally, but for the sport of tennis as a whole. “It is great, honestly, to have him around for me, for me, it's great to have him back,” he said in an interview with Tennis Channel. “Honestly, I'm going to say I need him, you know, on the tour, because, I mean, he forces me to be a better player, to give 100% of me every day, just to be better,” he added. Alcaraz said that, other than personal favoritism, he was also an advocate for growing tennis and that Sinner's absence was hurting tennis as a sport. “And, of course, I defend always tennis, and I think tennis needs him as well,” he said. You know, he's his tennis is huge. So having the chance to see him and watch his tennis again, it is great so I'm just, that really happy, but it's not a different feeling. Alcaraz said he was happy after his first match and that he exceeded his own expectations for the first round in Rome. The most important thing was to test myself be able to play the way I want and that was what happened. I'm confident for the rest of the week,” said Alcaraz during his post-match press conference.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Novak Djokovic has taken a wildcard to play the upcoming Geneva Open as he looks to find form and match fitness before the French Open. Djokovic, who is aiming for a standalone record 25th Grand Slam title in Paris, pulled out of this week's Italian Open. The 37-year-old Serb has lost his past three matches after early exits at clay-court events in Monte Carlo and Madrid last month. It has been a patchy season by Djokovic's high standards. A positive start saw him reach the Australian Open semi-finals, although he had to pull out injured against Germany's Alexander Zverev after losing the first set. However, he was overwhelmed by powerful Czech teenager Jakub Mensik in the final, costing him another chance to win his 100th ATP title. Overall, he has won 12 of his 19 matches this season and hopes to improve that record in Geneva. He went on to reach the Roland Garros quarter-finals, but had to withdraw from his last-eight match against Casper Ruud with a knee injury picked up in the previous round. Norway's Ruud, who beat Britain's Jack Draper in the Madrid final on Sunday, is also in this year's Geneva field, along with American world number four Taylor Fritz.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tennis legend Kim Clijsters has spoken out in admiration of Serena Williams, highlighting what she sees as an underappreciated chapter in the 23-time Grand Slam champion's storied career—her remarkable return to tennis after giving birth. “When you think back about it now it's amazing and the women that we had growing up too - Steffi Graf, Monica Seles, Lindsay Davenport I mean she was so important for me also,” said Kim Clijsters in a recent podcast. However, one name stood out for Clijsters and that was Serena Williams. Clijsters even recalled the first match she ever played against Serena, which she ended up losing and Serena went on to win her first US open. “My first US open I qualified and played against Serena in the second round and that was her first US open title and she ended up being the GOAT in our sport right?” said Clijsters. Clijsters also mentioned how Serena's achievements after she came back from child birth, were underappreciated. Clijsters as we all know is the only WTA player in the open era to win a grand slam as a mother. However, she failed to do so, falling short of just one match multiple times. She made it to four grand slam finals- twice at US open and Wimbledon, falling short all 4 times. “I feel very fortunate that we had great rivalries and seeing Venus and Serena develop into just multiple Grand Slam champions, especially Serena being what she did after she you know had her daughter and coming back and being so close to winning more titles was, I feel like doesn't get enough recognition, but yeah, I'm very very proud to be part of that generation,” stated Clijsters.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Having played only two competitive matches on clay – one each in Monte Carlo and Madrid – his decision to skip the Rome ATP Masters 1000 event raised eyebrows as many felt he was undercooked on the surface. But Djokovic has maintained in recent years that his main focus is the Grand Slams and he hopes to peak at Roland Garros. Novak Djokovic facing threat of a new rankings slide and it may be terminal Novak Djokovic's doubters given a firm reminder by world No 1 ahead of French Open “Kind of new reality for me, I have to say. You know, trying to win a match or two, not really thinking about getting far in the tournament. “It's a completely different feeling from what I had in 20-plus years of professional tennis, so it's kind of a challenge for me mentally to really face these kind of sensations on the court, going out early now regularly in the tournaments. “Now I'm trying to, you know, use this as a driving force for the future. Obviously Grand Slams, I was saying many times, are the most important tournaments for me.” The Geneva Open – which runs from May 18-24 – will now give him an opportunity to get more matches on clay under his belt before the French Open starts on May 26. Djokovic won five consecutive ATP Masters 1000 titles during one of his unbeaten streaks. Novak Djokovic is sliding down the ATP Rankings and it could be significant for his Grand Slam hopes. Andy Roddick admits he is confused by Novak Djokovic's big decisions ahead of French Open.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Four years ago, a teenaged Lorenzo Musetti enjoyed an impressive Grand Slam main draw debut at Roland-Garros. And I was a little bit scared, playing against him,” Musetti recalls. Last year, he had an excellent grass-court campaign, reaching the semi-finals in Stuttgart, the final at Queens, and his first Grand Slam semi-final at Wimbledon. “Honestly, it was a little bit of a surprise, I would say, because I didn't experience so much grass. But when I started playing on grass, I always fell in love with it,” Musetti told rolandgarros.com in a recent interview. “And I see some similarities on grass with clay, I would say, because now grass is not like 30 years ago that was so fast that you cannot have a rally. Of course, serve and return are really important, much more than on the clay. So I really love to play on both, honestly.” This spring, Musetti is perhaps putting together a similarly impressive run, but on clay – the surface he grew up on – with a final at the Masters 1000 in Monte-Carlo and semis at the Madrid Open under his belt heading into his home tournament in Rome. It probably gave me that extra motivation and confidence of deserving where I am today,” said the talented Tuscan. Musetti told reporters in Rome he will try to “keep the momentum alive” starting with his opener against Finnish qualifier Otto Virtanen. Carlos Alcaraz and Lorenzo Musetti at the Monte-Carlo 2025 Trophies ceremony “Making final of a Masters 1000, like in Monte-Carlo, with a lot of ups and down during my matches, then stopped one week, almost two because I played in the weekend of the second week. Going through the Madrid Open to the semi-finals without losing a set, it's a confirmation of my level, of my mentality I would say, because the top 10 mentality is of course, you try not to lose with somebody who is lower than you, you know?” he explained. Is something different even if you win against top 10. As a crafty player with lots of variety in his game, Musetti feels he has fully grasped the true identity of his playing style, and steps on court with a purpose. He hopes march to the final four at Wimbledon last year will help him have a successful Roland-Garros, a place where he has already made the second week twice. “My best results in Paris were the two times fourth round. But I just don't want to think too much in the future,” he says. So definitely I will try to experience the same.” Lorenzo Musetti before his second round match at Roland-Garros 2024 Wimbledon 2024 isn't the only positive experience Musetti can draw on when it comes to Roland-Garros. “I always felt great in the conditions of Roland-Garros. And even if it was like two months later, I definitely felt great also at the Olympics,” he said. So, having great memories, I think it's not bad to have that in mind when you play.” Halfway through his fifth year on tour, Musetti is feeling like a seasoned player. “I remember when I was really, really fresh on tour and when it was my first year or the first two years, where every tournament that you play is new. So a lot more responsibility, even on the human side. But they brought me a better version, I think, of myself also into the court.” “Probably having more responsibilities and becoming a sort of example, not just for my kid, but also for all the kids that watch tennis and they dream about becoming a professional tennis player or they love the sport,” he says when asked how fatherhood has changed him. The fighter that I showed up in Monte-Carlo was really surprising also for me. And I would say that I need to be more like that during my career, during hopefully all my seasons,” he concludes.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tiger Woods' teenage son Charlie fell at the first hurdle in his bid to qualify for next month's US Open. But Woods' score of three-over-par was not good enough to progress. Only a handful of players from each event make it through to final qualifying and Woods finished seven shots off the four-under-par cutoff. It nevertheless marked a huge improvement on last year, when Woods finished nine-over-par in his bid to reach the 2024 tournament. Charlie did qualify for his first US Junior Amateur Championship last year but failed to reach the match play knockout stages. Tiger Woods' son Charlie fell at the first hurdle in his bid to qualify for next month's US Open Charlie is the eldest son of Tiger, a three-time US Open champion and 15-time major winner Charlie is the eldest son of Tiger Woods, a three-time US Open champion who is recovering from surgery on a ruptured Achilles. Tiger and Charlie have teamed up for several events in recent years but neither will be in the field at Oakmont next month. Former NFL quarterback Tony Romo, ex-tennis star Mardy Fish and New York Rangers player J.T. Miller are also among those hoping to reach Oakmont. By posting your comment you agree to our house rules.
