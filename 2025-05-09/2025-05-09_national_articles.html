President Trump or Defense Secretary Hegseth could fix it, lawyers say. FIRST ON FOX: President Donald Trump on Friday signed an executive order to establish a national center for homeless veterans with redirected funds previously spent on services for illegal aliens, Fox News Digital has learned. Los Angeles has approximately 3,000 homeless veterans — more than any other city in the country, and accounting for about 10% of all homeless veterans in America, according to the White House. President Donald Trump on Friday signed an executive order to establish a national center for homeless veterans with redirected funds previously spent on services for illegal aliens, Fox News Digital has learned. "The new National Center for Warrior Independence will help them and other veterans like them rebuild their lives," the White House said. The center will allow veterans from around the nation to seek and receive care, benefits and services "to which they are entitled," the White House said. The order redirects funds previously spent on housing or other services for illegal aliens to constructing, establishing and maintaining the new center. The order also directs the secretary of housing and urban development to use vouchers to support homeless veterans and instructs the secretary of veterans affairs to "restore accountability at the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)." The order also instructs the VA to take action against individuals who have committed misconduct and to investigate and rectify the Biden administration's decision to "rehire and reinstate back pay for employees previously fired for misconduct." The order also ensures that veterans will have access to increased options for care, benefits and services — including reduced wait times for Veterans Health Administration appointments through options such as expanded hours, weekend appointments and virtual healthcare. The order also directs a feasibility study at the Manchester VA Medical Center to expand services to support a full-service medical center in New Hampshire. "President Trump strongly believes that every veteran deserves our gratitude, and that the federal government should treat veterans like the heroes they are," the White House said. The order comes a week after the White House announced that Trump will host a military parade on June 14 to honor military veterans and active-duty service members and commemorate the U.S. Army's 250th birthday.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Trump administration officials are weighing a change that would shift responsibility for US security interests in Greenland to the military command that oversees America's homeland defense, underscoring the president's focus on the strategically important territory that he has repeatedly said he wants to acquire, three sources familiar with the deliberations told CNN. The change under consideration would move Greenland out of US European Command's area of responsibility and into US Northern Command, the sources said. On its face, the idea of putting Greenland under NORTHCOM authority makes some logical sense given it is part of the North American continent, though politically and culturally, it is associated with Europe and is a semiautonomous territory of Denmark. CNN has reached out to the Office of the Secretary of Defense as well as Danish and Greenlandic officials for comment. Still, several US officials expressed wariness about the move because of Trump's repeated insistence that the US “needs” Greenland and his refusal to rule out military action to obtain it. “I don't rule it out,” he said. US Northern Command is chiefly responsible for protecting US territory and currently oversees missions like the southern border task force. Putting Greenland under US Northern Command would at least symbolically split Greenland from Denmark, which would still be overseen by US European Command. Danish officials are concerned about the message that could send suggesting that Greenland is not a part of Denmark, one of the sources familiar with the deliberations said. Proponents of the move have pointed out that despite there being a US military base there and Greenland being seen as a vital outpost in competition with Russia and China for access to the Arctic — a major bipartisan national security priority — it sometimes gets overlooked by US European Command because of its distance from the command center in central Europe, one US official said. For US NORTHCOM, though, Greenland is an important vantage point for any potential enemy craft coming from that direction towards the United States. The unclassified version of the US intelligence community's annual threat assessment mentioned Greenland four times, within the context of adversaries like China and Russia seeking to expand their influence there. The discussions about moving Greenland into NORTHCOM come amid another high-profile spat between American and Danish officials over Greenland. Danish Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen said this week that he plans to “call in” the US acting ambassador to Denmark for talks after a Wall Street Journal report said Washington had ordered US intelligence agencies to increase spying on Greenland. They were directed to learn more about Greenland's independence movement and attitudes towards American resource extraction, the Journal reported. “I have read the article in the Wall Street Journal, and it worries me greatly because we do not spy on friends,” Rasmussen told reporters in Warsaw on Wednesday, during an informal meeting of EU foreign ministers. “We are going to call in the US acting ambassador for a discussion at the foreign ministry to see if we can confirm this information, which is somewhat disturbing,” Rasmussen added.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump said he's open to hiking taxes on wealthy Americans to help pay for Republicans' sweeping tax and spending cuts package, but the idea remains hotly contested among GOP lawmakers on Capitol Hill. In a Truth Social post Friday morning, Trump said that he would “graciously accept” even a “TINY” tax increase on the rich, while acknowledging that that it could bring political risks for Republicans. House GOP lawmakers have been struggling to find $1.5 trillion in spending cuts to help offset trillions of dollars of tax reductions. NO, Ross Perot cost him the Election!” Trump wrote. Trump also mentioned the possibility of letting tax cuts expire on top earners – targeting individuals who earn at least $2.5 million or couples that make at least $5 million — in a call with House Speaker Mike Johnson on Wednesday, a Republican source familiar with the matter told CNN's Dana Bash. This is not the first time Trump has indicated that he supports raising taxes on the wealthy, even though throughout last year's presidential campaign, he repeatedly promised to cut their taxes. The president recently told Time magazine, “I actually love the concept,” when asked about a proposal circulating to raise taxes for those earning more than $1 million a year. The idea, however, is not being warmly embraced among the House GOP and is far from guaranteed to make it into the president's final “one big beautiful” bill, which aims to make permanent the sweeping Trump 2017 tax cuts and incorporate the president's campaign promises to eliminate taxes on tips and certain other income. Just extending the 2017 individual tax provisions – which expire at the end of this year – could cost more than $4 trillion. Republican lawmakers are also fractured on how deeply they'd have to cut spending – including on Medicaid and food stamps – to meet their targets. Within the House Ways and Means Committee, members have discussed two ideas. One is to let the tax breaks for the richest Americans expire, returning their top income tax rate to 39.6% – which is what it was before Trump's 2017 tax overhaul – from the current 37%. But it could hit roughly 1.5 million households and cut about $409 billion of the cost, as well as greatly limit potential economic growth from making the tax cuts permanent, according to the Tax Foundation, a right-leaning think tank. Another idea is to create a brand-new tax bracket for the wealthy. The proposal, though limited in scope, could contribute to offsetting costly tax provisions, such as restoring the state and local tax deduction – known as SALT – that has become another flashpoint in Congress' tax debate. Levying a higher income tax rate on the very wealthiest of Americans would raise less money because much of that group's earnings come from dividends and capital gains, which are taxed at lower rates, said Garrett Watson, the foundation's director of policy analysis. One of the considerations for Republicans is what the goal of such a provision would be – to limit how much of the benefit is going to the rich or to raise more money to offset other tax cuts, Watson said. Asked whether Trump is seriously considering taxing the rich to pay for his budget bill, National Economic Director Kevin Hassett said: “The president is not a strong advocate of that, but he is a strong advocate of many things like no tax on tips, no tax on overtime, and nice treatment for auto loans.” When asked how the White House expects to pay for the bill, given a number of its stated priorities are expensive, Hassett argued Congress has already identified clear areas for cuts, without detailing what they are and whether they are achievable. “Well, the budget rules in the House and the Senate are very clearly identified that include spending cuts and so on, and they don't include dynamic scores,” he told CNN. House Ways and Means Chairman Jason Smith is expected to meet with Trump at the White House on Friday, and Hassett earlier told CNBC that he expects Smith will outline the House's schedule for the tax bill at some point during the day. Hassett has been meeting almost weekly with Johnson, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and others regarding Congress' budget. This story has been updated with additional details.</p>

Jordon Hudson is not going anywhere any time soon. However, the university refuted that, regarding "false" reports of her role. Jordon Hudson, the girlfriend of Bill Belichick, looks on in attendance at the Loudermilk Center for Excellence in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, on Dec. 12, 2024. "While Jordon Hudson is not an employee at the University or Carolina Athletics, she is welcome to the Carolina Football facilities. Jordon will continue to manage all activities related to Coach Belichick's personal brand outside of his responsibilities for Carolina Football and the University," the unversity's athletic program said in a statement. The report came from ex-ESPN employee Pablo Torre, who also said he had heard from sources in the Belichick family that there is a "deep worry" that Hudson could be "detrimental" to his legacy, and they were even "digging" up on her. Shortly after UNC's statement, though, Torre released a statement of his own, backing up his reporting on Hudson being banned from the facility. "The University of North Carolina can choose to describe or change its position on Jordon Hudson's involvement however it wishes, following the publication of our episode. We requested comment and filed dozens of FOIA requests that were not satisfied. Hudson has reportedly been heavily involved in Belichick's professional life since he was hired to be UNC's football coach in December. One report said she struck down the idea of the Tar Heels program being featured in "Hard Knocks." She and Belichick both reportedly expressed concern about fan vitriol, particularly about their relationship, if UNC were to underperform. Apparently, Belichick had asked UNC staff to include Hudson in all emails moving forward. Bill Belichick and Jordon Hudson on the red carpet before the Super Bowl LIX NFL Honors at Saenger Theatre.

Colonel and CEO of Mission Roll Call, told Fox News Digital in an exclusive interview why reform is necessary to improve the Department of Veterans Affairs. EXCLUSIVE: President Donald Trump's Secretary of Veterans Affairs, Doug Collins, has proposed a 15% workforce reduction with a goal of cutting 80,000 jobs at the VA. Retired Lt. Col. Jim Whaley, CEO of Mission Roll Call, a veteran advocacy non-profit, said such VA reform is necessary to improve veterans' lives across the United States. Whaley told Fox News Digital that veterans want to see less bureaucracy at the VA and more "community care" to cut wait times and increase services at local VA hospitals, but "if it was easy, somebody would have solved it." "Every American and politician, from both sides of the aisle, can agree that we want to make sure we take care of our veterans," Whaley said. Lt. Col. Jim Whaley, CEO of Mission Roll Call, told Fox News Digital that reform is necessary to improve veterans' lives across the United States. The VA serves only half of U.S. veterans. While Whaley said Collins is trying to reach the other 50% through TV and podcast appearances, he encouraged more transparency about the VA's services to reach the other half of veterans who still need care. "One hundred days into the second Trump administration, and VA is no longer content with poor results. Under President Trump's leadership, we have already stripped away many of the costly distractions that were coming between VA beneficiaries and the benefits they have earned. And we're looking to make even more historic reforms to better serve our veterans," Collins said. Trump and Collins have faced controversy in the media and among Democrats for cutting VA jobs and for their efforts to overhaul the department. Whaley, whose organization conducts veteran polling, said more than half of veterans are worried about VA cuts. "When all you hear is about the cuts versus what the philosophy is behind why you're making those changes in an organization, there's going to be fear. It's important that the VA stays as transparent as possible and reports on what is being done and what improvements are being made," Whaley said. However, Whatley, a veteran himself, said all veterans want to see an improved VA. As time goes on and Veterans Affairs communicate more and more with veterans, they will know a little bit about what's going on, and they'll be a little less anxious about it. Whaley encouraged Collins and the VA to include more veterans in the conversations surrounding the VA's reform by listening to families and caregivers to learn how to best invest in veteran care. "Veteran affairs are very important to recruitment issues, and that, of course, affects national security. When a veteran gets out of the service after a few years of serving their country, we have to make sure that the transition to the civilian world and finding a job and plugging into the community goes smoothly, because if we don't, then we have an issue," Whaley said.

According to the 2023 National Veteran Suicide Prevention Annual Report, more than 17 veterans committed suicide per day in 2021. That's the number one priority," Whaley said, adding that community care is also a top priority, so veterans don't have to drive long distances and wait a long time to get the services they need.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump on Friday set negotiating terms for his administration's first discussions with China, which are set to take place in Geneva this weekend. In a series of posts on Truth Social, Trump appeared to lay out his demands — and concessions — for the meeting between US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer and their Chinese counterparts. Trump said China must import more US goods, and in return, he believes the United States should lower its 145% tariff on most Chinese goods to 80%. “CHINA SHOULD OPEN UP ITS MARKET TO USA — WOULD BE SO GOOD FOR THEM!!! Up to Scott B,” Trump said in a separate post. The concession would be a dramatic break from the present reality, which has sent shipments from China into the United States plunging by 60%, according to Ryan Petersen, CEO of Flexport, a logistics and freight forwarding broker. Price hikes are beginning, and Goldman Sachs analysts Thursday said a key measure of inflation would effectively double to 4% by year end because of the trade war. Even if tariffs went to 0% this weekend, the US would still have price hikes and shortages, at least temporarily, because so little has been coming into US ports. China said Friday exports to the US fell 21% last month — before the effects of tariffs took hold. Trump has said he considers that a good thing. In the Oval Office Friday, Trump said the reduction in shipments from China means the United States is no longer losing money — a frequent if highly inaccurate refrain from the president that mistakenly equates a trade imbalance with losses. However, Trump administration officials are trying to lower expectations about the potential outcomes of this weekend's talks in Geneva, according to senior administration officials briefed on the plans. They are framing the talks as a good first step but won't result in any kind of “deal,” or even a framework like the one with the United Kingdom that Trump announced in the Oval Office to much fanfare Thursday. Despite Trump's apparent overture, Director of the White House National Economic Council Kevin Hassett told CNN Friday that the tariff will not be lowered ahead of the negotiation. “I think that everything will happen while the talks are happening, not before,” he said at the White House. “It will come out tomorrow what happens. Hassett added that Bessent and Greer are going into negotiations “with an open mind,” but said that news about any changes in tariffs won't come “until after the talks finish.” Bessent said Tuesday on Fox News that the discussions are to begin the thawing process in a frozen trade relationship. “My sense is that this will be about de-escalation, not about the big trade deal … but we've got to de-escalate before we can move forward,” he said. “You know, 145% [tariffs], 125%, is the equivalent of an embargo. Last week's report on gross domestic product, the broadest measure of the US economy, showed America's first contraction since early 2022, as an otherwise-healthy economy was dragged down by companies stockpiling goods to get ahead of tariffs. Despite the increasingly dire warnings and economic turmoil, the United States and China remain far apart on an actual deal. This story has been updated with additional developments and context.

Gavin Newsom, D-Calif., a potential 2028 presidential candidate, launched a new fact-check website on Wednesday targeting "right-wing misinformation," as a new poll found more than half of California registered voters believe he is more focused on becoming president than delivering for Californians. A new survey conducted by UC Berkeley's Institute of Governmental Studies and co-sponsored by the Los Angeles Times found that 54% of California registered voters believe Newsom is more focused on his personal presidential ambitions than solving the ongoing problems at home in the Golden State. "By a more than a two-to-one margin (54% to 26%), most voters believe that as Newsom serves out his final two years as governor, he is devoting more of his attention to things that might benefit himself as a possible candidate for president than to governing the state and helping to solve its problems," according to the results of the poll completed April 21-28 among 6,201 registered voters in California. Gavin Newsom, left, has rejected President Donald Trump's first 100 days back in the White House. Newsom's campaign, in a press release announcing the new fact-checking endeavor, touted California as the fourth-largest economy in the world, and said the blue state's population is growing, crime rates are at historic lows and California is leading the nation in clean energy and tech innovation. "This site is for everyone sick of the BS about California. We're going on the offense and fighting back — with facts," Newsom said. Newsom's latest endeavor targets misinformation from the devastating Los Angeles fires this year and other state issues, including crime, climate, the economy, immigration, energy and housing. Such was the case last month when a California lawmaker proposed a bill to allow state college and university students to sleep in their cars amid the blue state's housing crisis. The California politician has long been rumored to harbor presidential ambitions. He was one of several names floated as a potential Democratic nominee replacement for President Joe Biden before Biden suspended his re-election campaign last summer and ultimately chose former Vice President Kamala Harris as his successor. Newsom also campaigned for Biden and Harris in key battleground states, acting as a surrogate for both candidates when their names were on the top of the ticket. First lady Jill Biden and second gentleman Doug Emhoff watch as President Joe Biden raises the hand of Vice President Kamala Harris on July 4, 2024. Newsom launched a podcast this year embracing political dialogue across party lines, following Democrats losing the White House and the Senate and failing to regain the House of Representatives in 2024. Newsom has invited Trump allies and conservative guests, including Charlie Kirk and Steve Bannon, onto his podcast in an attempt to show he is open to "criticism and debate without demeaning or dehumanizing one another." The strategy follows criticism after the 2024 election that Democrats didn't prioritize new media appearances and unscripted conversations enough. But Newsom's willingness to soak up the national spotlight as Democrats look for someone to lead the party into the next generation may have backfired among his California constituents. Newsom is one of several Democratic governors trying to balance diplomacy with rejecting Trump's agenda during the president's second term. Newsom has spoken out against Trump's tariff policies and executive orders while reaching across the aisle to secure disaster relief following the Los Angeles fires earlier this year. The poll found a majority of California voters believe the state would be negatively impacted by Trump's overhaul of the federal government, as 64% believe Trump's tariffs would negatively impact California business and agriculture and over 50% believe Trump's policies would have a negative impact on education. Meanwhile, Californians are split on Newsom's job performance, with 46% both approving and disapproving of his job as governor and 45% reporting they are not confident in "his ability to be effective in looking out for California's interests when dealing with the Trump administration." "The Governor is focused on one thing: his job — driving L.A.'s recovery, confronting the housing crisis, and taking Donald Trump to court over his disastrous tariffs that are raising costs for families and blowing a hole in California's budget," Newsom's office told Fox News in response to the new polling.

'The Big Weekend Show' co-hosts guess dye-free foods and weigh in on Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. unveiling a plan to phase out eight artificial food dyes. President Donald Trump said he does not know his new nominee for U.S. surgeon general, telling reporters Thursday that he relied upon the recommendation of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Trump withdrew the nomination of his first pick for surgeon general, Dr. Janette Nesheiwat, this week and instead nominated Dr. Casey Means. The president, upon announcing her nomination, said she has "impeccable ‘MAHA' credentials." When asked Thursday about Means and why he tapped her for the role, the president said Kennedy recommended her. "Because Bobby thought she was fantastic, brilliant woman who went through Stanford — wanted to be academic instead of physician," the president said. President Donald Trump has picked Dr. Casey Means to be his nominee for surgeon general. Means, a vocal "Make America Healthy Again" proponent, played a significant role in helping shape the administration's agenda surrounding health alongside her brother, Calley Means. In 2024, both Casey and Calley co-wrote a book about the chronic disease epidemic titled "Good Energy," and Casey is also the co-founder of a health-tech company called Levels. When asked about Dr. Casey Means and why he tapped her for the role, President Donald Trump said Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. recommended her. It is unclear why Nesheiwat's nomination was pulled. Fox News Digital reached out to the White House for more information and did not immediately receive a response. Meanwhile, in a follow-up post on X, Nesheiwat also said she was "looking forward" to continuing to support Trump while working closely with Kennedy "in a senior policy role." "My focus continues to be on improving the health and well-being of all Americans, and that mission hasn't changed," Nesheiwat concluded in her public social media remarks. Nesheiwat is the sister-in-law of recently fired National Security Advisor Michael Waltz, whom the president indicated he will now be nominating to be the next ambassador to the United Nations after dropping his initial nominee, New York GOP Congresswoman Elise Stefanik.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Get inspired by a weekly roundup on living well, made simple. Getting the shingles vaccine could do more than just prevent a painful red rash — it may also lower the risk of heart disease and stroke, according to a new South Korean study of more than one million people published in the European Heart Journal. The highly common herpes strain, also called varicella-zoster virus (VZV), can cause chickenpox in childhood and later develop into shingles in older or immuno-compromised adults. The reduced risk was most noticeable up to eight years after vaccination among males, people under 60, and even those with “unhealthy lifestyles,” such as chronic smoking or drinking, according to the May 6 study. Related article Parkinson's disease prevention may ‘begin at the dinner table' “Since shingles can cause inflammation in blood vessels and lead to blood clots, which in turn raise the risk of heart disease, preventing shingles through vaccination might also help reduce these cardiovascular risks,” explained Hayeon Lee, a coauthor and researcher from the Lee Kyung Hee University College of Medicine in an email. The vaccine may be better at preventing shingles in younger patients and males because of their more robust immune systems, Lee said. “If a vaccine helps lower the risk of both infection and serious chronic conditions, it becomes an even more valuable public health tool,” Lee said. More research is needed to determine a direct causal link between vaccination and reduced cardiovascular event risk, but this analysis is the largest and most comprehensive so far, presenting a compelling case for those on the fence about vaccination, said Dr. Sharon Curhan, a physician and epidemiologist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, who was not involved in the study. Since this herpes strain can lie dormant in the body for years after exposure before it reactivates into shingles, you don't need a history of chickenpox to get the vaccine, Curhan said. In fact, more than 99% of adults age 50 years and older worldwide have been exposed to VZV, and many may not have had, or known they had chickenpox at all, according to estimates from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It's since been swapped for Shingrix, a two-shot recombinant zoster vaccine containing only part of the virus — which has shown to be more effective. More research is needed to compare the various health benefits of these different vaccine variations, said Dr. Pascal Geldsetzer, an assistant professor of medicine at Stanford University who was not involved in the study. “The biggest limitation of this type of research is that you're essentially comparing people who get vaccinated to those who don't get vaccinated,” Geldsetzer said. “We know that those people who decide to get vaccinated are often very different from those who don't in their health motivations and behaviors.” Researchers were able to sort for several demographic variables such as age, sex, income level and pre-existing conditions like high blood pressure, diabetes and high cholesterol. Still, some variables, like diet, other vaccinations, and proper adherence to treatments, can always slip through the cracks in non-clinical trials which use large data sets like the one used in this study, Geldsetzer said. For this reason, he hopes future studies can be randomized and use data from a clinical setting. These findings follow several other studies identifying the possible health benefits of shingles vaccination. Related article Cinnamon could interact with some prescription medications, according to a new study This study took advantage of a “natural experiment” after Wales rolled out its shingles vaccination program in 2013. Due to limited vaccine supply, government officials decided that only Welsh adults born on or after a very specific date would be eligible, so researchers could directly compare the health outcomes of two groups of individuals over time while limiting covariables. This is likely because shingles doesn't just cause inflammation in the blood vessels, said Geldsetzer.</p>

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? The mere fact that this hearing is happening is significant, as the Court rarely gives cases a full hearing in May, and typically only does so for matters of extreme urgency. At least three courts issued “nationwide injunctions” against Trump's anti-citizenship order, meaning that lower court judges handed down orders that bind the entire federal government and prohibit Trump from canceling anyone's citizenship anywhere under his executive order. The question of whether a single federal trial judge may issue an order that binds the entire country is fraught and has been hotly disputed for years. During the later days of the first Trump administration, Republican Justice Neil Gorsuch published an uncharacteristically persuasive concurring opinion arguing that these nationwide orders must be reined in. Gorsuch argued that injunctions — court orders that either require a party to take a particular action or forbid them from doing so — are “meant to redress the injuries sustained by a particular plaintiff in a particular lawsuit.” When one judge can go much further, halting an entire federal policy nationwide, that creates an asymmetry. “There are currently more than 1,000 active and senior district court judges,” Gorsuch wrote. In a world with nationwide injunctions, plaintiffs can shop around for the one judge in America who is most likely to be sympathetic to their cause, and potentially secure a court order that no other judge would hand down. This “judge-shopping” became a huge problem during the Biden administration, as there is a cohort of judges in Texas who proved quite willing to issue injunctions against a wide range of liberal policies that are unquestionably lawful. Think of Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk and his infamous court order attempting to ban the abortion drug mifepristone. The GOP-controlled Supreme Court, moreover, often treated nationwide injunctions against the Biden administration very differently than injunctions binding a Republican president. In the first Trump administration, when lower court judges blocked Trump's immigration policies, the Court often intervened within days to halt those injunctions. But when judges like Kacsmaryk enjoined Biden's immigration policies, the Supreme Court would sometimes sit on those cases for nearly a year before ruling that the injunction was illegal. That brief was filed in December 2024, after Trump had won the election, so Prelogar knew that Trump was likely to benefit if the justices took her up on her invitation. That's an odd choice, because the case for a nationwide injunction on this particular issue is unusually strong. If Trump's lawyers convince the Supreme Court to limit nationwide injunctions, however, it will have enormous implications that stretch far beyond the birthright citizenship issue. As of this writing, there are more than 200 lawsuits challenging actions by the Trump administration. If lower court judges cannot issue nationwide injunctions, Trump will have far more leeway to implement policies even after a lower court deems them illegal or unconstitutional. Still, the nationwide injunctions issue has lingered for a long time, upsetting the Justice Department in both Democratic and Republican administrations. So the Court probably could not continue ignoring it forever. Trump's attack on birthright citizenship is obviously unconstitutional, and there are no good-faith arguments for his position. On his first day back in office, Trump signed an executive order that purports to strip citizenship from many babies born in the United States. It also targets children of fathers with similar immigration status, and mothers who were lawfully, but temporarily, present in the United States when their child was born. The order does not apply retroactively — by its terms, only babies born 30 days after it was issued would be ineligible for citizenship. Had it applied to adult citizens, however, it would likely denationalize many very prominent Americans, including former Vice President Kamala Harris. The United States has “jurisdiction” over anyone who is bound by its laws — if the US did not have jurisdiction over undocumented immigrants, for example, then it would not be legal to deport them. (The third category is some “children of members of the Indian tribes,” but a 1924 law established that tribal citizens are also US citizens.) That strategic decision by Trump's lawyers is unsurprising, because the unconstitutionality of Trump's order was settled more than 125 years ago in Wong Kim Ark. While there is no serious argument that Trump's birthright citizenship order is legal, there are very serious arguments on both sides of the nationwide injunction question. Gorsuch and Prelogar are correct that, when a single trial judge can set policy for the entire nation, it can needlessly disrupt the federal government's legitimate activities. At the same time, a blanket rule against nationwide injunctions would render many court orders worthless. A more limited order would be unworkable and would impose impossible burdens on election officials who would have to track which voters are plaintiffs in which lawsuits in order to determine which candidates they may vote for. A parent who lets their membership lapse could see their child denationalized, perhaps to become a citizen again once they rejoin. That would create an unworkable administrative nightmare for everyone involved. And it's not at all clear how an injunction against the executive order limited to these states alone would work: Would someone born in Washington cease to be a citizen if they crossed the border into Idaho? Or would someone born in Idaho suddenly become a citizen if they entered Washington, only to lose that status the minute they returned to a non-plaintiff state? Such a rule wouldn't just be exceedingly difficult to administer, it would likely violate the Constitution's equal protection principle, which prohibits arbitrary distinctions among similarly situated individuals. Fortunately, the Supreme Court's current precedents offer a framework that can be used to resolve this tension between giving judges too much power to set national policy and forcing them to draw arbitrary lines that needlessly burden both the plaintiffs and the government. But, in the birthright citizenship cases, it's hard to see how anything other than a nationwide injunction could suffice. CASA and ASAP members won't receive complete relief if they are constantly having to prove their membership (or their parents' membership) in one of these two organizations to obtain the benefits of citizenship, including the right to be free from deportation. And states can't administer programs like Medicaid, where eligibility often turns on a beneficiary's immigration status, if they can't tell who is or is not a citizen. It's worth acknowledging one additional wrinkle in this case, which the Court could decide to take up at the May 15 argument. As one bloc of states explains in their brief, many federal programs tie funding to the number of citizens within a particular state, so states will lose money if the birthright citizenship order goes into effect. Additionally, the states argue that ending birthright citizenship for many children of immigrants would require them to make “substantial changes to existing public programs such as Medicaid, the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP), Title IV-E foster care, and the Social Security Administration's (SSA) Enumeration at Birth program.” Ultimately, because the case for a nationwide injunction in CASA is so strong, the Court probably will not use this case to unravel many of the more difficult questions posed by more questionable nationwide injunctions. But, at the very least, the case is likely to offer an early window into how these justices will determine which nationwide injunctions are allowed and which ones are forbidden. Trump filled the Supreme Court bench with anti-government saboteurs.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Conservatives have tried for years to strip federal funding from the abortion provider, only to see their efforts fall short in Congress or reversed when administrations change hands. With limited exceptions, federal law already bars taxpayer dollars from being used for abortions, but the organization receives hundreds of millions of dollars in Medicaid reimbursements that anti-abortion groups want blocked as well. Planned Parenthood also provides contraception and health services, such as STD screenings, that qualify under the program. Trump has begun to pull some funding for Planned Parenthood. Last month, the administration froze tens of millions in Title X dollars directed to family planning centers, targeting Planned Parenthood affiliates in several states. But anti-abortion activists see reconciliation, a budget process that allows Republicans to sidestep the filibuster, as the best avenue to pursue a broader and longer-lasting prohibition. Trump pursued a similar freeze in his first term that was reversed by former President Joe Biden. Outside groups such as Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America have been engaging with lawmakers one-on-one while also applying public pressure. There are signs those groups will find opposition from a crop of centrist Republicans uncomfortable with defunding the organization. Swing district lawmakers such as Rep. Mike Lawler (R-NY) have already begun to air concerns, throwing into doubt whether the language will be included in the GOP megabill, which sweeps together Trump's tax, border, and energy priorities. Yet Republicans, by and large, support defunding Planned Parenthood, arguing the Medicaid funding indirectly supports its abortion procedures. A week ago, Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) promised the House will “redirect funds away from big abortion” through reconciliation. Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-SD) has also aligned himself with the anti-abortion movement, attending this year's March for Life with Johnson in January. “We know that this is achievable,” said Kelsey Pritchard, a spokeswoman for Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America. Both lawmakers have caused headaches for GOP leadership, vowing in the reconciliation fight to oppose any bill that deeply cuts Medicaid benefits. But Republicans could face pressure in their districts from Planned Parenthood and its allied groups. They have run ads accusing Republicans of attempting to strip healthcare from women during past defunding attempts. “Federal Medicaid funds don't pay for abortion except in rare exceptions, but that's not stopping these lawmakers from going after Planned Parenthood,” said Alexis McGill Johnson, president and CEO of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund. “They're set on depriving patients, particularly people who already have the hardest time getting healthcare, of access to affordable cancer screenings, birth control, STI testing and treatment, and many other essential reproductive healthcare services.” So far, Planned Parenthood has survived GOP attempts at defunding. The measure even made it to then-President Barack Obama's desk in 2016 but was vetoed. But the Senate will pose a challenge regardless of which party is in charge. Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME) hasn't explicitly drawn a red line, but she and Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) have a long track record of voting to protect the organization. “I'm going to wait and see what the full package is rather than singling out individual provisions,” Collins told reporters on Tuesday. The strict rules of budget reconciliation pose a second hurdle for anti-abortion groups. If Republicans' budget bill fails this time, as it did with Obamacare repeal, they would likely have to wait for the next fiscal year to make another push through reconciliation.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As workers set up stations at North Division High School's cafeteria to test children's blood for lead, a group of frustrated parents and community activists gathered just outside the main entrance. After a child was found to have lead poisoning from peeling lead paint in a local elementary school early this year, the district began closing buildings and temporarily relocating students. For the crowd gathered outside, it's not enough. “This lead crisis is not a new crisis,” said Melody McCurtis, deputy director of a local organization called Metcalfe Park Community Bridges, a grassroots effort to revitalize one of the city's Northside neighborhoods. The city has fumbled its response before, leaving residents wary of new promises. Even as the city's health department and school district work to clean and repaint aging schools, they're having to rebuild public trust. And as of last month, they're doing it without federal help: Lead experts from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention who had been working with the city were cut during a massive wave of layoffs by the Trump administration. US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy suggested that they would be reinstated, but so far, they have not been. But many families say the latest efforts to clean and repaint old buildings, though well-intentioned, are only a Band-aid. They're covering up the lead, not getting it out of schools completely. “We have had crisis after crisis every few years, and we have heard similar kind of things from city leadership throughout that time,” said Derek Beyer, a former teacher with Milwaukee Public Schools, who spoke for the Get the Lead Out Coalition. “It's been kind of, in my opinion, a game of pass the buck rather than just remove the lead.” Like other major cities in America's Rust Belt, Milwaukee has long been burdened by lead. These uses for lead have long been banned, but the threat of its toxicity remains. It can still leach out of pipes, flake off walls and surface in soil. Even small amounts can damage a child's brain function, affecting their behavior, IQ and self-control. Each year, about 1,000 children in Milwaukee test positive for lead poisoning, which the CDC defines as at or above 3.5 micrograms per deciliter of lead in the blood. Roughly 15 have to be hospitalized for acute symptoms such as abdominal pain, vomiting, constipation and seizures. About 200 have blood lead levels over 15, which triggers a health department investigation to determine the source. Most often, they're poisoned by lead paint in deteriorating homes. Many of Milwaukee's schools had gone without regular painting and maintenance for years: A report submitted to the Wisconsin legislature last year showed that the schools needed more than $250 million in deferred maintenance. Kat Cisar, who has twins in the first grade at the Trowbridge Street School of Great Lakes Studies, found out that the school was abruptly closing and that students would be relocated in an email that came at 7:36 p.m. on a Thursday in March, giving parents and school officials only days to adjust. As parents dropped off their students at a building 5 miles away from their old school on the next Monday,  they had no idea how long they would be displaced or whether a student at their school had been poisoned. “What happened behind the scenes was a lot of confusion and a lot of uncertainty,” Cisar said the community event on Wednesday. Cisar said parents would like to see better communication from the district, including text alerts if a child at a certain school tests positive for an elevated lead level. They also want school principals to be kept in the loop so they can share timely updates with parents. Other school buildings have been closed for months. Parents say they have no idea how long the hazards existed before action was taken. Milwaukee Public Schools Superintendent Dr. Brenda Cassellius, who assumed her post in mid-March as the crisis was already unfolding, says schools in the district have been underfunded and individual principals were forced to make impossible choices. Going forward, Cassellius said, the district will assume the cost of school repairs so they aren't shouldered by individual schools. So far, the district has spent nearly $2 million to clean and repaint seven schools, and remediation will start on two more this month. Tracy Hampton, a 34-year-old mother of three who was born and raised in Milwaukee, has been trying to keep her kids away from lead for nearly a decade. When her oldest son, Prince, was a toddler, a test showed that he had a lead level of 27, which prompted his doctor to prescribe iron drops to help reduce the body's absorption of lead. Hampton was told to wipe down toys and surfaces in their home and make sure he was eating plenty of fruits, vegetables and other healthy foods to counteract the damaging effects of the heavy metal. An X-ray at the hospital revealed bright flecks of white in his stomach, a sign that he'd eaten chips of lead-based paint. He ran a high fever, vomited and had a seizure, and doctors worked to flush as much lead as they could from his body. An audit of the department's records in 2018 failed to find any evidence that it had notified some 6,000 families that their children had elevated levels of lead in their blood. Further investigation showed that the department bungled follow-up care too, failing to investigate the sources of lead exposure for some children. Other instances found that some children's cases were closed early, before there was evidence that their lead levels had returned to normal. It's not clear whether Hampton's family was among those that fell through the cracks. She had been spending nights at her mother's house for help with her active toddler, and she says the Milwaukee Department of Health tested the rental home and found that the windows and floors were loaded with lead. Her mother's rental home sits on the city's north side. After Hampton limited the amount of time she spent at her mother's place and stopped spending the night, Prince's lead levels began to come down. In 2022, Hampton moved her family into a different rental home. Prince's lead levels continued to be elevated, hovering around 6.5. That house, too, was tested and found to be full of lead paint. In Milwaukee, 88% of homes were built before 1978, when it was still legal to use lead-based paint. Dr. Mike Totoraitis, the city's health commissioner, estimates that about 200,000 housing units in the city may still be affected by it, based on their age. Practices like redlining contributed by concentrating Black populations in some of the poorest neighborhoods, which were then spurned by investors. “That's frankly how we're able to respond to this whole crisis at the schools,” said Totoraitis, who joined the department in 2023. When news of the student poisoning broke this year, the health department set up a dedicated website where it has posted photos of affected schools, inspection reports and letters to parents. It has held regular news briefings and town halls. Totoraitis said it's also working to create a dashboard so parents can have more insight into the results of student blood tests. Under pressure from angry parents, the school district parted ways with its facilities manager. “Through that moment in our department's history to where we are now, we have always leaned into the issues that we've seen in our city, in particular with our lead program, and I think that's helped to rebuild some of the trust that we lost, rightly so, with the community,” Totoraitis said. At Trowbridge Street School, it's clear that Room 13 – home to Mr. Koney's Kindergarten Superheroes – has gotten a recent facelift. A hallway with hooks for kids' backpacks now has blotches of fresh paint just a shade lighter than the old blue underneath. But some parents say argue that it doesn't address faucets where water has tested high for lead or soil around the schools. “This is an inadequate response that we're having at all levels of government here that we're fighting back, and we're kind of banding together and figuring out how we can force some of these institutions to do the right thing,” said Kristen Payne, whose son is a third-grader at Golda Meir, the site of the initial poisoning case. The health department and school district say that drinking water sources in schools are safe. The district has installed filtered water dispensers in schools, and any sinks that have been found to have elevated lead levels are supposed to be labeled as not for drinking. Totoraitis says that with strained resources, the city has to focus on lead hazards that are known to have poisoned students. He could also then inspect school buildings regularly to make sure the district is following its plans to mitigate lead. Health officials are encouraging parents of students at affected schools to get them tested for lead. Inside North Division High School on Wednesday, the district hosted a lead testing clinic that would give parents near-instant feedback on whether a child might have a high level of lead in their system. Of those, two had elevated blood lead levels and will require more testing. For now, given the funding they have, the schools and health department say, they can clean up chipped lead paint in homes and schools and seal it under new paint. They can make a building lead-safe but not truly lead-free. At some point, trying to maintain Milwaukee's aging schools – some of which are more than 100 years old – simply won't be sustainable or safe anymore. There is some federal help coming for homes in Milwaukee. Totoraitis said the city recently got federal funding to remediate 600, but each project has cost much more than anticipated. In the end, he said, they'll probably be able to clean up 450 homes. Helping a single home can have an impact, though. Hampton moved again in 2023, this time into a house that she said was tested and shown to have no lead issues. This year, for the first time since he was a baby, Prince's blood lead level has fallen into the normal range again, Hampton said. His sister, who turns 3 next week, is in the normal range, too. Hampton hopes her story will motivate the city to proactively test more homes and schools for lead and not wait until more children are harmed.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>McKEESPORT, Pennsylvania — Take the left off of Nessley Avenue after climbing the switchback up from this city's once-thriving downtown business district. Despite the impact weather has had on the bricks, giving them a wavy appearance, it adds a unique charm and character to the street, which is lined almost exclusively with tidy midcentury red brick homes. Built in 1940, it was the home of Michael and Maryann LaCivita. For the first 12 years of Chris LaCivita's life, this neighborhood was his everything. It was where he and his four brothers were born. It was the neighborhood where he would go to school and church, deliver the newspaper, play football with the other children, and build a snow-shoveling business with his brothers. This is the place that formed Chris LaCivita, who, along with Susie Wiles, led President Donald Trump‘s winning campaign last year. It took a while for LaCivita to realize how this background and rootedness guided him throughout his political career. LaCivita is the second oldest of five boys. His father was a public relations executive with Equitable Gas, and his mother was a stay-at-home mom. His parents surrounded the boys with grandparents, aunts, uncles, and cousins, all living within miles of each other. You would go to Mass, and if it wasn't during Steelers football season, you'd go to Mass and then we would go visit one of my dad's sisters, which there were plenty of them, or at my grandmother's for Sunday supper,” he said. LaCivita described his grandmother as “this tiny little Italian lady that barely spoke a word of English.” After she died, the family would do Sunday supper at one of his relatives' homes. “And it was always a big lunch or a big dinner, and that's what we did on Sundays.” LaCivita said that even at the time, he understood it was a good childhood. “My dad was at work in the summer months. We spent all of our time at McKeesport High School playing football or basketball. It's just what we did from sunrise to sunset.” Every once in a while, they spent the day at Kennywood Park, a local amusement park on a ridge just across the Edgar Thomson Steel Works that was filled with old wooden rollercoasters, bumper cars, and cavernous pavilions. “When my kids were old enough to appreciate it, the first thing I did was take them, too, and of course, they had more fun at Kennywood than they did at Disney World,” he said. The Roman Catholic parish right by LaCivita's home closed at the end of his first year of grade school. It was once a thriving city, significant enough that President John F. Kennedy campaigned there in 1962. The downtown also boasted two large multilevel department stores, a luxury hotel, restaurants, supper clubs, and numerous specialized retail shops. This fracturing of place happened across the Rust Belt for decades. “First of all, we were moving to Virginia, and the only thing I knew about Virginia was what I saw on the television, and well, that was The Waltons,” LaCivita said. “Oh, and they did not have a football team.” “I don't know what it was. I just wasn't interested a whole lot. I was always looking to make a buck. Cut massive lawns, and that was before high school,” he said. I worked rides and that kind of stuff at the amusement park with my older brother. And I worked at a steakhouse, washing dishes. I was also a stock boy at Food Lion, the night shift. That all changed as he was staggering through undergraduate studies at Virginia Commonwealth University in the late 1980s. Then, a political science professor suggested that the government should be in charge of healthcare, which led to a robust debate. LaCivita eventually pursued a master's in public administration. “So, at the time, I was somewhat active with politics, quasi-affiliated, but not really with the College Republicans,” he said, adding, “I'd go to their events basically to drink their beer and to meet the girls. It was my Marine buddies and I — that's what we would do. The next thing that changed everything was that his Marine unit got activated for the Persian Gulf War while he was in graduate school. LaCivita left for the war on New Year's Day 1991, returning five months later with a Purple Heart. He had been shot in the face on his mother's birthday. LaCivita described the moment as a “pissing match with a bunch of Iraqis” in which his unit took direct fire. The scars on his face where he was hit left him with nerve damage. The Kevlar jacket likely saved his life when he took a hit from shrapnel, leaving him with three cracked ribs instead. “I really had no idea of what I was going to do, was going to go back to school, and my energy level was like a hundred times more,” LaCivita said of his return home. There was a lot of things I couldn't do.” His father had a friend who was running for the board of supervisors and needed help with his race: “Dad said, ‘He is going to give you $500 and $50 for expenses.' '” That candidate was George Allen, who won and went on to run for Congress in a special election. “Here is the thing: I went from a board of supervisors race straight into a congressional race, and I knew who George Allen was, but I did not know that he was running for Congress. I just thought he was running for reelection,” he said of his upgrade from a local race to the big times. LaCivita then got his first taste of Washington, D.C., after taking a job in Allen's congressional office. “I spent 14 months in Washington as a legislative assistant,” LaCivita said. LaCivita married his college sweetheart, Catherine, and had two children. He would go on to have his hand in numerous successful and some not-so-successful political races over the next 25 years. Until the fall of 2022, when Susie Wiles came calling. Wiles, who did not know LaCivita at the time other than by his take-no-prisoners reputation, was looking for a certain kind of person to work with the Trump team. “He's done every blue-collar job that could possibly be. He grew up in a family where his dad worked for the government,” she said. “So, he understands that pretty uniquely, too. “When the president decided to run [in the 2024 race], he said to me, ‘Well, you ran Florida, and you won and you've been doing great,'” referring to her overseeing his successful Florida operation in 2016 and 2020. “And so I thought, ‘OK, well, I mean, this is sort of a big deal for me,' so I called my best friend in politics, Tony Fabrizio, and told him this is what the president wants.” “He said, ‘I got the guy, can you come to dinner next Thursday? Wiles and LaCivita had what they now laughingly call work “dates” with Fabrizio in the mix to see if they clicked. He comes to Mar-a-Lago, goes out and buys a new suit, got his shoes shined, and comes for dinner.” It wasn't a perfect first meeting. “And [Trump] said, ‘Everybody says they made the Swift Boat ads. You didn't make the Swift Boat ads. Wiles said she approached Trump again a few days later about LaCivita. “I really think he's the guy,” she said. Trump told her, “If that's what you want, it's fine with me. “Chris walked in the door, thinking he was going to have another dinner, hopefully more pleasant,” Wiles said. “And the president said, ‘Look, she wants you. LaCivita was working on Sen. Ron Johnson's (R-WI) reelection bid. He came on board right after that race ended. LaCivita and Wiles are opposites in many ways, yet their partnership worked. “That's what I know best in politics, particularly at the level we just finished,” Wiles said. Wiles said presidential campaigns are “just so big and so multifaceted that it's hard for me to conceive of one person really doing it all by themselves.” So, it was just common sense that they became co-campaign managers. “But it could have gone wrong in many ways. As an observer who saw the two of them dozens of times on the campaign  you could see their genuine respect and affection for each other. It was something you never see in the politics business. And he doesn't want anybody to know it,” she said. And so those kinds of values we both share.” LaCivita and Wiles spent much of their time together with Trump. But on July 13, Wiles was with Trump as he headed to Butler, Pennsylvania. LaCivita was in Milwaukee, where Trump was heading the next day to commence the Republican National Convention. Then came the assassination attempt that changed everything. LaCivita was watching the rally in his hotel suite but was distracted by a staffer with a minor crisis. His door was open so staff could go in and out as needed. LaCivita's daughter Victoria, who was working the convention, burst through the door to tell him Trump had been shot. LaCivita has a reputation for being stoic in emergencies. Wiles, who was getting into the car with Trump as they headed to the hospital, promised to call back. It took two hours for them to connect. “We ultimately go back to the FBO, and it looks like we're in the middle of a war zone,” Wiles said. “Everybody has their long gun drawn, and people that I know and they know me are looking at me funny. “He knew that the president was OK. “And to be just a small part of that, and then to be able to go to the White House and talk with the president and at the Oval next to the Resolute desk, and then the ride on Air Force One, those are such amazing, rare opportunities for any person,” he said. LaCivita said Allen once told him while passing the illuminated Capitol dome on their way back from a reception, “If that view ever stops giving you goose bumps, it's time to get out.” “I've never stopped getting goose bumps,” LaCivita said. “Chris, I know firsthand that you are an absolute warrior, an exceptional patriot, one of the greatest fighters in American politics, and I will tell you, you were by my side, and we won the presidency. Other than that, of course, you've learned how to fight from the very best: the United States Marine Corps. You bravely served our nation in uniform, and as of last July, we now have something in common: We have both taken a bullet for our country. But I want to thank you not only for your extraordinary service on our campaign, which was just leadership and brilliance, but to take back the White House. It was decades of political trenches fighting to defend America, and you learned a lot, and you gave me that knowledge. It's an honor to call you a friend, and really was an unbelievable honor to work with you toward our big victory in the presidency. Enjoy yourself and have a great life.” LaCivita's mother reached over to hold his hand. A wave of emotion washed over his face. I don't have to be, and the thanks is in accomplishing the mission and being a part of a team of people and the lasting friendships that I have — those are the most important things to me.” “It was that much more touching for my mother to be able to experience it as well because I'm sure there were times in her life where she probably didn't know what I was doing,” he added. LaCivita acknowledged, “Politics is a very tough, rough, and tumble business, and you don't often get to share these kinds of moments with anyone the older you get.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>My home state of Colorado used to shine as a Western American land of promise, where economic vigor and free-spirit vibes lured diverse transplants from around the globe. Migrants from great coastal cities likened it to a real-life version of Ayn Rand's fictional, Colorado-based Galt's Gulch, where industrialists, inventors, entrepreneurs, and artists established themselves to escape a collectivist society that manifests mediocrity and oppression. Business leaders and top-ranking executives flocked to Colorado, with the state becoming a permanent home for at least 12 billionaires and 170,223 millionaire households by 2020 — not bad for a state with fewer than 6 million residents. Then came 2018, when the far Left won majorities in both chambers of the legislature, and voters elevated Democrats to every statewide office, including Gov. Jared Polis, Secretary of State Jena Griswold, and Attorney General Phil Weiser. Seven years into this dark blue tsunami, the signs of damage are mounting. At first, Colorado's stumbles looked eerily like those made notorious by California. For decades, Coloradans have grumbled about “Californication,” the influx of Californians jacking up home prices and hauling in left-leaning politics. “Colofornia” became a term of consternation among natives and others witnessing the influx. The numbers show a genuine shift, and the fallout — economic strain, cultural friction, and a state generally losing its footing — is hitting hard. Despite a doctrinaire, radicalized legislature, what's the matter with Colorado is far from intractable. Colorado cities and towns consistently rank among the top 10 for livability, as ranked on lists by U.S. News & World Report, WalletHub, and other research organizations. Colorado has become a draw for the country's booming aerospace industry. Parks, trails, open spaces, ski slopes, and awe-inspiring vistas complement a four-season climate conducive to year-round recreation. A modern proliferation of art venues, museums, and concert arenas gives Coloradans cultural amenities more common in major coastal cities. What we have here is a governmental leadership crisis of one-party control, with rippling consequences of death, homelessness, addiction, despair, and growing unemployment, disproportionately burdening the most vulnerable among us. Pre-2018, Colorado reliably flexed economic muscle no matter which party controlled the famously swingy purple state. It is California's slow bleed redux: Regulations pile up, costs soar, and growth fizzles. Personal income growth, a bragging right at third nationally pre-2018, crashed to 39th by 2024, even with Polis and company supporting some of the country's highest minimum wage mandates, consistently projecting themselves as champions of the state's dwindling working class. Though wage hikes raise some paychecks, jobs thin out and businesses hesitate to grow or relocate, handing Colorado a growing “income inequality” dilemma like the divide between California's Silicon Valley/Hollywood crowd and ordinary households. Housing is referred to as a “crisis” by the legacy media. Median prices hit $541,352 in February, based on Zillow sales and listing data, landing Colorado among the five least affordable states. Apartments.com shows apartments in Denver going for 32% more than the national average. If that's not enough to discourage doing business in Colorado, the legislature crafted a bill that penalizes parents, with consequences that include losing custody, if they use a child's given name instead of one the child prefers. That proposed law alone has families planning to move and much of the country rolling its eyes. Oil and gas, a godsend for smart workers without college degrees, dropped 25% in active rigs by 2023, based on industry tallies. Compliance costs from post-2018 rules — $590 million a year, as found by the Common Sense Institute — push layoffs and send firms packing. The proposed 2025 Labor Peace Act overhaul, making it easier to require “closed shops” in Colorado, could jack up costs for employers running on fumes. The net effect, worried Colorado development recruiters point out, would be to scare off a lot of employers looking to locate in Colorado or expand their operations here. California, under a union chokehold, is the poster child; employers have been fleeing its closed shops for “right to work” states where unions cannot make nonmembers pay fees or dues. Expect it to rise if this bill becomes law. Colorado's energy production provides a case study in control creep. Senate Bill 19-181, signed in 2019, flipped the Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation Commission from industry booster to eco-enforcer. Industry seats shrank from three to one, swapped for environmentalists. Local governments gained free rein to tighten drilling regulations that the state had long prohibited to protect property rights and the country's energy supply. The oil and gas permitting process has become an engineered slog. A per-barrel fee imposed in 2024 siphons cash for transit and wildlife. Colorado, the country's fourth-largest energy producer, harvests less than it did in 2019, costing the state high-wage jobs and tax revenues essential to funding schools and infrastructure. In March, Colorado had the second-highest unemployment rate, 4.8%, falling far below Mississippi, West Virginia, and other states that traditionally struggle economically. As with oil and gas producers, commercial real estate owners also feel the squeeze of excessive regulation. Owners pay for retrofits, and the electrification mandates ban gas furnaces in buildings erected since 2024, with electric swaps due by 2027. A 2024 rule tacks on gender-neutral restrooms and baby-diaper changing stations by 2026, raising construction costs even more. Polis pitches sustainability and fairness, but for business leaders, it is the importation of California-style regulatory excess they can choose to reject by moving operations next door to Utah or to any of the other less-regulated states surrounding Colorado. Since 2019, Polis has backed policies such as House Bill 19-1124, tying the hands of state and local law enforcement when asked to cooperate with federal holds requested by Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Most have no jobs, cash, or prospects for employment and long-term housing. Before the immigrant invasion, housing was a pipe dream for the young, and now these taxpayers shell out big to care for immigrants. Culturally, it's a jolt, as schools strain under language gaps, and neighborhoods grapple with a new population of homeless people on top of scarcities in healthcare, social services, and housing that were problematic before the immigrant surge dramatically increased demand. Illegal immigrant prison gangs, most notably the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua, have notoriously spread from Denver. They have taken over apartment complexes in Aurora, and several of their victims told a member of the Colorado Springs Gazette's editorial board that the problem is far worse and more widespread than the public has been told. Similarly, California's open-door experiment tanked affordability and stretched resources. For a state with seven times fewer residents than the Golden State, 40,000-plus “new arrivals” are a wave too high for the public to surf. Then, the left-wing cabal decriminalized every illicit drug, on the heels of voters enacting full legalization of marijuana, and indulged a “criminal justice reform” agenda that eased penalties for nearly every crime. The ideology said criminals need reform, but the result has been criminals flocking to Colorado, including Tren de Aragua gangsters, who made Colorado their North American headquarters. Car thefts jumped 13.6% that year, hitting 40,000-plus and topping the nation. Violent crime is at 423 per 100,000 since 2018, above average, with homicides and assaults creeping up. Walking the streets of Denver alone at night — where one risks life and limb in Washington Park, on Capitol Hill, or in other traditionally safe neighborhoods — makes little more sense than walking the streets of south-central Los Angeles. Gaps for minorities, low-income children, and special education students widened after 2018 gains faded. More funding is the cry, but experience proves it doesn't buy results. Homelessness festers in Colorado's metropolitan areas, linked to housing woes and limp policies. In the wake of hard-drug decriminalization and full-scale cannabis legalization, fentanyl deaths soared 101.3% from 2019 to 2022. A federal forest official years ago told the Colorado Springs Gazette's editorial board of large plantations hiding in some of Colorado's 11 national forests, complete with makeshift buildings and armed guards. It turns out Latin American cartels prefer producing the drug in a state where illegal products meld right in with their licensed and legal counterparts. Colorado's anything-goes drug orgy, with the second-highest teenage fentanyl overdose rate, has fueled a booming drug rehab sector that has elders liquidating retirement funds to pay the costs of saving their children and grandchildren from substance abuse. By 2022, its national directory listed 448 facilities, suggesting an uptick in corporations feeding on a growing addiction epidemic. There, a former Ramada Inn hotel and two luxury mountain resorts have transitioned into rehab centers. The California-to-Colorado pipeline has been flowing for years, with estimates showing tens of thousands of California transplants annually for the past three decades. Though diminishing, the California influx brings Left Coast policies and more. Because of Colorado's relatively small population of 5.8 million, the demand created by deep-pocketed Californians contributes to housing prices rising so sharply that retirees struggle with property tax bills that rival old mortgage payments. Politically, Californication has tilted Denver, Boulder, and Fort Collins leftward while eating away at the consistently conservative tendencies of Colorado Springs — the veritable Orange County of Colorado, mimicking shifting political trajectories in south Los Angeles suburbs and San Diego. In a state with living costs and crime approaching levels endured in California, bringing up children becomes increasingly challenging for many and a near impossibility for the working class. Fertility has fallen as low as 50.2 in recent years for every 1,000 women aged 15 to 44, nearly a 25% fall since 2010, and the steepest decline nationwide. Fertility is at 1.48, which falls below the replacement rate. Although Colorado's median household income mirrors California's, a recent study found that a household of four needs an income of $108,000 in 2025 just to scrape by. In Denver proper, the median household income is $94,157 — nearly $14,000 short of affording a modest family lifestyle. Similar factors, throughout Colorado's metropolitan areas, render the state comfortably livable only for those with solid six-figure wages, high net worths, or what frustrated Boulder residents commonly refer to as “trust funders” or “trustafarians” — residents gifted with inherited wealth. Colorado's new economic strains, high crime rates, and the sanctuary misstep have tested its historic grit. Yet, data portend a future that could make California look stable and equitable by comparison. Colorado is far from hopeless — the climate, awe-inspiring terrain, and entertainment amenities will outlive trends, and even humanity's existence — but the culture and economy tell a cautionary tale of a far-left, central planning agenda gone mad.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A surprise victory by Pakistani Chinese-made jet fighters in an air battle with Western-made Indian aircraft has triggered alarm in the global defense industry. U.S. officials told Reuters that Chinese-made Pakistani J-10 aircraft shot down French-made Indian Rafale jets with Chinese PL-15 air-to-air missiles. Though the J-10 was introduced in 2004, China's lack of direct foreign engagements means it has never seen a combat deployment prior to Wednesday. Islamabad was quick to boast of its victory. “Not Just Defence — It's Dominance in the Skies! Pakistan Shatters the Rafale's Streak of Invincibility with Unmatched Precision and Readiness, Becoming the First Ever Force to Shoot Down Rafale Jet Since Its Combat Debut in 2001. “Air warfare communities in China, the U.S. and a number of European countries will be extremely interested to try and get as much ground truth as they can on tactics, techniques, procedures, what kit was used, what worked and what didn't,” Douglas Barrie, senior fellow for military aerospace at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, told Reuters. Pakistan's Foreign Minister claimed that its fighters only targeted Indian jets that fired first, limiting the number of Indian aircraft downed. “This is why only five jets were taken down. “You have arguably China's most capable weapon against the West's most capable weapon, if indeed it was being carried; we don't know that,” Barrie said. It is something that the U.S. military pays a lot of attention to,” a defense industry executive added to Reuters. Debris showcased by Indian officials and shared on social media appears to confirm that at least one of the shoot-downs was done by a PL-15. Another intact PL-15 was recovered and showed off by Indian authorities. Scant confirmed details remain regarding the Wednesday engagement, but one senior Pakistani security source told CNN that the dogfight was the “largest and longest in recent aviation history,” involving roughly 125 aircraft over an hour period. Opposing aircraft fired missiles at targets sometimes over 100 miles away. The source said that both sides were afraid of a similar humiliation. Though Pakistan has also modernized its F-16s since, the aircraft didn't take part in Wednesday's engagement. The Eurasian Times reported that Uzbekistan is currently deciding between purchasing the J-10 and Rafale to modernize its air force. Egypt is allegedly interested in the J-10 as well. Chinese social media users mocked the Indians over their loss, with one group posting a video to social media showing people dressed up as Indians bemoaning their loss of the aircraft. So now Chinese are mocking India for losing Rafale fighter jets. This video is going viral on Chinese TikTok. Wars between allied countries are often used as a testing ground for opposing defense industries. During the Cold War, the U.S. and Soviet defense industries used Israel and its Arab opponents as testing grounds to view their weapons' performance before a hypothetical hot conflict. The same pattern appears to be repeated in India-Pakistan, with the United States and China eager to view how Chinese weapons would perform in a possible war over Taiwan.</p>
