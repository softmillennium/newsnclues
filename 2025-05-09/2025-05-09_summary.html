Officials float idea of compact of free association (Cofa), used by US to keep close ties with Pacific Island nations

US officials are discussing a plan to pull Greenland into America's sphere of influence using a type of agreement that the United States has used to keep close ties with several Pacific Island nations, according to two US officials and another person familiar with the discussions.

Under the plan being considered, the Trump administration would propose to Greenland's leaders that the island enter into a so-called compact of free association, or Cofa, with the United States.

While the precise details of Cofa agreements – which have only ever been extended to the small island nations of Micronesia, the Marshall Islands and Palau – vary depending on the signatory, the US government typically provides many essential services, from mail delivery to emergency management to military protection. In exchange, the US military operates freely in Cofa countries and trade with the US is largely duty-free.

Donald Trump, who during his first administration floated the idea of acquiring Greenland, has pressed even harder since taking office in January, refusing to rule out taking the island by force. Denmark, which governs the island, has sharply rebuffed the idea.

A Cofa agreement would stop short of Trump's ambition to make the island of 57,000 people a part of the US. It is not the only Greenland plan on the table, the sources said, and it would face many practical hurdles.

Some officials at the national security council and the national energy dominance council, which Trump established, are involved in the talks, two of the sources said. The national economic council is also involved, one of those sources added.

Cofa agreements have previously been inked with independent countries, and Greenland would probably need to separate from Denmark for such a plan to proceed. While polls show Greenlanders are interested in independence, surveys also show most do not want to be part of the US. A Cofa – which cedes significant autonomy to Washington – could be viewed with similar skepticism.

One of those involved in the discussions is Markus Thomi, the acting senior director for the national security council's western hemisphere section, according to two of the sources. David Copley, the key mining official on the NEDC, is also involved in the talks, one of those sources said.

The White House did not respond to a request for comment, nor did the Danish embassy or Greenland's representative office in Washington.

The interior department, which plays a key role in administering Cofa agreements through its office of insular affairs, also did not respond.
 Washington's existing Cofa agreements with Palau, the Marshall Islands and Micronesia are seen across the US political spectrum as important for countering China's growing influence in the Asia Pacific region.

Still, such accords have hit snags in the past.

Republican lawmakers have at times opposed elements of the budget allotted to fund Cofa agreements, creating deep frustrations in the countries that rely on the funds.
  Signing a Cofa also offers no guarantee that a nation will be immune from influence operations by US rivals.

Danish leaders have not been approached about the idea and have not had any substantive discussions with the White House about Greenland's future status, one senior European official said. Danish officials have publicly rejected the idea of the US acquiring Greenland, and insist Greenlanders must determine their future.

Administration officials argue the island is crucial to the US due to its deposits of minerals that have important hi-tech and military applications, but which remain untapped due to labor shortages, scarce infrastructure and various other challenges.

An administration official told Reuters the US was helping Greenland diversify its economy and gain greater economic independence from Denmark. The Development Finance Corporation and Export-Import Bank could play a role in that process, the official said.

The official said a Cofa “could be an elegant way to address some of the concerns that we have when it comes to Greenland security” but did not otherwise comment on the possibility of such an accord.

Trump administration understood to have pushed for requirements to be attached to deal in effort to freeze out Chinese steel

The US deal on steel tariffs imposes conditions on the “nature of ownership” of British plants as part of its efforts to freeze out Chinese steel, it has emerged.

It is understood Donald Trump's administration pushed for requirements to be attached to the steel deal to ensure that the Chinese-owned British Steel plant in Scunthorpe was not used by Beijing as a backdoor to circumvent US tariffs.

Government sources say Washington is understood to be reassured that Scunthorpe is now in effect controlled by Jonathan Reynolds, the business secretary, and is likely not to come back under the direction of Jingye Group, its Chinese owners.

However, before the UK government took steps to seize control of British Steel last month the US had been concerned that the Scunthorpe plant could have been used as a base for processing Chinese steel to take advantage of lower tariffs.

The US-UK deal, agreed on Thursday, has come as a relief to the car and steel industries, which had been worried about job losses, although some of the terms are still unclear. It is set to bring car tariffs down to 10% and steel tariffs to zero if conditions are met.

Peter Mandelson, Britain's ambassador to the US, said the deal had immediately prevented job losses at Jaguar Land Rover's plant in the West Midlands. “This deal has saved those jobs,” Mandelson said in an interview on CNN. “That's a pretty big achievement, in my view, and I'm very pleased that the president has signed it.”

Government sources said JLR had planned for imminent cuts among its 30,000 staff in the UK but had not informed unions in the hope that a deal with the US could be struck to eliminate the 25% tariffs on exports of cars to the US.

Keir Starmer told ITV on Friday that the deal would be “measured in thousands and thousands of jobs that will be protected, saved and will thrive as a result” in steel, cars and in pharmaceuticals.

Government sources said the UK was still working with the US to define the exact requirements for the quota of steel allowed to be exported tariff-free, looking at the security of the supply chain and on ownership, so that the deal could be introduced as soon as possible.

The text of the agreement makes clear that US steel tariffs of 25% will be lowered only if certain US requirements are met on the “security of supply chains” and the “nature of ownership of the relevant production facilities”.

It says: “Understanding the United Kingdom will meet these requirements, the United States will promptly construct a quota at most favored nation (MFN) rates for UK steel and aluminum and certain derivative steel and aluminum products.”

Howard Lutnick, the US commerce secretary, boasted on Thursday: “The British government as part of this deal nationalised British Steel.”

UK sources said the US had not pushed Britain towards nationalising British Steel but had been impressed with the action taken against its Chinese owners before Easter.

Chrysa Glystra, the director of trade and economic policy at UK Steel, the industry body said: “The terms of the deal highlight a number of hoops to jump through before the UK steel sector can see the benefits of this deal.”

The UK exports about 200,000 metric tons of steel per year to the US, which is worth about £400m.

Glystra said it was still not clear what the terms and conditions of the tariff exemption were or when it would kick in, underlining the admission by government sources that they settled on a quick deal to “bank progress” and save jobs in the car industry.

“To fully assess the impact on our sector, we will need to fully understand the supply chain conditions that need to be met, how the quotas will be defined and when these will take effect,” Glystra added.

Trump, who has now turned his attention to the first trade talks between the US and China in Geneva on Saturday, said the “final details [of the UK deal] are being written up in the coming weeks”.

There had been reports that the deal in effect handed the US a veto on Chinese investment in UK sectors covered by the deal but No 10 said this was not the case.

The brutal beating of the 29-year-old during a traffic stop was caught on video, provoking widespread outrage.

We go to Memphis for an update after jurors acquitted three former Memphis police officers of the murder of Tyre Nichols, a 29-year-old Black father who died after the officers brutally beat him during a traffic stop in January 2023. The group beating was caught on video, provoking widespread outrage and calls for police reform. The three officers still face sentencing after they were convicted of separate federal charges, along with two other officers who pleaded guilty to the state charges and will not stand trial. “A lot of us were shocked,” says Amber Sherman, of the Memphis community's response. Sherman, a community organizer and member of Black Lives Matter Memphis, joined the family Thursday at a community vigil and protest. She warns this latest acquittal will “embolden” Memphis police as they continue to “do whatever they want.”

Explosions heard in Indian Kashmir as witnesses say attacks are heavier than those reported on Thursday

Pakistan has been accused of launching a fresh wave of drone strikes against India on Friday night, with projectiles reported over the states of Indian-administered Kashmir and Punjab.

Explosions were heard in areas of Indian Kashmir and the bright flash of intercepted drones were seen over the Punjab city of Amritsar. Witnesses said the drone strikes were heavier than those that took place on Thursday night.

Earlier in the day, India accused Pakistan of launching an attack using up to 400 drones to target cities, military bases and places of worship across the north of the country on Thursday night, as the Pakistani military said it would “not de-escalate with India”.

India claimed to have intercepted hundreds of Pakistani drones, which it said came across the border into Indian-administered Kashmir, as well as Rajasthan, Punjab and Gujarat. It said a first wave of drones came on Thursday evening and another wave hit close to dawn on Friday.

India said it had launched four drone strikes at Pakistan, directly targeting military defence infrastructure.

In a press conference on Friday, the Indian military alleged that Pakistan's drone attacks on Thursday had targeted a gurdwara, a Sikh place of worship, injuring a civilian, and that the drones had also targeted Christian churches.

“The targeting of temples, gurdwaras, convents is a new low by Pakistan,” said India's foreign secretary, Vikram Misri.

Pakistan's information minister, Attaullah Tarar, denied the drone attacks, calling the Indian army statement “baseless and misleading”, and said Pakistan had not undertaken any “offensive actions” within Indian Kashmir or beyond Pakistan's border.

However, a Pakistan security official said that Thursday night's drone strikes were just to “heat things up” before Pakistan launched a fully fledged retaliatory attack. “When we hit back, everyone will know,” they said.

Misri called Pakistan's denial of the drone attacks “farcical” and “another example of its duplicity”.

The tit-for tat allegations were yet another alarming confrontation between India and Pakistan, two nuclear-armed countries, since India's missile strikes on nine sites in Pakistan on Wednesday killed 31 people. Those strikes in turn were India's response to an attack in Indian-administered Kashmir late last month, in which militants killed 25 Hindu tourists and a guide.

Pakistan said it considered the attack an “act of war” and vowed to retaliate.

“We will not de-escalate – with the damages India did on our side, they should take a hit,” Pakistan's military spokesperson, Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry, said at a media briefing. “So far we have been protecting ourselves but they will get an answer in our own timing.”

The Pakistani army gave new details of Wednesday's strike in which it claimed Pakistan had deployed more than 100 planes to ward off the strikes by Indian planes that carried out the attacks from Indian airspace. It said the two sides had engaged in an hour-long aerial dogfight.

Pakistan claimed it used Chinese-made weapons and ground air defences to help bring down five Indian fighter jets. India has yet to respond to allegations that Pakistan shot down its planes, but debris from at least three fighter jets, including that of at least one elite French Rafale jet, was seen in Indian-administered Kashmir and Punjab.

The worst-affected area from Thursday's drone attacks was the city of Jammu, in India-administered Kashmir, which is close to the line of control (LoC), the heavily militarised border dividing the disputed region of Kashmir between India and Pakistan.

Despite decades of conflict in the region, people in the city said they had never witnessed such an aerial onslaught. They described a barrage of fiery projectiles streaking across the sky as air-raid sirens wailed and the city was plunged into an enforced blackout overnight.

Videos shared with the Guardian showed glowing orange dots piercing Jammu's night sky before flashing and fading – probably drones intercepted by Indian air defence systems. Local officials confirmed debris from the projectiles had been recovered from several areas, including densely populated neighbourhoods in and around Jammu, but no casualties were reported.

Ajay Lakhotra, a 24-year-old student in Kanachak, a suburban area close to the Pakistan border, said: “Skirmishes and exchanges of gunfire are nothing new to us, but what happened on Thursday night was extraordinary. We saw fiery objects launching from the Pakistani side; the barrage was so intense it looked like fireworks lighting up the sky. Flames streaked everywhere. It was terrifying to witness.”

He said it had quietened down after midnight but restarted at 4am. “Most of us couldn't sleep all night.”

Lethal aggression continued along the LoC as soldiers from both sides continued to fire across the border, killing and injuring civilians. With Pakistan's threats to retaliate still looming, Indian-administered Kashmir and states across northern India remained on high alert.

The mounting aggressions and allegations have resulted in a growing information – and disinformation – war on both sides of the border.

India accused Pakistan of a flood of dangerous disinformation and “grossly exaggerated claims” across its media, including reports that dozens of Indian drones had been shot down over Pakistan, calling it a “gross misrepresentation of facts”.

“What should have been a moment of international reckoning against terror has instead been manipulated into a disinformation war, where truth is the first casualty,” India's ministry of information and broadcasting said in a statement.

However, mainstream Indian media has also been flooded with misinformation and fake or unsubstantiated reports, including false claims of an attack on Karachi port, reports of a military coup and the arrest of Pakistan's army chief. Images of Turkish military personnel were broadcast as “captured Pakistani pilots”. Images of powerful bomb strikes on Gaza have been widely shared as showing India's attack on Pakistan.

As part of its alleged crackdown on misinformation, India ordered the social media platform X to block more than 8,000 accounts, including those of Pakistani politicians, celebrities and media organisations, as well as Indian independent news organisations and Indian-Kashmiri journalists.

The move was confirmed by X in a statement, which said in many cases the Indian government had not provided legal justification for the blocks.

However, X said it had no choice but to comply and remove the 8,000 accounts or it would face “penalties including significant fines and imprisonment of the company's local employees”.

“Tabkha: Recipes From Under the Rubble” reimagines traditional Palestinian cuisine amid genocide.

“Tabkha: Recipes From Under the Rubble” reimagines traditional Palestinian cuisine amid genocide.

In the heart of Gaza, during the darkest days of Israel's 18-month genocide, Chef Mona Zahed continued to cook. At the age of 38, with four children depending on her, Zahed became a beacon of hope for her family as she navigated despair and a lack of food while continuing her culinary practice. Her passion for cooking not only fueled her survival but also culminated in the release of her cookbook, Tabkha: Recipes From Under the Rubble. The book, which showcases 20 traditional Palestinian recipes and includes innovative alternatives born from extreme hardship, is a crucial documentation of Palestinian cultural tradition amid Israel's genocidal campaign of erasure. Published by Slingshot Books, Tabkha also features illustrations made by 21 artists.

“I'm a science graduate and a proud mother of four: Mohammad, 16, Hayat, 15, Sarah, 14, and Zahed, 10,” Zahed told Truthout. “We live in a home that's partially fallen apart, in an area of Gaza that's seen a lot of destruction. Many buildings are just piles of rubble, and we struggle to find basic needs like water for washing and drinking. The streets are cluttered with trash and debris, but despite it all, we're grateful to be back in our homes and are determined to make a life here.”

The biting cold and absence of basic utilities highlight the challenges she endures. “It's freezing here because we have no windows to block the chilly air. We cover the gaps with nylon, which doesn't really keep us warm for our children, but at least it's a step up from the tent we lived in while we were displaced.”

Before the genocide began, Zahed ran a teaching center and her husband managed his own pharmacy while their kids attended school. Their home shared a neighborhood with several international organizations.

“Our life before the war was beautiful, Alhamdulillah. We enjoyed everything around us and were on the verge of financial stability. I taught at the center from 8 am to 5 pm,” Zahed shared. Her commitment to her children's education was clear: “I would take a break from 10-11 am to cook and care for them before heading back to teach.” She even brought her young child, Zahed, along with her, proudly noting, “My children are the top in their classes, Alhamdulillah. I always tried to ensure that their education remained unaffected by my work or their father's, but when the war hit, everything changed.”

Zahed says she'll never forget the Israeli assault's first day. “I was getting my children ready for school for their exams, and at first, we didn't understand what was happening; we thought it was just rain or thunder. Confusion and worry set in as I kept them indoors while we followed the news, struggling to process the shock of the unfolding chaos. Three days later, our neighborhood, known for its towers and buildings, became one of the first bombed, prompting us to evacuate as the danger drew alarmingly near to our home.”

Amid the attacks, Zahed found creative ways to deal with the scarcity in her cooking. “During the genocide, I crafted recipes from the limited resources we had due to starvation and food shortages.” Despite the dire circumstances, she worked hard to uplift her children's spirits. “They were satisfied with what I made, even eating meals they had previously disliked because they simply had no other choice.”

“Moreover, there was no gas, which made meal preparation incredibly time-consuming; we had to cook things in advance,” Zahed explains.

“Sometimes, when we found a single apple, we felt a wave of happiness, slicing it thinly to share among four of us once a week,” Zahed said. Necessity demanded innovation in her recipes: “When yeast was unavailable, I experimented with fermenting dough. With no fresh fish around, I used canned tuna to create fesikh, sometimes frying it and other times baking it with vegetables. I transformed luncheon meat into various dishes, frying it or crafting it into shawarma, while canned beef became a savory grilled delight with parsley and onion. I even added vermicelli to our lentil soup, constantly adapting to make the most of what little we had.”

Now two months into a total blockade on all aid into Gaza, tens of thousands of Palestinian children are in urgent need of medical care due to malnutrition.

Even these meals, with their alterations borne out of need, could be logistically difficult to put together. “Most of our food consisted of canned items, which were hard to find and often too expensive,” said Zahed. “As a woman and a mother, I bore a heavy responsibility during those [first] 15 months, looking after many people. Those were tough days, especially when we ran out of flour; it broke my heart to see my children without bread. We often spent our days eating just pieces of biscuits from aid packages, only two at a time per packet.”

These extreme food shortages were not unintended by Israel, but were deliberate — “a tactic of genocide,” according to a UN report from July 2024:

Israel made its intentions to starve everyone in Gaza explicit, implemented its plans and predictably created a famine throughout Gaza. Tracking the geography of Israel's starvation tactics alongside Israeli officials' statements confirms its intent. Israel opened with a total siege that weakened all Palestinians in Gaza. Then, Israel used starvation to induce forcible transfer, harm and death against people in the north, pushing people into the south, only to starve, bombard and kill people in newly created refugee camps in the south.

The consequences have been devastating. “Never in post-war history had a population been made to go hungry so quickly and so completely as was the case for the 2.3 million Palestinians living in Gaza,” the report stated.

Israel has also repeatedly targeted Palestinian cooks and food aid providers, killing those who are striving to feed a starving population.

Now two months into a total blockade on all aid into Gaza, tens of thousands of Palestinian children are in urgent need of medical care due to malnutrition. Dozens of Palestinians have died have died due to Israel's starvation policy. Amid the longest and most encompassing blockade ever imposed on the besieged territory, international food organizations in Gaza have said their supplies are gone. Nearly 290,000 children may perish soon if food is not allowed in, Al Jazeera reported.

Before conditions further plummeted, Zahed found ways to prioritize her children's nutrition. “Sometimes, I would take the leftover white rice from lunch, add spices and seasonings so that my children would accept it for dinner.” She made use of every available ingredient: “We used dry bread in lentil soup or in salads called ‘fattoush,'” showcasing her resourcefulness in ensuring her family's sustenance amid scarcity.

Zahed explained to Truthout how the genocide has changed her. “The war affected me a lot, but it proved to me that I'm strong. It has made me older and taught me many lessons, placing many responsibilities on my shoulders, yet we remained steadfast.” Those responsibilities came under the most harrowing of conditions. “One of the most horrifying days was the night we were forced to flee our home when they planned to bomb the tower nearby. Even when I ask my children about their most terrifying memories of the war, they also mention this night.”

“Another terrifying moment was when we fled from Deir al-Balah to Khan Younis, traversing streets filled with tanks and snipers. We truly believed that it could be our last moment. With no other choice, we pushed through, surviving by a miracle while witnessing people being injured and killed right before our eyes.”

Zahed mourned the profound loss of Gaza's beauty due since October 7, 2023. “Just a day before the war erupted, I strolled along the beach, expressing to my brother how lovely Gaza was while yearning for job opportunities and development. Now, Gaza feels like a graveyard; returning home, I barely recognized the streets, filled with sorrow as if we had regressed a century. We hope for a day when it can be rebuilt.”

“While the world sympathizes with us, many see us merely as numbers. Our suffering, perceived as normal to some, overshadows our identities; we are not just statistics but individuals with families and friends. The ongoing violence reduces us to mere figures, yet we are people deserving of a dignified life.”

Zahed's book highlights Palestinian cultural tradition during a time when Israeli forces are trying to erase everything about Palestinian life. It is an attempt to save this heritage and traditional food even with the absence of some basic ingredients.

Despite the horrors surrounding her, Zahed found she could engage with her children through food: “My children were confident in my cooking. When we stumbled upon ingredients for a meal we hadn't had in a long time, their joy was palpable as they exclaimed, ‘Mom, this is the Gazan food!' — a phrase they often repeated.” She believes that her passion for cooking reflects her people's resilience: “All recipes reflect the strength of the Palestinian woman. The war has shown us that we can find alternatives and create something from nothing. Throughout the hardship and starvation, it became clear that Palestinians possess an incredible ability to adapt and innovate in dire circumstances.”

Amid the struggles of displacement in Nuseirat camp, Zahed recounts the daily challenges her family faced while living in temporary shelter. “Living in a sixth-floor apartment, my son Mohammed would carry 20-liter gallons of water up the stairs as we needed about 4-5 gallons daily. We cooked over an open fire, relying on basic staples like rice, spaghetti and soup, often only having bread once a day due to the high cost of vegetables.” During these hardships, her passion for cooking brought her joy: “Whenever I cook, I feel a sense of happiness. Even during the war, people would reach out for my recipes, and it fills me with pride to help others in this way. I love crafting delicious meals, often picturing the ingredients before I start cooking.”

The cookbook wasn't just about recipes — it's about preserving culture in the face of devastation.

Tabkha was inspired by a Japanese friend, who encouraged her to compile a diary of recipes for sale. In the book, she included 15 traditional Palestinian recipes, covering both desserts and savory dishes. In the midst of war, she took the initiative to document her culinary legacy, creating videos that showcased her improvisation with the ingredients around her. Her cookbook features a variety of dishes, including both desserts and savory meals, along with what she refers to as the “war alternatives” — all based on innovative recipes inspired by traditions passed down from her ancestors. It also showcases the work of 21 artists who illustrated the recipes, each in their unique styles.

“I loved to put that in a book because we want to reach our voice to the world. Every culture has its guide, and when food recipes spread widely, people start getting attracted to it and start to ask who created it,” Zahed said. Everything about putting the book together — from the improvisation to the ancestral knowledge to the spread of Palestinian culinary tradition — serves as an act of resistance during genocide, as the Israeli state attempts to erase Palestinian existence.

The cookbook wasn't just about recipes — it's about preserving culture in the face of devastation. “Our recipes tell the world stories of our history, cause and that we exist. Maqlouba, Maftool, and Sumaqiyaa are all dishes that represent our people. Each time Palestinian food becomes a trend online and I see people from all over the world making it, I feel proud that the world knows Gaza and that we are not forgotten,” Zahed said.

Through creative improvisation, inherited knowledge, and the richness of Palestinian food, the book documents life, love and identity as Israel attempts to destroy and starve Gaza.

Zahed expressed a strong desire to restart her culinary explorations. “I want to work again on my cooking project, but gas is expensive, and other materials are hard to find.” Still, Zahed envisions a future where she has her own business — a shop to share her food, and a kitchen specifically for women.

“My message to the world is that Palestinians in Gaza are humans who feel and have dreams,” Zahed said. “We deserve to live peacefully. We will start again. We are strong people who don't lose faith. We have hope.”

As legislative attacks on unhoused people ramp up, disabled people are on the front lines.

As legislative attacks on unhoused people ramp up, disabled people are on the front lines.

The U.S. approach to addressing homelessness in the wake of a recent Supreme Court ruling will maim and kill people, housing rights advocates and experts tell Truthout. It will disproportionately harm disabled Americans, who comprise more than a quarter of the nation's population and about half of its unhoused population.

The court's decision in Grants Pass v. Johnson, issued in June 2024, allows local governments to cite or jail unhoused people for camping on public lands even if there is no shelter available to them. The ruling de facto criminalized homelessness nationwide.

Meanwhile, since it came down, state governments have also given the green light to ramped-up policing as a response to homelessness. The Trump administration has also expressed support for carceral approaches, including banning urban camping and forcibly relocating homeless people into psychiatric institutions or detention camps.

“I'm terrified of being [detained] in an encampment when that starts happening, and I think that it will if things continue the way they are going,” Finn, an unhoused and disabled resident of Portland, Oregon, who is using only their first name due to safety concerns, told Truthout.

Homelessness in the U.S. reached a record high in 2024, with the Department of Housing and Urban Development recording more than 771,000 unhoused Americans during its annual point-in-time count. That marked a staggering 18 percent increase from the number of unhoused people recorded at the previous annual count.

At the same time, policy makers have begun to turn away from the evidence-based Housing First model for addressing homelessness and embrace punitive approaches. Right-wingers have long advocated for the carceral approach, and Democratic lawmakers have begun to echo them in recent years, with cities, including San Francisco and Portland, Oregon, corralling unhoused residents in encampments and enforcing camping bans.

Disabled Americans are at particular risk from the nationwide trend to criminalize homelessness. They are overrepresented among the nation's unhoused population due to several factors. Policies that allow employers to pay subminimum wages to disabled workers and place caps on the savings or income of recipients of Supplemental Security Income (SSI) and some Medicaid benefits contribute to increased poverty among disabled people and render them less able to prepare financially for a crisis.

People with disabilities also experience discrimination in housing, health care, employment and wages, making it difficult for some to secure stable housing and earn the income needed to meet their basic needs. These forms of discrimination are compounded for women, people of color and trans people. The U.S. also has a significant shortage of affordable and accessible housing.

Experts warn that even more disabled people are likely to slip into poverty and homelessness as the Trump administration eyes cuts to Medicaid, slashes funding for protection and advocacy agencies, undermines public health programs and pursues pharmaceutical tariffs that are likely to make medications more expensive. These are concerns that keep David Zoltan, a Chicago-based human rights activist, awake at night. “I am measuring my life right now in months,” they told Truthout.

“Nobody goes through homelessness unscathed.”

Zoltan, an amputee who lives with chronic illnesses, including complex post-traumatic stress disorder, experienced homelessness for several months almost a decade ago. While they have been off the streets for years, the roof over their head has never stopped feeling tenuous, and conditions have worsened since Donald Trump began rolling back federal support programs. “I survive because I have SSDI, Medicare, Medicaid, a housing voucher and SNAP benefits,” Zoltan told Truthout. “And still, I've literally had to stop paying my electric bill just to be able to make the rest of my bills work.”

Supplemental Security Disability Income (SSDI) provides monthly payments to individuals with health conditions that limit or prevent them from working. SSI provides payments to disabled and older adults with low incomes. These benefits have lost 20 percent of their buying power since 2010 as rising consumer prices outstrip annual cost-of-living adjustments to the payments, according to an analysis by The Senior Citizens League.

Like Zoltan, several disabled people who spoke to Truthout for this article expressed concern about rising living costs outstripping support programs. Janine Harris, an unhoused resident of Grants Pass, Oregon, the town that brought the now infamous Supreme Court case, also noted the disproportionate share of medical debt shouldered by disabled Americans. “There are disabled people out here and elderly people out here who cannot afford to live in a house because the rents have gotten so high, and some of them are using credit cards to pay off medical debt,” Harris told Truthout. “They don't have the money or the medical or housing benefits to deal with that, and so they end up losing their homes, and they're on the street.”

Once a disabled individual loses their housing, they face having to navigate homelessness services that are often inaccessible. Barriers to accessing homeless shelters are ubiquitous, according to experts and advocates who spoke to Truthout. “They may not be physically accessible. They may not allow people to bring service animals. They may not allow people to store medications or get other kinds of really elementary accommodations,” Tom Stenson, deputy legal director at Disability Rights Oregon (DRO), told Truthout.

Miranda DeNovo, a New Yorker who has spent the last year advocating for a friend with myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) and long COVID who was made homeless by caregiver abuse, told Truthout that the pair have been in contact with over a dozen housing and case management organizations, none of which has been able to provide the support needed to help DeNovo's friend transition into housing. DeNovo's friend was not able to access domestic violence shelters because they require regular visits from a caregiver, which the shelters could not accommodate due to privacy concerns.

“When we asked them to recommend alternatives, every single service provider just said my friend would need to go into a nursing home,” DeNovo told Truthout. “I'm just so frustrated at the lack of awareness of this issue, that sick people are still being pushed into institutions even though we fought for programs to prevent that.”

For many long COVID patients and others who are immunocompromised or concerned about the dangers of COVID-19 and other infectious diseases, the crowded indoor environment and lack of infection control measures at most communal shelters make those spaces inaccessible.

Meanwhile, Finn — the Portland, Oregon, resident — told Truthout that they once left a shelter even though they had nowhere else to go because they witnessed shelter staff physically abuse other disabled residents and feared for their own safety.

When shelters are inaccessible or hostile to disabled people, individuals are often forced to stay outdoors in conditions that can exacerbate health issues. Harris struggled to live in a local communal shelter due to her claustrophobia, which manifests in panic attacks. Other shelters would not accept her service animal. Since she began living outdoors, her arthritis and chronic migraines have worsened. “My health is deteriorating every single day; I can feel it,” she told Truthout.

Jeffrey Dickerson, another unhoused resident of Grants Pass, has had a similar experience. Dickerson has been intermittently unhoused since experiencing an aneurysm that left him unable to work in 2006. He is unable to save enough from his SSDI payments to cover the first and last month's rent and security deposit needed to move into most apartments.

“These proposals are not just criminalizing being poor, but they're criminalizing having a disability.”

But sleeping outside on a gravel lot, where Grants Pass lawmakers have sequestered the town's unhoused population after banning urban camping, has worsened Dickerson's chronic nerve pain. That pain is a symptom of neuropathy, which also causes weakness in his feet, making it difficult for him to walk on the uneven gravel. “It's not just physical either,” Dickerson told Truthout. “It's emotional, it's stressful.”

Zoltan told Truthout that for nondisabled and disabled people alike, the experience of homelessness can lead to new health problems. “Nobody goes through homelessness unscathed,” they said. “To what extent it is disabling, that's going to differ from person to person, but I would argue that it has an effect on everybody.”

For disabled people living on the street, the recent proliferation of policies criminalizing homelessness has compounded dangers. At least 150 cities in 32 states have passed or strengthened ordinances banning outdoor camping since the Grants Pass v. Johnson decision last summer.

“Cities out there are creating restrictions on camping, and sitting, and lying down in public that carry with them some implicit understanding that you have to be able to move around, you have to be able to carry your tent around, or you have to be able to move across a particular area that's not paved or doesn't have a safe way for people who use wheelchairs to get around,” DRO's Stenson told Truthout. “These proposals are not just criminalizing being poor, but they're criminalizing having a disability.”

Those who cannot meet the new demands are more likely to be swept up in crackdowns, raising the prospect of citations, arrests, police violence and confiscation of belongings. Unhoused individuals interviewed by Truthout reported having necessities — including mobility aids, medications and identity documents — taken in police sweeps. Recent reporting in San Francisco showed that the city confiscated dozens of wheelchairs and walkers in sweeps of homeless encampments in 2024.

The disability community is not only on the front lines of increasing violence against unhoused people nationwide, but it is also front and center in fighting anti-homeless policies in the courts. A lawsuit filed in February 2025 by DRO and the Oregon Law Center against the City of Grants Pass is one example. Harris and Dickerson are both plaintiffs in the suit, which asserts that the town's new policies on homelessness violate Oregon laws, including laws prohibiting discrimination against disabled people. A judge halted enforcement of the city's rules on March 28, 2025, while the lawsuit moves forward.

While Grants Pass Police continue to cite unhoused people for non-enjoined sections of the law, such as for leaving out trash or having a too-large tent footprint, there is no indication that they have violated the court's order, according to DRO.

Legal battles like this one have been made more complex by last year's Supreme Court decision, which advocates said has empowered anti-homeless contingents within government and the public. Still, Stenson told Truthout that the lawsuits send a message that “the rights of people with disabilities have to be respected.” If recent anti-homeless legislation goes unchallenged, Stenson fears that under the policies, “it would just be illegal for hundreds of people to exist.”

At this moment, we are witnessing a terrifying array of anti-democratic tactics to silence political opposition, increase surveillance and expand authoritarian reach.

Truthout is appealing for your support as Trump and his sycophants crack down on political speech. Nonprofits like Truthout could be caught in Trump's crosshairs as he attacks dissenting groups with bad faith lawsuits and targeted harassment of journalists.

As well, these attacks come at a time when independent journalism is most needed. The right-wing corporate takeover of media has left reliable outlets few and far between, with even fewer providing their work at no cost to the reader. Who will be there to hold the fascists to account, if not media like Truthout?

Pilot error was the root cause of a military helicopter crash near Pine Valley, California, last year that claimed the lives of five U.S. Marines, an investigation has found.

The CH-53E Super Stallion, callsign “TIGER 43,” was conducting a routine flight from Imperial County Airfield to Marine Corps Air Station Miramar when it crashed into a mountain ridge on Feb. 6, 2024.

The investigators confirmed there was no evidence of material or mechanical failure in the helicopter.

The five Marines lost in the crash were Lance Cpl. Donovan Davis, Sgt. Alec Langen, Capt. Benjamin Moulton, Capt. Jack Casey, and Capt. Miguel Nava, all members of Marine Heavy Helicopter Squadron 361, Marine Aircraft Group 16, 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing, based at Marine Corps Air Station Miramar.

The helicopter disappeared late on Feb. 6, 2024, during a storm, and its wreckage was found the next morning near Pine Valley. Recovery efforts were disturbed by rough terrain and severe weather, and Marines stayed with the fallen until their bodies could be recovered, in keeping with the Marine Corps' tradition of never leaving a Marine behind.

“We have been confronted with a tragedy that is every service family's worst fear,” Lt. Col. Nicholas J. Harvey, commanding officer of the squadron, said at the time of the accident. “The Flying Tigers family stands strong and includes the friends and community who have supported our squadron during this challenging time. We will get through this together.”

The May 7 statement said the investigation faced some limitations, including the inability to access certain onboard flight data and obtain exact real-time weather information. Investigators used available data and simulations to reconstruct the events leading to the crash.

Following a review of the investigation, the commanding general of the 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing relieved the HMH-361 commanding officer of command on Nov. 18, 2024, citing a loss of trust and confidence.

While the officer's actions were not found to be a direct cause of the crash, the commanding general determined that he had demonstrated poor judgment and should have exercised greater care in his duties, according to the investigation report.

In response to the findings, the Marine Corps has implemented multiple changes to policy and training across the 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing. The Corps also extended gratitude to the first responders and investigative teams involved in the aftermath and investigation of the crash.

Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre listens to questions from journalists as he arrives on Parliament Hill for a meeting of the Conservative caucus after the federal election, in Ottawa, on May 6.Justin Tang/The Canadian Press

Allan Levine is a historian and the author of King: A Life Guided by the Hand of Destiny. His next book, The Dollar-A-Year Men: How the Best Business Brains in Canada Helped to Win the Second World War, will be published in October.

Going into the 1921 federal election, Arthur Meighen was feeling mildly confident. Nearly 17 months earlier, the Conservative leader had succeeded Sir Robert Borden, who had led the Unionist government – a coalition of Conservatives and some English-speaking Liberals – during the First World War. Nearly all the Unionist Liberals had returned to their own party, led by William Lyon Mackenzie King. 

But Meighen was in far more trouble than he was willing to admit. He was detested in Quebec for being the architect of conscription and hated in the West for his unwavering support of the protective tariff.

King's Liberals won the slimmest of majority governments with 118 of 235 seats. For the first time in a Canadian federal election, the Conservatives fell from first to third, winning only 50 seats. More surprising was that the Progressive Party, a loose political association formed in 1919 by farmers who had lost patience with both traditional parties, combined with farmers' parties from Ontario and Alberta to win a total of 62 seats. 

Like Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre, who recently lost his Ottawa-area seat in Carleton, Meighen was defeated in Manitoba's Portage la Prairie by his Progressive opponent by 177 votes. He was “not very greatly surprised by the downfall of his regime,” writes Roger Graham, Meighen's biographer, but he was “sorely disappointed by the humiliating decisiveness of its rejection at the polls.” 

Still, there are always second chances in Canadian politics. Meighen did contemplate resigning, but decided against it: “A man is not much good, who after a period of unbroken success, cannot stand one reverse, however sharp and decisive,” Meighen wrote to a friend. 

In quick order, and before King was officially prime minister, a newly elected Conservative MP in the eastern Ontario riding of Grenville accepted a low-level civil-service job and resigned his seat. Much to King's dismay, Meighen easily won the by-election by 1,662 votes over his lone opponent from the Progressive Party. When the internally divided Progressives made clear that they had no desire to serve as the Official Opposition, Grenville's new MP was asked to serve as Opposition Leader.

Three years later, the tables were turned. In the 1925 federal election, King's Liberals came in second place with 99 of 245 seats, while Meighen's Conservatives won 116. Meighen assumed he would form a minority government, but King, as was his right, refused to relinquish power because he knew that the Progressives, who won 24 seats, would rather have him in power. And King was proven right – much to Meighen's incredulity.

But like Meighen in 1921, King lost his seat in the Southern Ontario riding of York North by 494 votes to Conservative Thomas Lennox. King later wrote of “feeling regret” at losing his seat, and he rationalized his loss to Mr. Lennox as being the result of “what money and whiskey can do.” Still, he was confident he would find and win in another riding in the near future – which he did early in 1926 in a by-election in Prince Albert, Sask. He appointed Charles McDonald, the Liberal MP who had won the riding, to the Senate.

A similar avenue is now open to Mr. Poilievre. Damien Kurek, a Conservative MP for the Alberta riding of Battle River‐Crowfoot since 2019, has decided to put the needs of the party leader ahead of his own by offering to resign. Winning there should not be a problem: Mr. Kurek got 46,000 more votes than the second-place Liberal candidate. And though the Prime Minister could take up to six months to call the by-election, Mark Carney has said he will do so “as soon as possible.” 

The other important factor, for leaders in this chastened purgatory, is to understand why you lost in the first place and alter your future strategy. Neither King nor Meighen did much soul-searching and carried on, however. Both blamed a myriad of factors for their respective electoral losses – except themselves. That approach mostly turned out better for King, though, because he innately understood that in Canadian politics, extreme and inflexible policies will never sustain long-term victory at the polls. King survived the debacle of 1925, a customs scandal and his famous constitutional fight with governor-general Byng, and went on to reign for many more years. 

However, in the 1945 election – King's last – he lost his seat in Prince Albert to the CCF by 159 votes. He easily won a by-election two months later in the Ontario riding of Glengarry, though he found the experience disappointing and somewhat humiliating. 

Meighen, on the other hand, was not flexible, especially on his unyielding faith in the pre-eminence of the British Empire and his sacred but alienating economic policies. He lost his seat again in the 1926 federal election, and after that resigned as Conservative leader. He returned as leader during the Second World War, but a 1942 by-election loss in the Toronto-area constituency of York South ended his political career.

Given Mr. Poilievre's supreme confidence and brash style, and the fact that his Conservatives won 20 more seats than they did in 2019, he seems far more likely to be a Meighen than a King. He, too, does not appear to grasp King's basic political tenet: That “in a country like ours it is particularly true that the art of government is largely one of seeking to reconcile rather than to exaggerate differences – to come as near as may be possible to the happy mean.” Mr. Poilievre's attack-dog shtick is sure to continue. 

Mr. Meighen titled his 1949 collection of speeches and essays Unrevised and Unrepented. That title might work as well for Mr. Poilievre's memoir, too, should he ever write it.

A Canadian flag flies in downtown Windsor, Ont., with skyline of Detroit in the background on April 1.  In Windsor, the unemployment rate jumped by 1.4 percentage points, reaching 10.7 per cent.Bill Pugliano/Getty Images

Canada lost more than 30,000 manufacturing jobs last month while Windsor, Ont., saw a jump in its unemployment rate as U.S. tariffs take aim at the automotive sector and feed into economic uncertainty. 

Statistics Canada's Labour Force Survey on Friday said employment increased by 7,400 nationally, though that figure was padded by an increase in election-related hiring. The overall unemployment rate rose to 6.9 per cent, up from 6.7 per cent in April. 

The latest jobs figures illustrate how tariffs are beginning to squeeze the Canadian economy, affecting regions and industries most exposed to trade with the United States. 

“It doesn't take an archeological dig to realize this is a weak report,” BMO chief economist Douglas Porter wrote in a client note. 

“This is the first major data reading for April, and it shows that tariffs are already taking a material bite out of the economy.” 

Ontario saw the largest decline in employment, falling by 35,000, with most of those jobs in the manufacturing sector. In Windsor, a major hub for the automotive industry, the unemployment rate jumped by 1.4 percentage points, reaching 10.7 per cent. 

Stellantis STLA-N temporarily laid off 3,800 workers after closing its Windsor plant for a week beginning May 5. This followed a two- week closure in April, a move the company said it made to assess the impact of the U.S. tariffs on imported vehicles. 

Since April 3, cars imported into the United States have faced a 25-per-cent tariff based on their non-U.S. content. 

Windsor finds itself on the wrong side of Trump's bitter tariff spat

Economists expect global trade tensions, as well as tariffs imposed on Canada specifically, to further weigh on the economy in the coming months and drive up the unemployment rate above 7 per cent. 

Michael Davenport, a senior economist at Oxford Economics, said fiscal stimulus from the federal government as well as lower countertariffs will lessen the impending slowdown. 

“But we still think a recession is under way that will lead to 120,000 job losses and drive the unemployment rate to 7.4 per cent by the end of this year,” Mr. Davenport wrote in a client note. 

Economists expect the April job report increases the odds of a quarter percentage point rate cut from the Bank of Canada in June. 

The Bank of Canada held its interest rate steady in April amid uncertainty in the trade outlook, but Governor Tiff Macklem signalled the central will be ready to act if needed. 

The U.S. trade war has weighed on business and consumer confidence as the economic outlook deteriorates. Friday's job report found that employees working in trade-exposed industries dependent on U.S. demand were more likely to anticipate fewer employees at their workplace over the next six months. 

But most employees remained confident in their own job security, with just under three in four workers surveyed saying that they disagreed or strongly disagreed that they might lose their job in the next six months. 

Meanwhile, average hourly wage growth slowed down last month to 3.4 per cent on an annual basis. Average hourly wages stood at $36.13.

About 1,000 troops who have been identified as having gender dysphoria are being discharged from the military, the Department of Defense said on May 8.

“Approximately 1,000 Service members who have self-identified as being diagnosed with gender dysphoria will begin the voluntary separation process.”

The force has around 2.1 million troops.

Gender dysphoria is when a person believes they're a gender that does not match their sex. At least some of the troops with gender dysphoria have begun or finished transgender treatments in an attempt to transition to a gender different from that of their sex, according to court filings.

President Donald Trump's first administration banned transgender troops. Under President Joe Biden, the military rescinded the ban.

Trump said in a January order that “expressing a false ‘gender identity' divergent from an individual's sex cannot satisfy the rigorous standards necessary for military service.”

The military said that troops with gender dysphoria can choose to voluntarily separate, and that if they do so, they may be eligible for voluntary separation pay.

The deadline to identify themselves for voluntary separation is June 6 for active-duty troops and July 7 for reserves. Both windows were extended, the former for 30 days and the latter for 60 days, from before.

Supreme Court justices in the majority, and the three who said they would not have granted the government's emergency request for a stay pending appeal, did not offer any rationale for their decision.

Darin S. Selnick, a Department of Defense undersecretary, said troops who want waivers must show there is “a compelling government interest” in retaining them “that directly supports warfighting capabilities.” Those seeking exemptions must also demonstrate they have had “36 consecutive months of stability in the Service member's sex without clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning,” that they have never attempted a gender transition, and that they are “willing and able to adhere to all applicable standards, including the standards associated with the Service member's sex.”

Exclusive: University College London acquires Gollancz archive that was in danger of being dispersed forever

George Orwell's correspondence, contracts and readers' reports relating to his earliest novels are among historic papers that have been saved for the nation after an outcry over their initial dispersal.

University College London (UCL) said it had acquired the archive of the Nineteen Eighty-Four author's publisher as “a valuable piece of Britain's cultural heritage”.

About 160 items, dating from 1934 to 1937, are to be added to the Orwell Archive in UCL Special Collections, the world's most comprehensive holdings of research material relating to him.

The papers offer extraordinary insights into one of the most influential British writers of the 20th century.

They relate to four of his earliest published works – A Clergyman's Daughter, Keep the Aspidistra Flying, The Road to Wigan Pier and Inside the Whale – and include his observations on the politics of 1930s Europe, which helped shape his thoughts and ideas.

The collection had belonged to his publisher, Victor Gollancz, who founded one of the 20th century's foremost publishing houses.

The company was acquired by the Orion Group, which became part of Hachette, owned by the French multinational Lagardère, whose decision to sell the archive because its warehouse was closing was condemned last year as an act of cultural vandalism.

Disbelief that such important papers had been languishing in dozens of rusty, dusty filing cabinets turned to anger with the realisation that they had been sold off.

Rick Gekoski, a leading antiquarian bookseller, was asked to dispose of the Gollancz archive, which included correspondence with Kingsley Amis and Daphne du Maurier, among the publisher's other authors. He recalled that the decision was sanctioned by Malcolm Edwards, the then publishing director of Orion, and the board. In his 2021 book, Guarded by Dragons, he wrote: “No one on the Orion board cared where they went, or to whom.”

He had tried in vain to sell the entire archive to various institutions, before dividing it up between dozens of dealers, private collectors and libraries.

He said among those approached was UCL, who, he recalled, declined partly due to funding – although it would have cost “considerably less” than the £154,000 that it has now paid.

On being told that UCL denies it had been approached previously, he said: “Why wouldn't we [approach them]? It's the Orwell Archive.”

Liz Thomson, who has reported on the book trade for 35 years, had warned of the loss of a “priceless” archive when she heard of its dispersal. She was dismayed to learn that one dealer had sold Gollancz's Animal Farm correspondence, with an asking price of £100,000. It included Orwell's 1944 letter describing it as “a little fairy story … with a political meaning”.

The publisher's sale was contrasted with the extraordinary generosity of Richard Blair, the son of Orwell, whose real name was Eric Blair. In 2021, Richard purchased 50 letters to donate them to UCL's Orwell Archive, fearing that they would otherwise have gone on to the market. “Then they're never seen again,” he said.

He said: “I'm very pleased and relieved that the Orwell Archive has taken [the Gollancz papers] and that they've not been dispersed into the ether, gobbled by various collectors, never to be seen again.”

The new acquisition boasts manuscript notebooks, personal papers and the first handwritten notes of some of Orwell's most famous words and phrases, such as “Two Minutes Hate”, “Newspeak”, and “War is Peace. Ignorance is strength. Freedom is slavery”.

UCL's purchase from Jonkers Rare Books and Peter Harrington Rare Books was made with support from the National Heritage Memorial Fund and the Friends of the Nations' Libraries.

Sarah Aitchison, the director of UCL Special Collections, said the collection revealed the editing process behind Orwell's published works and the legal anxieties that spurred amendments.

She noted that Gollancz's libel concerns run throughout the letters, with the publisher often requesting that Orwell change names and details to reduce similarities with real people, places and companies.

The papers relating to Keep the Aspidistra Flying, for example, show his frustration over requested changes. He reluctantly conceded: “These alterations spoil the book altogether.”

The Orwell biographer DJ Taylor said: “This is an absolutely fantastic treasure trove from the point of view of Orwell and publishing history … Literary manuscripts have a terrible habit of disappearing into the vaults of private collectors, never to be seen again, so it is wonderful that these can now be made available to everyone.”

Last year, Prof Jean Seaton, the director of the Orwell Foundation, expressed astonishment that the publisher had failed to understand the archive's value.

She argued that such literary archives should not be dispersed to collectors who want “trophies”. 
 “There are lots of people with lots of money who'd like a trophy. But you then lose track of them and they disappear, until they pop up on the market again.”

Bill Hamilton, the literary agent and executor of Orwell's estate, said of the acquisition: “We're thrilled. Bit by bit, all this really important Orwell material is finding its way to UCL, where it should really be.”

Orion declined to comment.

Peter Szijjarto's announcement came after Ukraine's Security Service (SBU) allegedly dismantled a Hungarian military intelligence network operating in Zakarpattia Oblast.

Moscow and Washington discuss the potential resumption of Russian gas supplies to Europe, among other issues related to the peaceful settlement of Russia's war in Ukraine, Russian presidential aide Yuri Ushakov confirmed to the Russian state-run Interfax news agency.



"This is a historic decision, as weapons for Ukraine will be purchased at the expense of the proceeds from frozen Russian assets through the European Peace Fund," Denys Shmyhal said.

Kurt Volker said that now "there is more alignment" between Ukraine and the U.S. under the Trump Administration than at the beginning of 2025.



The approval marks a key step in international efforts to hold Moscow accountable for what is considered the gravest violation of international law committed against Ukraine.

Although Moscow declared on April 28 that it would halt all military actions from May 8 to midnight on May 11 to mark Victory Day, strikes on civilian areas have continued. 

Under Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin's rule, millions of Ukrainians died during the Holodomor, a man-made famine in 1932–1933. The dictator also oversaw mass deportations, purges of Ukrainian intellectuals and leaders, and the suppression of the Ukrainian language and culture.

According to the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU), this marks the first time Ukrainian authorities have exposed a Hungarian military intelligence network conducting activities harmful to Ukraine. 

Delegations from 35 countries and the Council of Europe gathered in Lviv as EU officials prepare to approve both new defense aid and steps toward establishing a tribunal for Russian leadership.

The ruling marks a significant victory for RFE/RL amid growing concerns about U.S. funding cuts to independent media countering Russian disinformation.

U.S. Cardinal Robert Prevost was elected the new pope and leader of the Roman Catholic Church on Thursday, taking the name Pope Leo XIV, a senior cardinal announced on May 8 to crowds gathered in St. Peter's Square, according to Vatican News.



The Communist Party of Russia unveiled a monument to Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin in occupied Melitopol, Zaporizhzhia Oblast, on May 8 to commemorate Victory Day in World War II, the party announced.

The statue carries a plaque that reads: "To the organizer and inspirer of the victory of the Soviet people over the Nazi invaders, Generalissimo of the Soviet Union Joseph Stalin, from grateful descendants."

The ceremony was attended by Russian-installed officials and local school students who laid flowers at the site.

Melitopol has been under Russian occupation since March 2022.

Stalin's legacy in Ukraine is marked by profound suffering. Under his rule, millions of Ukrainians died during the Holodomor, a man-made famine in 1932–1933. 

The dictator also oversaw mass deportations, purges of Ukrainian intellectuals and leaders, and the suppression of the Ukrainian language and culture.

While some in Russia credit Stalin for leading the Soviet Union to victory in World War II, portraying him solely as a military hero ignores the brutal policies and immense human cost of his regime.

The monument comes amid a broader revival of Stalin's cult in Russia. 

On April 29, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a decree renaming Volgograd's international airport to "Stalingrad." Days earlier, Russian media reported that Putin had endorsed the renaming of Volgograd's Gumrak airport to honor the dictator.

            Russian President Vladimir Putin has taken center stage at Russia's Victory Day parade on Friday, surrounding himself by friendly world leaders in a highly choreographed show designed to show the Western world that Russia is far from isolated.
    


            Watching as thousands of troops marched across Moscow's Red Square, Putin stood next to his guest of honor, the Chinese leader Xi Jinping.
    


            The annual May 9 commemoration of the Soviet Union's victory over Nazi Germany in World War II is one of the most important days in Putin's calendar, and this year marks its 80th anniversary.
    


            Traditionally, the day has been dedicated to the estimated 25 million to 27 million Soviet soldiers and civilians who died during the conflict. But since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Victory Day has become more of a propaganda exercise, with Putin framing the war against Russia's much smaller neighbor as a continuation of what Russians call the Great Patriotic War.
    


            And while celebrations were muted in the past three years, Russia has not held back this time.
    


            Putin and Xi were joined by scores of other world leaders, most of whom had the black and orange ribbon of Saint George pinned to their lapels. Many of them have also sent troops to march in the parade, alongside Russian servicemen.
    


            The Russian military symbol dates back to imperial times, but it has become hugely controversial in recent years, having been coopted as a sign of support for Moscow's aggression against Ukraine. It has been banned in a number of countries.

Xi and Putin agree to ‘deepen' China-Russia ties during Moscow talks



            Brazil's President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, the Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, Serbia's President Aleksandar Vucic, Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro and Mahmoud Abbas, the President of the Palestinian Authority were all in attendance, marking a significant upgrade to last year's guestlist which was limited to a handful of delegations from post-Soviet states, Cuba and a few other countries.
    


            Robert Fico, the Prime Minister of Slovakia, a European Union member state, was also in Moscow on Friday. His appearance side by side with Putin was particularly significant given the EU's tough stance against Russia over its aggression against Ukraine.
    


            The weaponry and number of troops on display were also upgraded compared to the last few years when Russia clearly struggled to put on an impressive military show. The parade featured just one tank in the past two years and the usual fly-by of military aircraft over Red Square was canceled in 2022 and 2023.
    


            A selection of tanks, modern and historical, was on show this year and Russian state media reported that around 11,500 troops took part. For the first time, Russia's drones were also on display, including the Russian version of the Iranian-designed Shahed droned, known as Geranium-2.
    


            The parade comes as the US-led talks to end the war in Ukraine appear to have stalled, despite a flurry of diplomatic activity in recent weeks. Russia has so far refused to sign up to a US proposal for a 30-day ceasefire that Ukraine has already agreed to.
    


            Instead, Putin declared a three-day unilateral ceasefire around the anniversary – an announcement that was promptly rejected by Ukraine.
    


            “The Kremlin's proposal for a three-day truce is not about peace, but about ensuring the safe conduct of the parade in Moscow. This is political manipulation,” Andriy Yermak, the head of the Ukrainian Presidential Office, said in a statement on Thursday.
    


            Kyiv said that if Russia wanted a truce, it should sign up to the proposal already on the table.
    


            US President Donald Trump also reiterated his call for the 30-day ceasefire on Thursday, threatening fresh sanctions if it's not respected.
    


            Trump's comments come after a phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, the second time in less than two weeks that the two leaders were known to have spoken to each other

Ukrainians on front line say Russians keep breaking Putin's ceasefire



            Kyiv said Friday that Russia had breached the ceasefire hundreds of times since it came into effect. Several civilians were killed and injured in guided bomb attacks against Ukrainian cities, Kyiv said.
    


            Kyiv was openly indifferent to the smooth running of Putin's parade. It said that it “cannot be responsible for what happens on the territory of the Russian Federation” because of the war.
    


            Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said his country would not be “playing games to create a pleasant atmosphere to allow for Putin's exit from isolation on May 9.”
    


            Moscow said it would protect the safety of the parade and its guests. Yet Ukraine did succeed in disrupting the run-up to the parade earlier this week by launching several drone attacks against Moscow. The drones forced Russian authorities to temporarily shut down all four Moscow airports on Wednesday.
    


            This made the attendance of the dozens of foreign delegations in Moscow particularly significant as they came to show their support for Putin and Russia despite the risks.
    


            Ukraine's European allies were keen to show their support for Kyiv as Russia paraded its troops on Friday.
    


            Dozens of foreign delegations were in the western Ukrainian city of Lviv on Friday to endorse the establishment of a special tribunal to investigate crimes of aggression against Ukraine. The EU's foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas, UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy, Germany's new Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul, the French Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot and dozens of top diplomats from other European countries met in Lviv.
    


            In another gesture of sympathy, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania also threw in some logistical complications for international parade-goers, shutting their airspaces to diplomatic planes traveling to Moscow and forcing several of the pro-Kremlin leaders to reroute their journeys to Moscow.
    


            “In Latvian society, there is a clear and principled understanding that Russian propaganda and glorification of war crimes cannot be supported or encouraged … given this context, Latvia cannot grant diplomatic overflight permits for flights facilitating participation in the 9 May event,” the Latvian Foreign Ministry said in a statement on Thursday.
    


            Fico, one of the leaders affected by the closures, criticized the move, saying on Wednesday that it was “extremely disruptive.”
    


            Vucic was also forced to re-route after the Baltic states said he wouldn't be allowed to enter their airspace. According to Serbian media, he ended up flying via Baku in Azerbaijan.

    Editor's Note: Call to Earth is a CNN editorial series committed to reporting on the environmental challenges facing our planet, together with the solutions. Rolex's Perpetual Planet Initiative has partnered with CNN to drive awareness and education around key sustainability issues and to inspire positive action.



            For the first time in history, the majority of humans live in cities — spaces often defined by concrete, glass and a disconnect from the natural world. Access to nature is no longer guaranteed.
    


            London-based environmental activist Ellen Miles, 31, is trying to change that. “Before we urbanized the world, everyone had access to nature all the time.” Miles tells CNN. “Now, nature is becoming an afterthought.”
    


            In 2020, Miles founded Nature Is a Human Right, a campaign advocating for daily access to green spaces to be recognized in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Frustrated by the slow pace of institutional change, Miles says she “lost faith in the top-down process.” So she took matters into her own hands. Her weapon? Not protest banners or petitions, but seeds and shovels.
    


            She became a so-called guerrilla gardener — “Grassroots planting in a public place, with a purpose,” Miles explains. “Think of it like graffiti, but with wildflowers instead of spray paint.” This form of urban activism involves transforming neglected or overlooked spaces — cracks in pavements, roadside verges, abandoned lots — into mini-oases for people, pollinators and biodiversity.
    


            What began during the Covid pandemic — when parks were shut and access to green space became scarce — grew into a weekly ritual. Miles and her neighbors would meet on Sunday mornings, armed with bulbs and trowels, planting in overlooked corners of the London Borough of Hackney.
    


            In the UK, guerrilla gardening occupies a legal gray area: while planting on public land without permission is not technically lawful, authorities often turn a blind eye — so long as it doesn't cause damage, obstruction or a public nuisance.
    


            According to the Royal Horticultural Society, guerrilla gardeners should ensure their planting doesn't inconvenience others and be careful to not restrict public access or create trip hazards. It's also important that anything planted is removable, and that the roots won't cause structural damage to sidewalks and buildings.
    


            Guerrilla gardening dates back to the 1970s, when the Green Guerrillas, founded by Liz Christy in the US, transformed vacant lots into community gardens. The movement has since spread worldwide, from Ron Finley, the “Gangsta Gardener” in Los Angeles, to Ta Mère Nature in France, and the Ujamaa Guerrilla Gardening Collective in South Africa.
    


            Miles has brought the underground movement into the spotlight on TikTok and other social media. Her upbeat videos demystify the process, showing everything from creating seed bombs to planting moss graffiti — a form of street art where living moss is used to create patterns or words on walls. “I wasn't a gardener. I was learning as I went along,” she admits. “But I just wanted the streets to be greener.”
    


            As Miles' seeds grew, so did her online following. “Young people today are very awake to issues like climate change, inequality, and mental health,” Miles says. “Guerrilla gardening intersects with all of that. It's something you can do with your own two hands and see the impact immediately.”
    


            “A lot of activism can feel intangible,” she adds. “With guerrilla gardening, you see the results. It's empowering.”
    


            And it's more than just symbolic: “It's been shown that having access to green spaces is as vital to your mental and physical health as regular exercise and a healthy diet,” says Miles. “We need it around us. We need the phytoncides (compounds plants release into the air) that plants produce. The experience of having plants around us calms us.”
    


            A study of 20,000 participants by the UK's University of Exeter found that people who spent at least 120 minutes a week in green spaces reported significantly better physical health and psychological well-being than those who didn't. For young children, access to green spaces has been linked to reduced hyperactivity and improved attention spans. Communities can benefit too: a US study showed that greening vacant lots can lead to lower crime rates.
    


            Miles' message is simple: anyone can get involved. “It's spring now,” she continues. “Find native wildflowers, scatter them when it's raining then you won't even have to water them.” For those who want to go further, Miles has written a book on the subject and teaches a free four-week online course through the nonprofit Earthed, which has attracted over 300 participants. She advises gardening as a group — community is key.
    


            Her vision is bold but refreshingly practical: “Why aren't all our sidewalks lined with hedges?” says Miles. “Our buildings could be covered in plants. Our rooftops and bus stops could be buzzing with flowers. It's a no-brainer.”

The Polish prime minister criticised anyone seen ‘applauding President Putin' at today's Moscow parade

Polish prime minister Donald Tusk said that anyone attending the military parade in Moscow to mark the end of the second world war had brought shame on themselves, after Slovak prime minister Robert Fico became the only European Union leader to attend.

“I try not to comment on the decisions and behaviour of leaders of states, especially from our community,” Tusk told a news conference.

“But there is no doubt in my mind that being at the victory parade in Moscow and applauding President Putin … brings shame to everyone who is there.”

Polish prime minister Donald Tusk said that anyone attending the military parade in Moscow to mark the end of the second world war had brought shame on themselves, after Slovak prime minister Robert Fico became the only European Union leader to attend.

The United States and its European allies are finalising a proposal for a 30-day ceasefire in Ukraine that if refused would see them jointly impose new sanctions on Russia, a French diplomatic source said on Friday. The source said the proposal had still not been given a green light and would be worked on over the weekend at a summit being held in Ukraine.

Support for Ukraine is the “absolute focus” of Britain and its northern European allies, Keir Starmer said as he attended a military summit in Norway that coincided with Russia's Victory Day celebrations. The prime minister met counterparts at a Joint Expeditionary Forces (JEF) leaders' gathering in Oslo on Friday, during which Volodymyr Zelenskyy also spoke virtually.

France and Poland signed a treaty on Friday to increase cooperation on defence, nuclear energy and other measures, in a sign of growing alliances between European nations amid concerns about US commitment to Europe's security. The signing came a day before Ukraine hosts leaders of the so-called “coalition of the willing” – countries led by France and Britain that want to step up support for Ukraine in the face of a more sceptical Trump administration.

Ukrainian authorities claim to have busted a Hungarian spy ring operating on its territory, alleging that Budapest was collecting sensitive military data with one eye on a possible future incursion into the west of the country. Hungary's foreign minister dismissed the accusations as “propaganda” and announced the expulsion of two Ukrainians described as “spies working under diplomatic cover” at the Ukrainian embassy in Budapest.

Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that European leaders from the “coalition of the willing” will meet in Ukraine on Saturday. “In Ukraine, we are also preparing to meet with the leaders of the coalition of the willing … Tomorrow we have meetings,” Zelensky told a military summit in Oslo via video link, AFP reported, without saying who would attend.

Russian president Vladimir Putin greeted North Korean military personnel on Red Square after a military parade marking the defeat of Nazi Germany, several weeks after Pyongyang's troops helped Moscow oust Ukrainian forces from its Kursk region.

That's all from the Europe live blog for today. Thanks for following along.

Despite warnings from European Union officials, Slovakia's Moscow-friendly prime minister, Robert Fico, shook hands with Vladimir Putin at the Kremlin before becoming the only EU leader to attend Russia's 9 May parade of military forces waging war on Ukraine.

The Serbian president, Aleksandar Vučić, whose country aspires to join the 27-nation bloc, also accepted the Russian president's invitation to attend the annual Victory Day celebrations marking the defeat of Nazi Germany in the second world war.

The pair were the only European leaders to travel to Moscow after strong injunctions from EU officials not to do so. On Thursday, the bloc's chief diplomat, Kaja Kallas, said: “All those who truly support peace cannot stand side-by-side with Putin. Those who truly support peace should be in Ukraine tomorrow, not Moscow.”

Kallas added this week that the Russian president was “waging a war right now, not a war from history. That remains on the conscience of those attending”.

Donald Tusk, who later on Friday was due to sign a cooperation and friendship treaty with France including joint security and defence commitments, sharply criticised both leaders, although did so without naming them.

The Polish prime minister said: “For me it is unthinkable that one can be from this part of the world and – during Russia's aggression against Ukraine – be in Red Square and celebrate Victory Day with those who are murdering children, civilians and attacking other countries.”

The United States and its European allies are finalising a proposal for a 30-day ceasefire in Ukraine that if refused would see them jointly impose new sanctions on Russia, a French diplomatic source said on Friday.

The source said the proposal had still not been given a green light and would be worked on over the weekend at a summit being held in Ukraine.

The prime minister met counterparts at a Joint Expeditionary Forces (JEF) leaders' gathering in Oslo on Friday, during which Volodymyr Zelenskyy also spoke virtually.

After the summit, Starmer said the UK-led group's utmost priority was defending the values “hard-won” during the second world war and continuing to stand behind Kyiv.

Speaking to broadcasters, the prime minister was asked what his message would be to Russia and Beijing as Chinese president Xi Jinping attended events in Moscow marking the 80th anniversary of the defeat of Nazi Germany.

Starmer said: “The message of leaders here is very, very clear, and that is that we're focused on Ukraine.

“[President] Zelenskyy came in virtually to part of that meeting.

“And so that's where our absolute focus is – with Ukraine, defending the values that yesterday at VE Day we were remembering and commemorating, that were hard-won in the second world war.”

And that's all from me, Jakub Krupa, but I leave with you Tom Ambrose to guide you through the afternoon.

We don't yet have the full text of the agreement, so it's hard to know exactly what it contains – especially regarding the strength of the language on critical security obligations.

Still, it send a clear signal of political intent from both leaders – for both countries, and, as Tusk suggested (16:52), also towards the United States – that Europe is taking its defence responsibilities more seriously.

Finally, a cynic in me says that it's also worth noting the timing, with Poland's presidential election just over a week away.

While the deal seeks to transcend short-term politics, the visual message — a show of unity and close cooperation with a major European power— will do no harm to the ruling party's candidate, centre-right Warsaw mayor Rafał Trzaskowski, who also recently met with Macron.

Asked about Zelenskyy's comments on tomorrow's meeting of “the coalition of the willing,” Macron confirms it will take place in a hybrid format with some leaders joining in person and others online due to security concerns and that he will take part in it.

On Russia's show of force at the Moscow victory parade and more broadly on the continuing aggression on Ukraine, he says:

“President Putin is on the side of war, not on the side of peace.”

He says the reality of Putin's actions show that any belief that Russia is interested in peace is “wrong at this stage,” and repeats that European partners, together with the US, will keep pushing for a ceasefire.

He is also asked about Slovak prime minister Robert Fico's presence in Moscow, and he diplomatically says he is not sure that's the best reading of European history.

Poland's Tusk isn't quite as diplomatic: repeating his earlier criticism (10:28), he says “being present at the victory parade in Moscow brings shame on whoever is there.”

And that concludes the press conference.

In response to another question, Tusk also dismisses the suggestion that a closer Franco-Polish cooperation is “an alternative, or something that is [done outside] Nato, or, God forbid, anti-American.”

“It's the exact opposite. We've all heard these comments, repeated multiple times, from our American allies, and we in Poland treat these words seriously. … And they were clear: you need to arm, you need to be increasingly self-sufficient, and then you can count on US help, if you pull your weight when it comes to defence,” he says.

He adds that closer relationship with France is a part of that push.

“Yes, Europe needs to be able to defend itself. Yes, every aggressor needs to fear Europe, whether Russia or anyone else,” he says.

Macron responds by saying what's changed is the creation of Nato, which also includes a serious security guarantee in Article 5.

He then goes on to repeat his main argument that European defence and security position needs to be strengthened further.

He says it is needed also because of the growing pressure from the US for Europe to take more responsibility for its safety and become more independent.

He then says that the commemorations this week send a clear reminder that “we cannot succeed alone” and “narrow nationalism” is not the answer.

Tusk comes on the political part of the question to argue that both Macron and himself proved to be able to fight against populist and insurgent right.

He then says that the mutual assistance clause is underpinned by the conviction that all countries learned their lessons from the second world war.

He also stresses that Poland is in the process of building the largest army in Europe to be able to defend itself and offer support to partners, too.

Opening the Q&A, a Polish journalist tells Macron that Poland also had a treaty with France in 1939, and that didn't help it too much when it was invaded, so what's different this time?

And will this treaty last if Marine Le Pen or another far-right figure comes to power?

Ouch.

16:18 JST, May 9, 2025

MOSCOW, May 9 (Reuters) – Russia marks the 80th anniversary of the Soviet Union's victory over Nazi Germany in World War Two on Friday with a military parade attended by China's Xi Jinping that Moscow fears Ukraine will try to disrupt after three years of devastating war.

President Vladimir Putin, the longest-serving Kremlin chief since Josef Stalin, will speak at a 0700 GMT parade where thousands of Russian soldiers usually march by and drive military hardware such as intercontinental ballistic missiles and tanks past Lenin's Mausoleum on Red Square.

But the Ukraine war, Europe's deadliest since World War Two, haunts this celebration. Ukraine attacked Moscow with drones for several days this week, and Moscow and Kyiv accused each other of breaking a 72-hour ceasefire declared by Putin.

The Kremlin says the attendance of Russian allies such as Xi, Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva and several dozen leaders from the former Soviet Union, Africa, Asia and Latin America shows Russia is not isolated even if Moscow's former WW2 Western allies want to stay away. From Europe, the leaders of Serbia and Slovakia will attend.

“The victory over fascism, achieved at the cost of enormous sacrifices, has an everlasting significance,” Putin told Xi in the Kremlin. “The countless sacrifices made by both our peoples should never be forgotten.”

The Soviet Union lost 27 million people in World War Two, including many millions in Ukraine, but pushed Nazi forces back to Berlin, where Adolf Hitler committed suicide and the red Soviet Victory Banner was raised over the Reichstag in 1945.

For Russians – and for many of the peoples of the former Soviet Union – May 9 is the most sacred date in the calendar, and Putin, angry at what he says are attempts by the West to belittle the Soviet victory, has sought to use memories of WW2 to unite Russian society.

Chinese Communist Party historians say China's casualties in the 1937-1945 Second Sino-Japanese War were 35 million. The Japanese occupation caused the displacement of as many as 100 million Chinese people and significant economic hardship, as well as the horrific 1937 Nanjing Massacre, during which an estimated 100,000 to 300,000 victims were killed.

Moscow and Kyiv do not publish accurate casualty numbers for the war in Ukraine, though U.S. President Donald Trump, who says he wants peace, says hundreds of thousands of soldiers on both sides have been killed and injured.

Putin has sought to insulate Moscow from the grinding artillery and drone war being fought 600 km (370 miles) away in Ukraine, though Ukrainian drone attacks have in recent days disrupted air travel to the Russian capital.

The Kremlin said the military is doing everything it can to ensure security for the parade next to the Kremlin which Russia said was targeted in 2023 by Ukrainian drones.

There were some drone attack warnings announced overnight in some western Russian regions but no reports of attacks on Moscow, which along with the surrounding region has a population of at least 21 million.

Security is very tight in Moscow. Putin proposed a 72-hour ceasefire would run on May 8, May 9 and May 10, though Ukraine said Russia had broken the ceasefire, a claim dismissed as absurd by Moscow.

The Kremlin said military units from 13 countries, including China, will take part in the parade along with Russian troops, though it was unclear how North Korea – which has helped Russia fight in Ukraine – would be represented.

In Kyiv, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy called on allies to help it resist Russia, which now controls about a fifth of Ukraine.

“Evil cannot be appeased. It must be fought,” Zelenskiy said, according to the Kyiv Post. He criticised Moscow's Victory Day parade. “It will be a parade of cynicism. There is just no other way to describe it. A parade of bile and lies.”

The two countries both stated their opposition to unilateral sanctions and long-arm jurisdiction, Chinese state news agency Xinhua reported the statement as saying, and will work together to defend the United Nations' central role in international affairs.

NEW YORK, May 9. /TASS/. The situation on the battlefield in Ukraine is not in Kiev's favor, US Vice President JD Vance told Fox News television news channel commenting on the ongoing negotiations with Russia to resolve the Ukrainian conflict.

"We knew that Russia would ask for too much, because the Russian perception of the war is - ‘on the ground' they are winning," Vance stated in an exclusive interview with the US-based broadcaster.

"Of course, the Ukrainians would like to do a ceasefire and in part that things have not been going so well for the Ukrainians the last few months," he added.

Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on May 8 that Russia wants its national interests to be taken into account in the framework of peace talks as he commented on a previous remark from Vance that Moscow "is asking for too much" in the negotiation process.

"We want our national interests to be taken into account. So that the root causes of the conflict are eliminated. This is very important, because it is directly related to our national interests, to guarantees of our security," Peskov stated.

Peter Szijjarto's announcement came after Ukraine's Security Service (SBU) allegedly dismantled a Hungarian military intelligence network operating in Zakarpattia Oblast.

Moscow and Washington discuss the potential resumption of Russian gas supplies to Europe, among other issues related to the peaceful settlement of Russia's war in Ukraine, Russian presidential aide Yuri Ushakov confirmed to the Russian state-run Interfax news agency.



"This is a historic decision, as weapons for Ukraine will be purchased at the expense of the proceeds from frozen Russian assets through the European Peace Fund," Denys Shmyhal said.

Kurt Volker said that now "there is more alignment" between Ukraine and the U.S. under the Trump Administration than at the beginning of 2025.



The approval marks a key step in international efforts to hold Moscow accountable for what is considered the gravest violation of international law committed against Ukraine.

Although Moscow declared on April 28 that it would halt all military actions from May 8 to midnight on May 11 to mark Victory Day, strikes on civilian areas have continued. 

Under Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin's rule, millions of Ukrainians died during the Holodomor, a man-made famine in 1932–1933. The dictator also oversaw mass deportations, purges of Ukrainian intellectuals and leaders, and the suppression of the Ukrainian language and culture.

According to the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU), this marks the first time Ukrainian authorities have exposed a Hungarian military intelligence network conducting activities harmful to Ukraine. 

Delegations from 35 countries and the Council of Europe gathered in Lviv as EU officials prepare to approve both new defense aid and steps toward establishing a tribunal for Russian leadership.

The ruling marks a significant victory for RFE/RL amid growing concerns about U.S. funding cuts to independent media countering Russian disinformation.

U.S. Cardinal Robert Prevost was elected the new pope and leader of the Roman Catholic Church on Thursday, taking the name Pope Leo XIV, a senior cardinal announced on May 8 to crowds gathered in St. Peter's Square, according to Vatican News.



Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico arrived in Moscow on May 9 to celebrate Victory Day, commemorating the 80th anniversary of the defeat of Nazi Germany in World War II. 

Slovak and Russian press agencies reported that Fico was accompanied by other politicians from his party, including Erik Kaliniak, Lubos Blaga, Richard Gluck. A deputy from the far-right Slovak National Party, Miroslav Radachovsky, was also a part of the group.

During his visit, Fico is expected to hold bilateral talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin, Chinese President Xi Jinping, Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, and a government representative of Vietnam.

Fico, who anticipated arriving in Moscow on May 8, was delayed in his arrival, following the Baltic states' decision to bar Slovakia's government plane from flying over their respective country's airspace en route to Moscow.

"Estonia informed us a couple of minutes ago that it will not allow us to fly over its territory," Fico wrote on Facebook. "Of course, we are talking about a deliberate attempt to disrupt my visit to Moscow on the occasion of the official celebration of the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II."

The Kremlin uses the annual victory celebrations for propaganda purposes and to showcase its military might, while Russian propaganda leans heavily on the Soviet victory in World War II.

Fico is known for inflammatory statements on Ukraine and the war that often echo Moscow's talking points. He has repeatedly criticized military aid for Ukraine and called for restoring relations with Russia after the war.

Fico's planned visit comes as another jab at the Western efforts to internationally isolate Putin over Russia's full-scale war in Ukraine. Slovakia is a member state of both NATO and the EU.

Soldiers given false arrest records have been stuck in bureaucratic limbo for years. President Trump or Defense Secretary Hegseth could fix it, lawyers say.

FIRST ON FOX: President Donald Trump on Friday signed an executive order to establish a national center for homeless veterans with redirected funds previously spent on services for illegal aliens, Fox News Digital has learned. 

The president's order directs the secretary of veterans affairs to establish the National Center for Warrior Independence on the Veterans Affairs campus in West Los Angeles. 

TRUMP TO HOST MILITARY PARADE TO CELEBRATE ARMY'S 250TH BIRTHDAY, HONOR ACTIVE-DUTY SERVICE MEMBERS, VETERANS

Los Angeles has approximately 3,000 homeless veterans — more than any other city in the country, and accounting for about 10% of all homeless veterans in America, according to the White House.

"The new National Center for Warrior Independence will help them and other veterans like them rebuild their lives," the White House said. 

The center will allow veterans from around the nation to seek and receive care, benefits and services "to which they are entitled," the White House said. 

The order redirects funds previously spent on housing or other services for illegal aliens to constructing, establishing and maintaining the new center. 

"The Center will promote self-sufficiency through housing, substance abuse treatment, and support for productive work for the veterans housed there," the White House explained. 

It said the goal is to house up to 6,000 homeless veterans at the center by 2028.

TRUMP TO CREATE TASK FORCE TO PLAN 'EXTRAORDINARY CELEBRATION' FOR 250TH ANNIVERSARY OF AMERICA'S INDEPENDENCE

The order also directs the secretary of housing and urban development to use vouchers to support homeless veterans and instructs the secretary of veterans affairs to "restore accountability at the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)." 

The order also instructs the VA to take action against individuals who have committed misconduct and to investigate and rectify the Biden administration's decision to "rehire and reinstate back pay for employees previously fired for misconduct." 

The order also ensures that veterans will have access to increased options for care, benefits and services — including reduced wait times for Veterans Health Administration appointments through options such as expanded hours, weekend appointments and virtual healthcare.

The order also directs a feasibility study at the Manchester VA Medical Center to expand services to support a full-service medical center in New Hampshire.

"President Trump strongly believes that every veteran deserves our gratitude, and that the federal government should treat veterans like the heroes they are," the White House said. 

The order comes a week after the White House announced that Trump will host a military parade on June 14 to honor military veterans and active-duty service members and commemorate the U.S. Army's 250th birthday.

            Trump administration officials are weighing a change that would shift responsibility for US security interests in Greenland to the military command that oversees America's homeland defense, underscoring the president's focus on the strategically important territory that he has repeatedly said he wants to acquire, three sources familiar with the deliberations told CNN.
    


            The change under consideration would move Greenland out of US European Command's area of responsibility and into US Northern Command, the sources said.
    


            On its face, the idea of putting Greenland under NORTHCOM authority makes some logical sense given it is part of the North American continent, though politically and culturally, it is associated with Europe and is a semiautonomous territory of Denmark. Some of the discussions pre-date Trump's return to office this year, the sources said.
    


            US Northern Command declined to comment. CNN has reached out to the Office of the Secretary of Defense as well as Danish and Greenlandic officials for comment.
    


            Still, several US officials expressed wariness about the move because of Trump's repeated insistence that the US “needs” Greenland and his refusal to rule out military action to obtain it.
    


            In an interview with NBC that aired last weekend, Trump renewed that threat.
    


            “I don't rule it out,” he said. “I don't say I'm going to do it, but I don't rule out anything.”
    


            “We need Greenland very badly,” Trump said. “Greenland is a very small amount of people, which we'll take care of, and we'll cherish them, and all of that. But we need that for international security.”
    


            US Northern Command is chiefly responsible for protecting US territory and currently oversees missions like the southern border task force.
    


            Trump's rhetoric has also caused major friction with Denmark and with Greenland itself.
    


            Putting Greenland under US Northern Command would at least symbolically split Greenland from Denmark, which would still be overseen by US European Command.
    


            Danish officials are concerned about the message that could send suggesting that Greenland is not a part of Denmark, one of the sources familiar with the deliberations said.
    


            Proponents of the move have pointed out that despite there being a US military base there and Greenland being seen as a vital outpost in competition with Russia and China for access to the Arctic — a major bipartisan national security priority — it sometimes gets overlooked by US European Command because of its distance from the command center in central Europe, one US official said.
    


            For US NORTHCOM, though, Greenland is an important vantage point for any potential enemy craft coming from that direction towards the United States. The unclassified version of the US intelligence community's annual threat assessment mentioned Greenland four times, within the context of adversaries like China and Russia seeking to expand their influence there.
    


            The discussions about moving Greenland into NORTHCOM come amid another high-profile spat between American and Danish officials over Greenland.
    


            Danish Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen said this week that he plans to “call in” the US acting ambassador to Denmark for talks after a Wall Street Journal report said Washington had ordered US intelligence agencies to increase spying on Greenland.
    


            They were directed to learn more about Greenland's independence movement and attitudes towards American resource extraction, the Journal reported.
    


            “I have read the article in the Wall Street Journal, and it worries me greatly because we do not spy on friends,” Rasmussen told reporters in Warsaw on Wednesday, during an informal meeting of EU foreign ministers.
    


            “We are going to call in the US acting ambassador for a discussion at the foreign ministry to see if we can confirm this information, which is somewhat disturbing,” Rasmussen added.

President Donald Trump said he's open to hiking taxes on wealthy Americans to help pay for Republicans' sweeping tax and spending cuts package, but the idea remains hotly contested among GOP lawmakers on Capitol Hill.
    


            In a Truth Social post Friday morning, Trump said that he would “graciously accept” even a “TINY” tax increase on the rich, while acknowledging that that it could bring political risks for Republicans. House GOP lawmakers have been struggling to find $1.5 trillion in spending cuts to help offset trillions of dollars of tax reductions.
    


            “The problem with even a ‘TINY' tax increase for the RICH, which I and all others would graciously accept in order to help the lower and middle income workers, is that the Radical Left Democrat Lunatics would go around screaming, ‘Read my lips,' the fabled Quote by George Bush the Elder that is said to have cost him the Election. NO, Ross Perot cost him the Election!” Trump wrote.
    


            “In any event, Republicans should probably not do it, but I'm OK if they do!!!” he continued.
    


            Trump also mentioned the possibility of letting tax cuts expire on top earners – targeting individuals who earn at least $2.5 million or couples that make at least $5 million — in a call with House Speaker Mike Johnson on Wednesday, a Republican source familiar with the matter told CNN's Dana Bash.
    


            The White House has made the suggestion to Congress with the thought that not only would it help achieve much needed offsets, it could also help wipe away Democrats' argument about tax cuts for the rich, the source familiar said.
    


            This is not the first time Trump has indicated that he supports raising taxes on the wealthy, even though throughout last year's presidential campaign, he repeatedly promised to cut their taxes. The president recently told Time magazine, “I actually love the concept,” when asked about a proposal circulating to raise taxes for those earning more than $1 million a year.
    


            The idea, however, is not being warmly embraced among the House GOP and is far from guaranteed to make it into the president's final “one big beautiful” bill, which aims to make permanent the sweeping Trump 2017 tax cuts and incorporate the president's campaign promises to eliminate taxes on tips and certain other income.
    


            Just extending the 2017 individual tax provisions – which expire at the end of this year – could cost more than $4 trillion. Republican lawmakers are also fractured on how deeply they'd have to cut spending – including on Medicaid and food stamps – to meet their targets.
    


            Within the House Ways and Means Committee, members have discussed two ideas. One is to let the tax breaks for the richest Americans expire, returning their top income tax rate to 39.6% – which is what it was before Trump's 2017 tax overhaul – from the current 37%. This has drawn some criticism, however, as some Republicans fear it could impact small business owners.
    


            But it could hit roughly 1.5 million households and cut about $409 billion of the cost, as well as greatly limit potential economic growth from making the tax cuts permanent, according to the Tax Foundation, a right-leaning think tank.
    


            Another idea is to create a brand-new tax bracket for the wealthy. The proposal, though limited in scope, could contribute to offsetting costly tax provisions, such as restoring the state and local tax deduction – known as SALT – that has become another flashpoint in Congress' tax debate.
    


            The new tax bracket would raise about $59.3 billion over a decade, according to the Tax Foundation. And it would affect between 150,000 and 200,000 households and would have a much smaller dampening effect on the package's economic growth potential.
    


            Levying a higher income tax rate on the very wealthiest of Americans would raise less money because much of that group's earnings come from dividends and capital gains, which are taxed at lower rates, said Garrett Watson, the foundation's director of policy analysis. Also, there are much fewer of them.
    


            One of the considerations for Republicans is what the goal of such a provision would be – to limit how much of the benefit is going to the rich or to raise more money to offset other tax cuts, Watson said.
    


            Despite Trump's apparent openness to raising taxes on the wealthy, his economic adviser said Friday that the president “is not a strong advocate” of the idea.
    


            Asked whether Trump is seriously considering taxing the rich to pay for his budget bill, National Economic Director Kevin Hassett said: “The president is not a strong advocate of that, but he is a strong advocate of many things like no tax on tips, no tax on overtime, and nice treatment for auto loans.”
    


            “He has cited his priorities, and he understands that in the end, the final bill will include some priorities of members of the House of the Senate. That's how the democratic process works, and that's really what this conversation is about.”
    


            When asked how the White House expects to pay for the bill, given a number of its stated priorities are expensive, Hassett argued Congress has already identified clear areas for cuts, without detailing what they are and whether they are achievable.
    


            “Well, the budget rules in the House and the Senate are very clearly identified that include spending cuts and so on, and they don't include dynamic scores,” he told CNN. “And so in the fullest of time with the spending cuts that we're achieving ,and the dynamic score of the tax bill, we're highly confident that we're going to reduce the deficit that make bond markets celebrate.”
    


            House Ways and Means Chairman Jason Smith is expected to meet with Trump at the White House on Friday, and Hassett earlier told CNBC that he expects Smith will outline the House's schedule for the tax bill at some point during the day.
    


            Hassett has been meeting almost weekly with Johnson, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and others regarding Congress' budget. Earlier this week, the group met in the Roosevelt Room of the White House.

Jordon Hudson is not going anywhere any time soon.

A report earlier Friday circulated that UNC athletic staff had barred Hudson, the 24-year-old girlfriend of head coach Bill Belichick, from both the facility and the field.

However, the university refuted that, regarding "false" reports of her role.

"While Jordon Hudson is not an employee at the University or Carolina Athletics, she is welcome to the Carolina Football facilities. Jordon will continue to manage all activities related to Coach Belichick's personal brand outside of his responsibilities for Carolina Football and the University," the unversity's athletic program said in a statement.

The report came from ex-ESPN employee Pablo Torre, who also said he had heard from sources in the Belichick family that there is a "deep worry" that Hudson could be "detrimental" to his legacy, and they were even "digging" up on her.

Shortly after UNC's statement, though, Torre released a statement of his own, backing up his reporting on Hudson being banned from the facility.

"The University of North Carolina can choose to describe or change its position on Jordon Hudson's involvement however it wishes, following the publication of our episode. We requested comment and filed dozens of FOIA requests that were not satisfied. And we stand by the specific reporting in our episode, which came from the highest levels of the football program," he said.

Hudson has reportedly been heavily involved in Belichick's professional life since he was hired to be UNC's football coach in December. One report said she struck down the idea of the Tar Heels program being featured in "Hard Knocks."

She and Belichick both reportedly expressed concern about fan vitriol, particularly about their relationship, if UNC were to underperform.

Apparently, Belichick had asked UNC staff to include Hudson in all emails moving forward.

The 73-year-old and 24-year-old made their relationship public last year, which prompted plenty of eyeballs as it is. However, in recent weeks, Hudson gained more notoriety last month when she interrupted a CBS interview with Belichick, resulting in back-and-forth statements between the two parties.

Jim Whaley, retired Army Lt. Colonel and CEO of Mission Roll Call, told Fox News Digital in an exclusive interview why reform is necessary to improve the Department of Veterans Affairs.
 

EXCLUSIVE: President Donald Trump's Secretary of Veterans Affairs, Doug Collins, has proposed a 15% workforce reduction with a goal of cutting 80,000 jobs at the VA. 

Retired Lt. Col. Jim Whaley, CEO of Mission Roll Call, a veteran advocacy non-profit, said such VA reform is necessary to improve veterans' lives across the United States. 

Whaley told Fox News Digital that veterans want to see less bureaucracy at the VA and more "community care" to cut wait times and increase services at local VA hospitals, but "if it was easy, somebody would have solved it."

"Every American and politician, from both sides of the aisle, can agree that we want to make sure we take care of our veterans," Whaley said. "We just got out of over 20 years of war, so there are a lot of veterans and their families that need help. We want to make sure that every dollar that the American taxpayer is paying to support the VA is spent wisely, and that veterans are getting the care that they need. And more importantly, that they're getting the care when they need it, where they need it and how they need it."

The VA serves only half of U.S. veterans. While Whaley said Collins is trying to reach the other 50% through TV and podcast appearances, he encouraged more transparency about the VA's services to reach the other half of veterans who still need care. 

"One hundred days into the second Trump administration, and VA is no longer content with poor results. Under President Trump's leadership, we have already stripped away many of the costly distractions that were coming between VA beneficiaries and the benefits they have earned. And we're looking to make even more historic reforms to better serve our veterans," Collins said. 

Trump and Collins have faced controversy in the media and among Democrats for cutting VA jobs and for their efforts to overhaul the department. Whaley, whose organization conducts veteran polling, said more than half of veterans are worried about VA cuts.

"When all you hear is about the cuts versus what the philosophy is behind why you're making those changes in an organization, there's going to be fear. Change is hard. It's important that the VA stays as transparent as possible and reports on what is being done and what improvements are being made," Whaley said. 

However, Whatley, a veteran himself, said all veterans want to see an improved VA.

"They want to see services improve, they want to see wait times reduced. As time goes on and Veterans Affairs communicate more and more with veterans, they will know a little bit about what's going on, and they'll be a little less anxious about it. I think it's all about making sure that veterans are getting the news, making sure they understand why they're making these cuts."

Whaley encouraged Collins and the VA to include more veterans in the conversations surrounding the VA's reform by listening to families and caregivers to learn how to best invest in veteran care. 

"Veteran affairs are very important to recruitment issues, and that, of course, affects national security. So they're not all separate, it all wraps together. When a veteran gets out of the service after a few years of serving their country, we have to make sure that the transition to the civilian world and finding a job and plugging into the community goes smoothly, because if we don't, then we have an issue," Whaley said.

According to the 2023 National Veteran Suicide Prevention Annual Report, more than 17 veterans committed suicide per day in 2021. 

"We need to get the number of suicides as close to zero as possible. That's the number one priority," Whaley said, adding that community care is also a top priority, so veterans don't have to drive long distances and wait a long time to get the services they need.

"We need to make sure that the Department of Defense and the VA are working together when veterans are transitioning out of the military to make sure they're plugged into the VA and that the transition goes well. Because the fact of the matter is, the majority of suicides among veterans are from veterans that have recently transitioned to the civilian world."

            President Donald Trump on Friday set negotiating terms for his administration's first discussions with China, which are set to take place in Geneva this weekend.
    


            In a series of posts on Truth Social, Trump appeared to lay out his demands — and concessions — for the meeting between US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer and their Chinese counterparts. Trump said China must import more US goods, and in return, he believes the United States should lower its 145% tariff on most Chinese goods to 80%.
    


            “CHINA SHOULD OPEN UP ITS MARKET TO USA — WOULD BE SO GOOD FOR THEM!!! CLOSED MARKETS DON'T WORK ANYMORE!!!,” Trump posted.
    


            “80% Tariff on China seems right! Up to Scott B,” Trump said in a separate post.
    


            The concession would be a dramatic break from the present reality, which has sent shipments from China into the United States plunging by 60%, according to Ryan Petersen, CEO of Flexport, a logistics and freight forwarding broker.
    


            Even if tariffs fall to 80%, it's not clear that would be enough to convince US businesses to import Chinese goods. Economists have said 50% is the make-or-break threshold for the return of somewhat normal business between the two countries.
    


            Meanwhile, the damage is already done. Price hikes are beginning, and Goldman Sachs analysts Thursday said a key measure of inflation would effectively double to 4% by year end because of the trade war. Even if tariffs went to 0% this weekend, the US would still have price hikes and shortages, at least temporarily, because so little has been coming into US ports.
    


            China said Friday exports to the US fell 21% last month — before the effects of tariffs took hold.
    


            Trump has said he considers that a good thing. In the Oval Office Friday, Trump said the reduction in shipments from China means the United States is no longer losing money — a frequent if highly inaccurate refrain from the president that mistakenly equates a trade imbalance with losses.
    


            Trump and Bessent have both said the high tariff on China — and China's 125% tariff on most US goods — is unsustainable and needs to be lowered.
    


            However, Trump administration officials are trying to lower expectations about the potential outcomes of this weekend's talks in Geneva, according to senior administration officials briefed on the plans. They are framing the talks as a good first step but won't result in any kind of “deal,” or even a framework like the one with the United Kingdom that Trump announced in the Oval Office to much fanfare Thursday.
    


            Despite Trump's apparent overture, Director of the White House National Economic Council Kevin Hassett told CNN Friday that the tariff will not be lowered ahead of the negotiation.

            “I think that everything will happen while the talks are happening, not before,” he said at the White House. “It will come out tomorrow what happens. It's a negotiation.”
    


            Hassett added that Bessent and Greer are going into negotiations “with an open mind,” but said that news about any changes in tariffs won't come “until after the talks finish.”
    


            Bessent said Tuesday on Fox News that the discussions are to begin the thawing process in a frozen trade relationship.
    


            “My sense is that this will be about de-escalation, not about the big trade deal … but we've got to de-escalate before we can move forward,” he said. “You know, 145% [tariffs], 125%, is the equivalent of an embargo. We don't want to decouple, what we want is fair trade.”
    


            In the meantime, America's aggressive trade war has sent the US economy into reverse. Last week's report on gross domestic product, the broadest measure of the US economy, showed America's first contraction since early 2022, as an otherwise-healthy economy was dragged down by companies stockpiling goods to get ahead of tariffs. And that was the first quarter — before the most aggressive trade policy had even taken effect.
    


            Despite the increasingly dire warnings and economic turmoil, the United States and China remain far apart on an actual deal. Even with the talks set to kick off this weekend, Bessent said it could take two to three years for trade to normalize with China.

'America Reports' has the latest on the lawsuit from the California governor over the Trump administration's tariff policies.

Gov. Gavin Newsom, D-Calif., a potential 2028 presidential candidate, launched a new fact-check website on Wednesday targeting "right-wing misinformation," as a new poll found more than half of California registered voters believe he is more focused on becoming president than delivering for Californians. 

Newsom's campaign apparatus described the new fact-check website as a "rapid-response website to set the record straight about the Golden State" and President Donald Trump. 

A new survey conducted by UC Berkeley's Institute of Governmental Studies and co-sponsored by the Los Angeles Times found that 54% of California registered voters believe Newsom is more focused on his personal presidential ambitions than solving the ongoing problems at home in the Golden State. 

"By a more than a two-to-one margin (54% to 26%), most voters believe that as Newsom serves out his final two years as governor, he is devoting more of his attention to things that might benefit himself as a possible candidate for president than to governing the state and helping to solve its problems," according to the results of the poll completed April 21-28 among 6,201 registered voters in California.

Newsom's campaign, in a press release announcing the new fact-checking endeavor, touted California as the fourth-largest economy in the world, and said the blue state's population is growing, crime rates are at historic lows and California is leading the nation in clean energy and tech innovation.

"This site is for everyone sick of the BS about California. We're done letting the MAGA trolls define the Golden State. We're going on the offense and fighting back — with facts," Newsom said. 

Newsom's latest endeavor targets misinformation from the devastating Los Angeles fires this year and other state issues, including crime, climate, the economy, immigration, energy and housing. California is often ridiculed by Republicans as a representation of the demise of Democratic states. Such was the case last month when a California lawmaker proposed a bill to allow state college and university students to sleep in their cars amid the blue state's housing crisis. 

The California politician has long been rumored to harbor presidential ambitions. He was one of several names floated as a potential Democratic nominee replacement for President Joe Biden before Biden suspended his re-election campaign last summer and ultimately chose former Vice President Kamala Harris as his successor. Newsom also campaigned for Biden and Harris in key battleground states, acting as a surrogate for both candidates when their names were on the top of the ticket.

Newsom launched a podcast this year embracing political dialogue across party lines, following Democrats losing the White House and the Senate and failing to regain the House of Representatives in 2024. Newsom has invited Trump allies and conservative guests, including Charlie Kirk and Steve Bannon, onto his podcast in an attempt to show he is open to "criticism and debate without demeaning or dehumanizing one another." 

The strategy follows criticism after the 2024 election that Democrats didn't prioritize new media appearances and unscripted conversations enough. 

But Newsom's willingness to soak up the national spotlight as Democrats look for someone to lead the party into the next generation may have backfired among his California constituents.

Newsom is one of several Democratic governors trying to balance diplomacy with rejecting Trump's agenda during the president's second term. Newsom has spoken out against Trump's tariff policies and executive orders while reaching across the aisle to secure disaster relief following the Los Angeles fires earlier this year. 

The poll found a majority of California voters believe the state would be negatively impacted by Trump's overhaul of the federal government, as 64% believe Trump's tariffs would negatively impact California business and agriculture and over 50% believe Trump's policies would have a negative impact on education.

Meanwhile, Californians are split on Newsom's job performance, with 46% both approving and disapproving of his job as governor and 45% reporting they are not confident in "his ability to be effective in looking out for California's interests when dealing with the Trump administration."

"The Governor is focused on one thing: his job — driving L.A.'s recovery, confronting the housing crisis, and taking Donald Trump to court over his disastrous tariffs that are raising costs for families and blowing a hole in California's budget," Newsom's office told Fox News in response to the new polling.

'The Big Weekend Show' co-hosts guess dye-free foods and weigh in on Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. unveiling a plan to phase out eight artificial food dyes.

President Donald Trump said he does not know his new nominee for U.S. surgeon general, telling reporters Thursday that he relied upon the recommendation of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

Trump withdrew the nomination of his first pick for surgeon general, Dr. Janette Nesheiwat, this week and instead nominated Dr. Casey Means. The president, upon announcing her nomination, said she has "impeccable ‘MAHA' credentials."

When asked Thursday about Means and why he tapped her for the role, the president said Kennedy recommended her. 

"Because Bobby thought she was fantastic, brilliant woman who went through Stanford — wanted to be academic instead of physician," the president said. 

"I don't know her, I listened to Bobby," Trump added. "I think she'll be great."

Means, a vocal "Make America Healthy Again" proponent, played a significant role in helping shape the administration's agenda surrounding health alongside her brother, Calley Means. 

She has made a name for herself as a wellness influencer alongside her brother. In 2024, both Casey and Calley co-wrote a book about the chronic disease epidemic titled "Good Energy," and Casey is also the co-founder of a health-tech company called Levels.

Calley Means was previously tapped by the administration to serve as a top special advisor to Kennedy.

It is unclear why Nesheiwat's nomination was pulled. Fox News Digital reached out to the White House for more information and did not immediately receive a response. 

Meanwhile, in a follow-up post on X, Nesheiwat also said she was "looking forward" to continuing to support Trump while working closely with Kennedy "in a senior policy role."

"My focus continues to be on improving the health and well-being of all Americans, and that mission hasn't changed," Nesheiwat concluded in her public social media remarks.  

Nesheiwat is the sister-in-law of recently fired National Security Advisor Michael Waltz, whom the president indicated he will now be nominating to be the next ambassador to the United Nations after dropping his initial nominee, New York GOP Congresswoman Elise Stefanik.

            Getting the shingles vaccine could do more than just prevent a painful red rash — it may also lower the risk of heart disease and stroke, according to a new South Korean study of more than one million people published in the European Heart Journal.



            The highly common herpes strain, also called varicella-zoster virus (VZV), can cause chickenpox in childhood and later develop into shingles in older or immuno-compromised adults. The shingles vaccine is already considered a top-line defense against the virus, but recent studies have pointed to other unexpected health benefits.
    


            An analysis of health outcomes for 1,271,922 people age 50 and older found a 23% lower risk of cardiovascular disease among those who were vaccinated for shingles. The reduced risk was most noticeable up to eight years after vaccination among males, people under 60, and even those with “unhealthy lifestyles,” such as chronic smoking or drinking, according to the May 6 study.

            “Since shingles can cause inflammation in blood vessels and lead to blood clots, which in turn raise the risk of heart disease, preventing shingles through vaccination might also help reduce these cardiovascular risks,” explained Hayeon Lee, a coauthor and researcher from the Lee Kyung Hee University College of Medicine in an email. It's also possible that the nerve damage caused by shingles could disturb the heart's rhythm, leading to irregular palpitations and even cardiac arrest, per the study.
    


            The vaccine may be better at preventing shingles in younger patients and males because of their more robust immune systems, Lee said.
    


            “If a vaccine helps lower the risk of both infection and serious chronic conditions, it becomes an even more valuable public health tool,” Lee said. “This study supports a broader understanding of vaccination — not just as a shield against infectious diseases, but as part of a more comprehensive approach to maintaining long-term health.”
    


            More research is needed to determine a direct causal link between vaccination and reduced cardiovascular event risk, but this analysis is the largest and most comprehensive so far, presenting a compelling case for those on the fence about vaccination, said Dr. Sharon Curhan, a physician and epidemiologist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, who was not involved in the study.
    


            Since this herpes strain can lie dormant in the body for years after exposure before it reactivates into shingles, you don't need a history of chickenpox to get the vaccine, Curhan said.
    


            In fact, more than 99% of adults age 50 years and older worldwide have been exposed to VZV, and many may not have had, or known they had chickenpox at all, according to estimates from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
    


            Patients from the study used an older variation of the shingles vaccine that is being phased out of most countries.
    


            The live zoster vaccine, no longer available in the US as of 2020, contains a living but weakened form of the virus used to generate an immune response. It's since been swapped for Shingrix, a two-shot recombinant zoster vaccine containing only part of the virus — which has shown to be more effective.
    


            More research is needed to compare the various health benefits of these different vaccine variations, said Dr. Pascal Geldsetzer, an assistant professor of medicine at Stanford University who was not involved in the study.
    

Candidiasis that develops in the mouth or throat is called “thrush” or oropharyngeal candidiasis. Candidiasis in the vagina is commonly referred to as a “yeast infection.” Invasive candidiasis occurs when Candida species enter the bloodstream and spread throughout the body.

            “The biggest limitation of this type of research is that you're essentially comparing people who get vaccinated to those who don't get vaccinated,” Geldsetzer said. “We know that those people who decide to get vaccinated are often very different from those who don't in their health motivations and behaviors.”
    


            Researchers were able to sort for several demographic variables such as age, sex, income level and pre-existing conditions like high blood pressure, diabetes and high cholesterol. They also considered the frequency of medical visits and use of specific medications based on national insurance records, Lee said.
    


            Still, some variables, like diet, other vaccinations, and proper adherence to treatments, can always slip through the cracks in non-clinical trials which use large data sets like the one used in this study, Geldsetzer said. For this reason, he hopes future studies can be randomized and use data from a clinical setting.
    


            Additionally, Lee said future research should observe more racially and ethnically diverse populations, as immune responses can vary across different populations.
    


            These findings follow several other studies identifying the possible health benefits of shingles vaccination.
    


            In April, Geldsetzer and a team of researchers from Stanford published a study that found people who received the vaccine had a 20% reduced risk of dementia compared with those who didn't get it.

            This study took advantage of a “natural experiment” after Wales rolled out its shingles vaccination program in 2013. Due to limited vaccine supply, government officials decided that only Welsh adults born on or after a very specific date would be eligible, so researchers could directly compare the health outcomes of two groups of individuals over time while limiting covariables.
    


            This is likely because shingles doesn't just cause inflammation in the blood vessels, said Geldsetzer. It also inflames nerves throughout the body, which can lead to long-lasting pain disorders and, in the case of dementia, brain tissue damage.

Montclair Pickleball co-founders Aaron Reznick and Matt Slowinski discuss how pickleball can be a great place for singles to meet their partners on ‘Fox & Friends.'

Andre Agassi is back on the court, just a smaller one.

The eight-time Grand Slam winner made his professional pickleball debut last month at the U.S. Open Pickleball Championships, teaming up with 18-year-old Anna Leigh Waters, the top-ranked female player in the world, in a mixed tournament.

He won his first match before dropping his second, but after participating casually over the years, he's hooked.

"Dude, I'm not just liking it, I'm loving it. … It's an anomaly to see any support ever at this kind of pace, but it's easy to see why," Agassi said in a recent interview with Fox News Digital. "My family was looking for things to do, and watching how like bring people together, generations together, how it breaks cultural barriers, breaks down gender barriers, breaks down generational barriers, low-point of entry, nobody's intimated to try it, it's challenging at every level. Tell me when to stop, for crying out loud."

Agassi caught wind of "Dreambreaker: A Pickleball Story," a Netflix documentary - now streaming on MAX - directed by Ashley Underwood, Larry David's wife. She, too, has caught the pickleball fever, which might make for an amazing "Curb Your Enthusiasm" episode.

NAOMI OSAKA'S FIERY MESSAGE TO CRITICS AFTER WINNING TOURNAMENT IN FRANCE

"I played pickleball, my husband and I played. We had a fun group during COVID. That's actually when I got started," Underwood told Fox News Digital. "I was a tennis player before, and someone asked me to come play pickleball, and I fell in love with the sport. I went to a major league pickleball tournament in November 2021, and I couldn't believe what I saw in the pro game. They're just playing like a completely different sport almost than recreational players. Just real athletes, incredible to see, and honestly, I saw that this was the birth of a professional sport. So I wanted to chronicle a unique moment in time."

Despite his tennis success, though, there are a lot of nooks and crannies that Agassi still needs to get used to.

"It's really hard. These guys are so specialized, it's so sensitive, such little margin for error," Agassi said. "There's so much nuance that creates opportunity. It's not like ‘see space, hit space.' There was a lot I had to unlearn, but some things came instinctively. I grew up with a racket in my hand, and in this case it's a paddle, so I'm going to make good contact. But the blood pressure, it's hard to find a place to put it when you're out there on the pickle court."

The justices will soon decide whether to weaken the courts holding back Trump.

by  Ian Millhiser

On May 15, the Supreme Court will hear three cases — consolidated under the name Trump v. CASA — which concern his unconstitutional attempt to strip many Americans born in the United States of citizenship. The mere fact that this hearing is happening is significant, as the Court rarely gives cases a full hearing in May, and typically only does so for matters of extreme urgency.

There is no plausible argument that the Donald Trump executive order at the heart of this case, which targets birthright citizenship — the constitutional principle that nearly anyone born in the United States is automatically a citizen — is lawful. As Judge John Coughenour, a Reagan appointee who was the first judge to block the order, said from the bench, “I've been on the bench for over four decades, I can't remember another case where the question presented is as clear as this one is.”

Get the latest developments on the US Supreme Court from senior correspondent Ian Millhiser.

That said, the specific legal questions before the Court have little to do with birthright citizenship. At least three courts issued “nationwide injunctions” against Trump's anti-citizenship order, meaning that lower court judges handed down orders that bind the entire federal government and prohibit Trump from canceling anyone's citizenship anywhere under his executive order.

The question of whether a single federal trial judge may issue an order that binds the entire country is fraught and has been hotly disputed for years. During the later days of the first Trump administration, Republican Justice Neil Gorsuch published an uncharacteristically persuasive concurring opinion arguing that these nationwide orders must be reined in.

Gorsuch argued that injunctions — court orders that either require a party to take a particular action or forbid them from doing so — are “meant to redress the injuries sustained by a particular plaintiff in a particular lawsuit.” When one judge can go much further, halting an entire federal policy nationwide, that creates an asymmetry. “There are currently more than 1,000 active and senior district court judges,” Gorsuch wrote. In a world with nationwide injunctions, plaintiffs can shop around for the one judge in America who is most likely to be sympathetic to their cause, and potentially secure a court order that no other judge would hand down.

This “judge-shopping” became a huge problem during the Biden administration, as there is a cohort of judges in Texas who proved quite willing to issue injunctions against a wide range of liberal policies that are unquestionably lawful. Think of Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk and his infamous court order attempting to ban the abortion drug mifepristone.

The GOP-controlled Supreme Court, moreover, often treated nationwide injunctions against the Biden administration very differently than injunctions binding a Republican president. In the first Trump administration, when lower court judges blocked Trump's immigration policies, the Court often intervened within days to halt those injunctions. But when judges like Kacsmaryk enjoined Biden's immigration policies, the Supreme Court would sometimes sit on those cases for nearly a year before ruling that the injunction was illegal.

Indeed, nationwide injunctions so frustrated the Biden administration that, on her way out the door, Biden's solicitor general, Elizabeth Prelogar, filed a brief asking the justices to limit these broad orders. That brief was filed in December 2024, after Trump had won the election, so Prelogar knew that Trump was likely to benefit if the justices took her up on her invitation.

Ultimately, they did not — but they've instead decided to consider the question of nationwide injunctions in CASA. That's an odd choice, because the case for a nationwide injunction on this particular issue is unusually strong. 

If Trump's lawyers convince the Supreme Court to limit nationwide injunctions, however, it will have enormous implications that stretch far beyond the birthright citizenship issue. As of this writing, there are more than 200 lawsuits challenging actions by the Trump administration. If lower court judges cannot issue nationwide injunctions, Trump will have far more leeway to implement policies even after a lower court deems them illegal or unconstitutional.

Still, the nationwide injunctions issue has lingered for a long time, upsetting the Justice Department in both Democratic and Republican administrations. So the Court probably could not continue ignoring it forever.

Before we dive deeper into the nationwide injunctions issue, it should be noted that the merits of the CASA case are as straightforward as any issue that has reached the Supreme Court in recent memory. Trump's attack on birthright citizenship is obviously unconstitutional, and there are no good-faith arguments for his position.

On his first day back in office, Trump signed an executive order that purports to strip citizenship from many babies born in the United States. The order targets children born to undocumented mothers whose fathers were neither citizens nor lawful permanent residents at the time of the child's birth. It also targets children of fathers with similar immigration status, and mothers who were lawfully, but temporarily, present in the United States when their child was born.

The order does not apply retroactively — by its terms, only babies born 30 days after it was issued would be ineligible for citizenship. Had it applied to adult citizens, however, it would likely denationalize many very prominent Americans, including former Vice President Kamala Harris.

The problem with this order is that the 14th Amendment provides that “all persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the state wherein they reside.” “All persons” means all persons, regardless of their parents' immigration status.

As the Supreme Court held in United States v. Wong Kim Ark (1898), moreover, the 14th Amendment's exception for children who are not “subject to the jurisdiction” of the United States is very narrow. The United States has “jurisdiction” over anyone who is bound by its laws — if the US did not have jurisdiction over undocumented immigrants, for example, then it would not be legal to deport them.

Wong Kim Ark explained that there are three classes of people, two of which are still relevant today, who are not subject to US jurisdiction. One is the children “born of alien enemies in hostile occupation.” The other is children of “diplomatic representatives of a foreign state,” who have diplomatic immunity from US law. (The third category is some “children of members of the Indian tribes,” but a 1924 law established that tribal citizens are also US citizens.)

Indeed, it's worth noting that Trump's lawyers didn't even ask the Supreme Court to fully restore his birthright citizenship order — they merely asked the Court to limit the scope of the lower courts' injunctions so that they only apply to the specific plaintiffs challenging the order. That strategic decision by Trump's lawyers is unsurprising, because the unconstitutionality of Trump's order was settled more than 125 years ago in Wong Kim Ark.

While there is no serious argument that Trump's birthright citizenship order is legal, there are very serious arguments on both sides of the nationwide injunction question. Gorsuch and Prelogar are correct that, when a single trial judge can set policy for the entire nation, it can needlessly disrupt the federal government's legitimate activities.

At the same time, a blanket rule against nationwide injunctions would render many court orders worthless. As one of the plaintiffs challenging the birthright citizenship order points out in their brief, the appropriate remedy in a gerrymandering case is that the entire gerrymandered district must be redrawn — not that the individual plaintiffs who brought that case be moved to another district. A more limited order would be unworkable and would impose impossible burdens on election officials who would have to track which voters are plaintiffs in which lawsuits in order to determine which candidates they may vote for.

Similar problems would arise in the birthright citizenship cases if the Supreme Court attempted to limit the injunctions against Trump's executive order. Two of the plaintiffs challenging that order, CASA, Inc. and the Asylum Seeker Advocacy Project (ASAP), say that they have “more than 800,000 members, spread across all 50 states.” When an organization secures an injunction against a federal policy, that injunction typically covers every member of that organization.

Were the injunction against the executive order limited to CASA and ASAP members, in other words, states and the federal government could have to track whether the parents of impacted children are members of either group (or perhaps if the children are — again, it's not at all clear how this would work), and extend citizenship only to those individuals. A parent who lets their membership lapse could see their child denationalized, perhaps to become a citizen again once they rejoin. That would create an unworkable administrative nightmare for everyone involved.

Meanwhile, two other cases were brought by two blocs of states, led by Washington and New Jersey, respectively. And it's not at all clear how an injunction against the executive order limited to these states alone would work: Would someone born in Washington cease to be a citizen if they crossed the border into Idaho? Or would someone born in Idaho suddenly become a citizen if they entered Washington, only to lose that status the minute they returned to a non-plaintiff state? Such a rule wouldn't just be exceedingly difficult to administer, it would likely violate the Constitution's equal protection principle, which prohibits arbitrary distinctions among similarly situated individuals.

Fortunately, the Supreme Court's current precedents offer a framework that can be used to resolve this tension between giving judges too much power to set national policy and forcing them to draw arbitrary lines that needlessly burden both the plaintiffs and the government. As the Court said in Califano v. Yamaski (1979), the ordinary rule is that “injunctive relief should be no more burdensome to the defendant than necessary to provide complete relief to the plaintiffs.”

In many cases, Califano will preclude nationwide injunctions. But, in the birthright citizenship cases, it's hard to see how anything other than a nationwide injunction could suffice. CASA and ASAP members won't receive complete relief if they are constantly having to prove their membership (or their parents' membership) in one of these two organizations to obtain the benefits of citizenship, including the right to be free from deportation. And states can't administer programs like Medicaid, where eligibility often turns on a beneficiary's immigration status, if they can't tell who is or is not a citizen.

It's worth acknowledging one additional wrinkle in this case, which the Court could decide to take up at the May 15 argument. The Trump administration claims that the state plaintiffs aren't entitled to any relief at all because they lack “standing” — the requirement that a litigant show that they were injured in some way by the defendant they are suing before bringing a federal lawsuit.

But the states have a very strong argument that they have standing to challenge the birthright citizenship order. As one bloc of states explains in their brief, many federal programs tie funding to the number of citizens within a particular state, so states will lose money if the birthright citizenship order goes into effect. Loss of funding is one of the most common ways to establish standing to bring a federal lawsuit.

Additionally, the states argue that ending birthright citizenship for many children of immigrants would require them to make “substantial changes to existing public programs such as Medicaid, the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP), Title IV-E foster care, and the Social Security Administration's (SSA) Enumeration at Birth program.”

Ultimately, because the case for a nationwide injunction in CASA is so strong, the Court probably will not use this case to unravel many of the more difficult questions posed by more questionable nationwide injunctions. But, at the very least, the case is likely to offer an early window into how these justices will determine which nationwide injunctions are allowed and which ones are forbidden.

President Donald Trump's return to the White House is reviving a push to defund Planned Parenthood, with abortion opponents seeing a rare chance to pass the language through Republicans' sweeping budget bill.

Conservatives have tried for years to strip federal funding from the abortion provider, only to see their efforts fall short in Congress or reversed when administrations change hands.

With limited exceptions, federal law already bars taxpayer dollars from being used for abortions, but the organization receives hundreds of millions of dollars in Medicaid reimbursements that anti-abortion groups want blocked as well.

Planned Parenthood also provides contraception and health services, such as STD screenings, that qualify under the program.

Trump has begun to pull some funding for Planned Parenthood. Last month, the administration froze tens of millions in Title X dollars directed to family planning centers, targeting Planned Parenthood affiliates in several states.

But anti-abortion activists see reconciliation, a budget process that allows Republicans to sidestep the filibuster, as the best avenue to pursue a broader and longer-lasting prohibition. Trump pursued a similar freeze in his first term that was reversed by former President Joe Biden.

Outside groups such as Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America have been engaging with lawmakers one-on-one while also applying public pressure. In March, hundreds of activists visited congressional offices in the House and Senate in a Washington lobbying blitz.

There are signs those groups will find opposition from a crop of centrist Republicans uncomfortable with defunding the organization.

Swing district lawmakers such as Rep. Mike Lawler (R-NY) have already begun to air concerns, throwing into doubt whether the language will be included in the GOP megabill, which sweeps together Trump's tax, border, and energy priorities. The Energy and Commerce Committee, which has jurisdiction over Medicaid, has yet to release its legislative text ahead of a Tuesday markup.

Yet Republicans, by and large, support defunding Planned Parenthood, arguing the Medicaid funding indirectly supports its abortion procedures. 

A week ago, Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) promised the House will “redirect funds away from big abortion” through reconciliation. Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-SD) has also aligned himself with the anti-abortion movement, attending this year's March for Life with Johnson in January.

“We know that this is achievable,” said Kelsey Pritchard, a spokeswoman for Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America.

“We've got the Republican trifecta, we've got strong pro-life leaders in the House and the Senate, and basically what we've heard is that people are enthused overall to get this done,” she added.

The first step will come next week, when the Energy and Commerce Committee holds a hearing to sign off on its portion of the megabill. 

The lion's share of the controversy has focused on separate Medicaid reforms, with fiscal hawks seeking to roll back the generous federal subsidies offered to expansion states, but Planned Parenthood could become another flashpoint if the legislation includes defunding language.

Committee Republicans would then have to reject any Democratic attempts to strip the provision from the underlying bill.

The language could also threaten its passage on the House floor, though it's unclear how deep concerns run among centrist Republicans. Rep. Don Bacon (R-NE) is open to defunding Planned Parenthood as part of reconciliation, telling the Washington Examiner that “a lot of folks don't like their taxpayer money going to the largest abortion provider in the country.”

Rep. Jeff Van Drew (R-NJ) is also receptive. Both lawmakers have caused headaches for GOP leadership, vowing in the reconciliation fight to oppose any bill that deeply cuts Medicaid benefits.

Ultimately, unease over Planned Parenthood defunding could be dwarfed by bigger fights over the bill. In addition to Medicaid, blue-state Republicans are bartering for an expansion of SALT, a tax deduction that tends to help higher-income earners.

But Republicans could face pressure in their districts from Planned Parenthood and its allied groups. They have run ads accusing Republicans of attempting to strip healthcare from women during past defunding attempts.

In a statement, the organization promised to “fight like hell” to make sure its funding is preserved. Last year, 34% of its revenue fell under the umbrella of “government health services reimbursements & grants.”

“Federal Medicaid funds don't pay for abortion except in rare exceptions, but that's not stopping these lawmakers from going after Planned Parenthood,” said Alexis McGill Johnson, president and CEO of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund. “They're set on depriving patients, particularly people who already have the hardest time getting healthcare, of access to affordable cancer screenings, birth control, STI testing and treatment, and many other essential reproductive healthcare services.”

So far, Planned Parenthood has survived GOP attempts at defunding. In 2011, the House passed the provision in a fight over government funding, but the language was removed ahead of a shutdown deadline.

The measure even made it to then-President Barack Obama's desk in 2016 but was vetoed.

With unified control of Washington, anti-abortion activists have renewed that push, describing it as their “first priority” with Trump's reelection. But the Senate will pose a challenge regardless of which party is in charge.

The Senate, too, has GOP centrists who are expected to oppose the provision. Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME) hasn't explicitly drawn a red line, but she and Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) have a long track record of voting to protect the organization.

Both unsuccessfully tried to remove the defunding language when it came before the Senate in late 2015.

“I'm going to wait and see what the full package is rather than singling out individual provisions,” Collins told reporters on Tuesday.

MIKE WALTZ BEGINS UN NOMINATION OUTREACH WITH CALLS TO SENATE ALLIES

The strict rules of budget reconciliation pose a second hurdle for anti-abortion groups. In 2017, the last time Republicans had unified control, the parliamentarian ruled the defunding language must be struck from their Obamacare repeal legislation.

If Republicans' budget bill fails this time, as it did with Obamacare repeal, they would likely have to wait for the next fiscal year to make another push through reconciliation.

Nominated by former President Barrack Obama and confirmed by the Senate in 2016, Carla Hayden was the first woman and the first African American in the role.

Democratic leaders erupted late Thursday after it was reported that President Trump had abruptly fired Librarian of Congress Carla Hayden. 

Hayden was notified of her firing in an email late Thursday from the White House's Presidential Personnel Office, according to an email seen by The Associated Press. 

"Carla," the email reportedly began. "On behalf of President Donald J. Trump, I am writing to inform you that your position as the Librarian of Congress is terminated effective immediately. Thank you for your service." 

Nominated by former President Barack Obama and confirmed by the Senate in 2016, Hayden, whose term was set to expire next year, was the first woman and the first African American in the role. Advocates praised her tenure for helping to modernize the Library and make it more accessible with initiatives in rural communities and online.

But Hayden had come under fire from the conservative advocacy group American Accountability Foundation, which accused her and other library leaders of promoting children's books with "radical" content and literary material authored by Trump opponents. 

Earlier Thursday, just hours before the firing was made public, AAF derided Hayden on X as "woke" and "anti-Trump," accusing her of promoting "trans-kids." 

"It's time to get her OUT and hire a new guy for the job!" the group wrote. 

In a follow-up post on X, the group celebrated news of Hayden's firing, thanking President Trump. 

Hayden's reported firing ignited the fury of prominent Democratic leaders, including House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., and Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer of New York.

Jeffries applauded Hayden as "an accomplished, principled and distinguished Librarian of Congress."

"Donald Trump's unjust decision to fire Dr. Hayden in an email sent by a random political hack is a disgrace and the latest in his ongoing effort to ban books, whitewash American history and turn back the clock," Jeffries said.

"Enough is enough," Schumer said, calling Hayden a "trailblazer, a scholar, and a public servant of the highest order."

Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn., said Hayden was "callously fired" by Trump and demanded an explanation.

"Hayden, has spent her entire career serving people — from helping kids learn to read to protecting some of our nation's most precious treasures," said Rep. Joseph Morelle of New York, the top Democrat on the House Administration Committee that oversees the Library.

New Mexico Sen. Martin Heinrich, the top Democrat on the Senate panel that oversees funding for the library, said the firing, was "taking his assault on America's libraries to a new level."

"Dr. Hayden has devoted her career to making reading and the pursuit of knowledge available to everyone," he said.

The Library of Congress holds a vast collection of the nation's books and history, which it makes available to the public and lawmakers. It houses the papers of nearly two dozen presidents and more than three dozen Supreme Court justices. It also has collections of rare books, prints and photographs, as well as troves of music and valuable artifacts.

Robert Newlen, the principal deputy librarian, said he would serve as acting librarian of Congress "until further instruction" in a separate email seen by the AP.

"I promise to keep everyone informed," he wrote to colleagues.

Hayden's firing comes as the Trump administration has been purging officials seen as not aligning with the president's agenda – from the Justice Department to the Pentagon and beyond. 

Earlier Thursday, Cameron Hamilton, the acting administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, was fired just one day after telling lawmakers that dismantling the agency – as President Trump has proposed – is a bad move.

            As workers set up stations at North Division High School's cafeteria to test children's blood for lead, a group of frustrated parents and community activists gathered just outside the main entrance. They carried handmade signs: “Milwaukee–Beer, Cheese, and Lead Poisoning” and “Test All Schools for Lead Now.”
    


            After a child was found to have lead poisoning from peeling lead paint in a local elementary school early this year, the district began closing buildings and temporarily relocating students. It launched a plan to inspect, clean and repaint more than 100 schools by the end of the year, much of it during the summer.
    


            For the crowd gathered outside, it's not enough.
    


            “This lead crisis is not a new crisis,” said Melody McCurtis, deputy director of a local organization called Metcalfe Park Community Bridges, a grassroots effort to revitalize one of the city's Northside neighborhoods.
    


            “Milwaukee is full of lead, whether it's in your homes, whether it's in your schools, whether it's in your drinking water,” she said at the news conference.
    


            This year was the first time the city has confirmed that a child was poisoned by lead from a school, but the people of Milwaukee know it's not the city's first problem with the potent neurotoxin. The city has fumbled its response before, leaving residents wary of new promises.
    


            Even as the city's health department and school district work to clean and repaint aging schools, they're having to rebuild public trust.
    


            And as of last month, they're doing it without federal help: Lead experts from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention who had been working with the city were cut during a massive wave of layoffs by the Trump administration. US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy suggested that they would be reinstated, but so far, they have not been.
    


            The unprecedented loss of federal support brought a national spotlight to the crisis in schools. But many families say the latest efforts to clean and repaint old buildings, though well-intentioned, are only a Band-aid. They're covering up the lead, not getting it out of schools completely.
    


            “We have had crisis after crisis every few years, and we have heard similar kind of things from city leadership throughout that time,” said Derek Beyer, a former teacher with Milwaukee Public Schools, who spoke for the Get the Lead Out Coalition. “It's been kind of, in my opinion, a game of pass the buck rather than just remove the lead.”
    


            People like him believe that the city's old infrastructure will continue to cause harm for generations to come.
    


            Like other major cities in America's Rust Belt, Milwaukee has long been burdened by lead. Because it's cheap and easy to bend, it was used to make pipes that carried municipal drinking water. It was added to paint to make it dry faster and last longer and mixed into gasoline to reduce engine knock in cars.
    


            These uses for lead have long been banned, but the threat of its toxicity remains. It can still leach out of pipes, flake off walls and surface in soil. Even small amounts can damage a child's brain function, affecting their behavior, IQ and self-control.
    


            Each year, about 1,000 children in Milwaukee test positive for lead poisoning, which the CDC defines as at or above 3.5 micrograms per deciliter of lead in the blood. Roughly 15 have to be hospitalized for acute symptoms such as abdominal pain, vomiting, constipation and seizures. About 200 have blood lead levels over 15, which triggers a health department investigation to determine the source.
    


            Most often, they're poisoned by lead paint in deteriorating homes. In January, for the first time, the health department determined that a child had been poisoned not at home but by peeling paint in the basement of one of the city's elementary schools.
    


            Many of Milwaukee's schools had gone without regular painting and maintenance for years: A report submitted to the Wisconsin legislature last year showed that the schools needed more than $250 million in deferred maintenance. Meanwhile, the old lead paint created a fresh hazard as it chalked and flaked off the walls.
    


            Kat Cisar, who has twins in the first grade at the Trowbridge Street School of Great Lakes Studies, found out that the school was abruptly closing and that students would be relocated in an email that came at 7:36 p.m. on a Thursday in March, giving parents and school officials only days to adjust.
    


            As parents dropped off their students at a building 5 miles away from their old school on the next Monday,  they had no idea how long they would be displaced or whether a student at their school had been poisoned.
    


            “What happened behind the scenes was a lot of confusion and a lot of uncertainty,” Cisar said the community event on Wednesday. Principals and teachers didn't have any more information than parents did, she said.
    


            Cisar said parents would like to see better communication from the district, including text alerts if a child at a certain school tests positive for an elevated lead level. They also want school principals to be kept in the loop so they can share timely updates with parents.
    


            Trowbridge was closed for almost two weeks. Other school buildings have been closed for months. Parents say they have no idea how long the hazards existed before action was taken.
    


            Milwaukee Public Schools Superintendent Dr. Brenda Cassellius, who assumed her post in mid-March as the crisis was already unfolding, says schools in the district have been underfunded and individual principals were forced to make impossible choices.
    


            “You've had to make a hard choice between adding a teacher or a paraprofessional or additional special education teachers for students with disabilities, or painting a wall,” she told CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta this week.
    


            Going forward, Cassellius said, the district will assume the cost of school repairs so they aren't shouldered by individual schools. So far, the district has spent nearly $2 million to clean and repaint seven schools, and remediation will start on two more this month.
    


            Cassellius estimates that it could cost as much as $20 million from the district's reserve funds.
    


            That may stave off the crisis, but it won't be the last of the city's lead problems.
    


            Tracy Hampton, a 34-year-old mother of three who was born and raised in Milwaukee, has been trying to keep her kids away from lead for nearly a decade.
    


            When her oldest son, Prince, was a toddler, a test showed that he had a lead level of 27, which prompted his doctor to prescribe iron drops to help reduce the body's absorption of lead. Hampton was told to wipe down toys and surfaces in their home and make sure he was eating plenty of fruits, vegetables and other healthy foods to counteract the damaging effects of the heavy metal.
    


            But a few months later, a routine blood test showed that he had a blood lead level of 45, more than 11 times higher than the CDC's threshold for lead poisoning.
    


            “The doctor told me to take him to the hospital immediately, and that's what I did,” Hampton said, recalling the 2016 ordeal. Dr. Kristine Davison, a pediatrician at Children's Hospital of Wisconsin who has been the family's doctor for years, confirmed the details of the family's blood lead levels for this story.
    


            An X-ray at the hospital revealed bright flecks of white in his stomach, a sign that he'd eaten chips of lead-based paint. He ran a high fever, vomited and had a seizure, and doctors worked to flush as much lead as they could from his body.
    


            Around the same time, the city's health department dropped the ball on lead investigations. An audit of the department's records in 2018 failed to find any evidence that it had notified some 6,000 families that their children had elevated levels of lead in their blood.
    


Further investigation showed that the department bungled follow-up care too, failing to investigate the sources of lead exposure for some children. Other instances found that some children's cases were closed early, before there was evidence that their lead levels had returned to normal.
    


            The failures affected cases going to back to 2015.
    


            The health commissioner at the time was forced to resign. The state and federal governments launched investigations into the health department's handling of lead poisonings.
    


            It's not clear whether Hampton's family was among those that fell through the cracks. She had been spending nights at her mother's house for help with her active toddler, and she says the Milwaukee Department of Health tested the rental home and found that the windows and floors were loaded with lead.
    


            “It was really old,” Hampton said.
    


            Her mother's rental home sits on the city's north side. Between 2018 and 2021, nearly 1 in 5 children who lived in that neighborhood had elevated levels of lead in their blood, according to data from the Wisconsin Department of Health Services.
    


            After Hampton limited the amount of time she spent at her mother's place and stopped spending the night, Prince's lead levels began to come down.
    


            In 2022, Hampton moved her family into a different rental home. Prince's lead levels continued to be elevated, hovering around 6.5. His baby sister, Idanna, also tested over the CDC's threshold for lead poisoning for the first time.
    


            That house, too, was tested and found to be full of lead paint.
    


            In Milwaukee, 88% of homes were built before 1978, when it was still legal to use lead-based paint. Dr. Mike Totoraitis, the city's health commissioner, estimates that about 200,000 housing units in the city may still be affected by it, based on their age.
    


            “Unfortunately, the majority of the poisonings that we have in our city are in the poorest housing stock of our city,” he said.
    


            Since their industrial heydays, many Midwest cities have seen their urban populations shrink. Practices like redlining contributed by concentrating Black populations in some of the poorest neighborhoods, which were then spurned by investors. As a result, homes and municipal buildings have aged and deteriorated but were not torn down and replaced.
    


            If there was a silver lining to the scrutiny of Milwaukee's lax lead response in 2018, it was that the health department's lead program was completely rebuilt and strengthened.
    


            “That's frankly how we're able to respond to this whole crisis at the schools,” said Totoraitis, who joined the department in 2023.
    


            When news of the student poisoning broke this year, the health department set up a dedicated website where it has posted photos of affected schools, inspection reports and letters to parents. It has held regular news briefings and town halls. Totoraitis said it's also working to create a dashboard so parents can have more insight into the results of student blood tests.
    


            Under pressure from angry parents, the school district parted ways with its facilities manager. The director of the health department's home environmental health program has been loaned to the district to fill that role as abatement on the buildings continues.
    


            Totoraitis knows that the community remembers — and that shades the department's assurances to the public now.
    


            “Through that moment in our department's history to where we are now, we have always leaned into the issues that we've seen in our city, in particular with our lead program, and I think that's helped to rebuild some of the trust that we lost, rightly so, with the community,” Totoraitis said.
    


            At Trowbridge Street School, it's clear that Room 13 – home to Mr. Koney's Kindergarten Superheroes – has gotten a recent facelift.
    


            Photos taken during the health department's inspection showed bookshelves with cracked and peeling paint sitting close to the ground, but the wood is now sanded smooth and painted over. A hallway with hooks for kids' backpacks now has blotches of fresh paint just a shade lighter than the old blue underneath. Cracks in the walls outside the classroom have been sealed with a white caulk-like substance. The wooden floors of the 129-year-old building gleam with fresh polish.
    


            “It's almost a hospital-level clean that we're needing to do to clear the swabs,” Cassellius said, referring to how the health department tests to make sure there's no lead dust lingering on surfaces.
    


            The department said the lead has been contained at Trowbridge, for now.
    


            But some parents say argue that it doesn't address faucets where water has tested high for lead or soil around the schools. A soil sample at a playground at Golda Meir School surpassed the state's action level for lead but not a level set by the US Environmental Protection Agency.
    


            “This is an inadequate response that we're having at all levels of government here that we're fighting back, and we're kind of banding together and figuring out how we can force some of these institutions to do the right thing,” said Kristen Payne, whose son is a third-grader at Golda Meir, the site of the initial poisoning case.
    


            The health department and school district say that drinking water sources in schools are safe. The district has installed filtered water dispensers in schools, and any sinks that have been found to have elevated lead levels are supposed to be labeled as not for drinking.
    


            Totoraitis says that with strained resources, the city has to focus on lead hazards that are known to have poisoned students. For now, that's the paint.
    


            But he's asking for money to hire four more people to help him respond to community complaints of chipping paint or other potential hazards before they poison anyone. He could also then inspect school buildings regularly to make sure the district is following its plans to mitigate lead.
    


            Health officials are encouraging parents of students at affected schools to get them tested for lead. With 68,000 students in the district — most of them beyond the age when they'd get regular lead testing at a pediatrician's office — the city has been trying create more testing opportunities.
    


            Inside North Division High School on Wednesday, the district hosted a lead testing clinic that would give parents near-instant feedback on whether a child might have a high level of lead in their system.
    


            An earlier clinic tested about 250 kids, but only 22 were tested Wednesday. Of those, two had elevated blood lead levels and will require more testing.
    


            For now, given the funding they have, the schools and health department say, they can clean up chipped lead paint in homes and schools and seal it under new paint. They can make a building lead-safe but not truly lead-free.
    


            If the repairs are not maintained, the threat will eventually be back.
    


            “It's a constant cleaning, a constant upkeep, a constant painting. And it is expensive,” Cassellius said.
    


            At some point, trying to maintain Milwaukee's aging schools – some of which are more than 100 years old – simply won't be sustainable or safe anymore.
    


            There is some federal help coming for homes in Milwaukee. Totoraitis said the city recently got federal funding to remediate 600, but each project has cost much more than anticipated. In the end, he said, they'll probably be able to clean up 450 homes.
    


            Helping a single home can have an impact, though.
    


            Prince, who is now 10 and in fourth grade, has trouble reading and writing and needs remedial help in school. He's also been diagnosed with ADHD. His mother, Tracy Hampton, said doctors have told her that his issues were probably caused by his exposure to lead.
    


            Hampton moved again in 2023, this time into a house that she said was tested and shown to have no lead issues.
    


            This year, for the first time since he was a baby, Prince's blood lead level has fallen into the normal range again, Hampton said. His sister, who turns 3 next week, is in the normal range, too.
    


            Hampton hopes her story will motivate the city to proactively test more homes and schools for lead and not wait until more children are harmed.
    


            “We need our kids to live, to be smart, to be intelligent, to do what they want to be in life,” she said. “Not to grow up with a disability.”

            For around 2,000 years, global sea levels varied little. That changed in the 20th century. They started rising and have not stopped since — and the pace is accelerating.
    


            Scientists are scrambling to understand what this means for the future just as President Trump strips back agencies tasked with monitoring the oceans.
    


            Since 1993, satellites have kept careful watch over the world's oceans, allowing scientists a clear view of how they are behaving. What they have revealed is alarming.
    


            Sea level rise was unexpectedly high last year, according to a recent NASA analysis of satellite data.
    


            More concerning, however, is the longer-term trend. The rate of annual sea level rise has more than doubled over the past 30 years, resulting in the global sea level increasing 4 inches since 1993.
    


            “It's like we're putting our foot on the gas pedal,” said Benjamin Hamlington, a research scientist in the Sea Level and Ice Group at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. While other climate signals fluctuate, global sea level has a “persistent rise,” he told CNN.
    


            It spells trouble for the future. Scientists have a good idea how much average sea level will rise by 2050 — around 6 inches globally, and as much as 10 to 12 inches in the US. Past 2050, however, things get very fuzzy.
    


            “We have such a huge range of uncertainty,” said Dirk Notz, head of sea ice at the University of Hamburg. “The numbers are just getting higher and higher and higher very quickly.”
    


            The world could easily see an extra 3 feet of sea level rise by 2100, he told CNN; it could also take hundreds of years to reach that level. Scientists simply don't know enough yet to project what will happen.
    


            What scientists are crystal clear about is the reason for the rise: human-caused global warming.
    


            Oceans absorb roughly 90% of the excess heat primarily produced by burning fossil fuels, and as water heats up it expands. Heat in the oceans and atmosphere is also driving melting of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets, which together hold enough fresh water to raise global sea levels by around 213 feet.
    


            Melting ice sheets have driven roughly two-thirds of longer-term sea level rise, although last year — the planet's hottest on record — the two factors flipped, making ocean warming the main driver.
    


            It's likely that an increase of about 3 feet is already locked in, Notz said, because “we have pushed the system too hard.” The big question is, how quickly will it happen?
    


            Ice sheets are the biggest uncertainty, as it's not clear how fast they'll react as the world heats up — whether they'll melt steadily or reach a tipping point and rapidly collapse.
    


            From studying things like ice cores and sediments, scientists know sudden and dramatic melting happened thousands of years ago, Notz said, but it's still unclear how processes may unfold over the next decades and centuries.
    


            Antarctica is “the elephant in the room,” he said. Alarming changes are unfolding on this vast icy continent, which holds enough water to raise levels by 190 feet.
    


            Notz describes the ice sheet as an “awakening giant:” It takes a long time to wake up but once awake, “it's very, very difficult to put it back to sleep.”
    


            It will take time for scientists to unravel what the future holds for the ice sheets and what that means for sea level rise.
    


            “There'll be big uncertainties that persist for decades,” said Robert Nicholls, professor of climate adaptation at the University of East Anglia.
    


            The ocean is not flat like a bathtub and there are big variations in the way sea level rise is experienced.
    


            Some parts of the world see higher levels because of a tangle of factors, including regional currents, erosion and land shifts — some due to natural processes such as tectonic plate movements, others to human activities including fossil fuel and groundwater extraction.
    


            The US coastlines are tracking above global average and toward the upper end of climate model projections, NASA's Hamlington said.
    


            The Gulf Coast, where land is sinking in large part due to the extraction of oil, gas and groundwater, is a hotspot.
    


            Louisiana is particularly vulnerable as climate change-driven sea level rise meets fast-sinking land. The state has one of the highest rates of land loss in the world, with some areas experiencing relative sea level rise nearly four times the global rate.
    


            Outside the United States, low-lying Pacific island nations bear the brunt of sea level rise, which already poses a threat to their existence.
    


            Over the next three decades, islands such as Tuvalu, Kiribati and Fiji will experience at least 6 inches of sea level rise even if the world reduces planet-heating pollution, according to NASA.
    


            The world's coastal communities were built with an understanding of where high tides normally reach. “Now we're shifting that normal” and even tiny shifts can cause big  impacts, Hamlington said.
    


            Already, coastal flooding is increasing, even in the absence of big storms or heavy rainfall. High tide flooding is now happening two to three times more often since 1990 along most US Atlantic and Gulf coastlines, said William Sweet, an oceanographer at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
    


            Sea level rise also contributes to coastal erosion, chokes sewage systems and causes salty water to seep into underground freshwater supplies.
    


Where sinking cities are pushing sea level rise into overdrive



            Rising seas won't be felt equally. In some places, 6 inches might mean more frequent flooding during high tides; in others, it could lead to constant inundation, with water covering streets and coastal land for months at a time. The difference depends on a range of factors, including land shifts.
    


            The world can adapt to slow sea level rise, Notz said: “We might have to relocate cities; you might have to move people around,” but there are ways to build and prepare.
    


            This is already happening. “Entire villages in Fiji have been formally relocated,” said Fijian activist George Nacewa, from climate group 350.org, “the incoming tides are flooding our roads and inundating our crops.”
    


            However, if the pace accelerates rapidly, “it will be very, very difficult to adapt to, because things unfold too quickly,” he said. As ever, it will be the most vulnerable who feel the biggest impacts, he added.
    


            Many parts of the world aren't well prepared. Sea level rise is an “underappreciated” problem as “it's hard to grasp the implications” of even a few inches of rise, the University of East Anglia's Nicholls said.
    


            Humans still have control over how fast sea level rises over the next decades and centuries by cutting emissions, Notz noted.
    


            Global levels of planet-heating pollution, however, continue to tick up and the Trump administration is racing to undo climate policies, including slashing Earth science research at NASA, sweeping staff cuts at NOAA and withdrawing the US from global climate action.
    


            “One of the big concerns with the current US administration is that they won't renew satellites,” Nicholls said. This would take eyes off the oceans at a crucial time.
    


            What the world chooses to do is an ethical issue, said Notz.
    


            “The kind of sea level rise that we have to deal with is so much smaller compared to what future generations have to face,” he said; the real catastrophe will come further down the road when those who have caused the problem are no longer around.

McKEESPORT, Pennsylvania — Take the left off of Nessley Avenue after climbing the switchback up from this city's once-thriving downtown business district. For the next three blocks, you'll find yourself on the brick-paved portion of Jefferson Street.

Despite the impact weather has had on the bricks, giving them a wavy appearance, it adds a unique charm and character to the street, which is lined almost exclusively with tidy midcentury red brick homes. That is with the exception of one stone home on the slope side of the street with an architectural style that sets it apart from the rest.

Built in 1940, it was the home of Michael and Maryann LaCivita. For the first 12 years of Chris LaCivita's life, this neighborhood was his everything. It was where he and his four brothers were born. It was the neighborhood where he would go to school and church, deliver the newspaper, play football with the other children, and build a snow-shoveling business with his brothers.

This is the place that formed Chris LaCivita, who, along with Susie Wiles, led President Donald Trump‘s winning campaign last year.

It took a while for LaCivita to realize how this background and rootedness guided him throughout his political career. Sitting at the head of the table of honor at the Wyndham Hotel in downtown Pittsburgh with his mother beside him, LaCivita was humbled by the attention from local Republicans as he received an award from Sen. David McCormick (R-PA) at the Allegheny County GOP's annual Lincoln Day Dinner.

He was a little out of sorts about a profile being written about him. “I just want to go on the record to say I hate profiles,” he said.

LaCivita is the second oldest of five boys. His father was a public relations executive with Equitable Gas, and his mother was a stay-at-home mom. His parents surrounded the boys with grandparents, aunts, uncles, and cousins, all living within miles of each other.

“Sunday, there was a routine. You would go to Mass, and if it wasn't during Steelers football season, you'd go to Mass and then we would go visit one of my dad's sisters, which there were plenty of them, or at my grandmother's for Sunday supper,” he said.

LaCivita described his grandmother as “this tiny little Italian lady that barely spoke a word of English.” After she died, the family would do Sunday supper at one of his relatives' homes. “And that was quite the thing because my mom and dad were bringing in three boys, then four boys, then five boys. So you can imagine,” he said. “And it was always a big lunch or a big dinner, and that's what we did on Sundays.”

LaCivita said that even at the time, he understood it was a good childhood. “My mom was home,” he said. “My dad was at work in the summer months. We spent all of our time at McKeesport High School playing football or basketball. It's just what we did from sunrise to sunset.”

Every once in a while, they spent the day at Kennywood Park, a local amusement park on a ridge just across the Edgar Thomson Steel Works that was filled with old wooden rollercoasters, bumper cars, and cavernous pavilions.

“When my kids were old enough to appreciate it, the first thing I did was take them, too, and of course, they had more fun at Kennywood than they did at Disney World,” he said. “Oh, my God. And then we'd go to Pirates games. I was an altar boy at St. Pius and an altar boy at St. Mary's German.”

It was the mid-1970s, and the first sign of economic trouble was about to hit McKeesport. The Roman Catholic parish right by LaCivita's home closed at the end of his first year of grade school. It was once a thriving city, significant enough that President John F. Kennedy campaigned there in 1962. The downtown also boasted two large multilevel department stores, a luxury hotel, restaurants, supper clubs, and numerous specialized retail shops.

The world around LaCivita began to change. His father lost his job, several of his aunts and uncles died, and the community was hurting. The mills began to close, forcing people to move. Nearly 18% of the city's residents left, eventually including the LaCivitas. This fracturing of place happened across the Rust Belt for decades.

“First of all, we were moving to Virginia, and the only thing I knew about Virginia was what I saw on the television, and well, that was The Waltons,” LaCivita said. “Oh, and they did not have a football team.”

 LaCivita is constantly moving. This was true back when he was in school, too.

“I was a horrible student. Horrible student,” he admitted with a smile. “I don't know what it was. I just wasn't interested a whole lot. Just wasn't interested. I didn't get in trouble. I just was bored, I guess. I would read like crazy, but I just wasn't particularly interested in schoolwork.”

“I bombed my SATs. I mean, I started working when I was 15,” he added. “I spent my summers cutting people's grass, winters shoveling snow, cleaning people's gutters. I was always looking to make a buck. Always moving. But studying for SATs? No. That wasn't me.”

That's not all. “I delivered newspapers. Cleaned gutters. Cut massive lawns, and that was before high school,” he said. “Then, I got a job during high school working at Kings Dominion until I graduated. I worked rides and that kind of stuff at the amusement park with my older brother. And I worked at a steakhouse, washing dishes. I was also a stock boy at Food Lion, the night shift. I did everything, a little bit of everything.”

LaCivita said he always knew he was conservative, but he was never very political. That all changed as he was staggering through undergraduate studies at Virginia Commonwealth University in the late 1980s. He was disillusioned. He wasn't being challenged. Worse, he felt like he was being told what to think.

Then, a political science professor suggested that the government should be in charge of healthcare, which led to a robust debate. LaCivita eventually pursued a master's in public administration.

“So, at the time, I was somewhat active with politics, quasi-affiliated, but not really with the College Republicans,” he said, adding, “I'd go to their events basically to drink their beer and to meet the girls. It was my Marine buddies and I — that's what we would do. We'd go to CR stuff, not to be CRs, but to hang out and go to all their parties.”

The next thing that changed everything was that his Marine unit got activated for the Persian Gulf War while he was in graduate school.

LaCivita left for the war on New Year's Day 1991, returning five months later with a Purple Heart. He had been shot in the face on his mother's birthday.

LaCivita described the moment as a “pissing match with a bunch of Iraqis” in which his unit took direct fire. The scars on his face where he was hit left him with nerve damage. The Kevlar jacket likely saved his life when he took a hit from shrapnel, leaving him with three cracked ribs instead.

“I really had no idea of what I was going to do, was going to go back to school, and my energy level was like a hundred times more,” LaCivita said of his return home. “I couldn't sleep. I couldn't concentrate. There was a lot of things I couldn't do.”

So, LaCivita found an outlet. His father had a friend who was running for the board of supervisors and needed help with his race: “Dad said, ‘He is going to give you $500 and $50 for expenses.' And I said, ‘OK.'” That candidate was George Allen, who won and went on to run for Congress in a special election.

“Here is the thing: I went from a board of supervisors race straight into a congressional race, and I knew who George Allen was, but I did not know that he was running for Congress. I just thought he was running for reelection,” he said of his upgrade from a local race to the big times.

Allen won that race, too. LaCivita then got his first taste of Washington, D.C., after taking a job in Allen's congressional office. “I spent 14 months in Washington as a legislative assistant,” LaCivita said. “Loved it, thought it was the coolest thing. And then George got redistricted out of his House seat, and he ran for governor.”

LaCivita married his college sweetheart, Catherine, and had two children. He would go on to have his hand in numerous successful and some not-so-successful political races over the next 25 years. He was the political director of the Senate GOP's campaign arm, was the principal media adviser for the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth, and reshaped Republican politics with few people knowing his name. Until the fall of 2022, when Susie Wiles came calling.

Wiles, who did not know LaCivita at the time other than by his take-no-prisoners reputation, was looking for a certain kind of person to work with the Trump team. LaCivita fit that bill. “He's done every blue-collar job that could possibly be. He's worked in a factory. He's been a waiter. He grew up in a family where his dad worked for the government,” she said. “So, he understands that pretty uniquely, too. Just the culture of the bureaucracy and how corrosive it could be. There's not much he hasn't done. He's been a Marine for heaven's sake.”

“When the president decided to run [in the 2024 race], he said to me, ‘Well, you ran Florida, and you won and you've been doing great,'” referring to her overseeing his successful Florida operation in 2016 and 2020.

“'I think you should run the whole thing this time, but you're not a ‘blank' and you need to go find me one,'” Wiles said. “And so I thought, ‘OK, well, I mean, this is sort of a big deal for me,' so I called my best friend in politics, Tony Fabrizio, and told him this is what the president wants.”

Fabrizio didn't miss a beat. “He said, ‘I got the guy, can you come to dinner next Thursday?'” Wiles said. “And by now, I thought I knew everybody at politics in our level, and I knew Chris by name, but I had never met him.”

Wiles and LaCivita had what they now laughingly call work “dates” with Fabrizio in the mix to see if they clicked. “When I decided we did, then I invited him to meet the president. He comes to Mar-a-Lago, goes out and buys a new suit, got his shoes shined, and comes for dinner.”

It wasn't a perfect first meeting. It was just one of those days when Trump was not happy. “And I said to the president, ‘Well, Chris made the Swift Boat ads,'” Wiles said. “And [Trump] said, ‘Everybody says they made the Swift Boat ads. You didn't make the Swift Boat ads. Everybody claims credit for that.'”

Wiles said she approached Trump again a few days later about LaCivita. “I really think he's the guy,” she said. Trump told her, “If that's what you want, it's fine with me. Just do it.”

“Chris walked in the door, thinking he was going to have another dinner, hopefully more pleasant,” Wiles said. “And the president said, ‘Look, she wants you. If she wants you, I want you. Susie, you go negotiate the money thing and welcome him to the team.'”

“That was it,” she added. “And when you think about it, it's such a Donald Trump thing.”

LaCivita was working on Sen. Ron Johnson's (R-WI) reelection bid. He came on board right after that race ended.

LaCivita and Wiles are opposites in many ways, yet their partnership worked. “That's what I know best in politics, particularly at the level we just finished,” Wiles said. “I don't think it's ever happened before where there was really a partnership that worked, and he likes and is good at everything I'm not, and I like and am good at everything he's not.”

Wiles said presidential campaigns are “just so big and so multifaceted that it's hard for me to conceive of one person really doing it all by themselves.”

So, it was just common sense that they became co-campaign managers.

“But it could have gone wrong in many ways. And it did not,” Wiles said. “In fact, we are better friends today than when we started.”

As an observer who saw the two of them dozens of times on the campaign  you could see their genuine respect and affection for each other. It was something you never see in the politics business.

Wiles laughed. “No, you don't. And he doesn't want anybody to know it,” she said. “He has a gentle side. He doesn't want anybody to know that he is a wonderful husband. His wife, Catherine, is fantastic. He's a great dad. He's very proud of his children. And so those kinds of values we both share.”

LaCivita and Wiles spent much of their time together with Trump. But on July 13, Wiles was with Trump as he headed to Butler, Pennsylvania. LaCivita was in Milwaukee, where Trump was heading the next day to commence the Republican National Convention. Then came the assassination attempt that changed everything.

LaCivita was watching the rally in his hotel suite but was distracted by a staffer with a minor crisis. His door was open so staff could go in and out as needed. LaCivita's daughter Victoria, who was working the convention, burst through the door to tell him Trump had been shot.

LaCivita has a reputation for being stoic in emergencies. He quickly assessed the situation — yes, there was blood trickling down the side of Trump's face, but he was standing, so that was a good sign. LaCivita watched the Secret Service agent who had grabbed the ex-president by the collar, and he seemed calm — another good sign.

LaCivita quickly dialed Wiles. “What the hell?”

Wiles, who was getting into the car with Trump as they headed to the hospital, promised to call back.

It took two hours for them to connect. “We ultimately go back to the FBO, and it looks like we're in the middle of a war zone,” Wiles said. “Everybody has their long gun drawn, and people that I know and they know me are looking at me funny. It was a strange environment.”

“He's sobbing, sobbing,” Wiles said of her phone call with LaCivita. “He knew that the president was OK. But he was guilt-ridden that he wasn't there.”

LaCivita said his friendship with Wiles had only strengthened in the six months since the campaign ended.

LaCivita recently visited Wiles, now the White House chief of staff, in the West Wing. He did things he could not imagine while growing up on Jefferson Street. It was a pinch-yourself moment, LaCivita admitted, the culmination of a 35-year career.

“And to be just a small part of that, and then to be able to go to the White House and talk with the president and at the Oval next to the Resolute desk, and then the ride on Air Force One, those are such amazing, rare opportunities for any person,” he said.

LaCivita said Allen once told him while passing the illuminated Capitol dome on their way back from a reception, “If that view ever stops giving you goose bumps, it's time to get out.”

“I've never stopped getting goose bumps,” LaCivita said.

The ballroom at the Wyndham was packed to the rafters, with over 800 people coming to see McCormick honor LaCivita for his accomplishment. Just before LaCivita was called up to accept the honors, Trump's familiar face appeared at the center of the room on a screen, sitting at the Resolute desk.

“Chris, I know firsthand that you are an absolute warrior, an exceptional patriot, one of the greatest fighters in American politics, and I will tell you, you were by my side, and we won the presidency. That's all we can say that has to be said. Other than that, of course, you've learned how to fight from the very best: the United States Marine Corps. You bravely served our nation in uniform, and as of last July, we now have something in common: We have both taken a bullet for our country. But I want to thank you not only for your extraordinary service on our campaign, which was just leadership and brilliance, but to take back the White House. We did something very special. It was decades of political trenches fighting to defend America, and you learned a lot, and you gave me that knowledge. You should be incredibly proud of all you've accomplished. It's an honor to call you a friend, and really was an unbelievable honor to work with you toward our big victory in the presidency. Congratulations. Enjoy yourself and have a great life.”

LaCivita's mother reached over to hold his hand. A wave of emotion washed over his face.

“I would've never expected anything like that. I am a professional,” LaCivita said. “Everyone likes to be thanked. I don't have to be, and the thanks is in accomplishing the mission and being a part of a team of people and the lasting friendships that I have — those are the most important things to me.”

FETTERMAN'S REAL SICKNESS FOR THE LEFT? ISRAEL-ITIS 

“It was that much more touching for my mother to be able to experience it as well because I'm sure there were times in her life where she probably didn't know what I was doing,” he added.

LaCivita acknowledged, “Politics is a very tough, rough, and tumble business, and you don't often get to share these kinds of moments with anyone the older you get. It's harder and harder to find those opportunities to be able to share them with your parents.”

“And if you have your parents, you're lucky,” he added. “I just have my mother now, but I know my dad is extremely proud.”

My home state of Colorado used to shine as a Western American land of promise, where economic vigor and free-spirit vibes lured diverse transplants from around the globe. Migrants from great coastal cities likened it to a real-life version of Ayn Rand's fictional, Colorado-based Galt's Gulch, where industrialists, inventors, entrepreneurs, and artists established themselves to escape a collectivist society that manifests mediocrity and oppression.

Growth in population and wealth was the norm through the late 20th and early 21st centuries. Business leaders and top-ranking executives flocked to Colorado, with the state becoming a permanent home for at least 12 billionaires and 170,223 millionaire households by 2020 — not bad for a state with fewer than 6 million residents. It was an environment in which liberals, conservatives, libertarians, hippies, cowboys, rednecks, hillbillies, artists, tech entrepreneurs, and free-spirited people of all philosophical and political persuasions led safe and stable lifestyles in a cultural and economic cocoon.

Then came 2018, when the far Left won majorities in both chambers of the legislature, and voters elevated Democrats to every statewide office, including Gov. Jared Polis, Secretary of State Jena Griswold, and Attorney General Phil Weiser. By 2021, the Left held both of Colorado's U.S. Senate seats and four of the state's seven House seats (the state gained an eighth district in 2023, first held by a Democrat).

Seven years into this dark blue tsunami, the signs of damage are mounting. At first, Colorado's stumbles looked eerily like those made notorious by California. Nearing the end of the 2025 legislative session, Colorado has outdone what center-right Coloradans call the “Left Coast.” This year's legislative agenda — including a countercultural push to rework the state's Labor Peace Act, tilting the scales toward unions and away from production — hints at more trouble ahead.

For decades, Coloradans have grumbled about “Californication,” the influx of Californians jacking up home prices and hauling in left-leaning politics. It was one part jest, another part gripe, and a nod to the Red Hot Chili Peppers' riff on culture creep. “Colofornia” became a term of consternation among natives and others witnessing the influx. But it's no laughing matter in 2025. The numbers show a genuine shift, and the fallout — economic strain, cultural friction, and a state generally losing its footing — is hitting hard.

Despite a doctrinaire, radicalized legislature, what's the matter with Colorado is far from intractable. Colorado cities and towns consistently rank among the top 10 for livability, as ranked on lists by U.S. News & World Report, WalletHub, and other research organizations.

Colorado has become a draw for the country's booming aerospace industry. Parks, trails, open spaces, ski slopes, and awe-inspiring vistas complement a four-season climate conducive to year-round recreation. A modern proliferation of art venues, museums, and concert arenas gives Coloradans cultural amenities more common in major coastal cities.

What we have here is a governmental leadership crisis of one-party control, with rippling consequences of death, homelessness, addiction, despair, and growing unemployment, disproportionately burdening the most vulnerable among us.

Pre-2018, Colorado reliably flexed economic muscle no matter which party controlled the famously swingy purple state. Studies consistently ranked Colorado in the top five for economic performance, and the state shone as a beacon for go-getters. By 2024, the Centennial State slumped to the bottom 10. It is California's slow bleed redux: Regulations pile up, costs soar, and growth fizzles. Personal income growth, a bragging right at third nationally pre-2018, crashed to 39th by 2024, even with Polis and company supporting some of the country's highest minimum wage mandates, consistently projecting themselves as champions of the state's dwindling working class.

Though wage hikes raise some paychecks, jobs thin out and businesses hesitate to grow or relocate, handing Colorado a growing “income inequality” dilemma like the divide between California's Silicon Valley/Hollywood crowd and ordinary households.

Housing is referred to as a “crisis” by the legacy media. Median prices hit $541,352 in February, based on Zillow sales and listing data, landing Colorado among the five least affordable states. Apartments.com shows apartments in Denver going for 32% more than the national average.

Inflation across goods and services has risen 15.4% since 2021, outpacing the rest of the country. Colorado's new and troubling status as the sixth-most-regulated state raises a growing concern: Will top employers continue doing business in what free-market, supply-side defenders view as a freakishly controlling regulatory environment, much less choose Colorado as a good place to start, grow, or relocate a business?

The regulatory excess goes beyond wage mandates, expensive requirements to save the planet by forcing the abandonment of natural gas heating, and countless other regulations that are hostile to businesses. In April, the legislature and Polis banned the sale of most common handguns, rifles, and shotguns except for those with enough free time and money to buy themselves past required training courses and licensure fees.

If that's not enough to discourage doing business in Colorado, the legislature crafted a bill that penalizes parents, with consequences that include losing custody, if they use a child's given name instead of one the child prefers. That proposed law alone has families planning to move and much of the country rolling its eyes.

The workforce is taking hits. Oil and gas, a godsend for smart workers without college degrees, dropped 25% in active rigs by 2023, based on industry tallies. Compliance costs from post-2018 rules — $590 million a year, as found by the Common Sense Institute — push layoffs and send firms packing.

The proposed 2025 Labor Peace Act overhaul, making it easier to require “closed shops” in Colorado, could jack up costs for employers running on fumes. The bill now on the table at the legislature to scrap the act would make Colorado join the ranks of the minority of states where one simple majority vote is all that's needed to force all employees in a workplace to fork over union dues, like it or not. The net effect, worried Colorado development recruiters point out, would be to scare off a lot of employers looking to locate in Colorado or expand their operations here. California, under a union chokehold, is the poster child; employers have been fleeing its closed shops for “right to work” states where unions cannot make nonmembers pay fees or dues. Colorado's 3.8% unemployment in late 2024 looked rosy. Expect it to rise if this bill becomes law.

Colorado's energy production provides a case study in control creep. Senate Bill 19-181, signed in 2019, flipped the Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation Commission from industry booster to eco-enforcer. Industry seats shrank from three to one, swapped for environmentalists. Local governments gained free rein to tighten drilling regulations that the state had long prohibited to protect property rights and the country's energy supply.

The oil and gas permitting process has become an engineered slog. Permits that took an average of 319 days in 2021 ballooned to 647 days by 2023. A per-barrel fee imposed in 2024 siphons cash for transit and wildlife. Colorado, the country's fourth-largest energy producer, harvests less than it did in 2019, costing the state high-wage jobs and tax revenues essential to funding schools and infrastructure.

In March, Colorado had the second-highest unemployment rate, 4.8%, falling far below Mississippi, West Virginia, and other states that traditionally struggle economically. That compares with 2017, when Colorado tied for the country's second-lowest unemployment rate at 2.7% before the left-wing, uni-party tsunami.

In 2017, Colorado's job-growth rate was the envy of the country at 2.4%, compared with the national rate of 1.5%. The state's most recent job-growth rate has fallen to 0.17%, compared to the national rate of 1.2%, landing Colorado 43rd in the country for job growth between March 2023 and March 2024, with neighboring Utah and Wyoming in the top 10 for job growth.

As with oil and gas producers, commercial real estate owners also feel the squeeze of excessive regulation. House Bill 1286 (2021) mandates that buildings over 50,000 square feet track energy and cut emissions by 7% by 2026 and 20% by 2030. Owners pay for retrofits, and the electrification mandates ban gas furnaces in buildings erected since 2024, with electric swaps due by 2027.

A 2024 rule tacks on gender-neutral restrooms and baby-diaper changing stations by 2026, raising construction costs even more. Polis pitches sustainability and fairness, but for business leaders, it is the importation of California-style regulatory excess they can choose to reject by moving operations next door to Utah or to any of the other less-regulated states surrounding Colorado.

Since 2019, Polis has backed policies such as House Bill 19-1124, tying the hands of state and local law enforcement when asked to cooperate with federal holds requested by Immigration and Customs Enforcement. By 2025, more than 40,000 unvetted immigrants had poured in, landing in a state with 5.8 million permanent residents. Most have no jobs, cash, or prospects for employment and long-term housing.

The economy creaks under the weight of what Denver Mayor Mike Johnston gleefully calls “new arrivals.” It is a view from the perch of an Ivy League politician who grew up in Vail, where the median home price hovers around $2 million. Before the immigrant invasion, housing was a pipe dream for the young, and now these taxpayers shell out big to care for immigrants. Denver dropped $36 million on shelters in 2023, based on city budget data. Culturally, it's a jolt, as schools strain under language gaps, and neighborhoods grapple with a new population of homeless people on top of scarcities in healthcare, social services, and housing that were problematic before the immigrant surge dramatically increased demand.

Illegal immigrant prison gangs, most notably the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua, have notoriously spread from Denver. They have taken over apartment complexes in Aurora, and several of their victims told a member of the Colorado Springs Gazette's editorial board that the problem is far worse and more widespread than the public has been told.

Similarly, California's open-door experiment tanked affordability and stretched resources. For a state with seven times fewer residents than the Golden State, 40,000-plus “new arrivals” are a wave too high for the public to surf. Polis might call it compassion, but it amounts to a bill the average Joe and Jane Six Pack can't afford.

Crime, especially violent crime, was for Coloradans a problem mostly found in distant coastal and Midwestern cities throughout the 1990s and early 2000s. People lived here to avoid crime.

Then, the left-wing cabal decriminalized every illicit drug, on the heels of voters enacting full legalization of marijuana, and indulged a “criminal justice reform” agenda that eased penalties for nearly every crime. The ideology said criminals need reform, but the result has been criminals flocking to Colorado, including Tren de Aragua gangsters, who made Colorado their North American headquarters.

The Common Sense Institute pegged Colorado's 2022 monthly crime rate at 530 offenses per 100,000 residents, up 7.3% from 2019 and 20% from 2008. Car thefts jumped 13.6% that year, hitting 40,000-plus and topping the nation. Violent crime is at 423 per 100,000 since 2018, above average, with homicides and assaults creeping up. Walking the streets of Denver alone at night — where one risks life and limb in Washington Park, on Capitol Hill, or in other traditionally safe neighborhoods — makes little more sense than walking the streets of south-central Los Angeles.

The Left's soft-on-crime policies culminated in national notoriety when U.S. News & World Report ranked Colorado the third-most dangerous state in 2024.

Most of Colorado's 1,927 public schools are faltering, California-style. Post-2020, Colorado Measures of Academic Success found math proficiency at 27.4% of the student population, down from 32.7%, and literacy at 43%, down from 44.5%.

The scores reveal a dilemma nearly identical to California's 2022 slump to 33% proficiency in math and 47% in English. Gaps for minorities, low-income children, and special education students widened after 2018 gains faded. More funding is the cry, but experience proves it doesn't buy results.

The state slid from the top 10 for legal in-migration for three decades to the bottom 10 by 2025, perhaps the result of high living costs, crime, and a one-size-fits-all, intolerant political climate incapable of interparty cooperation. Homelessness festers in Colorado's metropolitan areas, linked to housing woes and limp policies. Tents and shanties make Denver streets and parks look similar to those in San Francisco and Los Angeles.

In the wake of hard-drug decriminalization and full-scale cannabis legalization, fentanyl deaths soared 101.3% from 2019 to 2022. Illegal marijuana trafficking persists. A federal forest official years ago told the Colorado Springs Gazette's editorial board of large plantations hiding in some of Colorado's 11 national forests, complete with makeshift buildings and armed guards.

It turns out Latin American cartels prefer producing the drug in a state where illegal products meld right in with their licensed and legal counterparts. So much for the belief that legalizing marijuana would kill the black market.

Colorado's anything-goes drug orgy, with the second-highest teenage fentanyl overdose rate, has fueled a booming drug rehab sector that has elders liquidating retirement funds to pay the costs of saving their children and grandchildren from substance abuse.

The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration reported 413 substance abuse treatment facilities in Colorado in 2020, up from 382 in 2016. By 2022, its national directory listed 448 facilities, suggesting an uptick in corporations feeding on a growing addiction epidemic.

Though numbers tell the rehab story, for the public, it is palpable. Consider the Tri-Lakes region of mountain villages north of Colorado Springs. There, a former Ramada Inn hotel and two luxury mountain resorts have transitioned into rehab centers. The community's former bowling alley and family fun center houses a large cannabis grow operation and recreational marijuana store.

The California-to-Colorado pipeline has been flowing for years, with estimates showing tens of thousands of California transplants annually for the past three decades.

Though diminishing, the California influx brings Left Coast policies and more. Because of Colorado's relatively small population of 5.8 million, the demand created by deep-pocketed Californians contributes to housing prices rising so sharply that retirees struggle with property tax bills that rival old mortgage payments.

Politically, Californication has tilted Denver, Boulder, and Fort Collins leftward while eating away at the consistently conservative tendencies of Colorado Springs — the veritable Orange County of Colorado, mimicking shifting political trajectories in south Los Angeles suburbs and San Diego.

In a state with living costs and crime approaching levels endured in California, bringing up children becomes increasingly challenging for many and a near impossibility for the working class.

Birth rates signal the growing unease. Polis, a married parent of two children, frequently champions what he calls family-friendly legislation and insists the state could use more children. Yet, births in his state fell from 62,949 in 2021 to 61,494 in 2023, based on the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment and March of Dimes data.

Fertility has fallen as low as 50.2 in recent years for every 1,000 women aged 15 to 44, nearly a 25% fall since 2010, and the steepest decline nationwide. Fertility is at 1.48, which falls below the replacement rate. A slate of new laws, including a tweak to the state's Medicaid program, encourages and subsidizes terminations of unborn children. The Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment reports abortions increased from 8,873 in 2017 to 14,691 in 2023 (latest available) — a 65.5% increase.

The 2024 Colorado Political Climate Survey from CU-Boulder shows 33% approving of the state's economy, with a 52% buy-in from Democrats and 16% from Republicans. The gap resembles California's, in which wealthy tech executives and celebrities don't typically know or care about the struggles of those living on or below the state's $96,000 median household income.

Although Colorado's median household income mirrors California's, a recent study found that a household of four needs an income of $108,000 in 2025 just to scrape by. In Denver proper, the median household income is $94,157 — nearly $14,000 short of affording a modest family lifestyle.

Similar factors, throughout Colorado's metropolitan areas, render the state comfortably livable only for those with solid six-figure wages, high net worths, or what frustrated Boulder residents commonly refer to as “trust funders” or “trustafarians” — residents gifted with inherited wealth.

When my wife and I moved to her native Colorado from Washington, D.C., in 1993, the state was indisputably America's playground — a magnet for workers, young professionals starting families, and free spirits of all sociopolitical and cultural backgrounds. Today, not so much.

THE CALIFORNIACATION OF COLORADO 

Colorado's new economic strains, high crime rates, and the sanctuary misstep have tested its historic grit. High costs, red tape, and policy pivots since 2018 echo California's stumbles, hitting a smaller state harder and faster. Workers and families feel it as homes slip away, jobs dwindle, and sidewalks and other public spaces head toward blight.

Polis, a well-intentioned optimist, anticipates a brighter tomorrow. Yet, data portend a future that could make California look stable and equitable by comparison. Colorado is far from hopeless — the climate, awe-inspiring terrain, and entertainment amenities will outlive trends, and even humanity's existence — but the culture and economy tell a cautionary tale of a far-left, central planning agenda gone mad. As the Chili Peppers tell it, “Born and raised by those who praise control of population — it's Californication.”

A surprise victory by Pakistani Chinese-made jet fighters in an air battle with Western-made Indian aircraft has triggered alarm in the global defense industry.

The opening of hostilities on Wednesday morning between India and Pakistan saw one of the largest air battles in modern history, with Pakistan emerging the victor. U.S. officials told Reuters that Chinese-made Pakistani J-10 aircraft shot down French-made Indian Rafale jets with Chinese PL-15 air-to-air missiles. The incident is the first time a Rafale has been shot down and the first time a J-10 has downed another aircraft.

Though the J-10 was introduced in 2004, China's lack of direct foreign engagements means it has never seen a combat deployment prior to Wednesday. The fact that its first combat deployment witnessed its triumph over its western equivalent is likely to serve as a major boost to the Chinese defense industry.

The J-10 and Rafale are considered Generation 4.5 fighters, equivalent to the U.S. F-16 and F/A-18.

Islamabad was quick to boast of its victory.

“Not Just Defence — It's Dominance in the Skies! Pakistan Shatters the Rafale's Streak of Invincibility with Unmatched Precision and Readiness, Becoming the First Ever Force to Shoot Down Rafale Jet Since Its Combat Debut in 2001. A Historic Blow to the Indian Air Force,” the Government of Pakistan X account said.

The shock of the victory over the Chinese hardware over its western counterpart was quickly reflected in the stock market, with the Eurasian Times reporting that stocks for the J-10C producer, Avic Chengdu Aircraft Co. Ltd., shot up by 36% in two sessions, while the stock of the Rafale producer, Dassault Aviation, fell 1.64-5%.

“Air warfare communities in China, the U.S. and a number of European countries will be extremely interested to try and get as much ground truth as they can on tactics, techniques, procedures, what kit was used, what worked and what didn't,” Douglas Barrie, senior fellow for military aerospace at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, told Reuters.

Of equal focus to the jets were the missiles they were carrying. Analysts speculate that each side used its most advanced missiles, with the Pakistanis using the Chinese PL-15 air-to-air missile and the Indians using the European Meteor air-to-air missile. The PL-15 appears to have emerged at the top of the engagement, downing at least three fighters, compared to no Pakistani fighters downed.

Pakistan's Foreign Minister claimed that its fighters only targeted Indian jets that fired first, limiting the number of Indian aircraft downed.

“This is why only five jets were taken down. Had the directive been different, nearly 10-12 jets would have been struck,” he alleged.

The engagement is a wake-up call for the Western defense industry, which has long been unsure about the viability of Chinese weapons.

“You have arguably China's most capable weapon against the West's most capable weapon, if indeed it was being carried; we don't know that,” Barrie said.

A Western industry expert told the outlet that the engagement showed the capabilities of the PL-15 “may be greater than was thought.”

“The PL-15 is a big problem. It is something that the U.S. military pays a lot of attention to,” a defense industry executive added to Reuters.

Debris showcased by Indian officials and shared on social media appears to confirm that at least one of the shoot-downs was done by a PL-15. Another intact PL-15 was recovered and showed off by Indian authorities.

Scant confirmed details remain regarding the Wednesday engagement, but one senior Pakistani security source told CNN that the dogfight was the “largest and longest in recent aviation history,” involving roughly 125 aircraft over an hour period. Opposing aircraft fired missiles at targets sometimes over 100 miles away.

Part of the reason for the long distance was the unwillingness of either aircraft to cross over the border, with a smaller dogfight between the powers in 2019 causing the downing of one Indian Air Force pilot in Pakistan, who was then paraded on TV. The source said that both sides were afraid of a similar humiliation.

The engagement was the first since India and Pakistan upgraded their air fleets; the last flare-up in hostilities in February 2019 featured engagements between older Pakistani F-16s and JF-17s and older Indian Mirage 2000s and MiG-21s. Though Pakistan has also modernized its F-16s since, the aircraft didn't take part in Wednesday's engagement.

The victory of the J-10 is likely to boost China's defense industry across the globe. The Eurasian Times reported that Uzbekistan is currently deciding between purchasing the J-10 and Rafale to modernize its air force. Egypt is allegedly interested in the J-10 as well.

Chinese social media users mocked the Indians over their loss, with one group posting a video to social media showing people dressed up as Indians bemoaning their loss of the aircraft.

So now Chinese are mocking India for losing Rafale fighter jets. This video is going viral on Chinese TikTok. 😀 pic.twitter.com/m7q27JAP5U

VANCE URGES NONINTERVENTION WITH INDIA AND PAKISTAN AS CONFLICT ESCALATES WITH MASS DRONE ATTACKS

Wars between allied countries are often used as a testing ground for opposing defense industries. During the Cold War, the U.S. and Soviet defense industries used Israel and its Arab opponents as testing grounds to view their weapons' performance before a hypothetical hot conflict.

The same pattern appears to be repeated in India-Pakistan, with the United States and China eager to view how Chinese weapons would perform in a possible war over Taiwan.

Newark Mayor Ras Baraka was arrested Friday for allegedly trespassing inside a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention center in his city, New Jersey's interim top prosecutor said.

Baraka "committed trespass and ignored multiple warnings" from Department of Homeland Security officials who told him to leave the facility, alleged Alina Habba, the interim U.S. attorney for the District of New Jersey.

"He has willingly chosen to disregard the law. That will not stand in this state. He has been taken into custody," Habba, a former defense attorney for President Donald Trump, wrote on X.

"NO ONE IS ABOVE THE LAW," she added.

Baraka, 55, is a Democrat running for governor of New Jersey. Kabir Moss, a spokesman for Baraka's gubernatorial campaign, confirmed the arrest at the facility known as Delaney Hall, NBC News reported.

At least three U.S. House Democrats from New Jersey were also at the detention center on Friday, according to an X post from Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman.

Baraka's office and campaign did not immediately respond to CNBC's requests for comment.

Videos posted on X by News12NJ reporter Amanda Lee show a physical altercation between law enforcement officers and apparent protesters by a security gate at the facility.

Another video posted by Lee appears to show Baraka being led away with his hands cuffed behind his back.

A spokesperson for Watson Coleman told NBC that the three U.S. representatives "were escorted in" to Delaney Hall "after a period of explaining the law to the officials at the site."

The members of Congress said they were there to conduct oversight on the facility in light of reporting about other ICE centers, which have become political flashpoints amid Trump's aggressive deportation efforts.  

But Homeland Security spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin in a statement to NBC called the incident "a bizarre political stunt" by a group of protesters that included the elected officials.

The group "stormed the gate and broke into the detention facility" as a busload of detainees entered a security gate, McLaughlin said.

The protesters "holed up in a guard shack, the first security check point," she said.

"Had these members requested a tour, we would have facilitated a tour of the facility. This is an evolving situation," she added.

Baraka's administration filed a lawsuit in late March to block the opening of the Newark immigrant detention facility, arguing that its operators failed to obtain the proper permits and violated city code.

White House deputy chief of staff for policy Stephen Miller said Friday that the Trump administration is "actively looking at" suspending the writ of habeas corpus, which is the right to challenge the legality of a person's detention by the government.

Miller's comment came in response to a White House reporter who asked about President Donald Trump entertaining the idea of suspending the writ of habeas corpus to deal with the problem of illegal immigration into the United States. 

Asked when that might happen, Miller responded: "The Constitution is clear, and that, of course, is the supreme law of the land, that the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus can be suspended in time of invasion."

"So, I would say that's an option we're actively looking at," he said.

Miller said that Trump's decision on whether to suspend the writ of habeas corpus "depends on whether the courts do the right thing or not."

Miller implied that "the right thing" is for judges to stop blocking the administration's deportation of undocumented immigrants in cases where those people are exercising habeas writs.

The idea of habeas corpus was codified in the Magna Carta, signed by King John of England, in the early 13th Century.

"No man shall be arrested or imprisoned...except by the lawful judgment of his peers and by the law of the land," the provision said.

Miller's use of the word "invasion" reflects the Trump administration's argument that the U.S. faces an "invasion" of undocumented migrants. 

The administration likewise has claimed that there is a national emergency from the influx of the deadly opioid fentanyl into the U.S. that justifies the imposition of high tariffs on China, Canada and Mexico without prior authorization by Congress.

A number of pending civil cases challenging the Trump administration's deportation of undocumented immigrants in the United States are based on habeas claims.

In one such case, a Georgetown University scholar, Dr. Badar Khan, is challenging the constitutionality of his arrest and detention.

The Trump administration has chafed at orders by judges blocking efforts to summarily deport immigrants, including alleged gang members.

Miller said that Congress had stripped federal courts of jurisdiction over immigration cases with the Immigration and Nationality Act.

"The courts aren't just at war with the executive branch, the courts are at war, these radical rogue judges, with the legislative branch as well," Miller said.

"So all of that will inform the choices the president ultimately makes."

A Whoop wristband in 2017. 

Whoop Inc., the maker of popular screen-less fitness bands, is facing a backlash from subscribers upset that it's charging an upgrade fee for the new models after previously pledging not to do so.

The company on Thursday unveiled two new fitness bands, the Whoop 5.0 and MG, which add improved sleep tracking and new features like blood pressure monitoring in the higher-end model. The company's business model charges users an annual subscription — ranging from $199 to $359 a year — versus an upfront payment for the hardware.

The U.S. Postal Service Board of Governors said Friday that it had selected former Waste Management CEO David Steiner as postmaster general.

Steiner, who is a board member of shipping giant FedEx, will succeed former Postmaster General Louis DeJoy, who resigned in March, and current acting Postmaster General Doug Tulino.

Steiner, who is expected to formally join the USPS in July, will leave the board of FedEx, where he has served some 2009.

USPS reported a net loss of $9.5 billion in 2024

In a statement, Steiner said, "It is an incredible honor to be asked to lead the world's greatest postal organization, with a history that stretches back before the founding of the United States."

"I deeply admire the public service and business mission of this amazing institution, and I believe strongly in maintaining its role as an independent establishment of the executive branch.

Steiner served as CEO of Waste Management from 2004 through late 2016.

USPS said that when he led Waste Management, Steiner was "credited with leading tremendous change in the organization, transforming operations and culture, and delivering strong financial results."

USPS Board of Governors Chair Amber McReynolds, in a statement, said, "Dave is the right person to lead the Postal Service at this time to ensure this magnificent and historic organization thrives into the future," said 

"Dave is a highly regarded leader and executive with tremendous vision, experience and skill that can be 

FexEx founder and executive chairman Frederick Smith praised Steiner, and said in a statement that his "sharp business acumen will be key to addressing the significant challenges facing the United States Postal Service which has lost more than $108 billion since 2007 despite receiving billions in taxpayer relief."

The problems keep piling up at Newark Liberty International Airport.

The Federal Aviation Administration said that an air traffic control equipment outage at the Philadelphia approach control facility, which guides aircraft in and out of Newark, occurred around 3:55 a.m. on Friday morning.

The agency said it affected communications and radar displays for "approximately 90 seconds."

It's the facility's second outage since April 28, when screens went dark for 60 to 90 seconds and prevented controllers from talking to aircraft.

Operational issues, coupled with bad weather and runway construction, have caused hundreds of delays and cancellations at the airport over nearly two weeks.

United CEO Scott Kirby has called on the government to designate Newark as a "level 3" airport, meaning it would run on a slot system that limits the number of planes that could take off and land at certain times to manage capacity.

In July, some controllers were moved from an approach control facility in New York to one in Philadelphia to address understaffing issues, but the facility is still facing shortages.

Kirby said in a letter to customers in May that the Philadelphia center has been "chronically understaffed for years" and that Newark "cannot handle the number of planes that are scheduled to operate there in the weeks and months ahead."

The airline, which holds the largest market share at Newark, has since axed 35 daily flights, or about 10% of its schedule at the airport, to deal with overcapacity and compounding air traffic problems.

The airport is also grappling with the closure of its main runway, which won't be operational until at least mid-June.

An FAA advisory said that as of 12 p.m. ET on Friday, Newark is facing arrival and departure delays of up to four hours because of overcapacity, runway construction, and bad weather.

United does not fly out of New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport, which has not been affected by the Philadelphia control problems, meaning rivals Delta and American have not experienced the same disruptions to flights and customers.

Recent air traffic control issues have highlighted the US's ongoing battle to update aging equipment and hire more controllers at facilities around the country.

The FAA said in May 2024 that it was short about 3,000 controllers but was meeting its hiring goals to catch up.

Still, the entire infrastructure needs work, an issue made clear by the recent problems in Newark and the January midair collision over Washington, DC. A preliminary investigation found that the DC airport tower was understaffed at the time of the crash.

The Trump administration announced a "supercharge" program in February to accelerate hiring. This program includes offering bonuses to new hires, reducing the hiring process by months, and creating new opportunities for veteran controllers.

In March, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy announced a plan to upgrade the national airspace system with modernized technology and infrastructure.

At long last, ESPN has chosen a name for its upcoming all-access streaming service.

Ready?

It's "ESPN."

Disney's sports media division will announce the new — and also sort of old — name for the all-access streaming application at a media event next week, according to people familiar with the matter who declined to be named speaking about not-yet-public details. A Disney spokesperson declined to comment.

Disney executives have referred to the streaming product, which is expected to cost $25 or $30 a month, as "flagship" internally for the past two years as they have developed the service. It will consist of everything ESPN has to offer, including all games; programming on other ESPN cable networks such as ESPN2 and the SEC Network; ESPN on ABC; fantasy products; new betting tie-ins; studio programming; documentaries and more.

This will differ from ESPN's current streaming product ESPN+, which does not include the most-watched live games, such as Monday Night Football, that currently only air exclusively on traditional pay-TV. ESPN+ costs $11.99 per month and can be bundled with Disney+ and Hulu for $16.99 per month with commercials. ESPN+ will remain a less expensive offering for consumers, according to people familiar with the matter.

ESPN Chairman Jimmy Pitaro decided to name the application ESPN to simplify what has become a cluttered streaming world, filled with different media products that can be bundled with other services at different price points, according to those people. The CNBC Sport newsletter first reported in February that ESPN executives were considering naming the application ESPN among other options.

The new ESPN streaming service is a new distribution mechanism, but most of the content is not new. Rather, the launch is about introducing consumers to a different way customers can access ESPN's programming. That led executives to gravitate toward carrying over the legacy name, said the people.

The ESPN mobile application will be reimagined and act as the gateway to the all-access service on smart TVs and devices. Pay-TV subscribers who already get ESPN will automatically be able to authenticate into the new app to get the digital bells and whistles that are not available through cable TV. That overlap also played into executives' decision to maintain uniformity with the name ESPN, rather than a different name that may increase confusion, the people said.

ESPN will next week announce the pricing of the application, as well as associated bundled discounts, Disney CEO Bob Iger said Wednesday during Disney's quarterly earnings conference call.

ESPN has previously said the service will debut in the fall.

Air traffic controllers who guide planes in and out of Newark Liberty International Airport lost radar and communication with aircraft before dawn on Friday in another 90-second outage, the Federal Aviation Administration said, hours after the Trump administration unveiled a plan to overhaul the aging technology that keeps U.S. airspace space safe.

The outage occurred at about 3:55 a.m. ET, the FAA said. There are far fewer aircraft flying overnight, so disruptions were minimal compared with a similar outage on the afternoon of April 28, which snarled air travel for days.

Several controllers took leave because of the stress of that April incident, the FAA said. That exacerbated low staffing levels at the Philadelphia facility, where controllers oversee planes at Newark, New Jersey, airport, forcing the FAA to slow the airport's traffic.

Like in the April incident, Friday's outage left controllers unable to communicate with aircraft and their radar screens dark.

On Thursday, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy unveiled plans to overhaul several aging facilities and modernize technology used by controllers, who oversee about 45,000 flights a day in the U.S.

Aviation-industry groups and labor unions applauded the proposal and said Thursday that Congress should approve at least $31 billion over the next three years for improvements. That includes $12.5 billion outlined in a House spending proposal last month, for air traffic control modernization and more hiring of controllers.

Sam Altman's friendship goals for his infant son do not include AI.

The OpenAI CEO was asked Thursday while giving Senate testimony whether he'd want his child to form a best-friend bond with an AI bot.

"I do not," Altman replied.

The question, from Sen. Bernie Moreno, came during a broader discussion about how to shield children from harm in the AI era as people trust chatbots with more personal information.

"These AI systems will get to know you over the course of your life so well — that presents a new challenge and level of importance for how we think about privacy in the world of AI," said Altman, who became a father in February.

Altman said that people were already forming deeply personal relationships with artificial intelligence and essentially relying on it for emotional support.

"It's a newer thing in recent months, and I don't think it's all bad," he said. "But I think we have to understand it and watch it very carefully."

Altman said there should be greater flexibility for adults using AI tools, while children should have "a much higher level of protection."

But, as with other online services, it can be difficult to know a user's age.

"If we could draw a line, and if we knew for sure when a user was a child or an adult, we would allow adults to be much more permissive and we'd have tighter rules for children," Altman added.

He has previously spoken about what it means to raise a child in the AI era.

"My kid is never going to grow up being smarter than AI," he said during a January episode of the "Re:Thinking" podcast with Adam Grant. "Children in the future will only know a world with AI in it."

Last month, Altman said OpenAI was no longer his proudest achievement after his son, who was born prematurely, learned to eat on his own.

On Thursday, Altman said his son was "doing well," adding that it's "the most amazing thing ever."

DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — U.S. President Donald Trump will touch down in the Persian Gulf region – or as he may soon be calling it, the Arabian Gulf – on May 13, for an official trip with stops in Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates. 

The stakes are high, as the visits take place amid turbulent geopolitical tensions. On the agenda will be Israel-Gaza war ceasefire talks, oil, trade, investment deals, and the potential for new policy developments in the areas of advanced semiconductor exports and nuclear programs.

"We expect to see a lot of announcements. And I think in a broad spectrum of areas as well," Monica Malik, chief economist at Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank, told CNBC's Dan Murphy on Friday. She noted the potential removal of Trump's 10% tariffs on aluminum and steel, which would be a positive for the Gulf states as some of them export those metals to the U.S., though they make up only a small percentage of the countries' GDPs. 

Trump has long enjoyed a warm relationship with Gulf Arab states, in particular the UAE and Saudi Arabia, where his children have several business ventures and planned real estate projects. Those relationships could strengthen the countries' hands when it comes to negotiating new trade deals – while also raising concerns among critics over potential conflicts of interest, accusations the Trump family rejects. 

During the president's initial term in office, his first overseas trip was to Saudi Arabia – a country now hosting the negotiations that Trump hopes will end the Russia-Ukraine war, making the kingdom ever more important to Washington. Qatar, meanwhile, has played a central role in negotiations between Israel and Hamas over ceasefires and hostage releases.  

The presidential visit is drawing several Wall Street and Silicon Valley titans to the Saudi kingdom. A Saudi-U.S. investment forum announced just this week and set to take place on May 13 in Riyadh will feature guests including BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, Palantir CEO Alex Karp, and CEOs of major firms like Citigroup, IBM, Qualcomm, Alphabet, and Franklin Templeton, among others. White House AI and crypto czar David Sacks will also be in attendance. 

"We also expect to see a lot of investment deals being announced," Malik said. "And both ways, we've already seen the UAE announce a number of investments in the U.S. in areas such as AI, energy, aluminum, but we also think that there will be opportunities for U.S. companies to increase investment."

Both Saudi Arabia and the UAE have invested heavily in AI infrastructure with the goal of becoming global hubs for the technology. Therefore, likely top of mind for those leaders is the future of U.S. semiconductor exports, the most advanced of which they so far have not gained access to due to national security concerns. But that may soon be changing.

The Trump administration on Wednesday announced its plan to rescind a Biden era "AI diffusion rule," which imposed strict export controls on advanced AI chips, even to U.S.-friendly nations. The rule will be replaced with "a much simpler rule that unleashes American innovation and ensures American AI dominance," a U.S. Commerce Department spokesperson said Wednesday, though the details of the new rule have not yet been shared. 

UAE-based AI firm G42 has made efforts to align with U.S. regulations, including divesting from Chinese companies and partnering with Microsoft, which last year invested $1.5 billion in G42.

The Trump administration has been actively engaged in talks with Iran over its nuclear program – talks that the UAE and Saudi Arabia have expressed support for. That enthusiasm marks a stark contrast to those countries' attitudes toward any U.S. deals with Tehran during the Obama years. 

At the same time, Saudi Arabia wants its own civilian nuclear program and has asked the U.S. for approvals and assistance in this direction. Any U.S. support for a Saudi nuclear program was previously contingent on Saudi Arabia normalizing diplomatic relations with U.S. ally Israel – but that could change during this visit, according to media reports citing sources with knowledge of the matter. 

U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright, during a visit to the kingdom in April, said that Saudi Arabia and the U.S. were on a "pathway" to a civil nuclear agreement – but that any further announcements would come from Trump himself. 

Another major topic will be the future of Gaza. Trump has vowed to bring about an end to the war, while also controversially suggesting that the U.S. could take control of the war-ravaged Strip which he described as "important real estate," comments that drew strong rebukes from Arab leaders. 

The U.S. has continued to push for ceasefire deals, most recently floating a 21-day cessation of hostilities and release of some hostages, while Israel this week approved expanding fighting and territorial control in Gaza. 

"We have yet to hear a comprehensive plan from the Arab world," Greg Branch, founder of UAE-based Branch Global Capital Advisors, told CNBC on Friday while discussing Trump's upcoming visit. 

"If we're going to see a response that's going to be Arab-led, it's probably now or never," Branch said. "I think that will be handled very delicately behind the scenes … probably more of a long-term geopolitical risk than any immediate macro risk."

Branch suggested that lifting U.S. sanctions on Syria under its new government could also potentially be discussed. Meanwhile, reports that the Trump administration will announce a U.S. renaming of the Persian Gulf to the Arabian Gulf would be enthusiastically welcomed by Arab states, but could draw severe anger from Iran at a time of delicate nuclear negotiations with Tehran. 

Oil prices will also be in focus; Trump has long pushed OPEC states, led by Saudi Arabia, to pump more oil to lower prices for American consumers. For a combination of reasons, Saudi Arabia is doing precisely that – but it may have to change course in the coming months if prices stay subdued, hurting the kingdom's revenues. 

In that vein, financing will be an important agenda item for the kingdom during Trump's visit, according to ADCB's Malik. 

Saudi Arabia in November pledged to invest $600 billion in the U.S. over the course of Trump's term — but it also has sky-high costs for its own Vision 2030 investment ambitions. Lower global oil prices and big-ticket public spending projects have brought about widening budget deficits for Riyadh.  

"With oil prices where they are, Saudi will look at more financing support from America as well as they look to progress with their investment program," Malik said.

President Donald Trump on Friday tepidly backed the idea of raising taxes on the richest Americans, while openly wrestling with the politics of such a move and suggesting that his fellow Republicans should "probably" oppose it.

Trump's public deliberation on social media came after he reached out to House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., about adding a tax hike on the highest earners to the major tax and spending bill that the GOP aims to pass this year.

It's the latest signal that Trump — whose agenda leans heavily on what he calls the "one, big, beautiful bill" passing through a divided Congress — is willing to buck the traditional Republican orthodoxy on taxing the rich.

Trump in the Truth Social post Friday morning said he "and all others" would "graciously" accept "even a 'TINY' tax increase for the RICH" for the benefit of "lower and middle income workers."

But "the problem" with that idea, he wrote, "is that the Radical Left Democrat Lunatics would go around screaming, 'Read my lips,' the fabled Quote by George Bush the Elder that is said to have cost him the Election."

"The problem with even a "TINY" tax increase for the RICH, which I and all others would graciously accept in order to help the lower and middle income workers, is that the Radical Left Democrat Lunatics would go around screaming,"Read my lips," the fabled Quote by George Bush the Elder that is said to have cost him the Election. NO, Ross Perot cost him the Election! In any event, Republicans should probably not do it, but I'm OK if they do!!!" — Donald Trump, Truth Social post

Trump was referring to then-candidate George H.W. Bush's 1988 campaign promise that he would not raise taxes as president. Bush's eventual failure to keep that promise created a major target for his political opponents and was seen as a factor in his loss in the 1992 election.

Trump's post disputed that history. "NO, Ross Perot cost him the Election!" he wrote.

"In any event, Republicans should probably not do it," Trump added.

But then, apparently reversing himself, he wrote, "I'm OK if they do!!!"

The post could put even more pressure on GOP leaders who are already struggling to craft a bill that meets Trump's demands for a slew of major tax cuts, without adding so much to the deficit that the party's fiscal hawks won't vote for it.

Trump promised on the campaign trail and as president that he would eliminate taxes on overtime pay, on service workers' tips and on Social Security for seniors, while extending the corporate tax cuts implemented in 2017 during his first term.

Rep. Jason Smith, R-Mo., chairman of the tax-focused House Ways and Means Committee, is scheduled to meet with Trump on Friday, Politico first reported.

On Thursday, Johnson told Republicans that they will not be able to pay for the $4.5 trillion in tax cuts that they had previously been targeting, according to Politico.

Trump, in a phone call with Johnson on Wednesday, floated the idea of a higher tax bracket for top earners, albeit with a carve-out for small businesses, CNBC reported.

Trump also proposed closing the "carried interest loophole," a feature of the tax code taken advantage of by Wall Street investors, NBC News reported.

Lyft shares climbed 23% Friday after the ride-sharing company upped its share buyback plan and posted better-than-expected gross bookings.

During an interview with CNBC's "Squawk Box," CEO David Risher said that Lyft isn't seeing "anything to worry about" despite widespread concerns of a slowing consumer amid ongoing economic uncertainty.

"Our team is stronger than it's ever been, and the consumer demand is absolutely there," he said.

Gross bookings grew 13% from a year ago to $4.16 billion, slightly beating a $4.15 billion estimate from StreetAccount. The company said the quarter was its 16th straight period of gross bookings growth.

Rides increased 16% to 218.4 million, topping a FactSet estimate of 215.1 million.

Lyft's revenues grew 14% during the first quarter from a year ago to $1.45 billion, but fell short of a $1.47 billion estimate from LSEG. The company reported net income of $2.57 million, or 1 cent per share. That's up from a net loss of $31.54 million, or 8 cents per share, a year ago.

The board also authorized boosting Lyft's share repurchase plan to $750 million from $500 million. The company said it aims to use $500 million over the next year.

Activist investor Engine Capital said Friday it would halt its campaign at Lyft and withdraw its nominations to the company's board of directors, citing the share buyback news.

"Following a series of productive conversations, the Board has taken an important first step by committing to significant share repurchases in the coming quarters," founder and portfolio manager Arnaud Ajdler said in a release.

Shares of ride-sharing competitor Uber declined earlier this week after posting mixed first-quarter results.

Goldman Sachs upgraded shares to a buy from a neutral rating following the report, citing rides and bookings growth and "strong execution in a stable industry backdrop."

Upwards of 12,000 shipping containers that are subject to the 145%-plus tariffs levied by President Trump are on the first flotilla of Chinese freight vessels arriving at the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach.

A total of seven vessels that left China after the announcement of the 145%-plus tariffs are currently at the nation's two busiest ports for container traffic from Asia, according to vessel arrivals tracked and aggregated by MarineTraffic. An additional five freight ships are expected to arrive in the coming days.

Amazon, Home Depot, Ikea, Ralph Lauren and Tractor Supply are among the companies with Chinese goods in these containers, spanning a wide range of consumer items.

In addition to housewares, apparel, and furniture, Amazon imported a wide variety of products on behalf of sellers, including refrigerators, deep fryers, mousepads, bookshelves and living room sofas.

Tractor Supply shipments include portable drum fans, garden tools, and men's work boots.

Lamps and ceiling fans have been processed through customs for Home Depot.

A Tractor Supply spokesperson referred CNBC to its recent earnings call on April 24 when the company pointed to "notable uncertainty" as a result of the tariffs. "Tractor Supply is actively working with its vendor and supply chain partners to navigate the impact of recently announced tariffs, while also monitoring the broader macroeconomic factors impacting its customers," the spokesperson said.

Ikea furniture; Speedo swim goggles and swim caps; Procter & Gamble tissue holders; Samsung printed circuit boards, microwaves and refrigerator parts; Ralph Lauren sweaters, cashmere, and blazers; Dr. Martens Airwair footwear; Samsung microwaves and refrigerator parts; LG washing machines, air conditioners, ranges, refrigerators and dishwashers; Bauer Hockey sporting goods; Lenovo computer parts; auto parts for Valeo North America; and headsets and computer keyboards for Polaris, were all among the Chinese container goods.

For many of the companies, products in categories deemed as essential to replenish are brought in despite concerns about consumer demand and an economic slowdown.

Amazon said in a statement sent by email that it is working with its "broad, varied range of valued selling partners in our store to support them in adapting to the evolving environment while maintaining broad selection and low prices for customers."

Home Depot is in a quiet period ahead of announcing its quarterly results, and referred CNBC to an existing statement citing "a fluid environment."

"We, together with our vendors, are monitoring developments and will work closely to manage with the goal of being our customers' advocate for value," a Home Depot spokesperson said.

Trump suggested on Friday, ahead of key trade talks, that he was willing to lower tariffs on China to 80%, a rate many businesses would likely still consider to be extremely high.

"80% Tariff on China seems right! Up to Scott B," Trump said in a Truth Social post, referring to a planned meeting between Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and counterparts from China in Switzerland this weekend.

Brian Bourke, global chief commercial officer at SEKO Logistics, told CNBC that his clients continue to struggle in understanding how all of the various tariff provisions are stacked, or in some cases cancel each other out.

"This confusion has led them to continually alter and update their scenario planning, freezing any other decisions for the business they would be making," said Bourke. "Many of our clients priced and sold their products or projects prior to the tariff amounts being announced, and with the speed and severity as well as the quantity of new tariff provisions being announced, they are not able to change the pricing on items that have already sold and are arriving in May and June, or beyond."

The number of freight vessels and shipping containers headed to the U.S. from China has plummeted since the tariffs announcement in early April.

Across the Asia-North America West Coast and Asia-North America East Coast trade routes, there was a total of 90 blank sailings across April and May, according to Sea-Intelligence. The Ocean Alliance (a freight consortium including Chinese-owned and operated COSCO and OOCL, Taiwan-based Evergreen, and French-owned CMA) accounted for 48 of those canceled sailings.

Bookings are down anywhere from 30% to 50%, according to logistics providers and ocean carriers.

According to the Global Port Tracker report released on Friday by the National Retail Federation and Hackett Associates, import cargo at the nation's major container ports is expected to see its first year-over-year decline since 2023 as a result of the tariffs.

In addition to decreased vessel sailings as a result of paused manufacturing orders from shippers and fewer containers to fill, ocean carriers are using smaller vessels to move trade. MSC, the largest ocean carrier in the world, along with the Gemini Alliance (comprised of Maersk and Hapag Lloyd), are among the freight companies using smaller vessels between the Asia-North America West Coast routes.

MSC has reduced its container capacity by 28% year-over-year, according to Sea-Intelligence data analyzing the impact of canceled sailings and vessel changes, while Ocean Alliance container capacity is down by 26% year-over-year.

Bourke said once shippers have finished bringing in what they consider essential stocks, they are in various degrees of "wait-and-see" mode with their supply chains, and continuing to cancel orders from China, which has led to widespread fears about product shortages and the potential for empty shelves. "What happens when safety stocks that had been built up disappear?" Bourke said.

The stakes are high for the U.S. and China's icebreaker trade talks this weekend as the outcome could reset the future of economic relations between the world's two largest economies.

U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Trade Representative Jamieson Greer are scheduled to meet with Chinese lead economic representative and Vice Premier He Lifeng in Switzerland on Saturday.

Analysts say a comprehensive deal is unlikely to come out from a single meeting, however, they are hopeful that a partial rollback of the sky-high tariffs will be on the table.

Both sides have been looking for a pathway to de-escalation, as the economic toll of tariffs have become increasingly difficult to ignore.

The U.S. economy contracted 0.3% in the first quarter this year amid mounting concerns that the economy will slip into a recession with higher inflation and unemployment. And while the Chinese economy grew a better-than-expected 5.4% in the first three months this year, major banks have slashed their full-year growth forecasts for the country to just around 4% — below the government's target of around 5%.

Trump still might have more to lose, as the Chinese political system grants the country's leadership a "higher pain threshold" and a "greater degree of control over macro policy support in the short term," said Dan Wang, China director at political risk consultancy firm Eurasia Group.

Vice Premier He's main mission will simply be seeking clarity on what Trump wants and assessing whether the U.S. intends to hurt China's interests, Wang said.

In what appeared to be a confidence boost ahead of the meeting, China released trade data that showed its exports surged 8.1% year on year in April on the back of a jump in shipments to Southeast Asian nations, shrugging off the 21% drop in outbound goods to the U.S.

And on Friday, China's Commerce Ministry launched a "special operation" to combat the smuggling of strategic minerals, including gallium, germanium, antimony, tungsten and medium and heavy rare earths.

Without naming specific entities, the ministry framed the operation as "a crackdown on overseas entities that had colluded with domestic illegal personnel" to bypass the export control rules it had ratcheted up earlier this year.

"It serves as a useful reminder of the leverage China possesses as the negotiations are set to get underway in Geneva," said Stephen Olson, a visiting senior fellow at the Institute of Southeast Asian Studies and a former U.S. trade negotiator.

China is the world's largest producer of several critical minerals crucial to making semiconductors, defense equipment and clean energy. As part of the retaliatory measures against Trump's tariffs announced last month, China has increased export controls of the metals.

"The sharpest arrow that China has in its quiver would be to restrict U.S. access to critical minerals that can't readily be sourced elsewhere," Olson said.

High on Washington's agenda is securing the removal of China's export restrictions on rare earths used to make magnets, Bloomberg reported Friday, citing people familiar with the matter.

Another potential pressure point for Trump is China's vast holdings of U.S. Treasuries, which could pose risks to financial market stability, said Wu Xinbo, director of the Center for American Studies at Fudan University.

Beijing is likely to further trim its nearly $800-billion stockpile of U.S. government debt if it wants to turn up the heat on Trump, said Wu.

Despite market speculation that China might unload its Treasury holdings to hit back at tariffs, a significant sell-off could also backfire. Such a move might strengthen the yuan, undermining China's export competitiveness, and lead to substantial losses on its dollar-denominated assets.

A partial reversal of tariffs is one of the most likely outcomes of the meeting, according to analysts who remain split on the extent of any adjustments and the pace of de-escalation.

Robin Xing, chief China economist at Morgan Stanley, projects that effective U.S. tariff rates on Chinese goods could be lowered from the current 107% to a terminal rate of 45% by year-end.

Similarly, Tianchen Xu, senior economist at Economist Intelligence Unit, expects the U.S. and China to scale back their mutual weighted average tariff rates of around 50% in the near term.

That's still elevated compared to the tariff rates of 10.9% on Chinese goods and 16% that China had imposed on American products before Trump returned to office, according to Xu's estimates.

In recent days, senior U.S. officials have sounded an optimistic tone over the upcoming talks, saying they could ease the trade barriers that Trump raised last month.

"De-escalating, bringing those rates down to where they could, where they should be, I think it's Scott Bessent's goal," Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick told CNBC Friday. "And that's what the president hopes is a good outcome, is a de-escalating world where we go back to each other and then we work on a big deal together."

During a White House press conference on the signing of a trade deal with Britain, Trump said of the Switzerland meeting, "I think we're going to have a good weekend with China."

The U.S. president then said in a post on social media platform Truth Social on Friday, that "80% Tariff on China seems right! Up to Scott B."

Chinese officials, on the other hand, have struck a firmer tone, reiterating the country's demand for the Trump administration to cancel all unilateral tariffs on China.

A spokesperson for the Commerce Ministry said Wednesday that "China will not sacrifice principle to reach [a] deal with U.S.," while repeating that Washington must "rectify its wrongdoing" by removing all unilateral tariffs.

During the upcoming talks, China could still offer some "sweeteners," such as promises to step up its crackdown on fentanyl flows, said Xu, which could lead to a near-term removal of the 20% fentanyl-related tariffs Trump imposed.

Both sides have sought to temper the economic pain from the exorbitant tariffs, exempting the levies on a range of goods, including consumer electronics, semiconductors and auto parts.

China reportedly exempted import duties on select pharmaceuticals, microchips and aircraft engines from the United States. It has also created a "whitelist" of U.S. goods that will be exempted from extra levies, according to Reuters.

However, attempts to achieve a more comprehensive deal, similar to the Phase One deal signed during Trump's first term, will likely be "lengthy and unproductive," said Xu, as both sides have shown little appetite for compromise over respective strategic priorities and economic red lines.

"We severely doubt the possibility of the U.S. and China reaching something close to the Phase One trade agreement reached in 2020—a model that has been discredited in the eyes of senior US officials," Xu added.

China had alleged it fulfilled the terms under the Phase One trade deal that Trump struck with Beijing during his first presidential term, while claiming the U.S. violated certain mandates in the agreement.

The deal required China to boost purchases of U.S. goods by $200 billion over a two-year period, but Beijing did not meet the targets as the Covid-19 pandemic hit.

Another major player has entered the quantum-computing race: Amazon. 

The tech giant is the latest to make waves in the field with the February announcement of Ocelot, its own quantum chip. Amazon joins fierce competition from familiar rivals in cloud computing as Google, Microsoft and others race after what they say could be their next frontier. 

While Amazon is widely known as an e-commerce giant, its business took a pivotal and profitable turn in 2006 with the launch of Amazon Web Services. AWS is now a more than $100 billion business and a key part of why Amazon is worth over $2 trillion. The company sees quantum as the next major growth area for its cloud services.

"There's a … strong business case for AWS or Amazon to get involved with quantum computing," Oskar Painter, director of quantum hardware for Amazon Web Services, told CNBC. "Quantum computing is very much in line with that sort of business model where you would have off-premise quantum computing resources that can be made accessible through the cloud." 

Part of the hype with quantum computing is the perceived payoff down the line. While still years away from commercial applications, McKinsey projects quantum could be a $173 billion market by 2040. 

"The opportunity to build just a supercharged part of AWS that can crack incredibly difficult problems, whether it's related to drug discovery or cybersecurity … that is an opportunity for them to charge a lot more," said Gene Munster, managing partner at Deepwater Asset Management.

CNBC's Kate Rooney got an exclusive look inside the AWS Center for Quantum Computing located at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, California. Founded in 2019, Amazon's partnership with the university is starting to yield results, as it showcased the Ocelot quantum processor. Amazon says the chip, which it designed and fabricated in-house, uses a scalable architecture that reduces error correction by up to 90 percent. That's a key obstacle in developing these machines. Google's Willow chip, which was unveiled in December, also demonstrated improvements in this area.

Ocelot uses "cat qubits," named after the Schrödinger's cat thought experiment. The company says the design intrinsically suppresses certain forms of errors, reducing the resources required for quantum error correction.

"The heart of these quantum computing systems … it's really this quantum processor" Painter said. "The details of how that happens is really what differentiates one hardware platform from another – and really is where the secret sauce is and where all the intellectual property is."

Munster said quantum-computing should be thought of as a new vertical within the AWS cloud business. 

"In the end, it will probably be solved and monetized through one of these big cloud platforms," Munster said. "And AWS has a great shot at being successful there."

Watch the video as Kate Rooney goes behind-the-scenes at Amazon and learns how the company is taking on Google and Microsoft in the quantum computing race.

Have you ever been in a work meeting or social gathering where one person just won't stop talking? It's really frustrating, especially when you have something to say.

As a global communication expert, I work with a lot of smart, polite people who feel like it's rude to interrupt. However, in my book, "Smart, Not Loud: How to Get Noticed at Work for All the Right Reasons," I talk about how important it is for you to speak up, especially if you have something important to add to the conversation. 

Here are three things you need to do:

The first step is to not think of interrupting as a bad thing. Instead, you're part of the conversation and your thoughts are just as valued as everyone else's.

Now, with the right mindset, how do you actually get a word in? 

When you find that opportune time to chime in, the first thing you'll want to say is the person's name. Research shows our brain lights up when we hear our name being called. It signals to us the flow of the conversation has changed, and we intuitively pause to see what's going on. 

So say the person's name firmly and politely. This combination showcases both confidence and presence without coming across as confrontational. 

Next, reroute the conversation to what you want to talk about. Be strategic by showing that you're collaborative and trying to expand on their thoughts. People love to feel like their ideas were acknowledged and it also creates a seamless conversational flow.

For example, you might say: 

When someone feels listened to and heard, they're more likely to back down and make way for others to speak. Now, you can drive the conversation to what you really want to talk about. 

If you're not sure exactly how to phrase your interjection, try this sentence — whether you're in a work brainstorm or a book club meeting: 

"[Person's name], can I jump in real quick here? I'd love to open up the conversation…"

For example: 

Let's say you've used this simple strategy to firmly and politely interrupt a person dominating the conversation. But this person just won't back down. What do you do? 

Being direct is key. If someone keeps going, it's okay to assert yourself even more firmly and call out exactly what you're doing. It's also powerful to pose it as a question. 

You might say:

At the end of the day, you want to create a respectful environment where everybody feels like they have a chance to talk. Speaking up doesn't have to be loud or combative. It just has to be intentional. 

If you feel like someone is dominating the conversation and making it difficult for anyone else to get a word in, chances are other people feel the same. With this approach, you can speak up tactfully and politely, but firmly. And I guarantee others will appreciate you for doing it.

President Donald Trump indicated Friday ahead of key trade talks that he was willing to lower tariffs on China to 80%, but that level may still be higher than what investors and business leaders were hoping for.

Trump said in a Truth Social post: "80% Tariff on China seems right! Up to Scott B." Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent is one of the U.S. officials set to speak with counterparts from China at meetings in Switzerland this weekend.

An 80% levy would be a significant reduction from the 145% tariff currently facing many Chinese goods. However, that number could still be seen as prohibitive to trade. It is also much higher than the 10% baseline tariff in the U.S.-U.K. trade agreement that was announced Thursday.

It is unclear whether Trump wants the 80% rate to be the long-term tariff for China, or whether it should be viewed as a step in negotiations.

In a separate post, Trump said "Many Trade Deals in the hopper, all good (GREAT!) ones!"

China is seen as the key hurdle in Trump's effort to shake up the global trading environment. While many other major countries saw his previously announced tariffs partially paused on April 9, tensions rose between the White House and Beijing until both countries had imposed a tariff of more than 100% on goods.

China is one of the U.S.' largest trading partners. In 2024, the U.S. exported $143.5 billion in goods to China, while importing $438.9 billion, according to the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative.

In another Truth Social post on Friday morning, Trump said, "CHINA SHOULD OPEN UP ITS MARKET TO USA — WOULD BE SO GOOD FOR THEM!!! CLOSED MARKETS DON'T WORK ANYMORE!!!"

The talks in Switzerland this weekend are not expected to result in a full trade deal. U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said Thursday on "Power Lunch" that he wants the discussions to result in "stability" that could be "a foundation for something more."

The latest shipping data shows a drastic decline in the amount of goods moving from China to the U.S., leading to concerns about the potential for higher prices or even shortages of certain goods in the coming weeks.

Friday's comments on China tariff rates appear to signal a shift for Trump. The president said on Wednesday he would not lower tariffs in order to get China to the negotiating table.

Mark Zuckerberg is the king of the quiet glow up — but his luxury watch collection reminds us that in fact, he's worth billions.

The 40-year-old Meta founder, who is estimated to be worth over $207 billion, has taken to flaunting his wealth via wrist candy in recent years.

From a flashy Rolex to a $900,000 Greubel Forsey creation, here's a look at some of his standout timepieces.

While attending Ambani's pre-wedding party in March 2024, Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla Chan, were seen admiring a Richard Mille watch worn by the Reliance Industries heir.

"You know, I never really wanted to get a watch, but after seeing that, I was like, watches are cool," Zuckerberg is heard saying in a video of the interaction.

While he clarified to Chan that he wasn't interested in buying the same watch, he said he'd consider similar options.

On September 1, 2024, Zuckerberg shared an Instagram photo of himself embracing his wife. In the image, his wrist was adorned with a large watch featuring a gold face and a brown strap.

Zuckerberg indulged watch fanatics who asked for details, sharing that the watch was a "5236P," or a Grand Complications In-Line Perpetual Calendar watch from Patek Philippe.

The timepiece is crafted with a platinum case and an alligator-leather band. In terms of functionality, it displays the current day, date, and month. It also indicates leap years, moon phases, and whether it's day or nighttime.

It retails for $141,400, according to the brand's website.

Zuckerberg appeared at an "Acquired" podcast event on September 10, 2024. While onstage, he was photographed wearing another flashy watch: a DB25 Starry Varius from the Swiss watch brand De Bethune.

He seemed to be wearing its rose-gold model, which can cost over $80,000 from independent watch sellers. As watch specialist Bryan Li previously told Business Insider, only 20 of the watches are made annually.

Other variants — like one made from titanium and another encrusted with 273 diamonds — can cost between $75,000 and $127,000.

There's also the Aérolite version of the watch, which features a dial made from a meteorite and usually costs $260,000.

This De Bethune piece — and Zuckerberg's Patek Philippe watch — showed a significant shift in the Facebook founder's style, taking his outfits from basic to luxe almost overnight.

He was photographed wearing a chunky silver watch onstage at the 2024 Meta Connect conference. It appears to have been a variant of a watch from the Swiss brand F.P. Journe's Souveraine collection.

The specific one Zuckerberg wore featured a thick band and large black buttons on its side. Sotheby's listed what appears to be the same watch for auction in March, and said it was made entirely from aluminum.

The auction company also said the watch style was produced between 2011 and 2014. The piece was estimated to sell for between $30,000 and $54,000, though it's unclear what it actually sold for.

The same watch in a darker gray colorway is now available to purchase online for $135,000.

On January 8, Zuckerberg posted a video to announce the end of Meta's fact-checking partnerships in the US. In the clip, he's seen wearing a Greubel Forsey watch that retails for over $900,000.

According to the brand's website, the watch is assembled entirely by hand, and only two or three are crafted each year. It's made with white gold and contains 281 pieces.

Michel Nydegger, the CEO of Greubel Forsey, told Bloomberg at the time that Zuckerberg showed "true appreciation for the most traditional approach to fine watchmaking" by wearing the piece.

Zuckerberg posted a handful of photos and videos from the mixed martial arts event, which showed a thick gold watch on his wrist.

BI spoke with four watch experts at the time, who all said the timepiece was likely a yellow-gold Rolex Daytona Le Mans.

Though Rolex has never confirmed how many exist, collectors and sellers say the watch style is rare.

That's partially why it had a resale value of up to $300,000, as Ng Yong Shen, a vice president at the Dubai-based secondhand retailer Re-Loved Luxury, told BI.

In April, Zuckerberg appeared on The Colin and Samir Show wearing a white timepiece with a vibrant blue face.

Watch fanatics quickly pointed it out as the GA2100WS-7A from Casio's G-Shock line. Made from resin and mineral glass, the watch retails for $120.

So far, it's the least expensive watch Zuckerberg has worn in public.

America's supply chain is under attack.

From coast to coast, organized criminal groups are hitting trucks on the road, breaking into warehouses and pilfering expensive items from train cars, according to industry experts and law enforcement officials CNBC interviewed during a six-month investigation.

It's all part of a record surge in cargo theft in which criminal networks in the U.S. and abroad exploit technology intended to improve supply chain efficiency and use it to steal truckloads of valuable products. Armed with doctored invoices, the fraudsters impersonate the staff of legitimate companies in order to divert cargo into the hands of criminals.

The widespread scheme is "low risk and a very high reward," according to Keith Lewis, vice president of Verisk CargoNet, which tracks theft trends in the industry.

"The return on investment is almost 100%," he said. "And if there's no risk of getting caught, why not do it better and do it faster?"

In 2024, Verisk CargoNet recorded 3,798 incidents of cargo theft, representing a 26% increase over 2023.

Total reported losses topped nearly $455 million, according to Verisk CargoNet, but industry experts told CNBC that number is likely lower than the true toll because many cases go unreported. Numerous experts who spoke to CNBC estimate losses are close to $1 billion or more a year.

Train cargo thefts alone shot up about 40% in 2024, with more than 65,000 reported incidents, according to the Association of American Railroads.

Industry experts and law enforcement officials say a more sophisticated and insidious form of cargo theft called strategic theft is also on the rise.

The way the system is supposed to work is this: A shipper pays a broker, and the broker, after taking its fee, pays the carrier, the trucking company that moves the load.

In strategic theft, criminals use deceptive tactics to trick shippers, brokers or carriers into handing cargo or legitimate payments, sometimes both, over to them instead of the legitimate companies.

Strategic theft represented 8% of all cargo theft in 2020, according to Verisk CargoNet figures, but by the end of 2024, it had risen to represent about one-third.

Tracking down the fraudsters, particularly if they are overseas, is almost an impossible task, Lewis said.

"Think of identity theft," Lewis said. "Think of a friend that's had their identity stolen or their credit card stolen. There's no difference ... There's no bread crumb trail to follow. It's a ghost."

Verisk CargoNet said it has tracked criminal groups that have tried to disrupt the U.S. supply chain to origins in 32 countries.

"There's no deterrent for these guys," said Jerry Jacobs, who oversees risk management at Prosponsive Logistics in Atlanta. The company is a broker connecting shippers with the carriers that move their products.

In an interview with CNBC, Jacobs said the criminals "literally have a license to steal."

"You're hiding out in a foreign country, and all you need is a cell phone and a computer to conduct this type of fraud," he said.

"Every day, we're seeing the bad guys trying to infiltrate our network. And our sales reps have to constantly stay vigilant," Jacobs said. "I say this all the time to my sales folks, that there's probably a 33% chance that you're going to be talking to a bad guy that's looking to steal freight."

Jacobs told CNBC during his interview in February that he was actively dealing with a fraud case. The offenders had stolen his company's identity and were booking shipments, he said. Their goal was to convince a legitimate trucking company to pick up a shipment and unwittingly deliver it so that the criminals, rather than the real carriers, would get paid, he said.

Jacobs showed CNBC the online platform used by brokers to book shipments, called DAT Freight and Analytics. There were listings purportedly initiated by his company, but they weren't legitimate — they were booked, he said, by the criminals.

"Right now, we're dealing with a ton of calls about this," Jacobs said at the time. "A lot of [carriers], unfortunately, picked up the shipment already for the bad guys, and they have already delivered it for the bad guys."

Weeks later, Jacobs was still dealing with the fallout. He said some of the loads were delivered, but not others, suggesting cargo and payments were stolen in the scheme. None of the carriers were paid, he said.

Jacobs said crime costs the average consumer, too, as cargo theft fuels retail price increases.

"I have to pay more at the grocery store, at the checkout line, because these bad guys want to come in and steal freight," he said.

Barry Conlon, founder and CEO of Overhaul, an in-transit supply chain security and risk management company based in Austin, Texas, said the crime groups are very familiar with how freight is moved across the U.S.

"They have people who are literally pulling the information off websites, scraping it, in some cases," Conlon told CNBC. "And then they're attacking at a chosen location once they see the product they want. And it's literally gone into the supply chain within days."

He contrasted the ease and payoff of cargo theft to the high risk and often lower reward of a bank robbery.

"Rob a million-dollar load, that's going to give you hundreds of thousands of dollars in return. And there's literally no risk," he said.

Cargo theft, which is almost always nonviolent, is considered a property crime. According to industry experts, it's underreported for a reason.

"A lot of cases, they don't report it because they feel they're not going to get it back. It's been weeks since they lost it and they've just found out about it," Conlon said.

Overhaul estimates there will be a 22% increase in incidents of cargo theft in 2025, according to the company's most recent report on trends in the industry.

Scott Cornell, the national transportation leader for insurance company Travelers Insurance, said he is also alarmed at what he's seeing in the industry.

"[There are] two things that I always point out about the organized cargo theft rings that are committing these crimes," Cornell said. "They know what to steal and when to steal it, and they're really good at return on investment."

Food and beverage is the thieves' No. 1 targeted commodity, according to Verisk CargoNet.

"It's consumable. So, the evidence disappears," Cornell said. "It's hard to chase. If you're a cargo theft investigator and you're trying to do a recovery investigation, the evidence is going be consumed, right? Or it's going to spoil. There's no barcode on a pistachio."

Household goods are the second-most commonly targeted cargo, followed by electronics, Verisk CargoNet found.

Cargo loss isn't something many retailers are eager to talk about.

Meta, which was hit by a $500,000 theft of its Ray-Ban and Oculus glasses last year in Texas, declined to comment to CNBC. Nike, whose sneakers are favorites of cargo thieves, according to police and court records, did not respond to repeated requests for comment.

The problem is "noticeably increasing," said Birger Buesching, head of the supply chain for Philips' personal health consumer business, which includes Sonicare toothbrushes and Norelco shavers, among other products.

"Two, three years ago, I didn't have to worry about this," Buesching told CNBC in February at the Manifest Conference in Las Vegas, where companies that focus on the supply chain showcased solutions to protect it. "But we do see an uptick in any kind of commercial shipments, bigger value shipments that are going out to our customers or traditional retail customers."

Replacing a stolen load is not so simple, he said.

"First of all, we can't ship that load on time and in full as we promise, so we're letting our customers down," Buesching said. "Often we have safety stock, so we can usually backfill orders very quickly, within days. But especially when you have custom-made products, then it might take a little longer, because you have to make more of that product."

Ellen Kapiloff, vice president of operations for North and Central America at Lacoste, said the threat of cargo theft can lead to inventory challenges on the floor.

"If you're a consumer and you wanted this shirt and we only made 100 of them and 50 of them were stolen, we are strategically going to place the other 50 in a different location, as well as a different channel," Kapiloff told CNBC in an interview at the Manifest conference. "So, it might not be available to you at a store or online when you want it."

Coincidentally, in February, just 10 days after CNBC spoke with Kapiloff, California Highway Patrol's Cargo Theft Interdiction Program served a search warrant at a store in Los Angeles' fashion district. Officers found five boxes containing Lacoste slides footwear that law enforcement said was part of a large cargo heist.

California sees more cargo theft than any other state in the U.S.

In a separate case, in May 2024, athletic apparel retailer Lululemon reported a burglary at a distribution center in Ontario, California, in which thieves made off with "well over a million dollars' worth of Lululemon product," according to the California Highway Patrol.

Police said a person was arrested on suspicion of selling the stolen goods.

In a statement to CNBC, Lululemon said, "Retail crime, including cargo theft, is a serious industry-wide challenge, and we are taking decisive action to combat it. ... In this specific case, our collaborative investigation led to arrests and recovery of stolen products."

While there are financial impacts, cargo theft has been mentioned only sparingly in public companies' earnings conference calls and investor webcasts over the last year.

Knight-Swift is the industry's largest full truckload carrier, but it has only spoken publicly about cargo theft once in the past year, according to a CNBC document search. CEO Adam Miller noted on the company's October earnings call that it is "starting to hear a lot more comments around cargo security."

"I've gone to different conferences here over the last few months, and cargo theft is now a prevailing topic when it really wasn't discussed that much in the past," Miller said.

On a January conference call for transportation company Landstar, Chief Financial Officer Jim Todd explained to investors that the increase in its insurance and claim costs in 2024 compared with 2023 was "primarily attributable to increased severity on cargo claims, primarily due to cargo theft and fraud in the supply chain."

Trucking company J.B. Hunt mentioned cargo theft more often over the past year than other publicly traded companies in the industry, though it was still light on details. In April 2024, the company's president of highway services, Bradley Hicks, said technology has "opened new avenues for bad actors to engage in sophisticated strategic theft, giving these organized groups access to thousands of loads through our platform."

Hicks added J.B. Hunt is "making some adjustments to harden the security of our system."

Not everyone is raising alarms.

C.H. Robinson has 450,000 contracted carriers and handles more than $23 billion in freight annually. The company's success rate in deterring theft and fraud is "99.999%," according to Michael Castagnetto, C.H. Robinson's North American surface transportation president, who oversees cargo theft for the logistics company.

"In January, for example, our North American trucking division recorded only two incidents. To put that in perspective: We move over 5 million truckload shipments a year," Castagnetto told CNBC.

Castagnetto said the company has strategies to weed out potential fraudsters, but, he added, "I can't give you all the details, because we don't want the bad actors to know how we catch them."

Cargo transportation companies of all sizes are working to address the rise in theft.

Zak Bowyer, vice president of sales support operations at TQL, the second-largest freight brokerage firm in the U.S., said the company has invested $4 million in technology and specialized personnel to combat the issue.

Nolan Transportation Group said in a statement that protecting customers from cargo theft is a "top priority."

"We take a proactive, data-driven approach, focusing on early detection and prevention to ensure the security of shipments," Katie Wild, vice president of marketing at Nolan, said in the statement. "We continuously strengthen our carrier onboarding process with additional security measures and increased real-time monitoring to proactively address fraudulent activities and identify suspicious behavior before it escalates."

DAT Freight and Analytics, the online platform widely used by brokers to book shipments, shows where freight is being moved around the country by a carrier and the broker that handled the transaction.

Jeff Hopper, the chief marketing officer of DAT, said 90% of all fraud that takes place in the cargo industry is identity theft. He said Prosponsive Logistics "reported the phishing attack to DAT, and we worked with them to address it. We encourage all customers to report suspicious activity so we can respond appropriately."

To combat strategic theft, he said DAT employs a team that spots attempts at illegal activity about a dozen times a day.

"We have a whole team of people that that's all they do all day long — 25 people all day long — is chase these things down and remove those people that we know to be bad actors," Hopper said. "Our biggest investment that we're making is to fight that battle and to put the protections in place for our customers so that they don't have to worry about that."

Targeting criminals before they disrupt the supply chain is the core business for Highway, a security company based in Dallas.

"It's like a virus," Highway CEO Jordan Graft said in an interview. "So, whenever an industry or a segment becomes infected, it spreads. ... These aren't just single individual actors deciding to wake up one day and say, 'I'm going to target freight brokers in the U.S.' They're working in groups and cohorts."

Highway itself is also regularly targeted by criminal groups trying to infiltrate the security service and disrupt its ability to flag fraud to clients, it said.

The company said its software blocked more than 914,000 fraud attempts last year. It also said 9,829 carrier users from 75 countries tried to get unauthorized access to its platform. The company said it believes those users wanted to steal the identity of legitimate motor carriers.

Highway said most of those attempts originated from six countries: India, Mexico, Moldova, Pakistan, Serbia and Uzbekistan.

Highway alerts its customers if there's a change to a company's phone number, email or address on the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration's site, where shippers register.

"If [hackers] can gain access to the carrier's information, if they can get control of the carrier's email inbox or they can phish the carrier to sharing a code with them, then they can change that information," Graft said. "So, doing it thousands of times a month — it's relatively easy."

He said the FMCSA needs better support to protect carriers, brokers and shippers, a concern that several brokers shared with CNBC.

"I think they are doing the best they can," Graft said. "You're asking an under-resourced government agency whose mandate is motor carrier safety to try and attempt to fight a cybercrime attack on behalf of an entire industry."

Chris Burroughs, CEO of the Transportation Intermediaries Association, agreed that it's been "too easy for these scammers" to hack the FMCSA system.

"The fraud has been going on for years. These are well-organized crime rings," he said.

FMCSA spokesman Matt Schuck, in a statement to CNBC, said: "The agency continuously introduces security enhancements and upgrades to help safeguard the commercial motor vehicle industry and the American public. Recent initiatives to combat cargo theft include implementing multi-factor authentication across all FMCSA systems and strengthening security protocols. Additionally, FMCSA is developing a modernized registration system featuring even stronger safeguards and processes."

In response to the surge in cargo theft, U.S. Rep. David Valadao, R-Calif., along with other lawmakers, in April introduced a bipartisan bill called the Combating Organized Retail Crime Act. The bill would set up a coordination center within the Department of Homeland Security tasked with fighting cargo theft and organized retail crime.

"It incorporates the FBI and Homeland Security," Valadao told CNBC, "and it creates the task force [to] communicate with my local agencies but also amongst themselves so that they can be informed about what's going on ... around the district or even around the country."

The legislation is pending.

On the other side of Congress, the Senate Subcommittee on Surface Transportation, Freight, Pipelines, and Safety has taken a particular focus on cargo theft.

"In this era of increasing permeability of our southern border, in particular, we've seen a lot of criminal elements come through, including those who are engaging in cargo theft," said Sen. Todd Young, R-Ind., who chairs the subcommittee.

In an interview in his Senate office, Young said the FMCSA is "unable" to identify and remove fraudsters from online shipping systems.

"That means a lot in this age of e-commerce, when people depend on this website," he said, "to identify appropriate shippers and to trust in that information."

The Household Goods Shipping Consumer Protection Act, a bipartisan bill introduced in the Senate, would give the FMCSA authority to impose civil penalties and other stricter regulations against fraudsters.

Correction: This story has been updated correct that C.H. Robinson handles more than $23 billion in freight annually. A prior version misstated the figure.

Germany needs to take more risks and boost its stagnant economy with a decade of investment in infrastructure, German Minister for Economic Affairs and Energy Katherina Reiche said Friday.

"The next decade will be the decade of infrastructure investments in bridges, in energy infrastructure, in storage, in maritime infrastructure... telecommunication. And for this, we need speed. We need speed and investments, and we need private capital," Reiche told CNBC's Annette Weisbach on the sidelines of the Tegernsee summit.

While 10% of investments could be taken care of with public money, the remaining 90% relied on the private sector, she said.

The newly minted economy minister also addressed regulation coming from Brussels, warning that it could hinder companies from investments and start-ups from growing if it is too restrictive. Germany has had to learn that investments comes with risks "and we have to kind of be open for taking more risks," she said.

Initiating regulatory changes will in fact be one of the most important jobs for the new German government, Veronika Grimm, member of the German Council of Economic Experts, told CNBC on the sidelines of the Tegernsee summit.

"It will be important to adjust regulation, so removing or changing innovation-stifling regulation so that more is possible again in many areas of technology," she said in comments translated by CNBC.

"And then of course it is about improving the environment or businesses, making it more attractive so that we are competitive again," Grimm said.

Germany's economy contracted slightly on an annual basis in both 2023 and 2024 and the quarterly gross domestic product has been flipping between growth and contraction for over two years now, just about managing to avoid a technical recession. Preliminary data for the first quarter of 2025 showed a 0.2% expansion.

Forecasts do not suggest much of a reprieve from the sluggishness, with the now former German government last month saying it still expects the economy to stagnate this year.

"This country needs an economic turnaround. After two years of recessions the previous government had to announce again [a] zero growth year for 2025 and we really have to work on this. So on the top of the agenda is an investor booster," economy minister Reiche said.

Lowering energy prices, stabilizing the security of energy supply and reducing bureaucracy were among the key points on the agenda, she added.

This is despite a major fiscal U-turn announced earlier this year, which included changes to the country's long-standing debt rules to allow for additional defense spending and a 500-billion-euro ($562.4 billion) infrastructure package.

Several of Germany's key industries are under pressure. The auto industry for example is dealing with stark competition from China and now faces tariffs, while issues in housebuilding and infrastructure have been linked to higher costs and bureaucratic hurdles.

Trade is also a key pillar for the German economy and therefore uncertainty from U.S. President Donald Trump's changing tariff policies are weighing heavily on the outlook.

The U.K. and U.S. agreed to a landmark trade deal on Thursday — yet the agreement appears to be far from free of tariffs.

The deal is the first made by the United States since President Donald Trump unveiled his so-called reciprocal tariffs on countries around the world last month.

The United Kingdom's position as one of a handful of countries where the U.S. boasts a trade surplus in goods — meaning the U.S. exports more to the U.K. than it imports — put the country at the front of the queue for officials to broker an agreement with the Trump administration.

However, even Britain, with its "special relationship" with the U.S., didn't manage to persuade Trump to drop all tariffs during trade talks.

Under the deal, the U.K. can export 100,000 vehicles each year at a 10% rate, with any additional vehicles facing 25% duties. British steelmakers and the aluminum industry will be able to export tariff-free, down from the 25% rate that the U.S. imposed in February.

However, all other goods imported to the U.S. from the U.K. will still be subject to a 10% baseline tariff — which Trump says is the lowest country-specific tariff that will be applied to trading partners.

Trump also suggested the deal is likely to be rare due to the two countries' balanced trading relationship and close political ties — meaning it's unlikely any country will be tariff-free under his second administration.

Asked if the 10% baseline tariff is a template for future trade deals, Trump said, "That's a low number."

"They made a good deal," he added. "Some will be much higher because they have massive trade surpluses."

Analysts took that to mean that tariffs of 10% at the very minimum are the best deal other countries and trading blocs could achieve.

"The details of the US-UK deal suggest that the US 10% baseline tariff is likely to remain in place for other trading partners with virtually no exceptions, but signals more flexibility than expected on sectoral tariffs," said Jan Hatzius, chief economist and head of global investment research at Goldman Sachs.

JPMorgan's U.S. economist, Abiel Reinhart, also noted that "the chances that a rate of at least 10% on most goods across most countries could be maintained this year," in a note to clients.

Reinhart also pointed out that the carve-outs the United Kingdom secured for its auto, steel and aluminum sectors indicated the U.S. may be willing to cut bespoke — yet narrower in scope — deals with other nations.

"This has been a key sticking point in recent trade discussions with Japan, given the importance of its auto sector," Reinhart added. "But it's also possible that the US was more willing to make concessions with the UK on autos given that the UK only accounts for about 2.5% of US imports of vehicles and parts. By contrast, Japan accounts for close to 12%."

However, Rella Suskin, equity analyst and autos expert at Morningstar, pointed out that the deal to reduce tariffs on only 100,000 cars effectively capped the market share of many of Britain's largest automakers, including Tata Motors-owned Jaguar Land Rover.

Instead, it would benefit automakers such as BMW that import some auto parts tariff-free and assemble vehicles in the U.S., according to Suskin.

"The limitation of the benefit of the UK being able to export 100 000 cars annually to the US at a 10% tariff means that Jaguar is unable to take any market share from a 'preferential' tariff relative to European automakers," Suskin said.

Andrew Hood, head of international trade at European law firm Fieldfisher and former advisor to British Prime Minister David Cameron, said the deal did more to support "the wider UK-US relationship" than help smooth trade between the two countries.

"It is notable that the deal is far more restricted than most Free Trade Agreements," Hood said. "Rather, the deal focuses on supporting particular sectors, notably the automotive industry, ethanol producers and the steel and aluminium manufacturers where tariffs have been substantially reduced or eliminated."

As damaging the residual 10% tariffs could be for the U.K., others point out the deal could dent U.S. economic growth, too.

"While exemptions will nibble away at the effective tariff rate, with the baseline 10% not going anywhere, the average US tariff is still set to remain in double digits, which will deliver a big hit to real incomes in the US which will cause growth to slow sharply in the second half of the year,," said Michael Pearce, deputy chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics.

Shares of Next Technology Holding Inc NXTT surged by 706% to $2.50 on Friday afternoon, driven by an extremely large spike in trading volume over the company's Bitcoin BTC/USD assets.

Friday's session volume exploded to 152.165 million shares, dwarfing the 100-day average volume of just 524,333 shares.

What To Know: Fueling the rally was the company's latest disclosure revealing it held approximately 5,833 Bitcoins as of March 31, 2025, with a carrying value of $481.7 million, up from just 833 Bitcoins at the end of 2024. This increase was largely tied to a major crypto acquisition executed in March, which was financed through stock issuance and warrants.

Next Technology, which has dual business focuses in software development and Bitcoin investment, also reported $193.4 million in net income for the first-quarter—almost entirely from unrealized gains on digital assets. 

With seemingly little traditional revenue and limited cash on hand, the company's stock price Friday appears to be riding the momentum of its crypto-centric strategy.

By now you're likely curious about how to participate in the market for Next Technology Holding – be it to purchase shares, or even attempt to bet against the company.

Buying shares is typically done through a brokerage account. You can find a list of possible trading platforms here. Many will allow you to buy “fractional shares,” which allows you to own portions of stock without buying an entire share.

If you're looking to bet against a company, the process is more complex. You'll need access to an options trading platform, or a broker who will allow you to “go short” a share of stock by lending you the shares to sell. The process of shorting a stock can be found at this resource.  Otherwise, if your broker allows you to trade options, you can either buy a put option, or sell a call option at a strike price above where shares are currently trading – either way it allows you to profit off of the share price decline.

According to data from Benzinga Pro, NXTT has a 52-week high of $6.00 and a 52-week low of $0.22.

 Cybersecurity researcher ZachXBT said they identified the wallet linked to the scam. 

Law enforcement detained the wrong person for a 2022 scam that pilfered more than $1 million worth of Bored Ape non-fungible tokens (NFTs), cybersecurity researcher ZachXBT said. 

In a May 9 X post, ZachXBT said he identified the wallet behind the scam and linked it to an X account that has since been deleted. 

But in 2023, law enforcement detained Sam Curry, a former Yuga Labs security researcher, at an airport as a suspect in the incident, ZachXBT said. Yuga Labs is the company behind the Bored Ape Yacht Club NFT collection. 

“It's unfortunate to see how a security researcher was detained when stronger leads on a threat actor potentially responsible exist,” ZachXBT said.

In December 2022, an anonymous attacker stole 14 Bored Ape Yacht Club NFTs, which at the time traded for roughly $86,000 each, according to data from CoinSlam.

Law enforcement then “mistakenly reviewed logs from OpenSea which included [Curry's] home IP address and used this to incorrectly link him as the suspect,” ZachXBT wrote.

“In reality as part of his security work at Yuga, [Curry] had been investigating the theft and used a private key put in the JavaScript of the website by the threat actor,” ZachXBT said. 

ZachXBT said he used forensic tracing — including reconstructing the flow of funds through Tornado, an Ethereum mixer — to identify a person he alleges is a likely suspect in the 2022 theft.

He said law enforcement officials should “request all data related to [the individual's] social media accounts” and dig into on-chain transactions associated with their alleged wallet. 

Launched in 2021, Bored Ape Yacht Club is among the most valuable NFT collections, with a cumulative market capitalization of more than $300 million, according to data from CoinGecko.  

As of May 9, Bored Ape NFTs trade for roughly $30,000 each, according to NFT marketplace OpenSea. Individual NFTs vary in price due to unique characteristics.

Short traders have been pummeled over the last 24 hours as the prices of top crypto assets spiked, contributing to a total of $1.12 billion worth of crypto positions liquidated during that span.

According to data from CoinGlass, shorts make up the bulk of that figure, with nearly $777 million worth of positions liquidated over the past day. Short positions are bets that the price of a particular asset will fall, with long positions being the opposite. Some $350 million worth of longs were zapped in the same span.

Bitcoin usually leads the list of liquidations, but over the past day, it's been Ethereum traders weathering the most damage with $439 million worth of liquidations.

That's because of Ethereum's incredible price rise, with the asset skyrocketing nearly 25% over the last week to a current price of $2,303. Earlier Friday, the price rose to $2,448 for the first time in two months. The Ethereum jump comes amid this week's launch of the long-awaited Pectra network upgrade.

Ethereum isn't the only big gainer this week, however, even if its rise has outpaced most other giants. Bitcoin is up 5% to a current price of $102,858, topping $100,000 on Thursday for the first time since February. The top cryptocurrency touched a high of $103,890 earlier Friday, with $307 million worth of Bitcoin liquidations piling up over the last day.

Other big movers in the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market cap this week include Solana with a 12% rise and Dogecoin with a more than 11% climb on the week.

Solana yielded the third-most liquidations for any single asset over the last day with over $40 million worth, with Dogecoin a little further down the list with $19 million worth of liquidations.

Per CoinGlass, the single-largest liquidation over the last day came from a trader betting against Bitcoin, losing an $11.97 million position in the process.

This is a daily technical analysis by CoinDesk analyst and Chartered Market Technician Omkar Godbole.

About two weeks ago, I discussed bitcoin's (BTC) bullish breakout above a technical resistance called the Ichimoku cloud and potential for a rally to $100,000. This week, the cryptocurrency obligingly surged into six figures.

Now, top alternative cryptocurrencies such as memecoin DOGE, payments-focused XRP, the Ethereum blockchain's ether (ETH) and Solana's SOL have also crossed above the cloud, flashing bullish signals.

The analysis, developed by a Japanese journalist in the 1960s, is used to identify support and resistance, momentum and trend change in price actions. The indicator comprises five lines: Leading Span A, Leading Span B, Conversion Line or Tenkan-Sen (T), Base Line or Kijun-Sen (K), and a lagging closing price line.

The gap between the first two lines makes the cloud. Crossovers above and below the Ichimoku cloud are taken to represent bullish and bearish shifts in momentum.

The chart shows XRP and DOGE moving above their respective Ichimoku clouds, signaling more gains.

In XRP's case, the breakout shifts focus to resistance at around 30 cents, characterized by the trendline falling from February highs. DOGE is trading close to its bear market trendline, which, if topped, would expose resistance at $3.02, the lower high created on March 2.

In ETH's case, the breakout has opened the doors to the 200-day simple moving average (SMA) at $2,700. Meanwhile, SOL may encounter resistance at $218, the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement of the January to April sell-off.

Oops, something went wrong

In recent years, the global demand for sustainable practices has grown, with industries across the world rethinking how they can reduce their environmental impact. One area receiving increasing attention is packaging.

Traditional packaging methods, particularly those reliant on plastic, have led to significant environmental damage, contributing to pollution, excessive waste, and resource depletion.

As businesses seek to align with consumer demand for sustainability, the need for innovation in packaging is more critical than ever. One such innovative solution gaining momentum is blockchain technology.

Blockchain, the underlying technology behind cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, offers a new way of tracking, verifying, and enhancing the sustainability of packaging materials.

This combination of digital technology and environmental consciousness is transforming the packaging sector, offering new opportunities to improve transparency, reduce waste, and promote the use of recyclable and renewable materials.

So, how exactly can blockchain be leveraged for sustainable packaging, and what are the benefits it brings?

One of the most significant benefits of blockchain technology is its ability to enhance transparency and traceability across supply chains.

Traditional packaging supply chains can be opaque, making it difficult for consumers to know the true environmental impact of the products they purchase.

In an age where customers are increasingly interested in the sustainability credentials of the brands they support, blockchain offers a solution by providing a decentralised, immutable ledger that records every transaction made along the packaging supply chain.

With blockchain, every step of a product's packaging journey can be tracked, from the sourcing of raw materials to manufacturing, distribution, and end-of-life disposal.

This transparency allows consumers to verify claims about the sustainability of products, including the use of eco-friendly materials, recycling efforts, and carbon footprint reduction strategies.

For businesses, it offers an opportunity to demonstrate accountability, reinforcing their commitment to sustainability in a way that is easily verifiable.

For example, a company producing recyclable packaging can use blockchain to prove that the materials used were sourced responsibly and that the product can indeed be recycled at the end of its life.

This level of traceability not only builds consumer trust but also helps companies adhere to regulations and certifications that require proof of sustainability, such as the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) certification for paper products.

One of the critical challenges in the pursuit of sustainability is the issue of waste, especially in the packaging industry. According to a report from the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, over 80% of packaging is not recycled properly, leading to vast amounts of waste that pollute landfills and oceans.

This is where blockchain can help drive change by promoting circularity — the process of reusing, recycling, and regenerating materials within the supply chain.

Blockchain can facilitate the creation of circular packaging systems by providing an efficient way to track the lifecycle of packaging materials. For instance, once packaging is used, blockchain can help companies track and incentivise the return and recycling of packaging materials.

By using smart contracts and tokens, businesses can reward customers who return packaging for reuse, further encouraging sustainable behaviour. Additionally, blockchain can assist in monitoring the effectiveness of recycling programs, ensuring that materials are returned and processed correctly, ultimately reducing the need for new resources.

With these advanced tracking systems in place, businesses can make more informed decisions about the design of their packaging. For example, a company can identify packaging that is not being recycled effectively and shift towards more recyclable or compostable materials.

Furthermore, blockchain allows for more efficient waste management practices, improving the ability to sort and process waste, which in turn reduces landfill usage.

One of the challenges in achieving truly sustainable packaging is the fragmented nature of the packaging industry. Companies often work with a multitude of suppliers, manufacturers, and logistics providers, all of whom may have different practices when it comes to sustainability.

Blockchain's decentralised and secure nature can break down barriers between these stakeholders, fostering collaboration and alignment on sustainability goals.

By creating a single, transparent ledger that all stakeholders can access, blockchain enables real-time sharing of data across the supply chain. This collaboration can lead to the sharing of best practices, the development of joint sustainability initiatives, and more consistent standards across industries.

Moreover, blockchain helps prevent greenwashing — the practice of making misleading claims about the environmental benefits of products. With verified data available to all parties, companies are held accountable for their sustainability claims, creating a more truthful and consistent approach to sustainable packaging.

For example, a consortium of companies could work together on a blockchain-enabled platform to create a more sustainable packaging solution that meets the needs of all stakeholders.

These could include packaging manufacturers, brands, recyclers, and even waste management organisations. By using blockchain to coordinate efforts, these diverse parties can work together more effectively, ensuring that packaging materials are sourced, used, and disposed of responsibly.

This level of collaboration could result in more efficient systems that reduce waste and improve recycling rates across industries.

As the world continues to prioritise sustainability, blockchain technology is likely to play an increasingly vital role in the packaging sector.

The potential for blockchain to enhance transparency, reduce waste, and foster collaboration makes it a powerful tool for tackling the environmental challenges posed by traditional packaging methods.

While the adoption of blockchain for sustainable packaging is still in its early stages, the growing interest in this technology suggests that it will be a significant force in the years to come.

In the future, we may see widespread adoption of blockchain in the packaging industry, with companies and consumers alike benefiting from a more sustainable and circular system.

As more organisations embrace this innovative approach, we can expect to see an acceleration in the development of new sustainable packaging solutions, which could ultimately lead to a reduction in waste, a decrease in the carbon footprint of packaging, and a cleaner, more sustainable environment for future generations.

Ultimately, blockchain presents an exciting opportunity for revolutionising the packaging industry.

By improving traceability, reducing waste, and fostering collaboration, blockchain can help businesses achieve their sustainability goals while providing consumers with greater confidence in the products they purchase.

As the world continues to face pressing environmental challenges, blockchain for sustainable packaging could be a pivotal solution in the ongoing pursuit of a greener planet.

 The $38 million crypto seizure from Bybit hack-linked eXch was the third-largest crypto confiscation in the history of Germany's federal criminal police. 

German law enforcement seized 34 million euros ($38 million) in cryptocurrency from eXch, a cryptocurrency platform allegedly used to launder funds stolen after Bybit's record-breaking $1.4 billion hack.

The seizure, announced on May 9 by Germany's Federal Criminal Police Office (BKA) and Frankfurt's main prosecutor's office, involved multiple crypto assets, including Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), Litecoin (LTC) and Dash (DASH). The move marks the third-largest crypto confiscation in the BKA's history.

The authorities also seized eXch's German server infrastructure with over eight terabytes of data and shut down the platform, the announcement added.

In the statement, the BKA described eXch as a “swapping” service that allowed users to exchange various crypto assets without implementing Anti-Money Laundering (AML) measures.

The platform had operated since 2014 and reportedly facilitated about $1.9 billion in crypto transfers, some of which were believed to be of “criminal origin,” including assets laundered during the Bybit hack.

“Among other things, a portion of the $1.5 billion stolen from the Bybit crypto exchange, which was hacked on Feb. 21, 2025, is said to have been exchanged via eXch,” the authorities wrote.

According to a post by crypto sleuth ZachXBT, eXch was also involved in laundering millions of funds from other crypto thefts and exploits, including Multisig, FixedFloat and the $243 million Genesis creditor theft.

Those were in addition to “countless phishing drainer services over the past few years with refusal to block addresses and freeze orders,” ZachXBT said.

ZachXBT was among the first security analysts to report on eXch's links to laundering $35 million of crypto assets stolen from Bybit soon after the hack was confirmed.

“Lazarus Group transferred 5K ETH from the Bybit Hack to a new address and began laundering funds via eXch (a centralized mixer) and bridging funds to Bitcoin via Chainflip,” ZachXBT wrote in a Telegram post on Feb. 22.

After initially denying involvement in laundering funds from the Bybit hack, eXch eventually announced it would cease operations by May 1 in a Bitcoin Talk post published in mid-April.

“Even though we have been able to operate despite some failed attempts to shut down our infrastructure [...], we don't see any point in operating in a hostile environment where we are the target of SIGINT [Signals Intelligence] simply because some people misinterpret our goals,” it wrote.

Addressing the seizure, senior public prosecutor Benjamin Krause stressed the importance of action against “quick and anonymous opportunities for money laundering for any amount.”

“Crypto swapping is an essential component of the underground economy, used to conceal incriminated funds from illegal activities such as hacking or trading in stolen payment card data, thus making them available to perpetrators,” he said.

According to a recent CryptoQuant Quicktake post by on-chain analyst BorisVest, Ethereum (ETH) appears to be stuck in a state of limbo. While retail investors are increasingly sending ETH to exchanges such as Binance – typically a sign of selling pressure – large investors are steadily withdrawing ETH from these platforms, indicating accumulation and long-term confidence.

Ethereum Stuck In A Tug-Of-War

As ETH inches closer to the $2,000 mark for the first time since March 27, market sentiment appears to be shifting. Optimism is building around the potential for a trend reversal, but on-chain data continues to deliver mixed signals regarding Ethereum's short- to medium-term direction.

In his analysis, BorisVest highlighted that Ethereum metrics from Binance are sending ‘mixed signals.' While short-term indicators reveal underlying weakness and investor indecision, longer-term metrics point to resilience and strength.

Notably, mean exchange inflows have increased significantly since late 2024, suggesting growing sell pressure from retail traders. This pattern resembles the behavior seen during 2022–2023, when a surge in ETH deposits to exchanges preceded a steep price decline.

Similarly, mean exchange outflows have also been rising steadily since October 2023. However, these outflows are largely linked to whale wallets – addresses holding large amounts of ETH – implying that high-net-worth individuals are accumulating rather than selling. This divergence highlights a classic tug-of-war between retail fear and institutional confidence.

The analyst also pointed to funding rate trends. He noted that during ETH's rally to $4,000 in early 2025, funding rates became overly positive as bullish sentiment took hold. This over-leveraged long positioning resulted in a sharp correction, driving ETH's price down to $1,400 by April.

At present, funding rates are hovering in neutral territory, indicating a lack of clear leverage bias. BorisVest noted that if short interest rises and funding rates fall below zero, a short squeeze could ensue – potentially driving prices higher. However, no such setup has formed yet.

Meanwhile, the taker buy/sell ratio, which tracks aggressive market orders, showed heavy selling pressure in late 2024 and early 2025 – right before Ethereum's steep decline. This ratio is now stabilizing, suggesting that sellers may be exhausted and buyers are gradually regaining strength.

Change Of Fortunes For ETH?

Although ETH is down 34.3% over the past year, several technical and on-chain indicators point toward a potential bullish trend reversal for the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap.

For instance, Ethereum recently flashed a golden cross on the daily chart, a bullish indicator that typically leads to major upward moves. Further, there are signs that the cryptocurrency may have already bottomed out for this market cycle. 

That said, uncertainty remains. Recently, machine learning algorithm CoinCodex predicted that ETH may witness another crash that may push its price down to $1,500. At press time, ETH trades at $1,966, up 7.8% in the past 24 hours.

A Florida-based pharmaceutical distributor is backing XRP as a treasury and payments asset, putting the token at the center of a $50 million financing deal.

Wellgistics Health (WGRX) said Thursday it had secured an equity line of credit to support XRP-based reserves and infrastructure for real-time payments.

The company plans to use the blockchain to settle transactions across its pharmacy network, manage vendor payouts, and issue credit lines backed by XRP.

The move makes Wellgistics one of the few publicly listed U.S. firms to actively integrate XRP into its financial operations. XRP will help eliminate banking delays and lower settlement costs of fractions of a cent, two key resistance points in pharmaceutical supply chains.

“We believe that there are certain advantages to integrating XRP and its related infrastructure into its healthcare ecosystem,” the firm said in the release. 

“XRP settles transactions in 3-5 seconds vs. 1-3 days for ACH or wire transfers, allowing for near real-time settlement among pharmacies, suppliers, and manufacturers. All transactions are logged on the XRP Ledger for real-time compliance, rebate tracking, and auditability,” it said, adding that the token will help process global vendor payouts at very low foreign exchange rates.

The credit facility is being provided by New York-based LDA Capital. No timeline was provided for the XRP-based services would actually begin.

Square Enix's Symbiogenesis Web3 game was slated to be discontinued in July 2025, but Sony said the game will now expand to Sony's Soneium blockchain.

The moves brings the first Web3 game from a major publisher to Sony's fledgling Soneium blockchain. Sony said that game studios and entertainment giants are choosing Soneium as a channel to collaborate, distribute, and connect with a new generation of builders. As more IP-driven titles enter the ecosystem, they're not just launching onchain, they're choosing a place where cross-game collaboration, interoperability, and creative ownership are part of the foundation, Sony said.

But it's not clear how much Symbiogenesis will be expanded with new content, as the content hasn't proven that popular so far. Sony is also connecting the game with others, offering rewards and status to players who complete the Symbiogenesis experience. Those who complete it will be greenlit to participate in the Evermoon and Sleepagotchi games that are also on Soneium. 

This initiative begins in the expansive world of Symbiogenesis, the blockchain-based narrative game from Square Enix. 

Sony called Symbiogenesis the flagship Web3 entertainment project, blending interactive storytelling, non-fungible token (NFT) ownership, and game progression into a single immersive experience. Gamers can collect unique character NFTs, unlock episodes, and shape the game's story. But so far, only hundreds of fans have collected the NFTs.

This initiative involving the three distinct gaming worlds offers players a shared quest, collectible rewards, and a new way to engage through blockchain gaming on Soneium.

Now, players who complete a limited-time quest in Symbiogenesis will receive a commemorative NFT collectible on Soneium, which opens the door to additional in-game benefits in Evermoon and Sleepagotchi. 

Symbiogenesis has a sprawling narrative told through 10,000 character NFTs, six chapters, and over 1.1 million words of interactive storytelling. Every NFT unlocks new story content and choices that shape the game world. The chapters one to four of this season's quest is the key to entering the crossover.

The onchain MOBA, Evermoon, leads onchain interactive entertainment with fast-paced 5v5 battles, interoperable NFTs, and DeFi rewards—built on Soneium. The Evermoon x Symbiogenesis collection introduces limited-edition digital stickers with perks like profile customization and rewards for gamers.

Sleepagotchi LITE launches a hit mini-app on LINE in collaboration with Soneium, after topping charts on Telegram with over a million users in its first month. It rewards daily engagement through light gameplay—and in this initiative, players can unlock the Epic Rarity One-Horned Dragon, exclusive to Symbiogenesis quest participants.

On Soneium, everyone is a creator. This initiative captures the spirit of collaboration that defines the ecosystem. Symbiogenesis brings IP and story. Evermoon brings competitive depth. Sleepagotchi brings daily habit loops and mobile-native simplicity. Soneium brings the infrastructure to make these experiences interoperable, onchain, and meaningful.

Square Enix is the example of top game publishers choosing Soneium to build a new kind of entertainment layer of the internet, where characters, rewards, and narratives travel across games, communities, and apps.

Bitcoin's rapid price rally has caught traders off guard, triggering large liquidations of bearish short positions.

The leading cryptocurrency by market value has risen over 3% to $102,500 in the past 24 hours, with prices topping $104,000 at one point, the highest since Jan. 31. The bullish move came as President Donald Trump announced a comprehensive trade deal with the U.K. and the cumulative inflows into the spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) hit a record high above $40 billion.

The broader market rallied as well, with the total market cap of all coins excluding BTC surging by 10% to $1.14 trillion, the highest since March 6, according to data source TradingView.

That has led to substantial liquidations of bearish short positions, or leveraged plays aimed at profiting from price losses. A position is liquidated or forced closed when the trader's account balance falls below the required margin level, often due to adverse price movements. This leads the exchange to close the position to prevent further losses automatically.

Nearly $400 million in BTC short positions were liquidated in the past 24 hours—marking the highest single-day total since at least November, according to Coinglass. Meanwhile, $22 million in long positions were also wiped out.

This significant imbalance indicates that leverage was heavily tilted towards the bearish side, and the rapid liquidation of shorts suggests there could be more upside potential for the market ahead.

 Bitcoin (BTCUSD) will remain in the spotlight Friday after surging above the closely watched $100,000 level on Thursday for the first time since early February.


 The legacy cryptocurrency rallied along with stocks after President Donald Trump announced that the U.S. had reached a trade agreement with the U.K. The president also said that further deals could be on the way and expressed optimism about trade talks with China that are slated to take place this weekend.


 Bitcoin's price had fallen sharply between February and April, weighed down by uncertainty about tariffs and their potential impact on the economy, as well as disappointment with the pace of reforms by the Trump administration to support the crypto industry. With the latest surge, bitcoin is nearly 40% above last month's low and up 10% from the start of the year.


 Bitcoin was trading at $102,700 late Thursday evening, up from an intraday low of around $96,000.


 Below, we take a closer look at Bitcoin's chart and apply technical analysis to identify crucial price levels worth watching out for.


 After reclaiming the 200-day moving average (MA) last month, bitcoin traded within a narrow consolidation period before today's strong breakout above the all-important $100,000 mark. The move sets the stage for a potential retest of the cryptocurrency's record high established at $109,000 in late January.


 Meanwhile, the relative strength index confirms bullish price momentum with a reading above the 70 threshold, though the indicator also cautions overbought conditions that could lead to short-term profit-taking.


 It's important to note that trading volumes on Coinbase (COIN), the largest crypto exchange in the United States, have declined since bitcoin's move higher started in early April, indicating larger market participants may be sitting out the current rally.


 Let's identify two crucial overhead areas on bitcoin's chart worth watching while also locating key support levels to monitor.


 The first overhead area to watch sits around $107,000. This location will likely attract significant attention near the prominent December and January peaks that marked a double top pattern on the chart.


 Investors can forecast an overhead area to watch above the cryptocurrency's record high by using bars pattern analysis. 


 To apply this technique, we take the price bars comprising bitcoin's move higher that preceded the recent consolidation period and reposition them from today's breakout point. The analysis projects a potential upside target of around $120,000 assuming a continuation move plays out.


 Short-term profit-taking could see the cryptocurrency's price revisit the $100,000 level. Following today's breakout above this key psychological area, the region may flip from prior resistance into future support.


 However, inability of bulls to successfully defend this level could trigger a more significant retracement in bitcoin's price to $92,000. This region finds a confluence of support from the nearby upward sloping 200-day MA and a trendline that connects a range of corresponding trading activity on the chart stretching back to late November last year.

Launching Summer 2025, T-Rex's built-in distribution engine introduces a radically simple idea: rewarding people seamlessly for doing what they already love online.

T-Rex, a purpose-built blockchain for entertainment, content, and cultural virality, today announced a $17 million fundraise and Incubation Fund to revolutionize online content publishing by seamlessly rewarding consumers for everyday interactions on social platforms such as YouTube, TikTok, or X (formerly Twitter) and reshape how consumer-facing decentralized applications (dApps) are discovered, published, distributed and scaled across Web3.

Backed by strategic investors including Portal Ventures, North Island Ventures, Framework Ventures, Arbitrum Gaming Ventures, ArkStream Capital, Mindfulness Capital, Hypersphere, SNZ, and Arche Fund, and developed by EVG, Asia's prominent product builder and publisher, known for driving mass adoption, T-Rex directly addresses the critical “ghost town” and “mercenary users” challenges in blockchain.

“Arbitrum Gaming Ventures recognizes the transformative potential of platforms like T-Rex that are expanding Web3 beyond DeFi. EVG's strong regional influence and deep understanding of the Southeast Asian market, projected to reach $7 billion by 2028, provide a strategic gateway for us to significantly scale our footprint within this high-growth region. Combining our robust scaling capabilities with EVG's extensive ecosystem expertise, we are strategically positioned to penetrate the entertainment industry and broader consumer market in a pivotal and rapidly expanding part of the world,” said Dan Peng, Partner at Arbitrum Gaming Ventures.

​​T-Rex leverages Arbitrum's powerful Layer-2 scaling solution, delivering ultra-fast, secure, and low-cost transactions essential for consumer-scale adoption. Arbitrum Gaming Ventures has specifically identified T-Rex as key to its regional growth strategy.

T-Rex: A New Kind of Blockchain for the Culture-First Internet

(UI screenshot: A user earning rewards while browsing YouTube with T-Rex's browser extension.)

While Web3 holds the promise of revolutionary change, the current landscape is fragmented, user-unfriendly and often empty with underutilized dApps. Despite all its innovation, most chains lack real users, real culture, and real reasons to stay. T-Rex flips the model with its simple first principle: stop trying to reinvent user habits and instead enhance them invisibly. Its core innovation, Proof-of-Engagement (PoE) mechanism, automatically rewards users on apps they already use daily through a privacy-preserving browser extension, turning everyday online actions like watching videos, liking posts, and sharing memes into tangible, valuable digital ownership and offline perks.

“Instead of building another blockchain pipe, we're delivering actual water: engaging content, thriving communities, real-world rewards”, said Allen Ng, Co-Founder of T-Rex and EVG. “Users shouldn't have to think about crypto until they want to. Our blockchain stays invisible, letting them effortlessly turn their online fun into meaningful rewards. Our vision is to let attention becomes equity, community becomes power and participation becomes currency.”

Radical Simplicity: Web3 That Feels Like TikTok, Not A Crypto Wallet

At launch, users simply install T-Rex's browser extension and continue browsing popular social media platforms. Every interaction is quietly, securely recorded via advanced zero-knowledge tech (zkTLS), and seamlessly turned into rewards, with no wallet or tech jargon required.

Creators and projects benefit from instant audience discovery and viral distribution, while end users earn rewards effortlessly, redeemable both digitally and offline, such as cash back at favorite restaurants or exclusive local deals.

“The next wave of breakout applications will be defined by distribution, UI / UX, and product differentiation. The team at T-Rex gets this. They're building a protocol that seamlessly onboards social media users and allows them to monetize their data through network rewards. We're excited to back T-Rex as they merge protocol-native network design with clean consumer product expertise,” said Evan Fisher, Founder and General Partner of Portal Ventures.

“Web3 infrastructure has matured, but it still lacks consumer momentum because only a few use cases resonate with the masses. T-Rex is a strong contender to bridge this gap. By prioritizing culture and abstracting complexity, it offers a path to broad adoption,” said Travis Scher Managing Partner and Co-founder of North Island Ventures.

Incubating the New Digital Metropolis

The $8 million Incubation Fund backed by EVG with support from the Arbitrum Gaming Ventures will accelerate ecosystem growth, offering comprehensive developer support beyond capital, including engineering resources, media partnerships, community activations, premium events, Key Opinion Leader (KOL) networks, and strategic Intellectual Property (IP) applications.

“We provide real firepower, not just capital”, Joyce Yim, Co-founder of T-Rex emphasised. “Developers gain immediate user traffic, creators grow loyal audiences effortlessly, and users become not just spectators, but stakeholders in the success of viral content.”

Set to launch in Summer 2025, T-Rex's distribution layer and browser extension create the railroads linking popular online consumer applications such as gaming, music, interactive media, and Web3. From creators rewarding top users with digital assets, to new projects gaining instant discovery, to active users earning a stake, T-Rex's ecosystem is designed for intuitive use, cultural resonance, and economic empowerment at scale.

Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) short traders took a major hit on Thursday, sparking nearly $1 billion in crypto liquidations. The short squeeze was fueled by BTC and ETH crossing $100,000 and $2,100, respectively, following President Trump's announcement of the US and UK reaching a trade agreement.

The crypto market saw a quick rebound on Thursday, with the total market cap climbing to $3.3 trillion for the first time since early March. Bitcoin and Ethereum led the charge, gaining 6% and 20%, respectively, at publication time.

The rally triggered a wave of futures liquidations worth $964 million across the crypto market in the past 24 hours, with short liquidations accounting for $834 million, per Coinglass data. The value may be understated, considering Coinglass' aggregated liquidation data from exchanges delays a few hours.

Bitcoin accounted for $416 million in liquidations as the sudden price rebound caught short sellers off guard. The largest liquidated position occurred on Binance, wiping out a BTC/USDT trade worth $11.97 million.

The rise follows Bitcoin breaking past the $100,000 mark for the first time since February 4. Despite the increased bullish sentiment dominating the market, Bitcoin's march to $102,000 could have mixed implications for its price, according to an X post from on-chain analytical platform Santiment.

The post reveals that retail fear of missing out (FOMO) — sparked by media coverage of Bitcoin's milestone — could sustain the rally in the short term. However, similar crypto rallies in the past have been halted due to increased calls of "higher or above like we're seeing now," the analysts wrote.

On the other hand, Ethereum rallied above the $2,000 psychological level for the first time since early March, sparking $259 million in short liquidations.

According to Santiment, Ethereum showed an example of contrarian success, rebounding sharply after a wave of retail-driven FUD. The asset saw significant sell pressure following a negative price response to the Pectra upgrade, with many traders rotating into meme coins and urging others to do the same, noted Santiment analysts.

Despite the negativity, ETH surged past $2,100 for the first time in over six weeks, outperforming the top 10 cryptocurrencies. Santiment noted that the turnaround came as crowd sentiment hit heightened negative levels, a dynamic that has historically preceded strong price recoveries.

The crypto market rally began following President Donald Trump's announcement of a trade agreement with the United Kingdom (UK) to ease some of the tariffs imposed on British goods on Liberation Day.

Trump stated that the deal with the UK is the first among many, as talks are in advanced stages with other international trading partners.

KARACHI: The Institute of Cost and Management Accountants of Pakistan (ICMAP), through its Research and Publications Department, has unveiled a comprehensive policy proposal titled “ICMA Proposes Crypto Adoption Framework and CBDC Launch Plan to Government.”

This timely initiative introduces a Four-Pillar Framework for the responsible adoption of crypto currencies in Pakistan and outlines a strategic Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) Development and Regulatory Launch Plan. The proposal is intended for consideration by the Pakistan Crypto Council (PCC) and relevant policymakers, aiming to facilitate a secure and well-regulated digital financial ecosystem in the country.

In view of the rapidly evolving global landscape of digital finance and crypto investments, ICMAP's proposal serves as a much-needed foundation for Pakistan's policy direction. The Four-Pillar Framework focuses on key dimensions necessary for crypto integration, each supported by international case studies to guide implementation. 

The first pillar emphasizes the creation of a clear regulatory framework. It highlights the need for robust, transparent, and internationally aligned regulations to support the development of a safe crypto environment. This includes full compliance with Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Counter-Terrorism Financing (CFT) measures, as well as lessons from other jurisdictions that have effectively implemented such frameworks.

The second pillar advocates for alignment with global crypto and blockchain standards. ICMAP stresses that Pakistan must actively engage with international standard-setting bodies and adopt best practices to ensure credibility and innovation. This involves the appropriate classification of digital assets, setting up effective controls for digital asset transactions, and encouraging blockchain innovation. The case study provided shows how a country successfully built a compliant yet dynamic crypto ecosystem by closely working with global organizations.

The third pillar calls for active industry-government collaboration to encourage responsible innovation while maintaining financial stability. ICMAP highlights that close coordination between regulators and industry stakeholders is essential to strike a balance between enabling innovation and safeguarding the economy. The included case study illustrates how a country effectively fostered such cooperation, promoting growth while ensuring regulatory oversight.

The fourth and final pillar underlines the importance of consumer protection and financial stability. ICMAP recommends clear and enforceable measures to ensure that consumers are protected from abuse and that markets operate with integrity. A case study demonstrates how another country implemented robust consumer safeguards in the crypto sector, ensuring both user confidence and market stability.

Complementing the crypto framework, ICMAP has proposed a structured Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) Development and Regulatory Launch Plan. Recognizing the need for a state-backed digital alternative to crypto currencies, this plan recommends that the State Bank of Pakistan introduce a CBDC to enhance regulatory control, reduce volatility, and expand financial inclusion. A government-issued CBDC would provide a stable digital option that supports innovation without compromising monetary sovereignty.

The proposal also reflects on global investment trends, noting that crypto currencies have attracted investors due to their higher returns compared to traditional stock markets and real interest rates. As more countries increase their exposure to digital assets, ICMAP believes Pakistan must take strategic steps to prepare for the financial future. The document also provides valuable insights into global developments in CBDC implementation, drawing lessons from countries at the forefront of digital currency adoption.

Through this initiative, ICMAP reaffirms its role as a leading policy advisor and thought leader in Pakistan's financial landscape. The Institute remains committed to supporting policymakers in developing forward-looking, well-regulated frameworks that enable innovation, protect consumers, and preserve economic stability.

Among the conference abstracts deleted from a planetary science archive site recently is work involving chemistry measurements made by NASA's Mars Curiosity rover (pictured, on Mars). Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech/MSSS via Getty

Over the past several weeks, hundreds of meeting abstracts have quietly vanished from the websites of research conferences organized by the Lunar and Planetary Institute (LPI) in Houston, Texas — a NASA-funded research institution that maintains key archives and information about US planetary science. The abstracts have a common theme: diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI). These topics were banned from receiving government funding by a 20 January executive order from US President Donald Trump, who called them “illegal and immoral discrimination programs”. The LPI did not seek permission from the abstract authors to remove the material.

Many researchers are fuming about the deletions from the archives of a research institute that is managed independently from the federal government. “This is just egregious censorship of science,” says Ingrid Daubar, a planetary scientist at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island, who co-authored several of the deleted abstracts.

Many of the abstracts are pages-long developments of preliminary ideas that are important to the planetary-science literature. Their removals are an “Orwellian rewriting of history”, says a researcher who asked to remain anonymous because of the sensitivity of the situation. Mark Sykes, a senior scientist at the Planetary Science Institute in Tucson, Arizona, called the decision “a profound ethical failure”.

Several scientists told Nature that they think the LPI and its parent organization, the Universities Space Research Association (USRA) in Washington DC, have over-interpreted the Trump executive order as retroactively applying to independently performed work in public archives.

In a statement provided to Nature, the USRA said it “believes that compliance with Administration directives requires DEI content to be out of public view”, unless it is “advised by an authoritative federal body that we can restore that content”.

“Waiting for some ‘authoritative federal body' to tell them to undo the harm they've done is just deflecting accountability,” Daubar says. NASA declined to comment on the basis that it does not run the websites.

A group of researchers is now leading a data-rescue effort to locate and rehouse the deleted material on a privately run website.

Many federal agencies, including NASA, have removed DEI-related content from their websites in response to the executive order. But the LPI is not a government institution; it was set up in 1968, during the Apollo era, primarily to foster relationships between university scientists and NASA. For decades, it has organized planetary-science conferences, trained researchers and maintained documents and databases on topics such as lunar impact craters.

The missing meeting abstracts include research on workforce issues, such as how to build the most effective team of scientists for a mission. One of Daubar's deleted abstracts described a programme to involve early-career scientists in NASA's InSight mission to Mars. David Trang, a planetary scientist at the Space Science Institute who is based in Honolulu, Hawaii, had his work on improving mental health among planetary scientists deleted. Removing these abstracts “takes away our culture”, he says. “That's the saddest part.”

What do atoms do when we're not watching? It turns out they do exactly what we thought. 

Enigmatic because of their quantum nature—meaning that they behave as both particles and waves—atoms had never been visualized freely interacting with each other. Where an atom is and how fast it is moving through space cannot be determined simultaneously. Before, it had been possible to make out the shape and structure of entire clouds of atoms using probes, but the individual atoms within the cloud eluded observation. Now, a team of researchers from MIT have finally managed to capture their interactions for the first time. 

Led by physicist Martin Zwierlein, the team developed a technique that allowed them to freeze atoms in place and put them in the spotlight with lasers. They were able to successfully image bosons of a sodium isotope and fermions of a lithium isotope before these atoms scattered again. (Bosons—like the infamous Higgs Boson—have spins of integer values, while fermions—like electrons, protons, and neutrons—have odd half-integer spins.) Both isotopes were in the form of quantum gases.

Bosons were previously predicted to bunch together in a wave form, exhibiting the wave part of quantum behavior, while fermions were predicted to repel those like them and form pairs with different fermions, which illustrates particle behavior. The probability of finding bosons near each other is high, while there is a low chance of seeing fermions as close together, and the gases needed to be at ultracold temperatures to see anything at all (because atoms get the zoomies when agitated by heat).

“Imaging quantum gases in situ at the resolution of single atoms realizes the ultimate depth of information one may obtain in real space,” Zwierlein and his team said in a study recently published in Physical Review Letters.

Their new technique, known as non-resolved microscopy, involves using a laser beam to trap the atoms in one place. There, they are free to interact before they are exposed to a lattice of light that freezes them in place. The atoms are then illuminated with fluorescent light to expose where they are and what they are doing. There was some difficulty in lighting these atoms up, since too much heat would send them flying all over. As a result, this is the first time Zwierlein managed to freeze the motion of strongly interacting atoms in situ, and he was able to capture images of both bosons and fermions.

With bosons, the team formed a Bose-Einstein condensate, which is a boson gas cloud cooled to temperatures verging on absolute zero. The MIT team wanted to prove the existing prediction that bosons bunch together because of their high probability of being near each other and their ability to share the same quantum mechanical wave. Atoms in this type of wave show wave-like behavior as they keep changing in time and space, but the properties of those atoms are difficult to observe. The image of bosons shows atoms bunching together with wavelike trails of light behind them, indicating that they are moving in waves.

To image a fermion cloud, the team needed two types of fermions—they wanted to capture pairs, and fermions of only one type would end up repelling each other. Sure enough, fermions of the same type avoided each other, while opposite fermions attracted each other. 

Zwierlein plans to continue using non-resolved microscopy to understand more about the physical world and potentially image stranger, more exotic quantum phenomena.

“This kind of pairing is the basis of a mathematical construction people came up with to explain experiments. But when you see pictures like these, it's showing in a photograph, an object that was discovered in the mathematical world,” Richard Fletcher, a coauthor of the study and physicist from MIT, said in a recent press release. “So it's a very nice reminder that physics is about physical things. It's real.”

Linguists Find Proof of Sweeping Language Pattern Once Deemed a ‘Hoax'

Inuit languages really do have many words for snow, linguists found—and other languages have conceptual specialties, too, potentially revealing what a culture values

By Cody Cottier edited by Allison Parshall

In 1884 the anthropologist Franz Boas returned from Baffin Island with a discovery that would kick off decades of linguistic wrangling: by his count, the local Inuit language had four words for snow, suggesting a link between language and physical environment. A great game of telephone inflated the number until, in 1984, the New York Times published an editorial claiming the Inuit have “100 synonyms” for the frozen white stuff we lump under a single term.

Boas's observation had swelled to mythic proportions. In a 1991 essay, British linguist Geoff Pullum called these claims a “hoax,” citing the work of linguist Laura Martin, who tracked the misinformation's evolution. He likened it to the xenomorph from Alien, a creature that “seemed to spring up everywhere once it got loose on the spaceship, and was very difficult to kill.” His acerbic critique rendered the subject taboo for a generation, says Victor Mair, an expert on Chinese language at the University of Pennsylvania. But now, he says, “it's coming back in a legitimate way.”

In a sweeping new computational analysis of world languages, researchers not only confirmed the emphasis on snow in the Inuit language Inuktitut but also uncovered many similar patterns: what snow is to the Inuit, lava is to Samoans and oatmeal to Scots. The results were published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA in April. Charles Kemp, a computational psychologist at the University of Melbourne in Australia and senior author of the study, says the results offer a window onto language speakers' culture. “It's a way to get a sense of the ‘chief interests of a people'—what's important to a society, what they prioritize and value,” he says, quoting Boas.

The researchers analyzed bilingual dictionaries between English and more than 600 languages, looking for what they call “lexical elaboration,” in which a language has many words related to a core concept. It's the same phenomenon that fueled the Inuit debate. But this study brings a twist: rather than the number of words, it measured their proportion, the slice of dictionary real estate taken up by a concept. This produced elaboration scores for hundreds of concepts, from “abandonment” to “zoo,” based on how many times the English words for those concepts appeared in the definitions of foreign words. You can explore the results in this online module that shows which languages have the most words for each concept and which concepts have the most words in each language.

Ripley Cleghorn; Source: “A computational analysis of lexical elaboration across languages,” by Temuulen Khishigsuren et al., in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA, Vol. 122, No. 15; April 15, 2025

Often the elaboration is clearly a product of environment—small wonder that Arabic, Farsi and Indigenous Australian languages abound with words to describe the desert, and Sanskrit, Tamil and Thai with words for elephants. Other cases aren't so straightforward. Many Oceanic languages, for example, have highly specific words for smell. In Marshallese, meļļā means “smell of blood” and jatbo means “smell of damp clothing.” This may be explained by the humidity of the rainforest, which amplifies scents. But why is the concept of rapture so prominent in Portuguese and agony in Hindi? What historical and cultural circumstances lead a language down such obscure paths? “I'm not sure if anybody knows,” Kemp says.

Mair says this research, which he highlighted on the popular linguistics blog Language Log, helps resurrect the much-maligned idea of linguistic relativity, sometimes known as the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis. At its boldest, linguistic relativity asserts that language determines how we perceive things, causing speakers of different languages to experience the world in radically different ways (think of the movie Arrival, in which a character becomes clairvoyant after learning an alien language). But in Mair's opinion, this study supports a softer claim: our brains all share the same basic machinery for perceiving the world, which language can subtly affect but not restrict. “It doesn't determine,” he says. “It influences.”

Similarly, Lynne Murphy, a linguist at the University of Sussex in England, who was not involved in this study, notes that “any language should be able to talk about anything.” We may not have the Marshallese word jatbo, but four words of English do the trick—“smell of damp clothing.” It's not that having many precise words for smell reveals mind-blowing cognitive abilities for processing smell; it's simply that single words are more efficient than phrases, so they tend to represent common subjects of discussion, highlighting areas of cultural significance. If we routinely needed to talk about the smell of damp clothing, we'd whittle that unwieldy phrase down to something like jatbo.

Still, “lexical elaboration alone cannot tell us about the culture of its speakers,” at least not with certainty, says study lead author Temuulen Khishigsuren, a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Melbourne. And because this analysis was based on dictionaries, it comes with the biases and limitations of the lexicographers that wrote them. As Murphy puts it, they “offer only snapshots of a language at a particular time, from a particular angle.” Some of the dictionaries used are decades or centuries old, and they may reflect the archaic concerns of colonizers—to translate the Bible or establish a trade route—as much as those of modern-day speakers. Dictionaries of vast written languages like German or Sanskrit are much larger than those for languages that are exclusively spoken and are loaded with esoteric terminology.

Because dictionaries don't represent how people use language in the real world, the next step would be to measure how often people actually talk or write about the concepts being studied, such as snow and smells and elephants. This is difficult for languages without large bodies of written text but could be possible for many languages, especially those used heavily on social media.

It bears remembering that these lexical elaborations come from comparison between languages—French only has “many” words for futility because other languages have fewer. And because all the bilingual dictionaries in this study map back to English—it's the language into which everything else gets translated—the analysis is influenced by the words used in English itself. If we find the patterns of elaboration in other languages unusual, it's safe to assume their speakers will return the favor. “English is as ‘different' as any other language,” Murphy says, which raises the question: “If we had started from, say, Spanish or Chinese or Malayalam, which concepts would have stood out for English?”

Most proteins imported into peroxisomes use a carboxy-terminal PTS1 signal, which is recognized by soluble receptors that transport the cargo through a nuclear pore-like conduit in the peroxisomal membrane formed by the tyrosine and glycine-rich YG domain of PEX13. The receptors then return to the cytosol through a separate retrotranslocon. Some peroxisomal proteins instead use an amino-terminal PTS2 signal that is recognized by an adaptor called PEX7, but how they are imported is poorly understood. Here we show that PTS2 cargo is moved through the YG phase by PEX7 bound to a receptor. After cargo release inside peroxisomes, PEX7 returns to the cytosol by moving back on its own through the YG phase. The chaperone PEX39 then extracts PEX7 from the phase on the cytosolic side and helps to reload PEX7 with a new receptor and cargo to start another import cycle. Our results provide a comprehensive model of PTS2 protein import.

Peroxisomes are conserved organelles essential for human health. They consist of a single membrane enclosing a luminal matrix1 and play crucial metabolic roles that include fatty-acid β-oxidation and ether-lipid biosynthesis2. Peroxisomal matrix proteins are made in the cytosol and then imported, remarkably, in a folded state and even as oligomers or preformed complexes3, in contrast to the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria that can only import unfolded polypeptides4,5.

Most peroxisomal matrix proteins contain a type 1 peroxisomal targeting signal (PTS1) that is located at their carboxy (C) terminus and comprises the amino-acid sequence SKL (or variants thereof)6. Some matrix proteins, however, use the more complex PTS2 signal located at their amino (N) terminus7. PTS2 proteins include the enzyme thiolase required for peroxisomal β-oxidation in nearly all eukaryotes8 as well as enzymes that detoxify branched-chain fatty acids and produce ether-lipid precursors essential for myelination2. Defective PTS2 protein import in humans causes Refsum disease9 and the life-threatening disorder rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctata10.

The import mechanism of PTS1 proteins is reasonably well understood11. Their PTS1 signal is recognized in the cytosol by the tetratricopeptide-repeat (TPR) domain of PEX5 (ref. 12) and related soluble receptors13,14. PEX5 then transports the cargo completely across the peroxisomal membrane15,16 through a conduit formed by the tyrosine and glycine-rich YG repeats of the PEX13 membrane protein17,18. The conduit resembles the selective phase formed by the phenylalanine and glycine-rich nucleoporin FG repeats in nuclear pores19 and can be reconstituted in vitro as a hydrogel into which PEX5 can drag folded cargo17. Passage through the phase requires conserved motifs in PEX5 comprising the amino-acid sequence WXXXF/Y (where ‘X' denotes any residue)17. PEX5 returns to the cytosol through a separate channel formed by a membrane-embedded ubiquitin ligase complex20. The receptor's flexible N terminus inserts into this retrotranslocon and gets mono-ubiquitinated on a conserved cysteine; ubiquitinated PEX5 is then pulled out of the organelle by a cytosolic AAA ATPase21. Pulling unfolds the TPR domain and thereby strips off the cargo15. In the cytosol, PEX5 is deubiquitinated22,23 and presumably also refolds before starting another import cycle.

PTS2 protein import is by contrast poorly understood. The PTS2 signal is recognized by an adaptor called PEX7 that anchors the cargo to a compatible receptor24. In humans and other animals, the receptor is a specific splice variant of PEX5 called the long isoform (PEX5L); a shorter isoform (PEX5S) lacks the PEX7-binding region25,26. In yeast, PEX7 associates instead with specialized receptors such as PEX18 and PEX21 that resemble PEX5L but lack a TPR domain27. PEX7 shuttles the bound cargo and receptor completely across the peroxisomal membrane28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35. The mechanism, however, remains to be established because PEX7 lacks the WXXXF/Y motifs required for traversing the YG phase; whether the receptors facilitate translocation or simply stabilize the interaction with cargo is not clear. How PEX7 returns from the matrix to the cytosol is also unknown. PEX7 consists of WD40 repeats that form a seven-bladed β-propeller24 and has neither a flexible N terminus for insertion into the retrotranslocon nor a conserved cysteine for mono-ubiquitination. PEX7 therefore cannot be recycled like PEX5 and other receptors.

To understand how PTS2 proteins are brought into peroxisomes, we reconstituted the process using a cytoplasmic extract from the eggs of the frog Xenopus laevis. As shown previously15,36,37, this cell-free system recapitulates the import of PTS1 cargo such as green fluorescent protein (GFP) fused to an SKL sequence: over time the cargo accumulates inside peroxisomes that then become visible as bright puncta under a microscope (Fig. 1a). To adapt this system for PTS2 cargo, we fused GFP to the import signal from different Xenopus PTS2 proteins (Extended Data Fig. 1a; purity of all recombinant proteins in Extended Data Fig. 1b). Each PTS2 cargo formed puncta in the extract (Extended Data Fig. 1a), demonstrating a functional PTS2 import pathway. The puncta were dimmer than those formed by PTS1 cargo, suggesting that PTS2 import is less efficient. As expected, PTS2 import was abolished following depletion of PEX5 from the extract (Extended Data Fig. 1a) and could be restored with purified recombinant PEX5L, the long isoform that can bind to PEX7 (schematic of the PEX5 variants used in Fig. 1b) but not with the short isoform PEX5S that cannot bind (Extended Data Fig. 1a). Either isoform could restore PTS1 import (Extended Data Fig. 1a). The PTS2 puncta result from multiple import cycles because they were not visible with a PEX5 mutant lacking the conserved cysteine (C11A), which cannot be mono-ubiquitinated and recycled (Extended Data Fig. 1a). Notably, both PTS2 and PTS1 import was abolished by a PEX5 mutant lacking the WXXXF/Y motifs (∆WF) that enable translocation through the YG phase (Extended Data Fig. 1a).

a, Xenopus egg extract was incubated with fluorescent cargo, mounted on a slide and imaged using a spinning-disk confocal microscope. Cargo consisted of GFP fused to the PTS1 signal SKL or the PTS2 signal from the yeast peroxisomal thiolase POT1 (residues 1–27). Repeated rounds of cargo import into peroxisomes produce bright puncta. Created with BioRender.com. b, Schematic of the PEX5 variants used. Numbers refer to residues in Xenopus PEX5L. Black bar, position of the conserved cysteine (C); white bars, locations of WXXXF/Y motifs; yellow box, PEX7-binding region. PEX5S lacks most of the PEX7-binding region, whereas in PEX5-21 the region was replaced by the homologous region from the yeast PTS2 receptor PEX21. c, Extract was depleted of endogenous PEX5 using beads conjugated to the PEX5-binding domain from PEX14 and then supplemented with or without purified recombinant yeast PEX7 and the indicated purified recombinant PEX5 variants (described in b). Import was assessed using the fluorescent PTS1 and PTS2 cargos described in a. d, As in c except using the PEX5 variants shown. Scale bars, 5 µm.

We next assessed the importance of PEX7. Because frog PEX7 was unstable when produced recombinantly, we instead used yeast PEX7 and cargo consisting of GFP fused to the PTS2 signal from the yeast peroxisomal thiolase POT1 (Fig. 1a). Yeast PEX7 together with PEX5L (but not PEX5S) could restore import of the PTS2 cargo in PEX5-depleted extract (Fig. 1c), albeit inefficiently, probably reflecting the relatively weak interaction between PEX5L and yeast PEX7 (Extended Data Fig. 2a). To improve the affinity of the receptor for yeast PEX7, we replaced the PEX7-binding region in PEX5L with the homologous region from the yeast PTS2 receptor PEX21 (Fig. 1b). The resulting chimaeric receptor, PEX5-21, bound to yeast PEX7 more strongly (Extended Data Fig. 2a) and boosted import of the PTS2 cargo (Fig. 1d). Both the receptor and yeast PEX7 were necessary for import (Fig. 1d). The import rate of the PTS2 cargo was notably slower than that of PTS1 cargo (Extended Data Fig. 2b). A receptor mutant lacking the TPR domain could still bind to PEX7 and PTS2 cargo as expected (Extended Data Fig. 2c) as well as import the cargo into peroxisomes in egg extract (Fig. 1d). Importantly, PTS2 import by either PEX5L or PEX5-21 again depended on the WXXXF/Y motifs of the receptor (Fig. 1c,d), providing support for the hypothesis that PTS2 proteins are moved into peroxisomes through the YG conduit.

To test whether PTS2 proteins are shuttled through the YG phase, we reconstituted the phase as a hydrogel using a recombinant fragment of PEX13 comprising the YG domain and upstream unstructured region (Extended Data Fig. 3a). As shown previously17, entry of fluorescently labelled proteins into the phase can be visualized under a microscope as a bright zone expanding inwards from the gel edge (Fig. 2a). Consistent with the egg extract experiments, PTS2 cargo accumulated in the YG hydrogel in the presence of PEX7 and the long receptor isoform PEX5L, whereas no entry was observed with either component alone or with the short isoform (Fig. 2a). By contrast, either isoform could drag PTS1 cargo into the gel independently of PEX7 (Fig. 2a), as expected. PTS2 entry was enhanced by the chimaeric receptor PEX5-21, consistent with its increased affinity for PEX7, whereas the efficiency of PTS1 entry remained unchanged (Fig. 2b). PTS2 entry also did not depend on the receptor's TPR domain, whereas PTS1 entry did (Fig. 2b). Thus, PTS2 proteins are probably translocated into peroxisomes through the YG phase, and PEX5 and PEX7 are both critical for this process. Interestingly, PTS2 cargo was dragged through the YG hydrogel more slowly than PTS1 cargo (Fig. 2c), in agreement with the slower rate of PTS2 import measured in egg extract. In addition, the entry of PTS2 cargo into the gel was not greatly affected by ablation of the receptor's WXXXF/Y motifs (Fig. 2d), which are otherwise essential for moving PTS1 cargo through the YG phase17. The PTS2–cargo complex therefore probably interacts with the YG phase not just through the receptor.

a, YG hydrogels were incubated with the fluorescent cargo shown (described in Fig. 1a) with or without purified recombinant yeast PEX7 and the indicated recombinant PEX5 variants (described in Fig. 1b).

A possible additional interaction of the PTS2–cargo complex with the YG phase is suggested by the reported binding of PEX7 to the unstructured region of PEX13 preceding the YG domain38. We identified within this region a conserved motif characterized by the amino-acid sequence KPWE (Fig. 3a). Beads conjugated to a synthetic peptide containing this motif could recruit yeast PEX7 fused at the C terminus to GFP (PEX7–GFP), whereas a peptide with the motif scrambled could not (Fig. 3b). PEX7–GFP was also recruited to beads conjugated to a polypeptide encompassing the entire unstructured region and YG domain but only when the KPWE motif was intact (Extended Data Fig. 3b). The KPWE motif thus directly binds to PEX7 and is the only PEX7-binding site within the region of PEX13 that forms the YG phase.

AlphaFold predicts that the KPWE motif binds specifically to the bottom of the PEX7 β-propeller (Fig. 3c and Extended Data Fig. 4 for the associated pLDDT confidence scores of all AlphaFold models). The interface is highly conserved (Fig. 3d) and shows that each of the amino acids comprising the KPWE motif engages in a unique interaction with PEX7: the lysine projects into the acidic core of the β-propeller, the proline is nestled in a hydrophobic pocket, the tryptophan is sandwiched between the aliphatic stem of a conserved lysine in PEX7 and the lysine from the KPWE motif, and the glutamate forms polar contacts with a conserved arginine in PEX7 (Extended Data Fig. 5). The interaction with the KPWE motif notably occurs on the side of the PEX7 β-propeller opposite to where the PTS2 signal and import receptors bind (Fig. 3e). The two interfaces are indeed independent, as beads conjugated to the KPWE peptide could recruit PTS2–GFP only when PEX7 and the receptor were both present (Extended Data Fig. 6a). No binding was seen in the absence of PEX7 or with beads harbouring the scrambled peptide. These results imply that PEX7 might enter the YG phase either by binding directly to the KPWE motif or by piggybacking on an import receptor in the presence of cargo.

Direct entry of PEX7 into the YG phase could be demonstrated with the hydrogel system. Using hydrogels prepared from a recombinant fragment of PEX13 consisting of the wild-type unstructured region and YG domain (Fig. 3f), we observed that PEX7–GFP readily entered the phase, whereas GFP alone did not (Fig. 3g). Ablation of the KPWE motif did not affect gelation (Fig. 3f) but it precluded the entry of PEX7–GFP (Fig. 3g). By contrast, PEX5 fused at the C terminus to GFP (PEX5–GFP) accumulated equally well in either wild-type or mutant hydrogels (Fig. 3g). Thus, PEX7 interacts with the YG phase through the KPWE motif instead of through the YG repeats to which import receptors bind.

We next examined how PEX7 interacts with the YG phase when bound to a receptor and cargo. We prepared a complex between PEX7–GFP and the chimaeric receptor PEX5-21 in the presence of a synthetic peptide comprising the PTS2 signal. Formation of the complex was verified using beads coated with the receptor, which could recruit PEX7–GFP only in the presence of the PTS2 peptide (Extended Data Fig. 6b). The complex could partition into the YG hydrogel even when the KPWE motif was absent (Fig. 3g), revealing that the receptor is sufficient to drag PEX7 and cargo into the YG phase. This result was recapitulated using a complex consisting of PEX7 bound to the receptor and PTS2–GFP cargo, which readily entered the gel regardless of the KPWE motif (Fig. 3g).

Together, the hydrogel experiments demonstrate that PEX7 and import receptors can partition into the YG phase independently of each other. When both components assemble with cargo into a complex, each of these interactions may be utilized to move the cargo through the phase into peroxisomes. Interestingly, PEX5–GFP permeated further into the wild-type hydrogel than either PEX7–GFP alone or PEX7–GFP in the cargo complex (Fig. 3g). Thus, PEX7 seems to traverse the YG phase more slowly, consistent with PTS2 cargo being moved through the phase slower than PTS1 cargo (Fig. 2c). Efficient translocation into peroxisomes might therefore primarily be driven by the receptor.

We wondered whether the interaction between PEX7 and the KPWE motif allows PEX7 to return to the cytosol after PEX7 has dissociated from the receptor and cargo inside the matrix. To test this hypothesis, we ablated the KPWE motif in PEX13 in yeast and investigated whether PEX7 would accumulate in peroxisomes. To enable detection of PEX7 by immunoblotting, we introduced a single FLAG tag at the C terminus of the protein (Extended Data Fig. 7a). The tagged form was expressed from the endogenous locus and was fully functional, as assessed in cells expressing fluorescently labelled PTS1 and PTS2 matrix proteins (Extended Data Fig. 7b). The corresponding strains were cultured in oleic acid to induce peroxisomes and the cells subsequently fractionated into a peroxisome-containing membrane pellet (Fig. 4a). PEX7–FLAG was indeed considerably enriched in the membrane fraction in the absence of the KPWE motif (Fig. 4b and Extended Data Fig. 7c). Given that PEX7 completely enters the peroxisomal matrix during import28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35, this observation suggests that PEX7 cannot return to the cytosol when its interaction with the YG phase is disrupted. Consistent with this assumption, PEX7–FLAG accumulation was abolished after deletion of the two yeast PTS2 receptors PEX18 and PEX21 (Fig. 4c). By contrast, deletion of the two PTS1 receptors PEX5 and PEX9 had only a small effect (Fig. 4c). All receptor-pair knockouts correctly precluded import of their respective cargo (Extended Data Fig. 7d).

a, PEX7 fused at the C terminus to a FLAG epitope tag (PEX7–FLAG) was expressed in yeast strains containing different PEX13 mutants. The cells were cultured in oleic acid to induce peroxisomes, lysed and then separated into a peroxisome-containing membrane fraction. PEX7–FLAG was immunoprecipitated (IP) from the lysate and the detergent-solubilized membranes, resolved by SDS–PAGE and detected by immunoblotting for the FLAG epitope. b, PEX7–FLAG was analysed as in a for cells lacking PEX13 (−), or cells containing either wild-type PEX13 (WT) or a PEX13 mutant lacking residues 2–13 (∆2–13) that encompass the KPWE motif, as shown (top).

Total lysates from cells expressing PEX7–FLAG with or without the riboswitch were analysed by immunoblotting as in a (bottom). e, Peroxisomes were induced in cells expressing PEX7 (with or without the riboswitch as indicated) as well as either wild-type PEX13 or PEX13 lacking the KPWE motif (∆2–13).

Experiments in Xenopus egg extract confirmed that PEX7–GFP enters peroxisomes only when it is assembled into a complex with PEX5 and cargo (Extended Data Fig. 7e). Interestingly, PEX7–GFP puncta were considerably brighter than those formed by PEX5–GFP (Extended Data Fig. 7e), consistent with the hypothesis that the two proteins are not recycled together. This conclusion agrees with a previous study35 showing that PEX7 is recycled more slowly than PEX5. Together, our results suggest that PEX7 enters peroxisomes along with cargo by piggybacking on an import receptor; PEX7 then returns to the cytosol by binding to the KPWE motif of PEX13 and thereby partitioning back into the YG phase from inside the matrix.

The proposed model implies that KPWE-motif deletion should inhibit PTS2 import because PEX7 should no longer be recycled. Surprisingly, however, cells lacking the KPWE motif showed no obvious PTS2 import defect (Extended Data Fig. 7d). We reasoned that in our assay, PEX7 might be sufficiently abundant to mask a recycling phenotype. We therefore inserted a tetracycline-responsive riboswitch39 upstream of the PEX7 open reading frame to reduce translation of the corresponding PEX7 messenger RNA. This strategy decreased the abundance of PEX7 by about an order of magnitude (Fig. 4d). Under these conditions, PTS2 import was still normal in cells that retained the KPWE motif, whereas cells that lacked the KPWE motif now had a pronounced import defect specific to PTS2 proteins (Fig. 4e). These results confirm the proposed role of the KPWE motif in PEX7 recycling and further demonstrate that PEX7 recycling is essential for protein import when PEX7 becomes limiting in cells.

Given the favourable interaction between PEX7 and the YG phase, we next investigated how PEX7 would be extracted from the phase and returned to the cytosol to start another import cycle. A possible mechanism was suggested by large-scale protein-interaction studies in yeast40,41 and mammalian cells42,43,44, which had identified an uncharacterized binding partner of PEX7 in the cytosol that has recently been named PEX39 (ref. 45). The protein is conserved throughout eukaryotes and contains an amino-acid sequence (RPWE in yeast) that resembles the KPWE motif of PEX13 (Fig. 5a). PEX39 also has a conserved amphipathic helix (APH) near its N terminus (Fig. 5a). AlphaFold predicts that PEX39 can bind to PEX7 using both of these features: the RPWE motif binds to the same site as the analogous motif of PEX13 and the APH binds to the opposite side, where the PTS2 signal and import receptors are recruited (Fig. 5b). Both interaction surfaces on PEX7 are conserved in addition to a groove that cradles the linker between the RPWE motif and the APH (Extended Data Fig. 8).

Scale bar, 100 µm. d, Glutathione-conjugated beads were incubated with 1 µM yeast PEX7 and varying concentrations of the indicated GST-tagged forms of yeast PEX39. The beads and any bound protein were sedimented after 1 h. Each supernatant fraction was resolved by SDS–PAGE and stained with Coomassie blue (representative images of the gels in Extended Data Fig. 9b). PEX7 remaining in the supernatant was quantified and used to calculate the bound fraction, which was plotted as a function of the PEX39 concentration. Lines represent fits, generated by least-squares regression, to the data from three independent experiments; the corresponding observed binding constants (Kobs) are indicated (right; mean ± s.e.m.).

The predicted interactions were validated by showing that beads coated with PEX7 could recruit PEX39 fused at the C terminus to GFP (PEX39–GFP; Extended Data Fig. 9a). Conversely, beads coated with PEX39 could recruit PEX7–GFP and the recruitment required the RPWE motif (Fig. 5c). Mutations in the APH resulted in marginally reduced binding. These results were quantitatively confirmed by incubating PEX7 with varying concentrations of PEX39 immobilized on beads (Extended Data Fig. 9b). Measurements of the amount of PEX7 remaining in solution revealed similar binding constants for wild-type PEX39 and the mutant lacking the APH, whereas the mutant lacking the RPWE motif bound considerably weaker (Fig. 5d). No binding was measurable in the absence of both the RPWE motif and the APH. Thus, PEX39 can directly bind to PEX7, with the RPWE motif driving the interaction.

Because PEX39 and PEX13 can each bind to PEX7 using similar motifs, we investigated whether PEX39 could extract PEX7 from the YG phase. We tested this hypothesis by preloading YG hydrogels with PEX7–GFP, then spiking the buffer with increasing concentrations of PEX39 and following the PEX7–GFP fluorescence in the gel over time (Fig. 6a). Addition of PEX39 rapidly depleted PEX7–GFP from the hydrogel in a dose-dependent manner, whereas PEX7–GFP continued to accumulate in the gel in the absence of PEX39 (Fig. 6b). The extraction of PEX7–GFP was abolished by mutating the RPWE motif in PEX39 (Fig. 6c), whereas mutating the APH had a much smaller effect, consistent with our binding experiments. Ablation of both motifs had no additional effect. PEX39 was notably unable to extract PEX5–GFP from the hydrogel (Fig. 6d). These results thus support the hypothesis that PEX39 can extract PEX7 from the YG phase during recycling, when PEX7 would no longer be bound to cargo and an import receptor.

The proposed role of PEX39 in PEX7 recycling implies that PEX39 should not extract PEX7 from the YG phase during translocation into peroxisomes when PEX7 would be loaded with cargo and an import receptor. PEX39 was indeed unable to efficiently extract PEX7–GFP from YG hydrogels in the presence of a PTS2 peptide and the chimaeric receptor PEX5-21, even when PEX39 and the receptor were both present in excess molar ratios relative to PEX7–GFP (Fig. 6e). By contrast, PEX7–GFP was readily extracted by PEX39 in the presence of the short receptor isoform PEX5S that cannot bind to PEX7 (Fig. 6e). Thus, PEX39 does not interfere with the translocation of the fully assembled PEX7–receptor–cargo complex into peroxisomes.

To confirm this conclusion, we monitored the influx of PEX7–GFP into the hydrogel in the presence of PEX39 (Fig. 6f). As expected, PEX39 blocked the influx of PEX7–GFP alone as well as PEX7–GFP in the presence of a PTS2 peptide and PEX5S (Fig. 6g). By contrast, PEX39 was much less inhibitory when PEX7–GFP was assembled into a complex with the PTS2 peptide and the chimaeric receptor PEX5-21 (Fig. 6g). Some inhibition was observed at high PEX39 concentrations, suggesting that PEX39 cannot be too abundant in vivo; PEX39 is indeed a few-fold less abundant than PEX7 in yeast (Extended Data Fig. 9c). Consistent with the hydrogel release experiments, PEX39 did not prevent the influx of PEX5–GFP (Fig. 6h), and the observed inhibition of PEX7–GFP influx depended on the RPWE motif and much less on the APH (Fig. 6i). PEX39–GFP did not by itself enter the YG hydrogel (Extended Data Fig. 9d) and was not imported into peroxisomes in Xenopus egg extract (Extended Data Fig. 7e).

Together, our results lead to a model in which import receptors move cargo-loaded PEX7 through the YG conduit into peroxisomes. After dissociating from the receptor and cargo inside the matrix, PEX7 moves back on its own through the YG conduit and is extracted out of the YG phase into the cytosol by PEX39.

To start another round of translocation, PEX7 has to be reloaded with cargo and a new receptor molecule. AlphaFold predicts that the APH of PEX39 can stabilize the interaction between PEX7 and the PTS2 signal (Fig. 7a), suggesting that PEX39 might promote cargo binding. PTS2–GFP cargo was indeed recruited to PEX7-coated beads in the presence of PEX39 (Fig. 7b) and conversely, PTS2–GFP was recruited to PEX39-coated beads in the presence of PEX7 (Fig. 7c). The cargo did not bind to either component alone. APH mutation abolished cargo binding to the PEX39–PEX7 complex (Fig. 7b,c), consistent with the APH stabilizing the interaction with the PTS2 signal. Notably, cargo binding was also reduced following mutation of the RPWE motif, as expected from the role of the motif in driving the interaction with PEX7. Thus, PEX39 not only extracts PEX7 from the YG phase but also enables PEX7 to rebind to cargo (Fig. 7e).

a, AlphaFold models of the complex between yeast PEX7 and the region of yeast PEX39 that includes the APH and RPWE motif, with and without a PTS2 signal and the yeast PTS2 receptor PEX21. Note that PEX7 alone binds to both the APH and RPWE motif (top). The APH additionally stabilizes the interaction with the PTS2 signal (middle), whereas binding of the receptor displaces the APH (bottom). The RPWE motif remains bound in all cases. b, Glutathione-conjugated beads were incubated overnight with 5 µM GST-tagged yeast PEX7 (GST–PEX7) and 1 µM GFP fused at the N terminus to the PTS2 signal from yeast POT1 (PTS2–GFP). Where indicated, reactions included 5 µM wild-type (WT) yeast PEX39 or a mutant whose conserved hydrophobic residues in the APH were converted to alanine (∆APH). Recruitment of PTS2–GFP to the beads was visualized on a spinning-disk confocal microscope. c, As in b using GST-tagged wild-type yeast PEX39 (GST–PEX39) or the indicated GST-tagged mutants and yeast PEX7 at 5 µM. d, As in c with the additional presence of the chimaeric receptor PEX5-21 (5 µM). Contrast was adjusted as in b. e, Proposed steps for reloading of PEX7 with receptor and cargo. Scale bars, 100 µm.

Dissociation of PEX39 would have to occur in two steps. First, an import receptor would displace the APH of PEX39, as predicted by AlphaFold (Fig. 7a). The prediction is supported by experiments in which a complex between PEX7, the chimaeric receptor PEX5-21 and PTS2–GFP cargo could be recruited to beads coated with wild-type PEX39 (Fig. 7d). Recruitment was abolished by mutation of the PEX39 RPWE motif and completely unaffected by mutation of the APH (Fig. 7d). Thus, after receptor binding, PEX39 only interacts with PEX7 through its RPWE motif (Fig. 7e).

Finally, complete dissociation of PEX39 would occur following re-entry of the PEX7–receptor–cargo complex into the YG conduit, where the KPWE motif of PEX13 would displace the RPWE motif of PEX39. The PEX7–receptor–cargo complex was indeed no longer efficiently recruited to PEX39-coated beads in the presence of the KPWE peptide, whereas the scrambled peptide had no effect (Fig. 8a). Furthermore, the KPWE peptide could strip off PEX7 from PEX39 lacking the APH, whereas the scrambled peptide could not (Fig. 8b). Together, our results reveal that PEX39 not only extracts PEX7 from the YG conduit but also allows PEX7 to rebind to cargo. The subsequent recruitment of an import receptor partially displaces PEX39 and allows the cargo complex to partition back into the YG conduit. As the receptor drags the complex into the YG phase, the presence of multiple KPWE motifs of PEX13 effectively displaces the RPWE motif of PEX39, thereby releasing PEX39 into the cytosol (Fig. 7e).

a, Glutathione-conjugated beads were incubated overnight with 5 µM GST-tagged wild-type yeast PEX39 or the indicated mutants in the presence of 5 µM PEX5-21 and yeast PEX7 as well as 1 µM PTS2–GFP.

Using a combination of in vitro reconstituted systems and experiments in vivo, we have determined the mechanism by which PTS2 matrix proteins are imported into peroxisomes (Fig. 8c). Translocation is initiated by the assembly of PTS2 cargo into a complex with PEX7 and an import receptor in the cytosol (step 1). The receptor can either be the long isoform of PEX5 in higher organisms or one of its paralogues such as PEX18 or PEX21 in yeast. The cargo complex then partitions into a conduit that consists of a selective phase formed from the YG domain and the preceding unstructured region of PEX13 (step 2). Translocation through the phase is mediated by interactions between the WXXXF/Y motifs of the receptor and the YG repeats of PEX13 as well as by the interaction between PEX7 and the KPWE motif of PEX13. These interactions allow the cargo complex to move across the membrane into the organelle (step 3). Receptor recycling is initiated by the insertion of the receptor's flexible N terminus into the pore of the PEX2–PEX10–PEX12 ubiquitin ligase complex from within the matrix (step 4). Mono-ubiquitination of the receptor's N-terminal cysteine then recruits the PEX1–PEX6 ATPase, which pulls the receptor through the ligase pore and causes the cargo as well as PEX7 to be stripped off and left behind inside the matrix (step 5). After being released from the receptor, PEX7 repartitions into the YG phase via the interaction with the KPWE motif and thereby diffuses back across the membrane (step 6). PEX7 is extracted out of the phase on the cytosolic side by PEX39 (step 7), which can then facilitate the reloading of PEX7 with cargo and a new receptor molecule to start another import cycle (step 8). The subsequent re-entry of the cargo complex into the YG conduit releases PEX39 and leaves it behind in the cytosol.

During translocation into peroxisomes, both PEX7 and import receptors can interact with the YG phase independently of each other and probably cooperate to move cargo through the import conduit. However, receptors move through YG hydrogels faster than PEX7, suggesting that translocation is predominantly driven by the receptors. PEX7 instead seems to strengthen the interaction of the cargo complex with the YG phase, causing the PTS2–cargo complex to move through the phase more slowly. This observation probably explains why PTS2 import in Xenopus egg extract is slower than import of PTS1 cargo, which has also been reported in plants46.

Because diffusion through the YG phase is non-directional, translocation must be biased towards the peroxisomal matrix. Directionality is exclusively imposed by the receptors, which can bind with high affinity to the luminal domain of PEX14 (a membrane protein closely associated with PEX13) using their WXXXF/Y motifs47. This interaction would attract the cargo complex into the matrix and would explain why the WXXXF/Y motifs of the receptors are essential for PTS2 import in Xenopus egg extract but not for permeation of the PTS2–cargo complex through the YG hydrogel. This model also agrees with the observation that the recombinant luminal domain of PEX14 blocks PTS2 import in rat-liver extract35. Translocation could additionally be driven inwards if import were coupled to receptor export48. The N terminus of the receptor could insert into the pore of the ubiquitin ligase complex and recruit the PEX1–PEX6 ATPase before the remainder of the cargo complex has moved through the import conduit; the ATPase would then pull the receptor together with bound PEX7 and cargo through the YG phase into the organelle, as suggested previously49. Although this mechanism might not be needed for import in every case35,50, it might expedite the translocation of bulkier or more YG-phobic cargo whose passage through the YG phase might be unfavourable. Regardless of the mechanism, the biased movement of the receptors would result in import of both PTS1 and PTS2 cargo, and would also explain how PEX7 enters the matrix.

Our work reveals that import receptors and PEX7 return to the cytosol by distinct mechanisms. Import receptors are actively pulled out through a retrotranslocon (the ubiquitin ligase complex) by a process powered by nucleotide hydrolysis21. By contrast, PEX7 recycling is driven solely by protein interactions with the YG phase and PEX39. The existence of separate recycling pathways is supported by experiments in rat-liver extract, which have shown that PEX7 returns to the cytosol slower than import receptors35; this difference is likely to reflect the slow permeation of PEX7 through the YG phase revealed by our hydrogel system. Nonetheless, PEX7 recycling depends on the extraction of the receptor from the organelle35,51, consistent with our model that PEX7 must be stripped from the receptor before re-entering the YG conduit.

The role of PEX39 as a chaperone for PEX7 is supported by a recent preprint45. Although this study did not investigate PEX39 in the context of PEX7 recycling, it likewise reports that PEX39 functions in PTS2 import, stabilizes the interaction between PEX7 and cargo, and binds to PEX7 more strongly than PEX13. These observations are in accord with our model in which PEX39 extracts PEX7 from the YG phase and then enables PEX7 to rebind to cargo and re-enter the phase during the next import cycle. Our model implies that PEX39 functions near the membrane, which is consistent with the observation that the PEX39 homologue in plants is fused to the cytosolic C terminus of the PEX14 membrane protein45. The authors additionally report that PTS2 import is attenuated by both downregulation and overexpression of PEX39, which is again consistent with our model: some PEX39 is required to recycle PEX7 but excess PEX39 would prevent PEX7 from binding to cargo and receptors, and would also inhibit the entry of the cargo complex into the YG phase. PEX39 does not need to be very abundant because PEX7 recycling is required only when PEX7 becomes limiting; a basal recycling rate coupled with new protein synthesis is probably sufficient to maintain a stable cytosolic pool of PEX7 under physiological conditions. Recycling might be critical under disease conditions where PEX7 expression is attenuated by hypomorphic alleles or destabilizing mutations. Boosting this recycling pathway might be an attractive therapeutic strategy to restore PTS2 import in such contexts.

The bidirectional translocation of PEX7 through the YG phase resembles the passage of nuclear transport receptors into and out of the nucleus through nuclear pores. In fact, PEX7 is uncannily similar to the mRNA-export factor GLE2 (also known as RAE1 in mammals). Both proteins consist of WD40 repeats24,52 and bind to short linear motifs in phase-forming polypeptides: PEX7 to the KPWE sequence in the unstructured region of PEX13 and GLE2 to the GLE2-binding sequence (GLEBS) in the unstructured FG nucleoporin NUP116 (also known as NUP98 in mammals)53. Akin to nuclear transport receptors and their intrinsic affinity for the nucleoporin FG phase19, PEX7 also seems to have weak affinity for the peroxisomal YG phase because some entry of PEX7 into YG hydrogels was observed in the absence of the KPWE motif. The similarity between PEX7 and nuclear transport receptors therefore reinforces the analogy between peroxisomal matrix-protein import and nuclear-protein transport.

The analogy implies that the two protein-transport systems probably evolved from the same ancestral machinery, which might have utilized a selective phase to move folded proteins between compartments. The most primitive systems might have allowed bidirectional transport of receptor–cargo complexes through a conduit containing the phase without directional bias. In the case of peroxisomal-protein import, this system might have consisted of PEX7, a PTS2 signal and a PEX13-like pore. Some directionality might have been provided by the removal of the PTS2 signal by a matrix protease, which still occurs in some organisms7. PEX5 and the PTS1 signal would have evolved later to provide directional bias and enhance the efficiency of translocation. Supporting this theory, only a few PTS2 proteins occur in most contemporary organisms yet include some of the most conserved and arguably ancient peroxisomal enzymes such as thiolase; furthermore, in certain species, PTS2 import has been completely supplanted by the PTS1 system7.

All reagents were obtained from Millipore Sigma unless specified otherwise. Buffers were prepared in ultrapure water. Room temperature (RT) indicates 22–25 °C.

Plasmids were derived from vector pET-28b(+) (Novagen) and are listed in Supplementary Table 1 along with details about their construction and relevant GenBank accession numbers. All constructs were codon-optimized for E. coli and verified by whole-plasmid sequencing. The construct for expressing the N-terminal unstructured region (including the YG domain) of PEX13 was described previously17. For constructs fused to GST, the GST coding sequence was first amplified by PCR from vector pGEX-6P-3 (Cytiva), incorporating at the 5′ end the nucleotide sequence CAT (which creates an NdeI restriction site in combination with the downstream start codon) and at the 3′ end the nucleotide sequence 5′-GGATCCGACTTGGAAGTACTGTTTCAGGGTCCCTAACTCGAG-3′ that encodes a short linker consisting of the amino acids GSD, a 3C protease-cleavage site (amino acids LEVLFQGP), a TAA stop codon and a XhoI restriction site. The complete backbone of vector pET-28b(+) was next amplified by PCR, starting with nucleotides 5′-GCTAACAAA-3′ downstream of the multiple-cloning site and proceeding through nucleotides 5′-GGAGATATA-3′ upstream of the multiple-cloning site. Both PCR amplicons were ligated by Gibson assembly (New England Biolabs). The coding sequence of individual constructs was then inserted immediately downstream of the 3C protease-cleavage site. Truncations and deletions were performed by site-directed mutagenesis (Agilent).

Plasmids were assembled in the integrating vector pPICZα-LINK20 and are listed in Supplementary Table 2 along with details about their construction and relevant GenBank accession numbers. The vector was first modified to include the coding sequence of GST, followed by a tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease-cleavage site exactly as described previously24. The coding sequence of individual constructs was then inserted immediately downstream of the TEV protease-cleavage site by Gibson assembly.

Plasmids are listed in Supplementary Table 3 along with details about their construction and relevant GenBank accession numbers.

To assemble plasmid MSV-262, the following components were amplified by PCR and ligated by Gibson assembly: a segment of plasmid pWCD1401 located between and including the two NotI restriction sites (containing a high-copy ColE1 origin of replication and bacterial kanamycin-resistance cassette)54; the yeast PEX7 coding sequence along with 80 bp of the 5′ untranslated region; the yeast ADH1 terminator (that is, the last 13 bp of the ADH1 reading frame along with 190 bp of the 3′ untranslated region) flanked at the 5′ end by the nucleotide sequence 5′-GGCGCGC-3′ (to introduce an AscI restriction site) and at the 3′ end by the nucleotide sequence 5′-GATCCGCTAGATCTCGAGC-3′ (to introduce BglII and XhoI restriction sites); a hygMX6 hygromycin-resistance cassette (Addgene, catalogue number 19342), followed by an MfeI restriction site; and 80 bp of the 3′ untranslated region immediately downstream of the PEX7 reading frame. Using site-directed mutagenesis, the nucleotide pair GC was next inserted immediately upstream of the PEX7 start codon to introduce an SphI restriction site, nucleotides 462 and 468 within the PEX7 coding sequence were mutated to T and C, respectively, to destroy two BamHI restriction sites and the last four nucleotides of the PEX7 coding sequence (TTGA) were converted to CTAGC to introduce an NheI restriction site.

To assemble plasmid MSV-269, the TAG stop codon in plasmid MSV-262 was replaced by the nucleotide sequence 5′-TCTGGTGATTACAAAGATGATGATGACAAGTAA-3′, which encodes a short linker comprising the amino acids SG, followed by a FLAG tag (amino acids DYKDDDDK) and a new stop codon.

To assemble plasmid MSV-322, the nucleotides GC immediately upstream of the PEX7 start codon were replaced by a tetracycline-responsive riboswitch (5′-GGCCTAAAACATACCAGATCGCCACCCGCGCTTTAATCTGGAGAGGTGAAGAATACGACCACCTAGGCC-3′)39 preceded by a short linker (5′-ATCGTACG-3′) and followed by a minimal Kozak sequence (AAA).

Plasmid MSV-282 was assembled like plasmid MSV-262, with the following modifications. Fragments containing the ColE1 origin of replication and kanamycin-resistance cassette, as well as the ADH1 terminator region, were amplified by PCR as described earlier. These were ligated by Gibson assembly to the yeast PEX13 coding sequence and 69 bp of the 5′ untranslated region, a natMX6 nourseothricin-resistance cassette (Addgene, catalogue number 19343) and 68 bp of the 3′ untranslated region downstream of the PEX13 reading frame. The nucleotide sequence 5′-AGCTCCGAGGATCTGTACTTTCAGAGCTATCCATATGATGTTCCAGATTACGCT-3′, which encodes a linker composed of the amino acids SS, followed by a TEV protease-cleavage site (amino acids EDLYFQS) and an haemagglutinin tag (amino acids YPYDVPDYA), was then inserted immediately upstream of the PEX13 stop codon. Modifications of the PEX13 coding sequence were performed by site-directed mutagenesis.

Plasmid MSV-324 was assembled like plasmid MSV-282, except using the coding sequence of yeast PEX39, 80 bp of the 5′ and 3′ untranslated regions, and the yeast LYS2 auxotrophic marker (Addgene, catalogue number 64188)55. The nucleotide sequence 5′-GGTTCTGGTGATTACAAAGATGATGATGATAAG-3′, which encodes a linker composed of the amino acids GSG, followed by a FLAG tag, was then inserted immediately upstream of the PEX39 stop codon.

Yeast strains were routinely cultivated on YPD medium (1% wt/vol yeast extract, 2% wt/vol peptone and 2% wt/vol dextrose) at 30 °C, unless stated otherwise; for plates, 2% wt/vol agar (Becton Dickinson, catalogue number 214010) was added to the medium.

P. pastoris strains were derived from the SMD1168 parental strain56 and are listed in Supplementary Table 4. Expression cassettes for PEX7 and PEX7–GFP were inserted at the AOX1 locus by homologous recombination using the integrating plasmids described earlier. Plasmids were linearized using the restriction enzyme PmeI (New England Biolabs) and delivered into the yeast cells by electroporation. Transformants were selected on YPD agar supplemented with 1 M sorbitol and 500 µg ml−1 zeocin (Thermo Fisher, R25001). Correct insertion was validated by PCR.

S. cerevisiae strains were derived from the BY4742 reference strain57 and are listed in Supplementary Table 5. Deletions and insertions were performed by homologous recombination in a BY4742 derivative (referred herein as strain MSB-462) that expresses the peroxisomal PTS1 enzyme FOX2 fused at the N terminus to red fluorescent protein (RFP–FOX2) as well as the peroxisomal PTS2 enzyme POT1 fused at the C terminus to green fluorescent protein (POT1–GFP)58. For gene deletions, the appropriate antibiotic-resistance cassette or auxotrophic marker was amplified by PCR from the plasmids listed in Supplementary Table 3 using primers that introduce 60-bp overhangs corresponding to the 5′ and 3′ untranslated regions immediately upstream and downstream of the target open reading frame, respectively. The resulting amplicon was delivered into the yeast cells by lithium acetate-based transformation59. Transformants were selected on YPD agar supplemented with 250 µg ml−1 hygromycin (Thermo Fisher, catalogue number 10687010), 500 µg ml−1 geneticin (Thermo Fisher, catalogue number 10131035) or 100 µg ml−1 nourseothricin (Jena Bioscience, AB-101), as appropriate, or on synthetic defined agar medium lacking the appropriate amino acid or nucleotide (Sunrise Science). For inserting mutant genes or epitope tags, the relevant reading frame was first knocked out and then replaced by the modified coding sequence using the integrating plasmids described earlier. The plasmids were linearized using the restriction enzyme NotI (New England Biolabs) before lithium acetate-based transformation. All deletions and insertions were validated by PCR.

PEX7 and PEX7–GFP were produced in P. pastoris as fusions to an N-terminal GST tag and a TEV protease-cleavage site, and purified by glutathione-affinity and size-exclusion chromatographies as described previously24 with the following modifications. Cells were cultured in 2-l baffled flasks for 36 h at 30 °C on an orbital shaker in BM medium (100 mM KH2PO4·KOH pH 6.0 at RT, 0.34% wt/vol yeast nitrogen base, 1% wt/vol ammonium sulfate and 4 × 10−5% wt/vol d-biotin) supplemented with 1% vol/vol glycerol. The cells were next sterilely resuspended in BM medium supplemented with 0.75% vol/vol methanol in clean 2-l baffled flasks and cultured for an additional 24 h at 28 °C. The final cell pellets were weighed and suspended (at a ratio of 1 ml g−1 wet cell weight) in lysis buffer (30 mM Tris–HCl pH 7.5 at RT, 500 mM NaCl, 5% wt/vol glycerol, 1 mM EDTA and 2 mM dithiothreitol (DTT)) supplemented with protease-inhibitor tablets (Roche, catalogue number 5056489001) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cell suspension was divided among 50-ml beadbeater canisters (BioSpec, catalogue number 110803-50SS), supplemented with 2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and the cells were lysed by beadbeating at 4 °C with 0.5-mm glass beads (BioSpec, catalogue number 11079105). The lysate was supplemented with 0.05% wt/vol Tween 20 and clarified by centrifugation at 40,000g and 4 °C for 40 min. The resulting supernatant was incubated overnight at 4 °C with glutathione agarose (Prometheus). The beads were washed with excess wash buffer (30 mM Tris–HCl pH 7.5 at RT, 300 mM NaCl and 1 mM DTT) and bound protein was eluted at RT with elution buffer (30 mM HEPES·KOH pH 7.8 at RT, 150 mM NaCl, 5% wt/vol glycerol, 1 mM DTT, 0.5 mM EDTA and 20 mM reduced glutathione). To remove the GST tag, the eluate was mixed with homemade His-tagged TEV protease60 and dialysed overnight at 4 °C against elution buffer lacking glutathione. The dialysed solution was incubated with glutathione agarose and Ni-NTA agarose (Thermo Fisher) to adsorb the GST tag and TEV protease. The resulting flow-through was gel-filtered into 30 mM HEPES·NaOH (pH 8), 300 mM NaCl, 5% wt/vol glycerol and 1 mM DTT (at 4 °C) either on a Cytiva HiLoad 16/600 Superdex 75 prep-grade (for PEX7) or a Cytiva HiLoad 16/600 Superdex 200 PG (for PEX7–GFP) column. Peak fractions were pooled and concentrated before being snap-frozen and stored as single-use aliquots at −80 °C.

The unstructured N-terminal region (including the YG domain) of A. thaliana PEX13 was produced in E. coli BL21 Rosetta 2(DE3) cells (Novagen) as a fusion to an N-terminal 14×His tag and a TEV protease-cleavage site, and purified under denaturing conditions in 8 M urea as previously described17.

Proteins were produced in E. coli BL21 Rosetta 2(DE3) cells as fusions containing an N-terminal GST tag and a 3C protease-cleavage site. The proteins were purified by glutathione-affinity and size-exclusion chromatographies as described previously15 with the exception that after proteolytic removal of the GST tag using 3C protease, the proteins were gel-filtered into 25 mM HEPES·NaOH pH 7.8 at RT, 150 mM NaCl, 5% wt/vol glycerol and 1 mM DTT before being snap-frozen as single-use aliquots.

Lyophilized peptides (Genscript) were dissolved in 1 M HEPES·NaOH pH 7.5 at RT, 10 mM tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP) and 1 mM EDTA to a final concentration of 10 mM, snap-frozen as single-use aliquots and stored at −80 °C. The KPWE peptide corresponds to the amino-acid sequence CSSTAVPRPKPWETSASLEE consisting of residues 2–20 of S. cerevisiae PEX13 and an additional N-terminal cysteine for coupling to thiol-reactive agarose beads. In the scrambled peptide, amino acids 8 and 10–13 were rearranged into the sequence CSSTAVPEPRWKPTSASLEE. The PTS2 peptide corresponds to the amino-acid sequence SQRLQSIKDHLVESRS consisting of residues 2–15 of the S. cerevisiae peroxisomal thiolase POT1, followed by the amino acids R and S to improve solubility.

Peroxisome biogenesis was induced in S. cerevisiae using an established procedure61. Briefly, cells were subcultured twice in YPD medium to mid-log phase (optical density at 600 nm (OD600) ≈ 2), harvested through centrifugation at 2,000g and 30 °C for 10 min, sterilely resuspended to an OD600 of 0.5 in YPGO medium (1% wt/vol yeast extract, 2% wt/vol peptone, 2% vol/vol glycerol, 0.1% wt/vol oleic acid and 0.25% vol/vol Tween 40) and cultured for an additional 16 h at 30 °C. For experiments involving PEX7 riboswitch constructs, cultures in YPGO were supplemented with 250 µM tetracycline (Millipore Sigma, T7660) as described previously62.

S. cerevisiae cells expressing RFP–FOX2 and POT1–GFP (MSB-462) were induced to form peroxisomes as described earlier. A 1-ml aliquot of each culture was sedimented by centrifugation for 30 s at 13,000g and RT, and the cells were resuspended in 7 µl of RT complete synthetic defined medium (Sunrise Science, catalogue number 1001) supplemented with 10 mM potassium phosphate pH 6 at RT, 4 mM magnesium sulfate, 25 mM ammonium sulfate and 2% wt/vol d-glucose. An aliquot of the resulting suspension was spotted on a clean glass slide (Thermo Fisher, 22-310397), covered by a 22 × 22 mm no. 1.5 square glass coverslip (VWR, 48366-227) and imaged immediately.

The cells were imaged on a spinning-disk confocal platform consisting of a Nikon Eclipse Ti inverted microscope, a Yokagawa CSU-X1 spinning-disk confocal scanner, a Hamamatsu ORCA-Fusion BT sCMOS camera and a Prior Proscan II motorized stage. Samples were illuminated sequentially by solid-state 65 mW 561-nm and 80 mW 488-nm lasers through a Di01-T405/488/568/647 dichroic (Semrock). Fluorescence was collected using a red-emission ET605/52 m (605 ± 26 nm) or a green-emission ET525/50 m (525 ± 25 nm) single-band bandpass filter (Chroma), respectively, through either a Nikon ×100 1.45 numerical aperture (NA) Plan Apo Lambda or Nikon ×40 0.95 NA Plan Apo Lambda air objective. Images were acquired using the Nikon NIS-Elements software with a 16-bit digitizer without binning. Multiple non-overlapping positions arrayed around the centre of the coverslip were imaged for each sample, with focus being maintained at a preset distance from the coverslip using the Nikon PFS. Imaging parameters were configured to maximize the signal-to-noise (SNR) ratio while avoiding saturation. All samples intended to be compared were imaged using identical acquisition settings.

Interphase-locked egg extract lacking filamentous actin was prepared exactly as described in a previously published protocol37 using adult female X. laevis wild-type pigmented African clawed frogs (aged 20–30 yr; Xenopus1). The frogs were handled strictly within the confines of the Amphibian/Aquatics facility of the Cell Biology Department at Harvard Medical School according to protocols fully approved by the Harvard Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (protocol number IS00000098-9).

Import reactions were performed exactly as described in a previously published protocol37. Briefly, extract was mixed with 500 nM of the indicated cargo and 100 nM of the indicated receptor variants with or without 100 nM PEX7, and incubated at 24 °C. Where stated, endogenous PEX5 was first depleted from the extract using agarose beads covalently conjugated to the high-affinity PEX5-binding domain from PEX14. Recombinant proteins were diluted in XBHS buffer (40 mM HEPES·KOH pH 7.7 at RT, 100 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM CaCl2 and 250 mM sucrose) before being added to the reactions. For imaging, an aliquot of each reaction was sandwiched between two 22 × 22 mm no. 1.5 square glass coverslips (VWR, 48366-227) that had been passivated with 20 kDa polyethylene glycol (JenKem, M-SLN-20K). The sandwich was mounted on a 25 × 75 mm aluminium slide and sealed with a mixture of Vaseline, lanoline and paraffin. The slides were imaged on a spinning-disk confocal platform consisting of an inverted Nikon Eclipse Ti2 microscope and a Yokagawa CSU-W1 spinning-disk confocal scanner. The samples were illuminated by an 80-mW solid-state 488-nm laser through a Di01-T405/488/568/647 dichroic (Semrock), and fluorescence was collected through a Nikon ×100 1.45 NA Plan Apo Lambda oil-immersion objective and a green-emission ET525/50 m (525 ± 25 nm) single-band bandpass filter (Chroma). Images were acquired using the Nikon NIS-Elements software with a Hamamatsu ORCA-Fusion BT CMOS camera with 2 × 2 binning and a 16-bit digitizer. For each sample, multiple non-overlapping positions arrayed around the centre of the coverslip were imaged using a Prior Proscan III motorized stage operating at 20% of the maximum speed (to avoid shaking the extract). Focus was maintained at a preset distance from the coverslip using the Nikon Perfect Focus System. Imaging parameters were configured to maximize the SNR ratio while avoiding saturation. All samples intended to be compared were imaged under identical acquisition settings.

Samples in Laemmli buffer (50 mM Tris–HCl pH 6.8 at RT, 10% vol/vol glycerol, 2% wt/vol SDS, 0.01% bromophenol blue and 700 mM β-mercaptoethanol) were heated for 5 min at 95 °C and then electrophoretically resolved under denaturing conditions on 4–20% TGX precast polyacrylamide gels (Bio-Rad, catalogue number 5671095). For immunoblotting, samples were transferred from the gels to Immun-Blot PVDF membranes (Bio-Rad, catalogue number 13709A06) for 12 h at 25 V and RT in 25 mM Tris, 192 mM glycine and 10% vol/vol methanol. The membranes were blotted in 20 mM Tris–HCl pH 7.5 at RT, 150 mM NaCl, 0.01% vol/vol Tween 20 and 3% wt/vol fat-free milk solids (Apex, catalogue number 20241) using antibodies to the FLAG epitope (Sigma, F7425) and compatible horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Cytiva, NA934). The blots were developed by chemiluminescence (Perkin Elmer, NEL103001EA) and scanned on an Amersham ImageQuant 800 imaging system. For staining with Coomassie blue, gels were fixed in 50% vol/vol methanol and 10% vol/vol acetic acid for 30 min at RT, incubated for 30 min in 50% vol/vol methanol, 10% vol/vol acetic acid and 0.001% wt/vol Coomassie brilliant blue R-250 (Bio-Rad), and destained overnight in 10% vol/vol acetic acid before washing into water. The stained gels were digitized on an Epson Perfection V700 scanner using the Epson Scan 2 software.

Cells cultured in YPGO medium (200 ml) were collected by centrifugation at 2,000g and 4 °C for 5 min, resuspended in an equivalent volume of water and re-pelleted. The final cell pellet was suspended in 3 ml chilled lysis buffer (20 mM HEPES·KOH pH 6.8 at RT, 150 mM potassium acetate, 5 mM magnesium acetate, 250 mM sorbitol and 1 mM EDTA) supplemented with protease-inhibitor tablets. The cell suspension was divided among three 2-ml screw-cap tubes on ice, supplemented with 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and lysed by beadbeating with 0.5 mm glass beads on a mini-beadbeater (BioSpec). The cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 2,000g and 4 °C for 10 min, and the resulting lysate (2 ml) was further fractionated into a soluble supernatant and a membrane pellet by centrifugation at 20,000g and 4 °C for 30 min. A 1-ml aliquot of the supernatant fraction was supplemented with 1% wt/vol highly pure Triton X-100 (Thermo Fisher, catalogue number 85111) and incubated with anti-FLAG agarose beads (Millipore Sigma, A2220) for 1 h at 4 °C. The pellet fraction was gently washed with lysis buffer, resuspended in 2 ml lysis buffer supplemented with 1% Triton X-100, solubilized for 15 min on ice and clarified by centrifugation at 20,000g and 4 °C for 10 min. A 1-ml aliquot of the resulting solubilisate was incubated with anti-FLAG beads as described earlier. The beads were washed several times with lysis buffer supplemented with 0.01% Triton X-100 and finally boiled in an equivalent volume of 2×Laemmli buffer.

A solution of the purified wild-type YG-domain polypeptide (or the variant lacking the KPWE motif) was concentrated to 2 mM in 50 mM HEPES·NaOH pH 7.8 at RT, 2 M urea and 2 mM TCEP. Aliquots of 2 µl were then spotted on the bottom of multiple wells of a 96-well glass-bottomed plate (Cellvis, P96-1.5H-N), which was then sealed with a gas-impermeable AlumaSeal II film (Hampton Research, HR8-069) to prevent desiccation and incubated at RT for 24 h. Before each assay, the resulting gels were equilibrated overnight at RT in a 100-fold excess of Assay Buffer (25 mM HEPES·NaOH pH 7.8 at RT, 150 mM NaCl and 1 mM TCEP). A 0.5 µM solution of fluorescently labelled protein in Assay Buffer was then added to the samples, with or without additional components at the concentrations indicated in the text, and incubated at RT. Gels were imaged at the times indicated in the text using a Nikon A1R point-scanning confocal system consisting of an inverted Nikon Eclipse Ti microscope and a Nikon ×20 0.75 NA Plan Apo air objective. The objective was centred on the gel edge and focus was maintained 5 µm above the glass surface using the Nikon Perfect Focus System. Fluorescence was excited through a 405/488/561/647 quad-band dichroic (Chroma), using a 488-nm solid-state laser (Coherent) and a galvano scanner. A 50-nm emission band was collected on a gallium arsenide phosphide detector, using an ET525/50m (525 ± 25 nm) single-band bandpass filter (Chroma) and a pinhole dilated to 0.9 Airy units. Images were acquired using the Nikon NIS-Elements software with a pixel size of 1 µm and a 12-bit digitizer. Imaging parameters were configured to maximize the SNR while avoiding saturation. All samples intended to be compared were imaged using identical acquisition settings.

YG hydrogels were prepared in a glass-bottomed plate as described earlier and equilibrated for 3 h at RT in Assay Buffer containing 0.5 µM PEX7–GFP or PEX5–GFP with or without PTS2 peptide and receptor at the concentrations specified in the text. Following the initial incubation, the hydrogels were imaged on a Nikon A1R point-scanning confocal system, as described earlier, with a Nikon ×10 0.45 NA Plan Apo air objective, a pinhole dilated to 1.4 Airy units and a pixel size of 2 µm. A solution of purified PEX39 was then spiked into each reaction and the hydrogels imaged every 2 min for an additional 1 h at RT.

Cysteine-containing peptides were covalently conjugated to thiol-reactive SulfoLink coupling resin (Thermo Fisher, catalogue number 20401) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The prepared beads were then mixed with Assay Buffer containing the fluorescently labelled protein as well as additional components indicated in the text, and the resulting bead suspensions were transferred to a 384-well glass-bottomed plate (Cellvis, P384-1.5H-N). GST-fusion proteins were instead mixed with glutathione agarose 4B (Prometheus, 20-543) in Assay Buffer containing the fluorescently labelled protein and additional components indicated in the text; the resulting bead suspensions were then transferred to a glass-bottomed plate as above. The plates were incubated at RT for the durations specified in the text and directly imaged on the spinning-disk confocal platform described earlier for peroxisomal import reactions in Xenopus egg extract. Note that imaging the beads directly in the binding reaction preserves the equilibrium and thereby allows even weak interactions to be detected. Fluorescence was collected through a Nikon ×10 0.45 NA Plan Apo air objective, and images were acquired using the Nikon NIS-Elements software and a 16-bit digitizer without binning. Imaging parameters were configured to maximize the SNR while avoiding saturation. Samples intended to be compared were imaged using identical acquisition settings.

For the assay shown in Fig. 5d, 15 µl glutathione agarose 4B (Prometheus, 20-543) was mixed with 1 µM purified recombinant yeast PEX7 and varying concentrations of the GST-tagged variants of yeast PEX39, as indicated in the text, in a final volume of 50 µl. Reactions were prepared in Assay Buffer in low protein-binding tubes (Eppendorf, catalogue number 022431081) to minimize sample adhesion to the tube walls. The reactions were incubated at 25 °C for 1 h with agitation. The beads were then quickly sedimented for 30 s at 16,000g and RT, and 20 µl of each supernatant fraction was boiled in reducing Laemmli buffer. The samples were resolved by SDS–PAGE and stained with Coomassie blue as described earlier.

For the assay shown in Fig. 8b, the beads were first incubated with yeast PEX7 and the GST-tagged ∆APH variant of yeast PEX39 (each at 1 µM) for 30 min at 25 °C with agitation. Varying concentrations of the peptides, as indicated in the text, were then added and the reactions were incubated for a further 1 h under the same conditions. The beads were finally sedimented and the resulting supernatant fractions resolved by SDS–PAGE as above.

All experiments were repeated independently at least three times. No data were excluded from the analyses. Mathematical fitting was performed in GraphPad Prism using least-squares regression.

Proteins containing KPWE motifs (or conservative variants) were identified in different species using the MOTIF Search tool at GenomeNet (https://www.genome.jp). Amino-acid sequences were aligned using Clustal Omega63. Secondary structure predictions were performed with AlphaFold 3 (ref. 64). Amino-acid conservation was calculated using ConSurf65. Helical-wheel diagrams were prepared using HeliQuest66.

All analyses were performed on the original unmodified images using routine functions in ImageJ67. Fluorescence images were first background-subtracted before further analysis.

For the YG hydrogel permeation assay, images were first oriented such that each gel edge faced the same direction. Fluorescence profiles across the buffer–gel interface were then generated by centering a 60 × 300 µm rectangular area on the gel edge and then measuring the mean fluorescence at each position within this selection. To express the resulting values in terms of fold enrichment, the fluorescence at each position along the selection was normalized to the average fluorescence in the buffer and plotted in terms of the distance from the gel edge.

For the PEX7-release assay from YG hydrogels, the total fluorescence within a 30-µm-wide band in the gel extending for 150 µm from the gel edge into the gel was measured at each time point. This distance was sufficient to fully encompass the permeation front of each fluorescent species. The resulting values were then normalized to the total fluorescence inside the gel at the start of the experiment and plotted as a function of time.

To calculate permeation rates through the YG hydrogel, a 60 × 300 µm rectangular area was first centred on the gel edge. The resulting region was then thresholded to demarcate the permeation zone (that is, the distance traversed by the fluorescent species) from the buffer and non-permeated part of the gel. The width of the area above the threshold was then measured and plotted as a function of time. A linear fit to the data yielded the permeation rate.

To calculate import rates in Xenopus egg extract, images were first thresholded to identify peroxisomes that were within the focal plane. A circular area with a diameter of 3 pixels was then centred on each local maximum and the mean fluorescence within this area was measured; the average fluorescence in the cytosol was then subtracted from the measured values. The resulting difference (that is, the peroxisome-associated fluorescence) was subsequently converted into a GFP concentration using a calibration curve of GFP fluorescence in the egg extract measured at different concentrations. The peroxisome-associated GFP concentrations were finally plotted as a function of time; linear fits to the data yielded the import rate.

To calculate the fraction bound in the quantitative binding assay, digitized images of Coomassie-stained gels were first converted into 16-bit grayscale and their pixel intensities inverted. The mean pixel intensity was then measured within a rectangular selection encompassing each PEX7 protein band and the mean intensity of the background was subtracted from the measured values. The background-corrected intensities (corresponding to unbound PEX7 remaining in solution) were in turn subtracted from the intensity of the PEX7 band in a sample without PEX39 (that is, total PEX7). The resulting difference (corresponding to PEX7 that had bound to the beads) was finally divided by the total PEX7 intensity to yield the fraction bound. The data were fitted either to a standard binding isotherm or a competitive-binding isotherm, as appropriate, to estimate the observed binding constants.

All images intended to be compared were processed identically. Fluorescence micrographs were normalized to the background before being linearly contrast-stretched in ImageJ to the same bit range. Digitized images of immunoblots and Coomassie-stained gels were linearly contrast-stretched in ImageJ to reveal relevant bands but avoid clipping of the background, whereas photographs of YG hydrogels were processed using Adobe Photoshop. Structural models of proteins were rendered using the PyMOL Molecular Graphics System (Schrödinger). Figures were assembled for publication in Adobe Illustrator.

a, Xenopus egg extract was depleted or not (mock) of endogenous PEX5 using beads conjugated to the PEX5-binding domain from PEX14, then supplemented with buffer or the indicated purified recombinant PEX5 variants (described in Fig. 1b). Import was assessed by imaging the indicated fluorescent cargo on a spinning-disk confocal microscope. The cargo, shown on the left, consisted of GFP fused to the SKL peroxisome targeting signal (PTS1) or to the signal from the indicated Xenopus PTS2 peroxisomal matrix enzymes (PTS2). Repeated rounds of cargo import into peroxisomes produce bright puncta. Scale bars equal 5 µm. b, The indicated recombinant proteins were produced and purified as described in the Methods, then resolved by SDS–PAGE and stained by Coomassie Blue. Molecular weights (in kD) are marked on the left; images of the unprocessed gels are provided.

Source data

a, Glutathione-conjugated beads were bound to 1 µM GST alone or to the purified recombinant GST-tagged PEX5 variants shown (described in Fig. 1b), and incubated in the presence of 1 µM purified recombinant yeast PEX7 and 1 µM GFP fused at the N terminus to the import signal (residues 1–27) from yeast POT1 (PTS2). Recruitment of the fluorescent cargo to the beads was visualized after 1 h on a spinning-disk confocal microscope as a bright ring around the bead perimeter. Scale bar equals 100 µm. b, Xenopus egg extract was depleted of endogenous PEX5 using beads conjugated to the PEX5-binding domain from PEX14, then supplemented with the chimeric receptor PEX5-21 (described in Fig. 1b) and purified recombinant yeast PEX7. Import was assessed using fluorescent PTS1 and PTS2 cargo: the PTS2 cargo is described in panel a, whereas the PTS1 cargo consisted of GFP fused at the C terminus to the SKL peroxisome targeting signal. Reactions were imaged at the indicated times on a spinning-disk confocal microscope. The fluorescence intensity of the resulting puncta (corresponding to imported cargo) was then measured, converted into GFP concentrations as described in the Methods, and plotted as a function of time. Error bars span the range of at least 30 imaged fields; lines represent linear fits to the data generated by least-squares regression. The corresponding import rates (±the standard error) are specified beside the graph. Scale bars equal 5 µm. c, As in panel a, using GST alone or the indicated GST-tagged PEX5 variants (described in Fig. 1b), in the presence or absence of purified recombinant yeast PEX7 and the fluorescent cargo described in panels a and b. Source numerical data are provided.

Source data

a, Left, scheme depicting the domain organization of PEX13 from Arabidopsis thaliana. Note that A. thaliana PEX13 lacks the transmembrane segment and SH3 domain found in metazoan PEX13. Relevant residue numbers are specified on top, and the region that was produced recombinantly to prepare YG hydrogels is underlined beneath. The recombinant fragment was fused at the N terminus to a tetradecahistidine (14×His) tag and a TEV protease-cleavage site, and at the C terminus to a cysteine (Cys) residue. Right, purification of the wild-type fragment (WT) and the version lacking the KPWE motif (∆KPWE). Lanes 1 and 5 show each His-tagged precursor purified by nickel-affinity chromatography in the presence of urea (as described in the Methods), resolved by SDS–PAGE and stained by Coomassie blue. Lanes 2 and 6 show each fragment after cleavage with TEV protease to release the His tag. Lanes 3 and 7 show the soluble fraction (sup) of each TEV-cleavage reaction, demonstrating that each fragment remains soluble in urea in the absence of the tag. The cleaved tag was removed from the reactions by a subsequent nickel-affinity step, and the resulting flow-through containing each final purified fragment is shown in lanes 4 and 8. Molecular weights (in kD) are marked on the side; an image of the unprocessed gel is available in source data. b, Thiol-reactive beads were conjugated to the purified wild-type (WT) YG-domain polypeptide or the version lacking the KPWE motif (∆KPWE) described in panel a. The beads were then incubated with PEX7 fused at the C terminus to GFP (PEX7–GFP) or with GFP alone, and binding of each fluorescent protein to the immobilized fragments was visualized on a spinning-disk confocal microscope. Scale bar equals 100 µm.

Source data

a, Top, AlphaFold model from Fig. 3c of the complex between yeast PEX7 and the N-terminal segment of yeast PEX13 (residues 1–27) containing the KPWE motif. Below, the model coloured according to the predicted local distance difference test (pLDDT) score computed by AlphaFold for each residue, with a score of 100 reflecting the highest confidence. b, As in panel a, showing the AlphaFold model from Fig. 5b of the complex between yeast PEX7 and the region of yeast PEX39 that contains the APH and RPWE motif. c, As in panel a, showing the AlphaFold model from Fig. 7a of the complex between yeast PEX7 and the region of yeast PEX39 that contains the APH and RPWE motif, in the presence of a PTS2 peptide. d, As in panel a, showing the AlphaFold model from Fig. 7a of the complex between yeast PEX7 and the region of yeast PEX39 that contains the APH and RPWE motif, in the presence of a PTS2 peptide and the yeast receptor PEX21.

a, Interaction between full-length yeast PEX7 and residues 1–27 (including the KPWE motif) of yeast PEX13, predicted by AlphaFold. PEX7 is shown as a space-filling model in the same orientation as in Fig. 3c, coloured by surface electrostatic potential according to the scale on the right. The PEX13 fragment is depicted as a ribbon, with the side chain of lysine 10 (K10) of the KPWE motif shown. The region outlined by a dashed black line is magnified on the right. b, As above, with PEX7 coloured by surface hydrophobicity according to the scale on the right, and showing the side chain of proline 11 (P11) of the KPWE motif. c, As above, with PEX7 coloured yellow and showing the side chain of glutamate 13 (E13) of the KPWE motif. E13 is predicted to contact arginine 117 (R117) within the loop of one of the WD40 blades of the PEX7 β-propeller (overlaid on top as a cartoon representation). A sequence alignment of this loop from the indicated organisms is shown on the right, illustrating the conservation of the arginine residue. d, As in panel c, with the model rotated as indicated and showing the side chain of tryptophan 12 (W12) of the KPWE motif. W12 is predicted to contact the aliphatic stem of lysine 230 (K230) within the loop of one of the WD40 blades of the PEX7 β-propeller (overlaid on top as a cartoon representation). A sequence alignment of this loop from the indicated organisms is shown on the right, illustrating the conservation of the lysine residue.

a, Thiol-reactive beads were conjugated to a cysteine-containing synthetic peptide comprising the region of yeast PEX13 that contains the KPWE motif, or a peptide in which the motif was scrambled (both described in Fig. 3b). The beads were then incubated with or without 1 µM yeast PEX7, in the presence of 1 µM cargo consisting of GFP fused at the N terminus to the import signal (residues 1–27) from yeast POT1 (PTS2). Where indicated, reactions included 1 µM of either the chimeric receptor PEX5-21 (described in Fig. 1b) that can bind to PEX7, or the short receptor isoform PEX5S that cannot bind. Recruitment of the cargo to the beads after 1 h was visualized on a spinning-disk confocal microscope. Scale bar equals 100 µm. b, Glutathione-conjugated beads were bound to the purified recombinant GST-tagged chimeric receptor PEX5-21 (described in Fig. 1b) or to GST alone. The beads were then incubated with 1 µM PEX7–GFP in the absence or presence of a synthetic peptide comprising the PTS2 signal (residues 2–15) from yeast POT1; the fold excess of the peptide relative to PEX7–GFP is indicated above. Recruitment of PEX7–GFP to the beads was visualized on a spinning-disk confocal microscope. Note that the beads are less porous than those in panel a, so binding appears as a bright ring around the bead perimeter. Scale bar equals 100 µm.

a, PEX7 was fused at the C terminus to a FLAG tag (PEX7–FLAG) and expressed at endogenous levels in yeast. Shown is a FLAG immunoblot of the total lysate from cells expressing wild-type (WT) untagged PEX7 or two clones expressing PEX7–FLAG. Asterisk indicates non-specific bands; molecular weights (in kD) are marked on the left. b, Yeast cells lacking PEX7 (pex7∆), or expressing PEX7–FLAG, were grown in oleic acid to induce peroxisomes. Peroxisomal protein import was assessed by imaging the endogenous matrix proteins FOX2 fused to RFP (PTS1) and POT1 fused to GFP (PTS2). Note that bright puncta indicate successful import; in the absence of import, the cargo is diffusely distributed throughout the cytosol. Scale bar equals 5 µm. c, PEX7–FLAG was expressed in cells lacking PEX13 (pex13∆), or cells containing wild-type (WT) PEX13 or a mutant lacking the KPWE motif (∆KPWE). Cells were grown in oleic acid to induce peroxisomes, then lysed and separated into a peroxisome-containing membrane fraction. PEX7–FLAG was immunoprecipitated from the total lysate and the corresponding detergent-solubilized membranes, resolved by SDS–PAGE, and detected by immunoblotting for the FLAG epitope. Asterisk marks non-specific bands; molecular weights (in kD) are marked on the left. d, Yeast cells devoid of PEX13 (pex13∆), or expressing PEX13 lacking residues 2–13 that encompass the KPWE motif, were grown in oleic acid to induce peroxisomes. Where indicated, the cells additionally lacked the two PTS2 receptors PEX18 and PEX21 (pex18∆ pex21∆) or the two PTS1 receptors PEX5 and PEX9 (pex5∆ pex9∆). Peroxisomal protein import was assessed as in panel b. Scale bar equals 5 µm. e, Xenopus egg extract was incubated for 1 h with 0.5 µM GFP alone or GFP fused to the C terminus of the indicated proteins, then imaged on a spinning-disk confocal microscope. Where indicated, reactions additionally included the chimeric receptor PEX5-21 (described in Fig. 1b) at 0.5 µM and a synthetic peptide comprising the PTS2 signal from yeast POT1. Note that puncta reveal entry of the fluorescent species into peroxisomes. Scale bar equals 5 µm. Unprocessed blots are available.

Source data

a, The leftmost panel shows an AlphaFold model of the complex between yeast PEX7 and the indicated region of yeast PEX39 containing the APH and the RPWE motif. The N terminus of PEX39 is marked for reference. The next panel on the right shows the same complex but with PEX7 represented as a surface and coloured according to the amino-acid conservation scale underneath. A conserved groove along the side of PEX7 is framed by dashed black lines. The four rightmost panels show the same complex but rotated as indicated. Note the extensive amino-acid conservation around the binding sites for the APH and the RPWE motif. b, As in panel a, showing the crystal structure (PDB: 3W15) of the complex between yeast PEX7, a PTS2 peptide, and the yeast PTS2 receptor PEX21. The complex is overlaid on the AlphaFold model of yeast PEX7 shown in panel a (with PEX7 from the crystal structure not visible). Note that a portion of the receptor snakes along the same conserved groove (framed by dashed black lines) on the side of PEX7 to which PEX39 is predicted to bind. Furthermore, the receptor and PTS2 peptide are cradled by the same conserved surface on top of PEX7 that also binds to the APH of PEX39.

a, Glutathione-conjugated beads were bound to 1 µM purified recombinant GST-tagged yeast PEX7 or GST alone, and incubated with 1 µM purified recombinant yeast PEX39 fused at the C terminus to GFP (PEX39–GFP) or with GFP alone. Recruitment of each fluorescent protein to the beads was visualized after 1 h on a spinning-disk confocal microscope. Scale bar equals 100 µm. b, Representative Coomassie-stained SDS–PAGE gels corresponding to the binding experiment in Fig. 5d. Briefly, yeast PEX7 was incubated with beads coated with GST-tagged wild-type yeast PEX39 or the indicated mutants; after sedimenting the beads, each supernatant fraction was resolved by SDS–PAGE and stained by Coomassie Blue. Molecular weights (in kD) are marked on the left. c, PEX7 and PEX39 were fused at their C terminus to a FLAG tag (PEX7–FLAG and PEX39–FLAG) and expressed from their respective endogenous promoters in yeast. Shown is a FLAG immunoblot of the total lysate from two different clones (lanes 3 and 4) following growth in oleic acid, compared to cells expressing PEX7–FLAG and untagged PEX39 (lane 2), and cells expressing untagged versions of both proteins (lane 1). Asterisk indicates non-specific bands; molecular weights (in kD) are marked on the left. d, YG hydrogels were incubated with GFP alone or with GFP fused to the C terminus of the indicated proteins. The accumulation of each fluorescent protein inside the gel after 30 min was visualized on a point-scanning confocal microscope. Representative images are shown; the fold enrichment of each protein relative to buffer, across the imaged field, is plotted above (mean ± range of 3 experiments). The width of each image corresponds to 300 µm. Source numerical data and unprocessed blots are provided.

The Only Particle Collider in the U.S. Will Be Replaced with an Upgrade

Brookhaven National Laboratory is pushing the boundaries of particle physics.

By Rachel Feltman, Naeem Amarsy, Fonda Mwangi, Kelso Harper & Jeffery DelViscio 

Jeffery DelViscio/Scientific American

Rachel Feltman: For Scientific American's Science Quickly, this is Rachel Feltman. Today we're taking you on another one of our Friday Fascination field trips with an auditory journey to Brookhaven National Laboratory. This Long Island facility boasts seven Nobel Prize–winning discoveries and more than 70 years of groundbreaking research into energy and the environment.

Earlier this year the Science Quickly team visited Brookhaven to get a look at its Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, or RHIC, which has been helping scientists study subatomic particles since 2000. RHIC's 25th year of operations is set to be its last—but only because something new is on the horizon: the Electron-Ion Collider [EIC], which scientists hope can reveal the secrets of the “glue” that binds the building blocks of visible matter together.

To guide us through these weighty subatomic topics, I chatted with Brookhaven's own Alex Jentsch. You'll notice that this episode's audio quality is lower than usual, but that's because we were hanging out next to giant science machines. If you want to see those incredible instruments for yourself—and get access to an extended version of my conversation with Alex—check out our YouTube channel for a video edition of today's episode. For now here's part of our chat at Brookhaven.

We take you inside the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, housed at Brookhaven National Laboratory.

I'm here with scientist Alex Jentsch. Nice to meet you, Alex.

Alex Jentsch: Nice to meet you, too, Rachel.

Feltman: So where are we? What goes on here [laughs]?

Jentsch: Well, right now we are in the experimental hall for the STAR experiment, which is one of the two operating experiments right now at the collider.

Feltman: Mm-hmm.

Jentsch: And this monstrosity behind us is basically just a very large digital camera that we use to take pictures of collisions of particles.

Feltman: Wow, and what's the point of taking a picture of a collision of a particle?

Jentsch: Well, the only way that we can really understand what's going on inside of the atom—or inside the nucleus of the atom, really—is by destroying it. And so basically you can imagine this digital camera taking a picture of a firecracker after it blew up and then trying to put it all back together. So it's basically the only tool we have to look inside the nucleus.

Feltman: And what kind of stuff can we learn with that?

Jentsch: Well, there's various different things. So the original reason that we built this facility and built this collider was to study the early universe, so we were actually trying to recreate stuff that would've existed right after the big bang. So we obviously can't go visit the big bang very easily, unless you're a Time Lord, and so ultimately the only way we can do this is by trying to recreate those conditions in the lab.

So that was kind of the first main pillar of the science program, was looking at a situation where protons and neutrons were not protons and neutrons; they were actually melted into their constituents for a very short period of time. So we do that for very, very, very small amounts of time ...

Feltman: Mm.

Jentsch: In collisions in the middle of this detector.

Alternatively, we can also look at just basic structure of the proton. We can understand things like its mass, its charge and its spin, which is kind of the esoteric aspect of a proton, but that's another thing we can do with this camera.

Feltman: Cool. It would be great if you could just give us a quick overview of sort of the basic terms we need ...

Jentsch: Sure.

Feltman: To understand to wrap our heads around this.

Jentsch: So atoms are already fairly complicated. So we learn in chemistry that atoms have these electrons zipping around the outside in this cloud. And then if you go deeper into the inside of the atom, you get to the core thing that we call the nucleus.

So the nucleus is made up of these positively charged particles called protons and these neutral particles called neutrons. And for a long time we thought the electrons, the protons, the neutrons, they're fundamental. Well, then we looked deeper. We got new tools that we could use to probe deeper inside and found, “Oh, there's stuff inside the proton and neutron. Dang it, that's more complicated now.”

So we found these objects—we had no name for them yet; we didn't really expect them to be there. And one of the first things we had to figure out was what they're doing, what their properties are, how they're held together. They seem to be always bound up inside the protons and neutrons.

So we start out calling these things quarks because we couldn't really figure out a name and we found something in a James Joyce novel that sounded like it matched the, the weird thing we found. And they're seemingly glued together inside the protons and neutrons. And we know that, from the electromagnetic force, that photons are kind of the force-carrying particle between charged items.

Feltman: Mm.

Jentsch: So electrons, protons, they see their electric force by being able to exchange a photon; there must be something similar for quarks. And so since they're kind of glued together, we thought, “Okay, maybe this particle's called a gluon. Maybe it's the thing that's actually communicating this much stronger force than what we see for electromagnetism.”

And so from all of that we learned that the, the strong force is actually much stronger than electromagnetism, it's communicated via this thing we call the gluon. And so all of a sudden a whole new branch of physics became a thing and is now why we build these new machines.

Feltman: Quick follow-up: And what's the strong force [laughs]?

Jentsch: So the strong nuclear force is actually what binds protons and neutrons together and eventually binds them inside of atoms together. 'Cause if you think about it, protons have positive charge, neutrons have no charge—how are the positive charge items holding themselves together into a nucleus? So the strong force allows the nucleus to actually hold together.

Feltman: So can you walk me through what goes on when the accelerator's turned on? You know, what does an experiment entail?

Jentsch: So the accelerator part is immensely complicated; it's actually a whole complex of accelerators. So you can picture it kind of like the entrance ramp onto a highway. So we start the cars off, you know, after a red light on the access road. They eventually get on the ramp, and then they get on the highway and speed up.

Feltman: Right.

Jentsch: That's kind of how the RHIC facility operates. RHIC is short for Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider—RHIC is easier to say. So RHIC is kind of like the highway, and then the other parts of the complex are like the access roads.

Feltman: Mm.

Jentsch: That part is a whole set of expertise and a whole lot of challenges, and getting the particles into RHIC is only half the battle. Once they're there they have to accelerate. So we have to basically accelerate them at the same time that we ramp up all of the over 1,000 magnets that are inside the ring.

Feltman: Wow.

Jentsch: So those ring magnets are being ramped up in their field at the same time that we're speeding the particles up really, really close to the speed of light. And then eventually our friends at the collider department use other magnets to force the two beams to collide at the center of our detector, and then we start working.

So we're in a control room on the other side of this building. We turn on all of our detectors and start taking data, and that process goes on for about eight hours at a time. And so while we're in the control room, we babysit [laughs] all of the detectors, make sure the data-taking is going smoothly, and things always happen that we don't expect. And so we try not to run in the middle of summer, for example, because it gets hot and the power grid on Long Island [laughs] is not so happy with how much power we're drawing, and so eventually we get little dips, and that can shut things down for quite a while. So just getting the particles to the middle of the detector is really, really, really hard.

Feltman: So what are some examples of findings that have taken place because of the work here at Brookhaven?

Jentsch: So one of the initial things that was really interesting is that when we smashed these particles together, we originally started smashing gold ions together, and there was a reason for that. To recreate the early universe we want a lot of density and a lot of temperature.

Feltman: Mm-hmm.

Jentsch: And so by smashing heavy ions together the hope would be that in a very, very, very tiny nuclear scale you recreate the early universe—really, really, really small. And the thought was that when we do that the energy density becomes so high that the protons and neutrons “melt.”

Feltman: Mm-hmm.

Jentsch: And you get what, originally, we thought was a gas of the quarks and gluons inside. That wasn't really what we ended up finding. We actually found that they don't really behave like a gas at all. They kind of behave like a liquid …

Feltman: Mm.

Jentsch: Which is really not something we expected. And so as we started to do more work and study different things about the properties of this quark-gluon plasma we created inside, a lot of it was not what we really expected it to be.

So for example, we expected, because it might be a gas, that it would be fairly weakly interacting, which is not what you'd expect from the strong force, right? But it turns out it's actually quite strongly interacting—that's why it moves kind of like a fluid: all the particles actually kind of talk to each other.

Feltman: Mm.

Jentsch: And that has consequences for some of the things we try to measure. And so many of the things we initially measured were quite different from what we expected. As particles go through this plasma they lose energy. And so when we measure them in our detector they are not really behaving the way we originally thought they might.

The other aspect of things that we try to study here is the, the basic, fundamental property of the proton ...

Feltman: Mm-hmm.

Jentsch: The spin. And a long time ago we found out that the proton spin is not just coming from the quarks; it's coming from some combination of the quarks and the gluons.

Feltman: Mm-hmm.

Jentsch: And so we actually made some of the first constraint measurements here at STAR and at PHENIX down the road that showed the amount of spin that could be coming from the gluons, and that was, like, a first-ever measurement. So now the goal is to figure out the last part, which is how the motion of the quarks and gluo ns contribute to the proton spin.

So we can't answer all the questions with one facility, and so the hope would be that we can use the new facility, the Electron-Ion Collider, to start looking at that as well.

Feltman: Yeah, well, and speaking of, you know, answering new questions, one of the reasons we're here is that this is sort of the end of the line for this version of the accelerator ...

Jentsch: Mm-hmm.

Feltman: As far as I understand it. Can you tell us a little bit about the transition that's happening?

Jentsch: Yeahthis year we'll have our final data-taking for RHIC. And at that point we spend a couple of years taking all this stuff out because we have to make room for the new facility. And that process is really difficult 'cause you can see this is not a small piece of equipment. In parallel we'll also be retrofitting whole sections of the accelerator to build the components for the Electron-Ion Collider.

So it's exciting—we're really ready for the new physics—but it's also bittersweet because a lot of us have been working on this for a long time. I've been working on STAR for, like, 13 years, and so I have fond memories of sitting in the control room with friends from all over the world eating, you know, really salty snacks to stay awake and drinking coffee. And that's gonna be, you know, going away at the end of this year, and we'll have quite a long time before we start taking data with the new facility.

Feltman: Yeah, and what's the reason for the changeover?

Jentsch: So the kinds of collisions we do right now are either gold smashing on gold or proton smashing on proton or even proton smashing on gold. The problem there is that you have two items that are full of quarks.

Feltman: Mm.

Jentsch: They're really complicated items, and as you speed 'em up to really high energy they get more complicated. And smashing two really complicated objects together means that trying to study it is not easy.

Feltman: Yeah.

Jentsch: By using electrons as one of the beams instead of another proton or an ion— so you have an electron smashing into an ion—the electron basically serves as a source of light. It serves as a source of photons. And so you can actually take, essentially, snapshots of the nuclei, of the protons. It's a cleaner collision environment.

Feltman: Mm.

Jentsch: You can't study everything that we study here—you can't study a quark-gluon plasma, for instance, 'cause you don't have the energy density of all those quarks together—but you can study what the nucleus really looks like at a very, very, very small scale. You can study what the nucleus might look like before it would've collided in RHIC.

And so in some sense you can actually use the data we'll take 10 years from now to reanalyze data from now to try to understand more than we do now, which means we have to preserve [laughs] all the data that we've been taking for the last 25 years, and so there's a whole discussion now about the computing facility resources we're gonna need to store all of the data we've been taking …

Feltman: Mm.

Jentsch: Make sure it stays safe [laughs].

Feltman: Can you give me a sense of how much data has been collected in that time [laughs]?

Jentsch: Right now we're collecting an average of something like 15 petabytes per year …

Feltman: I don't even know what a petabyte is [laughs].

Jentsch: So a petabyte is—let's see; we're at terabytes—terabytes, gigabytes, so it's a, it's one million gigabytes.

Feltman: Wow.

Jentsch: And we're doing that now per year; it's gone up with each passing year. So when we first started taking data we were not taking so much data. The machine was at, you know, a much lower rate of collisions because we had to make sure the detector was safe, and computing power was not as good 25 years ago as it is now. So basically, as computing has caught up with what we wanna be able to do, we've increased the amount of data we take with each passing year to kind of make use of [laughs] all the computers we have available now.

Feltman: Yeah.

Jentsch: And so we've really stretched them to their max.

Feltman: What kinds of questions are you most excited to try to answer with the EIC?

Jentsch: So for me I'm probably interested in the stuff that's the less sexy aspects of the physics. I really wanna know the basic, fundamental aspects of the proton that we don't know. The proton mass, for example, it's a given; if you go into a chemistry textbook, there's a mass number there for the proton. But the quarks don't make up most of that mass. One percent of the mass of the proton comes from the quarks.

Feltman: Mm.

Jentsch: The rest of it is coming from the strong force itself, these interactions inside the proton. We still don't really understand how that works, and that's basic ...

Feltman: Yeah, yeah.

Jentsch: We know how much things weigh—we measure this all the time. Why don't we know how a proton gets the mass it has?

Feltman: Yeah.

Jentsch: So that's interesting to me. But then also even the proton spin. Spin is a less understood quantity, it's more esoteric, but we thought originally that this was coming just from the quarks. Then we learned that only about 30 percent comes from the quarks, so where the hell is the rest of it coming from? And so the EIC gives us the ability to combine data that we take at RHIC with the new data from the EIC and hopefully answer some of those questions.

There's stuff that's more interesting to other people in the community, such as what happens when you take a nucleus of gold, for example, and you accelerate it near the speed of light? And now it's incredibly complicated—it's quarks, it's gluons, but it's many, many, many gluons. The question is: Does it just keep producing gluons infinitely? Or does it—at some point does that production cease? If it does the former, that's new physics; that's going outside of what we know from quantum mechanics. If it kind of saturates at some point, then that would be something we more or less would expect, but we don't know, and that's kind of studying something that's in the same ballpark as the quark-gluon plasma. It's basically a state of matter that is dominated by the strong force. To people who have been interested in the RHIC program this is probably the fundamental thing they wanna focus on, is the, the heavy ion part of it—the really crazy stuff that happens when you make a heavy ion go near the speed of light.

Feltman: Yeah, and also very obvious question I should have started with: How big is it [laughs]?

Jentsch: [Laughs] So this thing is a little bit bigger than a three-story house.

Feltman: Wow.

Jentsch: It weighs about 1,200 tons. The detector that will replace this for the EIC weighs a few hundred tons more. It's not small. And most of what you see that's heavy is iron. So there's a big magnet inside of this, and that magnet has to have a place for those magnetic fields to go ...

Feltman: Mm-hmm.

Jentsch: So we have iron to protect and remove all that magnetic field. And then we have lots of detectors, somewhere like 10 subdetectors inside, but they're made up of thousands of components.

Feltman: When you're, like, talking to a member of the public and physics makes their head spin, what is your headline—like, “This is why what we're doing is really cool and important”—for them?

Jentsch: Well, we're made of protons and neutrons. Everything around us is made of protons,neutrons, electrons; they're fundamental. And we have an understanding of quite a bit of it—I mean, our chemistry textbooks and physics textbooks, there's a lot of information there.

Feltman: Mm-hmm.

Jentsch: But isn't it interesting to wanna understand how these things achieve their basic properties? We know they have an electric charge. We know they have a mass. At the end of the day it's a basic thing for human nature to try to understand the world around us. If we know we're made up of these things, we don't understand those things, it should be something that just drives our curiosity.

Additionally, it's really cool to be able to study things from the early universe in a laboratory environment. And the fact that you have to build something this large to study something so small is also rather insane.

Feltman: Yeah.

Jentsch: So in and of itself this is just kind of a wild idea: that we have a machine this large to study something that we cannot see with the human eye.

Feltman: Yeah.

Jentsch: And so my, my hope would be that that is enough to drive someone toward a little bit of curiosity: You know, what are we made of? Why are we made of it? How does it have the properties it has? That's really what kind of drives me toward it.

Feltman: Yeah, I think most people would agree that understanding the basic particles that make up literally everything is pretty important, so thanks so much for taking the time to tell us about it and show us around.

Jentsch: Yeah, thanks for having me, and I hope to see you again in 10 years when we start taking data with the EIC.

Metrics details

In isocitrate dehydrogenase wildtype glioblastoma (GBM), cellular heterogeneity across and within tumors may drive therapeutic resistance. Here we analyzed 121 primary and recurrent GBM samples from 59 patients using single-nucleus RNA sequencing and bulk tumor DNA sequencing to characterize GBM transcriptional heterogeneity. First, GBMs can be classified by their broad cellular composition, encompassing malignant and nonmalignant cell types. Second, in each cell type we describe the diversity of cellular states and their pathway activation, particularly an expanded set of malignant cell states, including glial progenitor cell-like, neuronal-like and cilia-like. Third, the remaining variation between GBMs highlights three baseline gene expression programs. These three layers of heterogeneity are interrelated and partially associated with specific genetic aberrations, thereby defining three stereotypic GBM ecosystems. This work provides an unparalleled view of the multilayered transcriptional architecture of GBM. How this architecture evolves during disease progression is addressed in the companion manuscript by Spitzer et al.

Tumor heterogeneity is a hallmark of isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) wildtype (WT) glioblastoma (GBM)1. Different GBM samples have distinct genetic and transcriptomic profiles (intertumor heterogeneity)2 and even a single GBM specimen contains diverse malignant and nonmalignant cells (intratumor heterogeneity)3,4. This diversity endows malignant GBM cells with distinct functional properties5 and is thought to enable them to evade therapies, leading to progression and relapse6. Nonmalignant cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME) establish an ecosystem with complex interactions that also plays critical roles in shaping GBM biology and treatment response5,7,8,9.

Previous studies used single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to uncover gene expression heterogeneity within human gliomas3,4,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17. These studies revealed that GBM malignant cells exhibit a variety of cellular states, including those resembling neurodevelopmental cell types. The frequency of these states in a particular tumor is influenced by genomic alterations and the TME7. However, previous studies had several limitations: (1) they were based on limited number of samples and cells and could still miss rare cellular states; (2) they relied on enzymatic tumor dissociation, which may deplete certain cell types and states, as evident by the scarcity of detected astrocytes, neurons and endothelial cells; (2) they addressed either heterogeneity across tumors (that is, tumor subtypes) or within tumors (that is, cell states) but did not develop an integrated model that explains tumor heterogeneity by a combination of tumor-level and cell-level features; (4) they lacked in-depth genetic characterization of the tumors; (5) they had limited clinical metadata; and (6) they were published by different groups, and leveraged diverse pipelines, analytics and classification schemes4,10,12,15,16.

To address these challenges, we created the GBM Cellular Analysis of Resistance and Evolution (CARE) consortium and profiled 121 IDH WT GBM samples using single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) and bulk DNA sequencing, thereby establishing a multi-omic dataset of unprecedented size while eliminating the confounding effects of enzymatic tumor dissociation. This dataset is richly annotated with clinical data and contains primary and recurrent matched pairs. In this article, we describe the identification of new GBM cellular states, for both the malignant and TME compartments. Furthermore, we describe new analyses that distinguish the contributions of intratumor and intertumor heterogeneity, toward a more complete understanding of the multilayered transcriptional architecture of GBM. The main conclusions of this article are independent of the timing of sampling (primary or recurrent) and can be reached by only analyzing primary GBM specimens, yet we include the recurrent samples for more robust statistical analysis and to provide a broad view of the range of GBM tumors. In the accompanying study by Spitzer et al.18, we focus on characterizing the longitudinal evolution of GBM after standard-of-care therapy.

Our groups jointly generated an snRNA-seq dataset of 121 tumor samples from 59 patients spanning initial disease and recurrence (Fig. 1a; see Supplementary Table 1 for detailed clinical information). All tumors were diagnosed as ‘Glioblastoma, IDH WT' based on the World Health Organization (WHO) 2021 classification, which was further confirmed using bulk DNA sequencing. We profiled all 121 samples with the droplet-based 10x Genomics platform, and also profiled a large subset of tumors (54 of 121) using plate-based full-length Smart-seq2 (ref. 19). Most samples (116 of 121) were also profiled using bulk whole-exome sequencing (WES) or whole-genome sequencing (WGS), enabling the integration of genetic information with single-nucleus transcriptomics (Fig. 1b and Supplementary Table 1). The frequency of common genetic alterations was consistent with previous studies of GBM20.

In the 10x snRNA-seq dataset, 429,305 of 752,458 cells passed our stringent quality control (Methods) with 2,318 genes detected per cell on average (Extended Data Fig. 1a). Cells were classified as malignant (246,408 cells) or nonmalignant (182,897 cells) by inferring chromosomal copy number aberrations (CNAs) from gene expression data, as described previously13,21, but with additional steps to improve classification accuracy (Extended Data Fig. 1b–d). Clustering of all cells highlighted the diversity of malignant cells, including many small patient-specific clusters, while nonmalignant cells were intermixed across patients without apparent batch effects (Fig. 1c and Extended Data Fig. 2a,b). Nonmalignant cells were assigned to cell types using clustering and well-established signatures (Extended Data Fig. 2c)22,23,24,25,26. Notably, we detected neurons and astrocytes (Fig. 1c,d) that were typically not captured in scRNA-seq studies with enzymatic tissue dissociation. In the Smart-seq2 dataset, 10,062 of 11,136 cells passed our quality control and were similarly classified to malignant and nonmalignant cell types (Extended Data Fig. 2d). Overall, the fractions of cell types were similar between 10x Genomics and Smart-seq2 datasets (Extended Data Fig. 2e–g).

We previously defined four principal cellular states in GBM based on 28 samples (7,930 cells) obtained at initial diagnosis4: neural-progenitor-like cells (NPC-like); oligodendrocyte-progenitor-like cells (OPC-like); astrocyte-like cells (AC-like); and mesenchymal-like cells (MES-like). While this robust classification scheme has been broadly adopted and validated by the community5,27,28,29, we sought to extend the atlas of GBM malignant cellular states by leveraging our much larger snRNA-seq dataset. First, nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) was used to derive gene expression programs that vary within each tumor30. After removing programs suspected of low technical quality (for example, enrichment of ribosomal proteins or pseudogenes; Methods), we found ten groups of similar programs and defined a consensus meta-program (MP) for each of them, representing the malignant cellular states in our dataset (Fig. 2a, Extended Data Fig. 3a and Supplementary Table 2).

a, Jaccard similarity indices of the robust NMF programs (n = 707) based on their top 50 genes. Programs are ordered according to clustering and grouped into MPs (Methods). MP10 (stress1) and MP15 (stress2) were coalesced into a single stress state. MP9 (excitatory neuron (ExN)) and MP14 (neurogranin neuron) were coalesced into a single NEU-like state. The ‘cycling' MP is separated to emphasize it as a feature that cells can have on top of their neurodevelopmental identity (and not as an independent state; Extended Data Fig. 3a). b, Gene expression scores of each cell for the different cellular states and the cell cycle. Cells are aggregated according to the state to which they were classified and are ordered within each group according to their cell cycle score. ‘Unresolved' represents cells that could not be confidently classified to a particular state. c, Relative expression (centered log2) of the three new MPs discovered in this work. Each row represents a gene and each column a cell. d, Association between the malignant MPs (rows) and gene sets reflecting normal brain development and adult brain cell types (columns). Each cell in the heatmap represents the Pearson correlation coefficient between the gene expression scores of an MP and a normal brain gene set across the malignant cells in the dataset. e, Association between pathway-based (rows) and gene-based (columns) MPs. Each cell in the heatmap represents the Pearson correlation coefficient between the gene expression scores of the pathway-based and gene-based MPs. The colored squares represent the seven groups of PMPs and their associated MPs. f, Demonstration of the hybrid state concept. The rows represent genes, which are aggregated according to the MP to which they belong. The columns represent cells, which are aggregated according to their singular (AC, GPC) or hybrid (AC-GPC) state. The heatmap of genes' centered log2 expression shows that hybrids express two MPs to the same extent, whereas singulars highly express a single MP. g, GBM cellular hierarchy model stemming from the high-frequency hybrid pairs. Each vertex represents a state; vertices are connected when they represent a high-frequency hybrid state. h, Two-dimensional representation of cellular states. Each quadrant reflects a cellular state and each dot represents a malignant cell; exact cell positions reflect their relative scores for the MPs, and their colors reflect the proportion of cells around them classified to the GPC state.

Overall, seven of the ten MPs largely recapitulate the patterns from ref. 4. One of these MPs represented the cell cycle and another five represented the previously defined cellular states: AC-like; OPC-like; NPC-like; MES-like; and hypoxia (previously denoted as MES2)4 (Fig. 2b). Another MP (stress) included genes associated with heat shock and unfolded protein response, which were previously included in the MES-like MP and associated with disordered DNA methylation12. Thus, high-resolution analysis divides MES-like states into three MPs that we termed MES-like, hypoxia and stress.

Although these seven MPs produce highly correlated cell scores as those from ref. 4 (Extended Data Fig. 3b), it is important to note that the exact sets of genes that define the MPs here and in ref. 4 differ (Extended Data Fig. 3c), suggesting platform-dependent effects such that distinct genes are highlighted by scRNA-seq versus snRNA-seq (Extended Data Fig. 3d). We also compared these MPs to prior GBM cell-state classifications, further corroborating their identities (Extended Data Fig. 3e)31,32.

The first new MP contained NPC-like genes but was mostly associated with markers of more differentiated neurons (NRG1, NRG3, NRXN3, CNTNAP2) and synaptic activity (SYN3, SYT1; Fig. 2c) and was similar to the NEU (neuronal) pathway-based program reported previously15. Consistent with a differentiated NEU state, cycling cells were depleted in this program relative to NPC-like cells (Extended Data Fig. 4a). Comparison to the signatures of neural cell types in development and in adult human brains showed the highest similarity to L2–L3 excitatory neurons (P = 7.2−5, hypergeometric test; Fig. 2d); thus, we named this state NEU-like. This state is depleted in single-cell relative to single-nucleus data4, suggesting that it may be poorly captured by enzymatic tumor dissociation, possibly because of complex cellular morphology.

The second new MP included the tyrosine kinase genes EGFR and ALK, the transcription factor genes MEIS1, MEOX2, ETV1, ELOVL2 and KLHDC8, which were previously linked to glioma stemness33,34,35. Comparison to normal brain signatures showed the strongest association with a recently described signature of glial progenitor cells (GPCs)36; hence, we denoted it as GPC-like. Consistent with a progenitor state, the GPC-like MP was enriched with cycling cells (Extended Data Fig. 4a). Like the NEU-like state, GPC-like cells were depleted in single-cell relative to single-nucleus data4.

The third new MP mostly contained cilia genes, including 12 of 50 DNAH and CFAP family members; therefore, it was named cilia-like. This MP was specific to a small fraction of cells (~1.6%), underscoring the utility of our large cohort for identifying rare cellular states. Notably, all of those cells also expressed the AC-like MP, indicating that a subset of AC-like cells activate a cilia program. As expected, this MP was most enriched with external cilia signatures. Therefore, all MPs are enriched with corresponding cell-type-signatures from developing or adult human brains24,26,36 (Fig. 2d), supporting our annotations and suggesting that GBM states mirror developmental trajectories32.

Collectively, our MPs are reflective of cell identity (for example, GPC-like, AC-like, NEU-like) or cell activity (for example, response to hypoxia or stress). We also scored malignant cells for signatures of functional attributes5,37,38, which suggested that AC-like and MES-like cells had greater connectivity, while OPC-like, NPC-like and NEU-like cells had greater motility and invasion scores, while cilia-like and GPC-like cells were intermediate (Extended Data Fig. 4b).

The new MPs defined from 10x data were validated in Smart-seq2; they were still detected when analyzing only primary samples and were detected independently in specimens profiled by different labs and obtained from different medical centers (Extended Data Fig. 4c–f). Overall, our analysis expands our original malignant GBM MPs to ten, some of which represent more granular subsets of the states in ref. 4.

As an orthogonal description of cellular states, we defined pathway-based MPs (PMPs) (Fig. 2e). We previously defined four PMPs, namely NEU, glycolytic/pluri-metabolic (GPM), mitochondrial (MTC) and proliferative/progenitor (PPR)15,39. To preserve a similar computational approach to the gene-expression-based MPs, we adapted the NMF-based algorithm to consider pathways instead of genes, including 3,015 pathway gene sets from the Molecular Signatures Database Hallmark, Gene Ontology (GO) and Reactome. This resulted in seven PMPs that recapitulated and extended the previously defined PMPs (Extended Data Fig. 5a–c).

We confirmed the existence of the NEU PMP, which correlated with the OPC-like, NPC-like and NEU-like MPs (Fig. 2e). We identified two distinct PMPs related to the previous GPM, one linked to glycolysis and hypoxia, and another closely resembling the MES-like state (denoted as GPM-MES). MTC-related and PPR-related PMPs also emerged from this analysis. We additionally identified two new PMPs, one similar to the AC-like and cilia-like MPs (AC-CIL), and another that is highly correlated with the GPC-like state, denoted as GPC/radial glia-like (RGL) (GPC-RGL). Overall, the association of PMPs and MPs provides further functional characterization to each state, supporting the identification and biological interpretation of the new malignant cell states.

Most malignant cells in our dataset were classified into a single state, yet roughly 20% of the cells could be classified into multiple states, with a limited difference between the two highest state scores (for an example, see Fig. 2f). These hybrid cells did not have a high number of detected genes as would be expected from technical doublets (two nuclei occupying the same droplet; Extended Data Fig. 5d). Moreover, hybrid cells were not distributed as expected across all state pairs but rather were highly enriched for certain state pairs (Extended Data Fig. 5e). Thus, we reasoned that these may represent cells in transition between two states, and constructed a GBM model where each node represents a cellular state and each edge reflects a high-frequency hybrid state (Fig. 2g).

Although this analysis lacks evidence for directionality, the differentiated cellular states (NEU-like, AC-like, cilia-like, MES-like and hypoxia) were all at the edges, while the three progenitor-like and stem-like states (NPC-like, OPC-like and GPC-like) were all in the center of the model. Specifically, the GPC-like state was positioned at the center of three trajectories (NEU, AC-cilia, hypoxia-MES), perhaps suggesting that this population represents an early progenitor state with differentiation potential along multiple trajectories. Consistent with this possibility, cells having high GPC-like scores tended to exhibit intermediate expression levels of programs for the other cellular states (Fig. 2h).

When assessing differences between samples, a dominant signal reflects variations in the abundance of shared cellular states. To highlight additional patterns of intertumor differences, we developed a cell-state-controlled approach in which we compared tumors only based on cells in corresponding states. First, each tumor sample was decomposed into subpopulations of cells representing seven common malignant states. For each subpopulation with a minimum of 25 cells in a particular sample, we then defined a state-specific pseudo-bulk (average) expression profile. Then, for each state, the pseudo-bulk profiles were compared across tumors, thereby eliminating state-specific signals and highlighting tumor-specific differences in that state. Principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to the pseudo-bulk profiles of each cell state, defining high and low signatures for the top three principal components (Fig. 3a).

a, Schematic of state-controlled analysis to define the BPs. b, Intertumor and intratumor variability of the BPs (n = 3) and MPs (that is, cell states, n = 7). Intertumor variability reflects the average variability measured between scores of different samples (defined as the average s.d. of program scores in each state across all states). Intratumor variability reflects the average variability measured between scores of same samples (defined as the average s.d. of program scores in each sample across all samples). Intertumor variability was significantly larger in BPs relative to MPs (mean score = 1.05 versus 0.65, P = 0.0005, one-sided t-test) whereas intratumor variability was significantly higher in MPs relative to BPs (mean score = 0.76 versus 0.62, P = 0.028, one-sided t-test). P values were not corrected for multiple testing. c, Intra-sample variability in BP scores across state-specific pseudo-bulk profiles. Each dot reflects a state-specific pseudo-bulk profile, is colored according to state and aggregated horizontally according to sample. The black horizontal lines connect pseudo-bulk profiles from the same sample as a visualization aid and have no other meaning. The black dots reflect the mean BP score of each sample and are connected using a line for visualization purposes. The dashed lines mark y = −1 and y = 1 to aid in visualization. The y axis shows the difference between the ECM and NEU BPs. d, Top, two-dimensional representation of the BPs. Each dot represents a specific sample (the mean score across the pseudo-bulks for each BP) and are colored according to the maximal score. The y axis reflect the BP-glial score, the x axis reflects the difference between the NEU and ECM BPs as follows: sign(NEU-ECM) × max(NEU, ECM). Bottom, limited intratumor variability in BP scores. Cells are colored according to the maximal BP score. Cellular states that reflects each quadrant are indicated on the right.

We found highly consistent signatures of intertumor variation across PCA analyses of different states. For example, signatures of variation across AC-like pseudo-bulk profiles were highly similar to signatures of variation across NPC-like pseudo-bulk profiles. Three sets of signatures were each identified in analyses of most states, reflecting patterns of intertumor heterogeneity that commonly influences several malignant states (Extended Data Fig. 6a). We denoted their consensus signatures as state-controlled baseline profiles (BPs), that is, consistent malignant gene expression differences between tumors that are not accounted by differences in tumor cell-state distribution.

We annotated BPs based on functional enrichment as NEU, glial and extracellular matrix (ECM) (Extended Data Fig. 6b and Supplementary Table 3). While BP annotations are reminiscent of cell-state MPs (that is, BP-NEU and NEU-like MP; BP-ECM and MES-like MP), we note that BPs and cell-state MPs reflected distinct sets of genes, such that MPs preferentially varied within tumors while BPs preferentially varied between tumors (Fig. 3b,c and Extended Data Fig. 6c) and remain consistent within a tumor (P = 2.3 × 10−9, Wilcoxon rank-sum test; Extended Data Fig. 6d). Accordingly, when we assigned tumors to BPs by averaging across the respective pseudo-bulks (Fig. 3d top; Extended Data Fig. 6e), we found that this classification tended to be consistent across different cellular states in the tumor (Fig. 3d bottom). In a tumor with high ECM BP, cells existed in multiple states but most tended to express high ECM, while in a tumor with high NEU BP most cells tended to express high NEU BP, even those in a MES-like state.

To examine whether BPs are consistent across regions of the same tumor, we leveraged a GBM spatial transcriptomics dataset that includes multi-sampled tumors37. We derived de novo BPs from the spatial transcriptomics data, resulting in three BPs that were highly correlated with the snRNA-seq-derived original BPs (Extended Data Fig. 7a,b). Sample pairs from the same tumor had significantly higher similarity in BP scores than sample pairs from different tumors (Extended Data Fig. 7c), supporting the consistency of BPs within tumors. Finally, we leveraged a subset of samples with both bulk RNA-seq and snRNA-seq data to compare the newly defined BPs to The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) expression subtypes17,40. We found a significant association (Fisher's exact test, P = 0.02) with the greatest overlap between the BP-ECM and the MES TCGA subtype (Extended Data Fig. 7d). Taken together, the three BPs reflect core intertumor transcriptional variation (that is, tumor-level phenotypes) that are partially independent of the variation in cellular states within tumors.

We next investigated how TME heterogeneity may influence malignant BPs and cell-state abundance. To accomplish this, we applied our NMF framework to derive TME MPs for each nonmalignant cell type (n = 62 total MPs; Fig. 4a). We annotated TME MPs based on pathway enrichment and by scoring cells for published signatures (Extended Data Fig. 8a–d, Supplementary Table 4 and Methods). TME MPs were linked to diverse functions, for example, reflecting cortical layers (among excitatory neurons), immune phenotypes (microglia versus bone marrow-derived macrophages) and differentiation status (immature versus mature oligodendrocytes). A subset of TME MPs had high overlap with malignant cell MPs (for example, hypoxia and MES-like), suggesting a similar effect of microenvironmental niches on multiple cell types30 (Extended Data Fig. 8e).

The size of the donut represents the relative proportion of all TME cells. b, Selected TME NMF state composition of tumors assigned to each BPs. The statistical significance of TME composition between samples with assigned BP to ECM (n = 23), glial (n = 39) or NEU (n = 35) was computed using a two-sided Kruskal–Wallis test (n = 97). c, Interaction graph between malignant cell states and TME cell type abundance.

Each green circled node represents a malignant cell state versus nonmalignant cell type pair, while each squared node represents a ligand–receptor interaction; there is an edge if that cross-talk is present. The thickness and color of the edge indicate the percentage of tumors in which both malignant cell state and nonmalignant cell type are present and the cross-talk exist. Open ‘(' and closed ‘)' parentheses reflect multiple ligand or receptor interaction from the same family. Specifically, closed parentheses ‘)' indicated multiple ligands interacting with the same receptor, and viceversa for closed ‘)' parentheses, multiple receptors interacting with the same ligand. UPR, unfolded protein response.

We assigned all TME cells to their highest-scoring TME MP (Methods). TME MP abundances differed significantly across GBMs mapping to the three BPs, suggesting an association between TME and BPs (Fig. 4b). Similarly, TME MP abundances were associated with malignant MP abundances (Extended Data Fig. 9a). Abundance of MES-like cells was associated with increased tumor-associated myeloid cells (TAMs) and monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs)4,7,9, but also with endothelial cells (Fig. 4c). Abundance of NEU-like malignant cells was associated with neurons, suggesting that nonmalignant neurons may interact with malignant cells and shape their states. Abundance of GPC-like cells was positively correlated with TAM-microglia; abundance of OPC-like malignant cells correlated with nonmalignant OPCs.

Collectively, these results indicate that malignant state abundance is associated with diverse TME cell types. Clustering of all states revealed two major TME-malignant compartments that probably reflect tumor periphery and core regions41 (Extended Data Fig. 9b). In particular, malignant hypoxia, stress and MES-like states were associated with inflammatory and hypoxic macrophages, reactive astrocytes, and inflammatory and angiogenic endothelial states (Fig. 4d). Thus, beyond shaping glioma cell identity3,4, hypoxia may cultivate an immunosuppressive ecosystem and induce astrocyte reactivity.

Finally, we used CellChat42 to quantitatively infer ligand–receptor interactions between malignant cell states and nonmalignant cell types. This resulted in two separate subnetworks, supporting the division into tumor core regions (Fig. 4e, left) versus periphery (Fig. 4e, right). Among those, we found (1) IGF1 and IGF1R cross-talk between TAM-MDM and MES-like cells, which is consistent with a proposed resistance mechanism43; (2) PTN-PTPRZ1 OPC cross-talk, which may promote tumor progression and invasion17,31; and (3) NLGN-NRXN and NRG-ERBB4 interactions between neurons and NEU-like cells, reported as potential therapeutic target in glioma44,45,46 (Fig. 4e). Taken together, GBM microenvironmental niches such as hypoxia, glial and NEU TME may serve as determinants of malignant and nonmalignant states.

Malignant gene expression profiles may also be driven by genetic alterations. Previously, we found that the CNAs of CDK4, PDGFRA and EGFR and mutations in NF1 were associated with inferred abundance of cellular states in bulk GBM data from TCGA4. To examine these associations in our snRNA-seq dataset, we analyzed malignant state abundance in samples with matched DNA profiling and sufficient malignant cells (n = 108 samples). As expected, we found associations between CDK4 amplification and NPC-like abundance, PDGFRA amplification and OPC-like abundance, and NF1 mutations and MES-like abundance (Fig. 5a; Wilcoxon rank-sum test, P < 0.05). In contrast, we did not observe an association between EGFR amplifications and AC-like abundance.

P value adjustments for multiple hypothesis testing were not performed. b, Cell type composition of each of the tumors (n = 121) in the dataset, aggregated based on their composition group. c, Malignant cell-state proportions (rows) in each tumor sample (n = 111 with at least 50 malignant cells; columns). Tumors are aggregated according to the dominant malignant state (at least 30% of cells). d, Interaction graph between the different layers of GBM (composition groups, malignant state groups, BPs, gene-level CNAs and single-nucleotide mutations). Each node represents a layer; nodes are connected with an edge if a statistically significant association exists between the nodes. mut, mutation.

We next tested whether EGFR amplifications, or other genetic alterations, might be associated with the newly identified states (Fig. 1b). The strongest associations were between canonical genetic alterations of GBM (that is, chromosome 7 gain, chromosome 10p loss, EGFR amplification and TERT promoter mutations) and increased GPC-like state abundance (Fig. 5a and Extended Data Fig. 10a). These canonical genetic alterations typically co-occur in GBM, so we compared samples with at least one of these alterations to those without. Tumors with canonical alterations had, on average, 12% GPC-like malignant cells, compared with less than 1% of those without (Wilcoxon rank-sum test, P = 0.003; Extended Data Fig. 10b), suggesting that the GPC-like state is rare in GBMs lacking canonical alterations.

Other associations included TP53 mutations linked to NEU-like abundance and chromosome 7 amplifications linked to hypoxia abundance, which is consistent with a recent study28. Similar analyses of BPs found that glial BP is more closely aligned with canonical GBM genetic alterations compared to ECM or NEU BPs (Extended Data Fig. 10c). Together, these results indicate an interplay between genetic alterations and specific cellular states, although our dataset may still be underpowered to detect additional associations given the low frequencies of GBM genetic alterations.

We defined three distinct layers of GBM transcriptional patterns: cell type composition; malignant cellular states; and BPs. To examine the associations across these layers, we first classified all samples according to each layer (Supplementary Table 5). Regarding cell type composition, tumors were divided into three main groups according to malignant fraction (high, intermediate and low); the latter group was further subdivided according to the dominant TME cell type (Fig. 5b). Regarding malignant state, most tumors were dominated by one state, thereby defining six groups (Fig. 5c). Finally, BPs were used to define three groups of tumors as described above (Fig. 3d).

Next, we investigated associations across layers (Fig. 5d). Each of the three BPs was significantly associated with classifications according to cell type composition and malignant state, as well as specific genetic events. BP-NEU was associated with the NEU-like and OPC and NPC-like states, with a glio-neural (GN)-rich (neurons, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes) TME and with TP53 and RB1 mutations. BP-ECM was associated with the MES-like and hypoxia states, with macrophage-rich TME and NF1 mutations. Finally, BP-glial was associated with the GPC-like state, with a highly malignant fraction and with EGFR and MDM2 amplifications (Fig. 5d).

These results define three multilayer ecosystems, each including correlated features among the three layers (Fig. 6a). Overall, 43% (52 of 121) of the samples could be robustly assigned to one of these three multilayer ecosystems, based on either two or three of its layers (Fig. 6b and Supplementary Table 6), which is significantly more than expected by chance (P < 0.01 for each ecosystem according to a binomial test). The remaining samples could be described according to individual layers but did not correspond to a stereotypic association between these layers (Extended Data Fig. 10d), highlighting the complexity and diversity of GBM ecosystems.

After the first report of scRNA-seq for 430 cells derived from five GBM samples3, technical progress has dramatically expanded the scale of single-cell profiling. In this study, we leveraged a large-scale single-nucleus dataset (~430,000 nuclei, 121 samples) to comprehensively redefine the GBM cellular architecture. We discovered three new cellular states that were not captured in previous glioma studies, including a differentiated NEU state (NEU-like), a new progenitor state (GPC-like) and a cilia-related state. The capacity to identify these new states may be due to the high number of samples and cells profiled in this study. Yet this explanation is insufficient given that two of the new states are relatively common in our data (6.7% NEU-like and 14.2% GPC-like cells). Thus, we speculate that these states were depleted by single-cell isolation protocols that require enzymatic digestion and may poorly capture specific cell states (for example, those with complex morphology). Single-nucleus protocols isolate nuclei using tissue homogenization in cold buffer, thus capturing a wider variety of cell types23,47. Accordingly, the newly described malignant states may resemble normal cells with complex cellular processes (for example, neurons, ciliated cells).

GBM cellular states resemble the programs observed in normal glial or NEU cell types. This finding is further supported by analysis of potential cellular transitions. Transitions between GBM states was demonstrated previously4, but the rate of specific transitions is unknown. We explored this question through quantification of hybrid states, based on the assumption that cells mapping to two states often reflect a transition. Only eight of the potential 38 hybrid states accounted for 71% of hybrids, highlighting the enrichment of specific hybrids and presumably the identity of common transitions. These putative transitions also mirror normal brain development, supporting the view that many aspects of GBM biology are inherited from the cell of origin.

Previous work noted that much of the diversity between GBMs is tightly linked to diversity within GBMs, such that tumor subtypes can be partially explained by the abundance of recurring cellular states. However, not all intertumor variation may be explained in this way; to our knowledge, no previous studies attempted to define the residual signal of intertumor heterogeneity. In this study, we addressed this issue by analyzing intertumor heterogeneity only among cells of the same cellular state, thereby controlling for the diversity of states within tumors. We found that the main patterns that vary between tumors in one state also vary in other states, thus defining a state-independent pattern of intertumor variability that may be thought of as reflecting a tumor baseline profile.

Notably, the three BPs we identified—NEU, ECM and glial—are functionally reminiscent of some of the malignant states that vary within tumors (NEU-like, MES-like and GPC-like), although they include distinct sets of genes. Moreover, these features are correlated, such that tumors with one BP also tend to be enriched with the related malignant state. We speculate that certain genetic and environmental features give rise to two related effects: a BP that influences all cells in the tumor and a higher fraction of cells with a certain expression program (that is, state). Thus, tumors with an NEU BP (represented by one set of NEU-related genes) also tend to have an abundance of cells that activate another set of genes that corresponds to the NEU-like MP. Similarly, tumors with an ECM BP also have an abundance of cells that activate genes of the MES-like MP. At bulk, the two phenomena of BP and frequency of certain MPs coalesce into the signal of GBM subtypes, while single-cell analysis allows us to dissect these distinct effects.

What might be the signals that concomitantly activate BP and frequencies of MPs? Our analysis shows a correlation of both of these malignant features with the TME. NEU malignant features are associated with low-purity tumors enriched with glial and neural TME cells. Mesenchymal and ECM malignant features are associated with low-purity tumors enriched with macrophages. Finally, glial malignant features are associated with high purity. In addition to the TME, we also found genetic events associated with a combination of tumor features: NF1 mutations, TP53 and RB1 mutations, and EGFR and MDM2 amplifications are linked to the ECM, NEU and glial ecosystems, respectively. Thus, we speculate that tumor genetics along with tumor location, which influences the tumor TME, define the propensity of each GBM toward a particular BP and enriched MP, culminating in three stereotypic ecosystems, each associated with multiple correlated components—tumor genetics, nonmalignant TME and two malignant features (BP and MP frequency). Nevertheless, the coupling between these components is only partial, such that around half of the tumors cannot be assigned to a stereotypical ecosystem but rather reflect unique combinations of features, highlighting the diversity and complexity of GBM.

In protocol 1 (laboratory 1 and laboratory 2 for the cohorts from Duke University, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Tokyo University Hospital, St. Michael's Hospital and Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital), nuclei from frozen tumor tissue were isolated. Tissue was thawed and mechanically dissociated in ST buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 146 mM NaCl, 1 mM CaCl2, 21 mM MgCl2) with 0.49% CHAPS (no. 28300, Merck Millipore). Single-nucleus suspensions were filtered using a 40-μm strainer, centrifuged at 500g for 5 min and resuspended in ST buffer supplemented with 0.01% BSA (cat. no. B9000S, New England Biolabs). Nuclear suspensions were inspected by microscope, counted using a hemocytometer and used for 10x Genomics workflow or fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) for the Smart-seq2 workflow.

In protocol 2 (laboratory 3 for the cohorts from NORLUX and Seoul National (SNU) cohorts), tissue samples were thawed and mechanically dissociated in Nuclei EZ Lysis Buffer (NUC101, Sigma-Aldrich) using dounce homogenization. Solutions were incubated on ice for 5 min and mixed 1–2 times during incubation. Single-nucleus suspensions were filtered through a 70-μm strainer and centrifuged at 500g for 5 min at 4 °C, resuspended in Nuclei EZ Lysis Buffer and incubated on ice for 5 min. Solutions were centrifuged at 500g for 5 min at 4 °C and resuspended in 1% BSA, 0.2 U μl−1 RNase inhibitor and PBS buffer (three times). For the final resuspension, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole was added to the buffer; the solution was filtered through a 40-μm strainer, cells were counted on a Countess II Automated Cell Counter (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and nuclei were taken into the 10x Genomics workflow.

The Chromium Single Cell 3′ Reagent Kit Vv3 (cat. no. PN1000128, 10x Genomics) was used according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, nuclei were loaded on the Chromium Chip (cat. no. PN12000120, 10x Genomics) with a target cell recovery of 6,000–8,000 nuclei and processed in the Chromium Controller. Single nuclei were partitioned into Gel Beads-in-emulsion, followed by RNA reverse transcription with barcoding. Libraries were created by breaking the Gel Beads-in-emulsion and pooling barcoded fractions, complementary DNA amplification, fragmentation and attachment of sample index and adapter, and sequenced on the NextSeq 500 or NovaSeq (Illumina) platform, with paired-end 28–91 bp reads. For the NORLUX and SNU cohorts, nuclei were loaded on a Chromium Chip with a target cell recovery of 6,000 nuclei for single-cell multi-omic assay for transposase-accessible chromatin and gene expression according to the manufacturer's protocol. The gene expression chemistry for the 10x multi-ome possesses the same chemistry as the 10x v3 3′ snRNA-seq.

The nuclear suspension was stained using the Vybrant DyeCycle Ruby Stain (cat. no. V10309, Thermo Fisher Scientific) immediately before FACS. Single-nucleus sorting was performed on a FACSAria Fusion Sorter (Becton Dickinson) using a 640-nm laser (Ruby, 670/14 filter) (Extended Data Fig. 2d). After doublet discrimination, intact nuclei were selected with ruby+ and were sorted into 96-well plates containing TCL buffer (cat. no. 1031576, QIAGEN) with 1% 2-mercaptoethanol (cat. no. M6250, Sigma-Aldrich). Plates were frozen on dry ice immediately after sorting and stored at −80 °C before whole-transcriptome amplification, library preparation and sequencing.

Whole-transcriptome amplification, library construction and sequencing were performed as previously published with slight modification for the nucleus as follows4,19. Briefly, on 96-well plates, RNA derived from single nuclei was first purified with Agencourt RNAClean XP beads (cat. no. A66514, Beckman Coulter). Then, Oligo(dT)-primed reverse transcription was performed using Maxima H Minus Reverse Transcriptase (cat. no. EP0753, Thermo Fisher Scientific) and locked TSO oligonucleotide (5′-AAGCAGTGGTATCAACGCAGAGTACATrGrG+G-3′, QIAGEN). This was followed by PCR amplification (22 cycles for snRNA-seq) using the KAPA HiFi HotStart ReadyMix (cat. no. K2602, KAPA Biosystems) with subsequent Agencourt AMPure XP Bead (cat. no. A63882, Beckman Coulter) purification. Libraries were tagmented using the Nextera XT Library Prep Kit (cat. no. FC-131-1096, Illumina) with custom barcode adapters. Libraries from 768 cells with unique barcodes were pooled and sequenced on a NextSeq 500 or NovaSeq 6000 sequencer (Illumina), with paired-end 38 bp reads.

WES for the samples from Duke University, the MD Anderson Cancer Center, Tokyo University Hospital and St. Michael's Hospital was performed as follows. DNA was extracted from each frozen tumor sample and blood samples corresponding to the patients using the DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit (cat. no. 69504, QIAGEN). Genomic DNA (100–250 ng) was acoustically sheared using an ultrasonicator (Covaris), targeting 150-bp fragments. Library preparation was performed using the KAPA HyperPrep Kit (cat. no. KK8504, KAPA Biosystems) followed by enzymatic cleanup using AMPure XP beads. Exome capture was performed using a custom exome bait (manufactured by Twist Bioscience to Broad Institute's specifications). Captured libraries were sequenced with 150 bp paired-end sequencing on a NovaSeq 6000. For the samples from Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital, after DNA was fragmented by a LE220 ultrasonicator (Covaris) and size-selected, library preparation and capture were performed using Twist Human Core Exome kit (Twist Bioscience) according to manufacturer's protocol. Sequencing was performed on a NovaSeq 6000, with 200-bp paired-end sequencing.

Newly generated whole-genome DNA sequencing data were collected for a cohort of frozen samples from the NORLUX Neuro-oncology Laboratory. Briefly, DNA was extracted from each tumor sample using the AllPrep DNA/RNA Mini Kit (cat. no. 80204, QIAGEN) for samples with sufficient tumor tissue and matched normal blood when it was available. Selected tissue for bulk DNA isolation was adjacent to tissue used for single-nucleus data generation. Briefly, DNA was sheared to 400 bp using an LE220 ultrasonicator (Covaris) and size-selected using AMPure XP beads. Whole-genome libraries were prepared and sequenced with 150 bp paired-end sequencing on a NovaSeq 6000 platform. WGS data for the SNU cohort was prepared in an identical manner and was previously reported in ref. 9. Data for the SNU cohort are available on Synapse (https://www.synapse.org/glass).

No statistical method was used to predetermine sample size. All available samples were provided by the aforementioned centers and no data were excluded from the analyses. For figures containing box plots, the box spans from the first to third quartiles, median values are indicated by a horizontal line and the whiskers show 1.5× the interquartile range; individual sample points are presented. The statistical analysis described in this work was done using R v.4.0.1 and above.

DNA sequencing alignment, fingerprinting, somatic variant detection (Mutect2) and copy number segmentation was performed in accordance with the Genome Analysis Toolkit best practices using the Genome Analysis Toolkit v.4.0.10.1, as described previously9,48. Briefly, whole-exome and whole-genome reads were aligned to the b37 genome (human_g1k_v37_decoy) using the Burrows–Wheeler Aligner MEM v.0.7.17. DNA fingerprint analysis using ‘CrosscheckFingerprints' (Picard) confirmed that all samples belonging to a patient came from the same individual, indicating that there were no sample mismatches in this study. Somatic mutations were detected using Mutect2 (v.4.1.0.0) for tumor samples with a matched normal blood sample. A panel of normals was constructed for each sequencing batch to account for differences in DNA library preparation (for example, whole-genome versus whole-exome) and used to filter out common artifactual and germline variants. Patient tumor samples without matched normal blood were analyzed for copy number alterations but not for SNV detection.

For Smart-seq2 sequencing data, the reads were mapped to the UCSC hg19 human transcriptome using Bowtie with the following parameters:-q-phred33-quals -n -e 99999999 -l 25 -I 1 -X 2000 -a -m 15–best -S -p 6. For droplet-based sequencing data, the Cellranger v.3.1.0 pipeline provided by 10x Genomics was used for alignment (GRCh38 release 93) and to generate count matrices. Smart-seq2 gene expression levels were quantified as \({E}_{i,\,j}=\log 2(\frac{{{\mathrm{TPM}}}_{i,\,j}}{10}+1)\) where TPMi,j refers to transcripts per million for gene i in sample j, as calculated using RSEM. For droplet-based sequencing data, we quantified the gene expression levels as \({E}_{i,\,j}=\log 2(\frac{{{\mathrm{CPM}}}_{i,\,j}}{10}+1)\), where CPMi,j refers to counts per million for gene i in sample j. We divided the TPM and CPM values by ten as the size of single-cell libraries is estimated to be in the order of 100,000 transcripts; therefore, we wanted to avoid inflating the expression levels by counting each transcript approximately ten times. After these normalization steps, initial filtering of low-quality cells was done based on the low number of detected genes (fewer than 200 genes) or the high expression of mitochondrially encoded genes (more than 3%). Most low-quality cells were removed downstream in case they could not be robustly classified as malignant or nonmalignant (see the later sections on the CNA analysis). Lastly, we computed the average expression of each gene i as \(\log 2[(\frac{1}{n}{\sum }_{j=1}^{n}{{\mathrm{TPM|CPM}}}_{i,\,j})+1]\) and filtered out lowly expressed genes by limiting the analyzed genes to the top 3,000 most highly expressed genes (using the Seurat v.4.0.4 (ref. 49) function CreateSeuratObject). For the cells and genes that passed these quality control filters, we defined relative expression levels by centering the expression levels for each gene across all cells in the dataset as follows: \({{Er}}_{i,\,j}={E}_{i,\,j}-\,\frac{1}{N}{\sum }_{k=1}^{N}{E}_{i,k}\) where N is the number of cells in the dataset.

To facilitate clustering, cell type annotation and scoring of droplet-based data, we used the R package Seurat v.4.0.4 (ref. 49). Unique molecular identifier count data were normalized and scaled (using the NormalizeData and ScaleData functions) and then clustered by projecting the data to a lower dimensional space using PCA and then running the FindNeighbors and FindClusters functions. Initial classification of tumor-associated macrophages, T cells, oligodendrocytes and endothelial cells was based on the expression of known marker genes22,23,24,25,26, whereas the rest of the cells were annotated as presumed malignant. After classification of cells as malignant or nonmalignant (see the following two sections), cells classified as nonmalignant were scored (using the AddModuleScore function) for known cell-type-signatures and assigned a cell type using the method explained in the section ‘Assignment of cells to states'. Finally, heterotypic doublets were filtered our using the R package scDblFinder50.

CNAs were estimated as described previously4,13,14,21 using the function infercna from the R package infercna (an implementation of the original method presented in ref. 3, which is available at https://github.com/jlaffy/infercna) with default parameters. Briefly, the algorithm sorts the analyzed genes in each sample according to their chromosomal location and applies a moving average with a sliding window of 100 genes in each chromosome to the relative expression values. The scores computed for the cells classified as nonmalignant (oligodendrocytes, macrophages and endothelial cells) define the baseline of the normal karyotype and their average CNA values are used to center the values of all cells.

In cells classified using single-nucleus droplet-based sequencing, we generally encountered a lower CNA signal and continuous signal distributions related to (1) lower data quality relative to that observed in single-cell data, and (2) inclusion of nonmalignant cell types, such as astrocytes and neurons, in the presumed malignant group as these cell types could not be classified a priori as nonmalignant because of transcriptional similarity with malignant cells.

Therefore, we used a multi-step classification scheme for the droplet-based, single-nucleus sequencing data.

For each cell j, we computed the CNA signal on each chromosome separately as \({{\mathrm{CNA}}}_{j}^{C}=\frac{1}{n}{\sum }_{i=1}^{n}{{\mathrm{CNA}}}_{i,\,j}^{C}\) where n is the number of genes on chromosome C included in the analysis. We fitted a normal distribution (that is, a classifier) to the signal distributions of the reference cells for each chromosome (using the function fitdistr from the R package MASS v.7.3-56). This enabled assigning each cell with a P value for each chromosome using a two-sided z-test (function pnorm from the R package stats) reflecting whether the cell had a CNA signal that was significantly different than expected from nonmalignant cells. These P values were further corrected for multiple testing (for each chromosome) using the Benjamini–Hochberg method; cells with Benjamini–Hochberg-adjusted P < 0.05 for a particular chromosome were considered as having a copy number event on that chromosome (either amplification or deletion based on the sign of the CNA signal). Cells with an unadjusted P < 0.05 for a particular chromosome that failed to achieve statistical significance after adjustment were considered to have a ‘suspicious event' on that chromosome. Then, inferred copy number events were cross-referenced with copy number calls from the WES and WGS data; only events detected in both methods were considered for classification and were termed ‘real' events. For a subset of samples, this procedure was not possible because of (1) lack of WES or WGS data, or (2) inability to call CNA events from WES or WGS because of low purity or quality. For this subset of cases, we defined a panel of highly recurring CNA events (intersection of highly recurring events inferred from the snRNA-seq and WES and WGS data), which were used as a short-list of potential events. Cells classified a priori as nonmalignant were reclassified as ‘unresolved' in case a ‘real' or ‘suspicious' CNA event was detected and ‘nonmalignant' otherwise. Presumed malignant cells with at least one ‘real' CNA event were classified as ‘malignant'; those with a ‘suspicious' event were classified as ‘unresolved' and those with no events at all (‘real' or ‘suspicious') were classified as ‘nonmalignant'.

We defined the CNA correlation as the Pearson correlation between each cell and the average CNA profile of the tumor sample the cell originated from. We limited the computation to the chromosomes on which ‘real' events were detected and a control panel of ~1,000 genes from the other chromosomes. Based on the distribution of CNA correlations across the cells classified as malignant, we defined 0.5 as the lower threshold of malignancy. To determine the upper threshold for nonmalignancy, we performed SNV calling from the snRNA-seq data to estimate the algorithm misclassification rate. Briefly, for each sample with available WES data, we called SNVs for each cell using the Vartrix tool (https://github.com/10XGenomics/vartrix) from the FASTQ files. Misclassified cells were defined as cells harboring a malignant mutation that were classified as nonmalignant in step 1 of the algorithm. After a cost-effectiveness analysis (misclassification rate versus percentage of excluded cells), we set 0.35 as the upper threshold for nonmalignancy. Finally, cells classified as malignant with CNAcor < 0.5 or cells classified as nonmalignant with CNAcor > 0.35 were reclassified as ‘unresolved' and excluded from the downstream analysis.

To refine the classification, we defined confidence levels. Confidence level 1 includes cells classified as malignant that harbored a malignant SNV, cells in which at least 50% of the expected CNA events were detected including chromosome 7 amplification or chromosome 10 deletion, and cells classified as nonmalignant with CNAcor < 0.25. Confidence level 2 includes cells classified as malignant in which at least 50% of the expected CNA events were detected that do not include chromosome 7 amplification or chromosome 10 deletion, cells classified as malignant in which less than 50% of the expected CNA events were detected, including chromosome 7 amplification or chromosome 10 deletion, and cells classified as nonmalignant with CNAcor < 0.5. The rest of the cells classified as malignant or nonmalignant were assigned confidence level 3. In the analysis presented in this work, we used only cells in confidence levels 1 and 2.

To capture the heterogeneity between cells from the same cell type, we leveraged the NMF51. NMF was performed on the relative expression values of each sample independently after setting negative values to zero. The NMF algorithm requires defining a priori the ‘k' parameter, reflecting the expected number of latent features in the data. Since k varies between samples and is largely unknown, we ran the NMF algorithm on each sample using different values (3–10), thereby generating 52 programs for each sample. Each of these NMF programs was summarized using the top 50 genes based on the NMF coefficients. Derivation of the MPs from the NMF programs was described thoroughly by in ref. 30 and is described briefly here. The method first filters out NMF programs that are not robust (do not recur in the sample they originated from or across several samples) or are redundant in the sample (that is, they highly overlap other NMF programs in that sample). Then, robust NMF programs are clustered according to Jaccard similarity using a customized clustering algorithm that iteratively considers the degree of overlap between robust NMF programs and combines highly overlapping ones to form a cluster. The R 50 most-recurring genes in each cluster define an MP.

Overall, the algorithm yielded 16 MPs that were annotated based on functional enrichment analysis (using GO terms, Molecular Signatures Database Hallmark gene sets and gene sets derived from normal brain development datasets). MP16 included genes from several cell types resulting in an MP that fitted almost all cells and thereby did not reflect any heterogeneity; thus, it was excluded from the analysis. This same procedure was independently repeated for each nonmalignant cell type.

Malignant cells were scored for the NMF MPs using the Seurat function AddModuleScore. To facilitate cell classification, we generated 20 shuffled expression matrices by sampling each time 5,000 cells and shuffling the expression values for each gene. We then scored each shuffled matrix for the NMF MPs, thereby yielding 100,000 normally distributed scores for each expression program. These served as null distributions for cell-state classification. For each original cell, we computed a P value for each of the expression programs with a z-test (using the R pnorm function) using the statistics of the null distributions that we generated previously. We adjusted all P values for multiple testing using the Benjamini–Hochberg method. Each cell was classified into a specific state if the adjusted P value computed for that state was smaller than 0.05. Cells that achieved Padj < 0.05 for multiple states were assigned to the state for which they scored maximally. Cells that did not achieve Padj < 0.05 for any of the states were assigned an ‘unresolved' state.

Cells were assigned a ‘cycling' state on top of their cellular state if they achieved Padj < 0.05 for the cell cycle MP and ‘non-cycling' otherwise.

We define hybrids as cells scoring significantly (that is, with Padj < 0.05) for at least two cellular states with a difference between the top two significant scores smaller than expected by chance. To quantify the score difference expected by chance, we leveraged on the null distribution generated for the state classification algorithm and computed for each artificial cell the difference between the top two states. The 95 quantiles of this score difference distribution (equal to a difference of 0.24) was set as the threshold for determining if a state was singular or hybrid.

To estimate the expected frequency of technical hybrids, we first computed for each pair of states (A, B) the expected frequency of hybrids, defined as \({\mathrm{Exp}}\left({\mathrm{A,B}}\right)={\mathrm{Freq}}\left({\mathrm{A}}\right)\times {\mathrm{Freq}}\left({\mathrm{B}}\right)\) and the observed/expected ratio defined as \({\log }_{2}(\frac{{\mathrm{Obs}}({\mathrm{A,{B}}})}{{\mathrm{Exp}}({\mathrm{A,B}})})\). As this is an overestimation of the expected frequency attributed to technical effects, we estimated this technical factor (TF) by averaging across observed/expected ratios of hybrid pairs detected less than expected by chance (that is, observed/expected < 0). Then, we computed the expected frequency of technical hybrids for each hybrid pair by multiplying the expected frequency with the technical factor and defined the observed/expected ratio as \({\log }_{2}(\frac{{\mathrm{Obs}}({\mathrm{A,{B}}})}{{{\mathrm{TF}}}\times {\mathrm{Exp}}({\mathrm{A,B}})})\). Finally, we filtered out insignificant hybrid pairs with large observed/expected ratio (attributed to small numbers) using a one-sided Fisher's test. The hybrid lineage model was generated using the R package igraph, with cell states as nodes and edges connecting the states that formed significant hybrid pairs. We did not include the ‘cycling' state in this analysis because we did not view ‘cycling' as an independent state but rather as an additional feature that cells can have on top of their neurodevelopmental identity (that is, AC-like, OPC-like, and so on).

Each tumor sample was decomposed to up to seven pseudo-bulk profiles (one for each of the common states—AC-like, MES-like, hypoxia, GPC-like, OPC-like, NPC-like, NEU-like—given at least 25 cells classified to that particular state) by averaging across the normalized unique molecular identifier counts and log2-transforming. Genes were included if their mean log2 expression value across all pseudo-bulks was at least 1 and if their median variance (computed separately within state) was at least 2.5. Overall, 1,005 genes passed these filters. Then, pseudo-bulks were analyzed within state to remove the state-specific signal using PCA. We then derived six gene programs from each state (top and bottom 50 genes of the first three principal components), computed the Jaccard similarity index between each pair of programs and hierarchically clustered the similarity matrix using the ConsensusClusterPlus package (v.1.56.0). Analysis of the cumulative distribution function revealed minor increases in area under the curve for k > 5 (where k is the number of clusters); therefore, k = 5 was chosen as the number of clusters. Then, we derived five consensus signatures by including genes that recurred in at least 25% of programs in each of the clusters (with a hard minimum of at least three times). Using manual inspection and GO enrichment, we annotated the consensus signatures. Two signatures were excluded because of short length or high suspicion of reflecting a technical artifact. To exclude the possibility that ambient RNA had a role in driving the BPs, we estimated the contamination by ambient RNA per sample using the R package SoupX (v.1.6.2). There was no difference in the estimated contamination level across the different BPs and no significant overlap between the top most contaminated genes per sample and the MP or BP signatures (data not shown).

To measure the differences in tumor composition, we generated for each tumor sample a composition vector reflecting the proportion of each cell type in the tumor sample. This enabled assigning tumors to three main composition groups: high malignant fraction (percentage of malignant cells > 75%); intermediate malignant fraction (percentage of malignant cells 50–75%); and low malignant fraction (percentage of malignant cells < 50%), where the low malignant fraction group could be further subdivided according to the dominant TME cell types (percentage of TAM, oligodendrocyte, GN > 40%, or mixed in case of no dominant TME cell type). Similarly, we defined the proportion vectors for the malignant cell states and assigned tumors to six groups according to the dominant cell state (at least 25% of cells assigned to the particular state)—AC, MES/hypoxia, GPC, OPC/NPC, NEU and mixed (in case of no dominant state). Tumors were classified according to the BP with maximal score and to the mixed category if the maximal score was less than 0.25.

The association between each pair of features (A, B) was computed using a binomial test with the number of times the pair was observed as the number of successes, the number of tumor samples as the number of experiments and the frequency of feature A times the frequency of feature B as the expected probability of success (under the assumption that the features were independent). We then generated an undirected graph by defining each feature as a node and connecting the nodes with edges when a statistically significant association (P < 0.05, unadjusted for multiple testing) between the two features was observed.

a, Total counts (left), number of detected genes (middle), and mitochondrial expression proportion (right) per cell across the whole dataset. The vertical lines represent the 10% and 90% quantiles. b, Flow diagram of the CNA calling algorithm used to classify cells as malignant or non-malignant. CNA signal reflects the extent of CNAs on each chromosome per cell. CNA correlation reflects the similarity between the CNA pattern of each cell and the overall CNA pattern of the tumor. SNV - single nucleotide variation. c, Sample-level copy number aberrations. Rows represent samples, columns represent chromosomes, values reflect the average CNA signal across all cells classified as malignant in the tumor. d, Cost-effectiveness of the 2nd step of classification. Top panel shows the % of misclassified cells (that is cells harboring a malignant SNV that were classified as non-malignant in the 1st step) that remain for each CNA correlation threshold. Bottom panel shows the % discarded cells for each CNA correlation threshold. Dashed line marks the upper threshold for non-malignancy (0.35).

a, UMAP colored by the lab that processed the tumor specimens and generated the 10x snRNA-seq data. b, Proportion (%) of samples contributing to each cluster of cells. Each dot represents a cluster and is colored by the dominant cell type in the cluster (n = 195, 11, 6, 6, 43, 5, 45, 6 for Malignant, Excitatory neuron, Endothelial, Astrocyte, Oligodendrocyte, Inhibitory neuron, TAM and Lymphocyte cell types respectively). Y axis reflects the proportion (%) of samples (out of all samples in which the cell type was detected) that contribute to the cluster. c, Heatmaps representing the average gene expression level (log2 relative expression) of cell type marker genes within each TME cell type for the 10x dataset. d, Gating strategy for single nuclei sorting for Smart-seq2. First, ruby positive proportion (P1, top) was selected by 570 nm laser. Then, doublet discrimination was performed by strict forward scatter height (FSC-H) versus area (FSC-A) criteria (P2, bottom left). It was further gated by removing 480 nm laser positive fraction was to exclude false positive proportion (P3, bottom right), and was sorted into 96 well plates for Smart-seq2. e, Heatmaps representing the average gene expression level (log2 relative expression) of cell type marker genes within each TME cell type for the Smart-seq2 dataset. Data generated at the two different labs was analyzed separately. f, Pie chart demonstrating the proportion (%) of each cell type in the Smart-seq2 dataset (two labs data combined, left), and 10x dataset considering only the same samples profiled also by Smart-seq2 (right). g, Boxplots of cell type proportions (%) in each tumor (n = 44) in both 10x (red) and Smart-seq2 (SS2, blue). Pearson's correlations of the proportions of each cell type are reported below each panel. Lines connect the cell type proportions of the patient's tumor profiled with both 10x and SS2.

a, Jaccard similarity indices of the robust NMF programs (n = 835) based on their top 50 genes. Programs are ordered by clustering and grouped into meta-programs (Methods). MP10 (Stress1) and MP15 (Stress2) were coalesced into a single Stress state. MP9 (ExN) and MP14 (NRGN neuron, NRGN) were coalesced into a single NEU-like state. MP1 (Ribosomal protein, RP), MP11 (Doublet), MP12 (Low quality, LQ) reflect low quality and are not considered a state. b, Correlation between cell state scores of meta-programs derived from this dataset (columns) and those derived by Neftel et al. (rows). Each cell was scored within tumor-of-origin for both sets of meta-program signatures. Pearson's correlation coefficient was computed across all cells for each pair of meta-programs. c, Jaccard similarity between meta-programs derived from this dataset (columns) and those derived by Neftel et al. (rows). d, Distribution of scores in this dataset (upper panel) and Neftel et al. (lower panel) dataset of cells that scored maximally for both corresponding states (for example to both AC-like signatures derived from this dataset and from Neftel et al.) across all corresponding states. Dashed vertical lines mark the mean score of each distribution. e, Association between the malignant MPs from our datasets (rows) and malignant signatures from other studies (columns). Each cell in the heatmap represents the Pearson correlation coefficient between the gene expression scores of an MP and other signature scores across the malignant cells in the dataset.

a, Percent cycling cells in each subpopulation across samples with at least 50 cells in any of the states (n = 84, 16, 51, 67, 60, 65, 61, 28, 70 for AC-like, Cilia-like, Hypoxia, MES-like, Stress, NEU-like, GPC-like, NPC-like and OPC-like states respectively). NPC-like (13.6%) vs. NEU-like (9.5%) p = 0.012, GPC-like (12.5%) vs. AC-like (1%) p < 2.2−16 and vs. MES-like (6.6%) p = 0.0001 (one-sided Wilcoxon rank sum test for all comparisons). b, Pearson's correlation coefficient heatmap between GBM state signature scores defined in this dataset and published functional gene signature scores. The published signature name is followed by each study's lead author in parentheses. c, Pearson's correlation of the proportions (%) of cells classified in each MP per tumor in both 10x (rows) and Smart-seq2 (columns). d, Similarity of MPs derived using all samples (x-axis) and MPs derived using primary (untreated) samples. e, Proportion (%) of contributing samples to each MP (relative to the number of samples profiled by each lab). f, Proportion (%) of contributing samples to each MP (relative to the number of samples provided from each sample source).

a, Jaccard similarity indices of the robust NMF programs based on their top 50 pathways. Programs are ordered by clustering and grouped into Pathway-based metaprograms (PMPs) according to their functional activities. b, Clustering of the PMPs based on their pairwise Pearson correlations reveal functional activity groups. c, Scores of each cell for the different PMPs. Cells are aggregated by the PMP to which they were classified. “Unresolved” represents cells that could not be classified to a PMP. d, Average number of detected genes per sample (n = 121) for singular and hybrid cells. Two-sided t-test was used to test for statistical significance. e, Relative frequency (in log2 scale) of observed hybrids vs. expected technical hybrids (Methods) for each of the possible state pairs (order within a pair is meaningless). Dashed line marks log2(Fold Change) = 2 to aid in visualization. Statistical significance was assessed for each hybrid state pair using a one-sided Fisher's exact test. P values were corrected for multiple testing using the Benjamini-Hochberg method. The bar plots were colored according to the BH-adjusted p-value.

a, Jaccard similarity matrix of the PCA-derived gene programs colored by cluster (see Methods). b, GO enrichment results for C1 (BP-ECM), C3 (BP-Neuronal) and C5 (BP-Glial) program clusters. Nodes represent enriched terms. Node color represents the extent of statistical significance and size represents the number of overlapping genes. Edges connect terms with a Jaccard similarity above 0.2 c, Same as Fig. 3c but here shown are the three BP scores. d, Observed vs. expected within-sample standard deviation (SD) of BP scores. Observed SD was defined as the SD across state-specific pseudo-bulk profiles in each tumor, shown are n = 98 samples with at least 3 pseudo-bulk profiles. Expected SD was estimated by randomly sampling n = 100 times 3 pseudo-bulk profiles and computing the SD across these PBs. Statistical significance was assessed with a two-sided Wilcoxon rank sum test. Each box plot represents a specific group (that is observed or expected) that spans from the first to third quartiles, median values are indicated by a horizontal line, whiskers show 1.5× interquartile range, and each dot reflects a specific standard deviation value. e, Same as Fig. 3d but here shown are the individual state scores in the 3-axis plane.

a, Same as Fig. 3c for the BP derived de-novo from the spatial transcriptomics data. For each tumor sample on the x-axis, the points represent the scores of the pseudobulk of that sample for a specific spatial equivalent of a state (Methods). b, Pearson's correlation between scores of de-novo spatial BPs (rows) and those derive from the snRNAseq data (columns) with p-values (unadjusted for multiple testing) for each comparison in the tile. c, Euclidean distance between BP scores of samples resected from the same tumor (n = 6 distances from 4 tumor samples) and samples resected from different tumors (n = 225 distances from 22 tumor samples). Each point represents a Euclidian distance between BP scores of two samples. Statistical significance was estimated using a two-sided t-test. d, TCGA subtype and the association with BP assignment.

Metrics details

The evolution of isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)-wildtype glioblastoma (GBM) after standard-of-care therapy remains poorly understood. Here we analyzed matched primary and recurrent GBMs from 59 patients using single-nucleus RNA sequencing and bulk DNA sequencing, assessing the longitudinal evolution of the GBM ecosystem across layers of cellular and molecular heterogeneity. The most consistent change was a lower malignant cell fraction at recurrence and a reciprocal increase in glial and neuronal cell types in the tumor microenvironment (TME). The predominant malignant cell state differed between most matched pairs, but no states were exclusive or highly enriched in either time point, nor was there a consistent longitudinal trajectory across the cohort. Nevertheless, specific trajectories were enriched in subsets of patients. Changes in malignant state abundances mirrored changes in TME composition and baseline profiles, reflecting the co-evolution of the GBM ecosystem. Our study provides a blueprint of GBM's diverse longitudinal trajectories and highlights the treatment and TME modifiers that shape them.

Despite significant advances in basic and translational research, isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)-wildtype glioblastoma (GBM)1 remains incurable. The standard treatment for newly diagnosed GBM consists of maximal surgical resection followed by radiotherapy and concurrent treatment with the alkylating agent temozolomide (TMZ). This treatment often elicits a partial response, particularly when the promoter of the O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) gene is methylated, as this gene encodes a DNA-repair protein that can remove alkyl groups added to O6-methylguanine by TMZ. However, the disease invariably recurs with a median overall survival of 14.6 months2,3. To interrogate mechanisms of recurrence, several studies have analyzed the longitudinal evolution of GBM specimens4,5,6. The Glioma Longitudinal Analysis (GLASS) consortium reported high similarity in genetic driver alterations between primary and recurrent GBM, indicating that standard treatment does not exert substantial clonal selection7. Conversely, transcriptome and proteome studies have demonstrated more dynamic evolutionary patterns, such as a proneural-to-mesenchymal (MES) shift, enhanced neuronal signaling and upregulation of extracellular matrix (ECM)-related genes at recurrence5,6,8,9,10,11,12,13,14. However, published longitudinal GBM studies have typically relied on bulk tissue profiling (averaging the signal across the malignant and tumor microenvironment (TME) compartments) and lack the granularity to independently interrogate the evolution of malignant and TME cell types and cell states. Single-cell longitudinal studies have had limited cohort size and limited clinical metadata, precluding a direct analysis of single-cell profiles with clinical correlates14. These limitations, along with the challenge of reconciling results from different groups that leverage diverse analytical and classification schemes, underscore the need for a larger single-cell longitudinal GBM dataset with detailed clinical and genomic annotations and with robust analysis.

We sought to address these challenges in two studies that we present here. We established the GBM Cellular Analysis of Resistance and Evolution (CARE) consortium to characterize the longitudinal evolutionary trajectories in GBM at single-cell resolution. We performed single-nuclei RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) of paired primary and recurrent GBM samples from 59 patients with detailed clinical annotations and genetic profiles. In the companion study of ref. 15, we conducted an analysis of the data independent of sampling time (primary versus recurrent) that characterized GBM transcriptional ecosystems across multiple layers. In this work, we examine the longitudinal changes in these ecosystems between primary and recurrence and identify molecular and clinical features that modify their trajectories. We show that a lower malignant cell fraction and a reciprocal increase in proportions of glial and neuronal (that is, glio-neural) TME cell types is the most consistent longitudinal change at recurrence, observed in 66% of cases. Contrary to prior studies, we observed no consistent malignant GBM state enrichment at recurrence across the cohort. However, specific trajectories were associated with defined subsets of cases, such as GBMs with MGMT methylation or radiation-related small deletion phenotype. Notably, changes in malignant state abundance were mirrored by corresponding changes in baseline profiles and TME composition, reflecting interdependent alterations of the GBM ecosystem. Our study highlights the diverse longitudinal GBM trajectories that are shaped by treatment response and TME interactions.

We collected matched snap-frozen GBM specimens from primary and recurrent surgeries (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Table 1). Tumor samples were obtained from seven hospitals, resulting in a total of 121 tumors from 59 patients profiled by snRNA-seq and whole-exome sequencing (WES) or whole-genome sequencing (WGS; Fig. 1b; Methods). For the majority of patients, we profiled samples from two time points (labeled T1 and T2); for three patients, we profiled samples from three time points (T1, T2 and T3). Most matched sample pairs were derived from primary and first recurrent tumors, except for three pairs that consisted of two recurrent samples and four pairs that consisted of a primary and a second recurrence.

The donut chart at the top represents average somatic mutation distribution for whether an alteration was detected at both time points (T1 + T2), the primary tumor only (T1) or the recurrent tumor only (T2). The bar plot at the bottom is for the known driver genomic events and the representative phenotypes related to the genomic alterations—arm-level refers to whole chromosome arm amplification (amp) (chr7q)/deletion (del) (chr10q), CNA refers to high-level gene amplification or deletion, and SNV refers to single-nucleotide mutations. De novo hypermutation (HM) indicates a high mutation burden at both time points without evidence for treatment-associated mutational signatures. Small deletion indicates tumors with increased small deletion burden at recurrence. UMAP, uniform manifold approximation and projection; chr, chromosome; assoc., associated.

Tumor location was known for 51 patients, of whom 45 cases locally recurred at the surgical margin and six cases recurred at a site distant from the resection cavity. The majority of patients (51/59) received radiotherapy with concurrent TMZ and adjuvant TMZ following surgery. The improved clinical outcomes in our cohort (median interval between two surgeries = 12.4 months, median overall survival = 24 months), compared with historical cohorts, likely reflect better performance status of patients eligible for multiple surgical resections, consistent with a younger age at diagnosis (median = 53 years, range = 19–73 years).

In our 10x Genomics snRNA-seq dataset, 429,305 cells passed quality filters (Methods). Cells were classified as malignant (246,408 cells) or nonmalignant (182,897 cells) based on inferred chromosomal copy-number aberrations (CNA). Nonmalignant cells were further classified and annotated based on established cell-type signatures and marker gene expression16,17,18,19 (Fig. 1c; Methods). Nonmalignant cells clustered together across time points (Fig. 1c, bottom), and we did not observe a significant difference in the number of cells profiled or the number of genes detected per cell between time points (Extended Data Fig. 1a,b).

Mutational and CNA profiles were derived from bulk DNA-sequencing data (Fig. 1b). The frequency of GBM driver alterations was consistent with prior studies7 and remained largely stable across time points (Fig. 1d and Extended Data Fig. 1c). However, 26% of cases (14 of 54 patients) acquired treatment-related DNA hypermutation20 or an increase in small deletion burden21 at recurrence (Fig. 1d, right).

Global (nonmatched) comparison of cell-type abundance showed overall similarity between time points, except for significantly lower abundance of malignant cells and higher abundance of glio-neural TME (oligodendrocytes, neurons and astrocytes (ACs)) in recurrent tumors (Fig. 2a and Extended Data Fig. 2a). We further separated the broad nonmalignant cell types (for example, myeloid) into more granular states (for example, microglia and bone marrow-derived macrophages) using non-negative matrix factorization (NMF; Methods). Analysis of these higher-resolution cell states demonstrated that recurrences were enriched with reactive ACs and with oligodendrocytes expressing an interferon program (Extended Data Fig. 2b). To further evaluate differences in cell-type composition, we categorized tumors into six compositional groups based on the relative abundance of malignant and TME cell types (Methods). Briefly, tumors were divided into the following three main groups based on their malignant fraction: high malignant fraction (HMF), intermediate malignant fraction (IMF) and low malignant fraction (LMF). The latter group was further subdivided by the dominant TME cell type (for example, LMF—tumor-associated macrophages (TAM), oligodendrocyte (OC) and glio-neural (GN); Extended Data Fig. 2c, left). The HMF group was enriched in primary tumors, while the LMF with glio-neural (LMF—GN) or oligodendrocytic TME (LMF—OC) were enriched at recurrence (P = 0.005 for both groups, two-sided Fisher's test; Fig. 2b, left).

Correlations were computed separately in primary samples (top-left) and in recurrent samples (bottom-right) and are ordered according to the hierarchical clustering pattern of the recurrent samples. NS, not significant.

To validate our findings, we re-analyzed an independent longitudinal GBM snRNA-seq cohort14 (Extended Data Fig. 2d,e). Consistent with our cohort, we observed lower malignant cell abundance, higher oligodendrocyte abundance and similar enrichment of LMF compositional groups at recurrence (P = 0.04, two-sided Fisher's exact test; Extended Data Fig. 2f).

Survival analysis stratified by compositional groups showed significant differences in survival time after the second surgery (Extended Data Fig. 2g, top) but not in the time interval between the first and second surgeries. Patients with glio-neural TME at recurrence had significantly longer survival time after second surgery than patients with other recurrences (median = 19 versus 8 months, P = 0.012, log-rank test; Fig. 2c, left). These differences in clinical course were independent of other clinical characteristics, including MGMT methylation status (Extended Data Fig. 2h, top).

Next, we investigated changes in malignant cell state abundance across time points. As described in more detail in the companion paper15, we applied NMF to malignant cells and identified ten GBM metaprograms (MPs) representing intratumoral cellular heterogeneity (Methods)22,23,24. This included the cell cycle and the previously identified AC-like, MES-like, stress, hypoxia, neural progenitor cell-like (NPC-like) and oligodendrocyte progenitor cell-like (OPC-like) states. In addition, we identified the following three previously undescribed states: a differentiated neuronal state (NEU-like), a glial progenitor-like state (GPC-like) and a cilia-related state (Cilia-like), characterized by marker genes, pathway enrichments and similarity with normal neural cell types. Beyond cell states, we defined three baseline gene expression profiles (BP), reflecting intertumor heterogeneity that is not driven by differences in malignant cell state abundance. The three BPs were annotated as glial-BP, ECM-BP and neuronal-BP.

Comparison of malignant cell state abundance between primary and recurrent samples did not reveal significant differences both in our cohort and in the cohort of ref. 14 (Extended Data Fig. 3a,b). Moreover, we did not detect significant differences across time points when considering a division of tumors into six groups based on dominant malignant states or by BPs (Fig. 2b (middle and right), Extended Data Fig. 2c (middle and right) and Extended Data Fig. 3c,d). However, survival analysis stratified by dominant malignant cell states showed significantly worse prognosis in the MES-like/hypoxia group at recurrence (median survival time from second surgery = 5 versus 10.3 months, P = 0.00086, log-rank test; Fig. 2c (right) and Extended Data Fig. 2g,h), consistent with a recent study14.

The multiple transcriptomic layers of cell-type composition, malignant cell states and malignant BPs are significantly associated with each other and define three stereotypical GBM ecosystems (that is, glial, neuronal and ECM)15. We next investigated whether interactions between components of the GBM ecosystems are maintained between primary and recurrent tumors. We separately computed for each time point the correlations between (1) proportions of 11 TME cell types, (2) proportions of ten malignant cell states and (3) three BP scores. In both time points, we found three comparable clusters of correlated features (Fig. 2d and Extended Data Fig. 3e). These conserved associations (P < 0.01 by permutation test) remain largely stable.

Nevertheless, we did observe some differences, such as preferential association of the neuronal-high ecosystem with OPC-like malignant cells (in primary samples) and with NEU-like malignant cells (in recurrent samples; Fig. 2d and Extended Data Fig. 3e). Interestingly, ligand–receptor analysis with CellChat25 showed some differential enrichment of predicted interactions across time points. For example, neuroligin (NLGN) and neuregulin (NRG) gene families—expressed by oligodendrocytes and neurons—are predicted to interact with the neurexin (NRXN) gene family or ERBB4 on NEU-like and NPC-like malignant cell states, preferentially at recurrence (Extended Data Fig. 3f)15,26,27,28. Taken together, global analysis of our cohort (not matched per sample pairs) shows differences in cell-type composition that are consistent with decreased malignant cell fraction and further integration of recurrent GBM cells with the brain parenchyma9,29,30, but does not reveal substantial global differences either in malignant cellular states or in BPs.

Despite global conservation of cell types and malignant cellular states, when examining individual matched sample pairs, we found extensive divergence (Fig. 3a). Most (68%) sample pairs diverged from one compositional group at diagnosis to a different one at recurrence. Similarly, 64% and 56% switched groups of dominant malignant states and of BP, respectively. We observed the same phenomenon in the cohort of ref. 14, with 68% of patients switching compositional groups and 72% switching malignant groups at recurrence (Extended Data Fig. 4a). While no group was significantly enriched, there was a trend toward increased neuronal-BP and reduced glial-BP at recurrence (Fig. 3a (right)). Remarkably, we observed 72% of all possible trajectories at least once (63 of 88 trajectories), including opposite trajectories. For example, patient P1 had an increase of AC-like and decrease of GPC-like malignant cells at recurrence, while patient P2 had an opposite trajectory (Extended Data Fig. 4b). Furthermore, patients profiled at three time points showed opposite trajectories between two treatment intervals (T1–T2 and T2–T3), despite recurrences occurring at the same site (Fig. 3b). Finally, the frequency of conservation was not significantly different between local and distant recurrences (P = 0.66, two-sided Fisher's test).

This divergence of individual sample pairs prompted us to compare the observed patterns of conservation to those expected by a null model in which matched primary–recurrent pairs are as similar to one another as pairs of randomly selected samples. This analysis revealed that, across all three layers, matched pairs were significantly more conserved than expected by chance (P < 0.004 for each layer, binomial test; Fig. 3c). Thus, matched samples usually diverge in their transcriptomic classification and may diverge in a wide range of trajectories between and within patients but remain significantly more likely to retain any specific classification compared to a random pair of samples. This observation prompted us to further stratify our cohorts and attempt to identify predictors/modifiers of evolutionary trajectories.

Previous studies have shown that patients with methylated MGMT promoter exhibit better response to TMZ and have more favorable prognosis2,31, but whether this is mirrored by differences in either cellular architecture or in cellular trajectories following treatment is unknown. We classified patients as methylated (MGMT-MET, n = 12), unmethylated (MGMT-UM, n = 19) or unknown (n = 28), based on the primary tumor's MGMT promoter methylation status. As expected, MGMT-MET patients exhibited longer surgical intervals than MGMT-UM patients, both in our cohort and in the GLASS cohort (Extended Data Fig. 5a,b).

We next assessed whether MGMT promoter methylation status correlated with MGMT expression in single cells, as this association has been challenging to establish in bulk analyses32. Malignant cell expression of MGMT was significantly lower in primary MGMT-MET samples than in primary MGMT-UM samples (P = 5.3 × 10−6, two-sided Wilcoxon rank-sum test; Fig. 4a)32,33, but this effect was not observed for TME cell types (Fig. 4b). In a subset of MGMT-MET cases, MGMT expression increased at recurrence, possibly reflecting a competitive disadvantage of cells with low MGMT expression during treatment.

a, Average MGMT expression in malignant cells per sample across time points. Samples were included only if the MGMT promoter status was verified using a methylation assay and were annotated as methylated/unmethylated according to the status of the primary sample (n = 12 methylated and n = 19 unmethylated). Dashed lines connect matched samples. Statistical significance was estimated using a two-sided Wilcoxon rank-sum test; unadjusted P values are shown. In a, for within-group comparisons, a Wilcoxon signed rank test (paired) was used. b, MGMT expression level in each cell type between methylated and unmethylated samples.

Genes are ordered according to their correlation (across patients) with the difference between signature scores. FC, fold change.

The correlation between MGMT promoter methylation and low MGMT expression prompted us to build a logistic regression model that uses average malignant cell MGMT expression to infer MGMT methylation status (Extended Data Fig. 5c). When applying this model, we found that classification by MGMT expression levels was associated with surgical resection interval (Fig. 4c) and, in fact, led to improved association compared to classification by MGMT promoter methylation alone—within the MGMT-MET group, we observed significantly longer surgical interval for the MGMT-low expression group relative to the MGMT-high/MGMT-intermediate expression groups (Fig. 4d); in contrast, within the MGMT-high expression group, there was no significant difference in surgical interval when further stratifying by MGMT promoter methylation status (Fig. 4e). This improved performance of MGMT expression level could be due to exclusion of nonmalignant cells that may affect MGMT promoter methylation assessment; alternatively, it could indicate that MGMT expression level in the therapeutically targeted malignant cells more directly reflects MGMT protein activity and hence is more predictive of treatment response.

Comparison of cellular architecture between MGMT-low and MGMT-high expression samples showed no significant differences in cell-type composition and malignant state distribution (Extended Data Fig. 5d,e). However, MGMT expression level was significantly associated with changes in abundance of MES-like states at recurrence, both in our CARE dataset and in ref. 14 (Fig. 4f and Extended Data Fig. 5f). Specifically, MGMT-low tumors recurred with a lower abundance of MES-like states compared to their primary samples, while MGMT-high tumors displayed the opposite pattern. Baseline profiles changed in a similar manner—trending toward decreased ECM in MGMT-low, highlighting the coordinated evolution of cellular states and BPs (Extended Data Fig. 5g).

To further identify longitudinal gene expression patterns specific to MGMT-high and MGMT-low samples, we compared their malignant pseudobulk expression (aggregated gene expression from all malignant cells per sample) across time points. This revealed four groups of genes—those consistently upregulated or downregulated in recurrence, regardless of MGMT expression (CONS-UP and CONS-DN), and those upregulated specifically in MGMT-low (low-UP) or MGMT-high samples (high-UP; Extended Data Fig. 5h). CONS-UP was enriched with genes involved in postsynaptic activity (for example, GRIN1/GRIN2A/GRIN2B, GABRA1/GABRA4), consistent with the trend toward increased neuronal-BP in recurrence (Fig. 3a), while CONS-DN was enriched with genes related to oxidative phosphorylation (for example, NDUFB4/NDUFB11, UQCRB/UQCRQ) and stemness (for example, CD24, DCX, SOX4/SOX11 and SOX11; Extended Data Fig. 5i). In contrast to those MGMT-independent gene sets, low-UP genes were enriched with genes linked to gliogenesis (for example, ACSL1, OLIG1/OLIG2 and SOX8), whereas high-UP genes were enriched with mesenchyme development and ECM remodeling (for example, COL1A1/COL1A2, COL1A2, DCN, FN1 and LOXL1; Fig. 4g). To validate our findings, we repeated this analysis in the ref. 14 dataset and found significant similarities, especially in the high-UP signature (Jaccard index 8.5% versus 1.2% expected, P < 0.0001, bootstrapping).

In summary, our single-cell analysis revealed that MGMT expression in malignant cells predicts time to recurrence and influences longitudinal cellular trajectories—MES-like state and ECM-related genes tend to be enriched in recurrence in MGMT-high (likely nonresponsive) patients, while in MGMT-low (likely responsive) patients, recurrence is associated with loss of MES-like states and enrichment of genes related to gliogenesis. Our results suggest that prior attempts that failed at correlating MGMT expression with treatment response32 were likely confounded by bulk analysis and expression of MGMT by nonmalignant cells.

Treatment may affect GBM genetic evolution, as supported by reports of somatic hypermutation following TMZ chemotherapy and/or small deletion phenotype following radiotherapy7,20,21,34. To analyze the longitudinal mutation patterns in the CARE cohort, we examined mutation burden and mutational signatures following therapy. We observed that mutation burden (mutations per megabase) generally increased at recurrence (P = 0.01, two-sided paired Wilcoxon; Extended Data Fig. 6a) and identified four treatment-associated hypermutant samples (mutation burden > 10 mutations per megabase (Mut per Mb) at recurrence; Methods)34. Two tumor pairs displayed high mutation burden at both time points without evidence of treatment-associated mutation signature (COSMIC single base substitution (SBS) 11; Extended Data Fig. 6b).

To investigate new mutational signature associations at recurrence, we examined the frequency of the COSMIC v3 SBS signatures35, both in our CARE cohort (n = 46 patients) and in the GLASS cohort (n = 138 patients). In both cohorts, we observed a significant decrease in SBS1 (aging/clock-like etiology) and an increase in SBS21 (defective mismatch repair) at recurrence (Fig. 5a and Extended Data Fig. 6c). Notably, patients with increased mutations attributed to SBS21 did not tend to acquire mutations in mismatch repair genes. While mutational signatures temporally differed, we did not observe individual mutations enriched at recurrence (adjusted Fisher's exact test P > 0.05). Among small insertion/deletion variants, we observed increased burden of deletions (Fig. 5b) but not insertions (Extended Data Fig. 5d), including ten recurrences that acquired the small deletion phenotype without treatment-associated hypermutation (Methods; Fig. 5b). Taken together, our analyses reveal that subsets of tumors acquire consistent patterns of genetic alterations following treatment.

To understand whether post-treatment genetic alterations modify cellular state evolution, we investigated the specific trajectories of tumors with hypermutation, SBS21, and small deletion phenotypes. For hypermutant tumors, we did not observe a consistent cellular phenotype at recurrence, although this analysis was limited by sample size (n = 4). In contrast, patients who acquired small deletions were enriched with hypoxia and MES-like cell states (Fig. 5c and Extended Data Fig. 6e; paired Wilcoxon rank-sum test, P < 0.05). We observed a similar effect for tumors with increased SBS21 signal, although this effect was weaker when excluding samples with co-occurring small deletion phenotype (Fig. 5c and Extended Data Fig. 6f). The association between recurrence-specific small deletions and hypoxia state was recapitulated in analysis of bulk samples from GLASS9 (Fig. 5d). In contrast, the MES-like observation did not validate in the GLASS cohort (Extended Data Fig. 6g), possibly due to similarities between MES-like and nonmalignant profiles that make it difficult to disentangle these signals in bulk datasets. Hypoxic cells have been linked to deregulated epigenetics and stress responses36 and, consequently, to increased resistance to radiation37. Thus, malignant cells in hypoxic regions may be better able to repair radiotherapy-associated DNA damage, leading to an outgrowth of hypoxic state at recurrence.

Finally, we examined the correlation between overall genetic distance, as defined by longitudinal single-nucleotide variant (SNV)/CNA differences, and overall malignant transcriptional distance (Methods). We found a significant correlation (Pearson's correlation = 0.42, P = 0.009; Fig. 5e) that was retained when analyzing only SNV or CNAs (Extended Data Fig. 6h,i), suggesting that intratumoral genetic evolution during disease progression contributes to transcriptional evolution.

Intertumoral and intratumoral heterogeneity in GBM has been associated with treatment resistance and disease recurrence, but how specific subsets of GBM cells respond to therapy remains poorly understood. Here we leveraged a longitudinally matched multi-omic GBM snRNA-seq and bulk DNA dataset of 121 tumors from 59 patients consisting of ~430,000 nuclei to comprehensively characterize the compositional, transcriptional and genetic changes that GBMs undergo following standard-of-care. We found extensive variability in longitudinal trajectories of different patients (Fig. 6). While many trajectories were unpredictable, we identified patient characteristics—MGMT methylation and increased small deletion burden—that were associated with particular trajectories and expanded our understanding of recurrences.

Analysis of the GBM CARE dataset reveals key patterns of GBM evolution following treatment. (1) The most common observation was in the cell-type composition layer, where many samples exhibited a reduced malignant cell fraction at recurrence. (2) At the malignant state level, many tumors recurred with an unpredictable trajectory that likely reflects patient-specific evolution (top). A smaller subset of tumors recurred with more predictable trajectories, such as reduced MES-like fraction for MGMT-MET versus MGMT-UM primary tumors (middle) or increased hypoxia fraction for samples with increased small deletion burden following treatment (bottom). Columns separated into malignant and nonmalignant fractions indicate the relative proportions per tumor. Only selected nonmalignant and malignant cell states are shown for clarity. Hyp, hypoxia.

Previous studies have highlighted specific transcriptional trajectories during GBM evolution. The recent GLASS consortium study highlighted three trajectories toward neuronal, MES and proliferative profiles9, and other studies have highlighted proneural-to-MES phenotypic shifts11,14,38. While we similarly identified these recurrence-associated patterns, our analysis suggests that their overall frequency is limited and that such trajectories are enriched only in specific subsets of patients, while global comparison of cell states between primary and recurrent samples shows overall similarity. In particular, a shift toward the MES phenotype following treatment was not observed as a globally enriched trend in our dataset, only in specific subsets of patients. This discordance with prior studies may be attributable to at least the following three effects: (1) differences in technology (for example, bulk versus single-cell profiling), (2) cohort/sampling (for example, single-center sampling, tissue digestion versus not) and (3) analysis methods. There may also be biases due to additional treatments that were not addressed (bevacizumab, corticosteroids, etc.).

Our dataset contains tumor samples that were collected from seven medical centers across six countries, limiting the possibility of results being skewed toward a particular recurrence trajectory due to institution-specific procedures. Moreover, the samples in our dataset were processed and profiled by three different labs, limiting the possibility of skewing due to a lab-specific batch effect. The snRNA-seq protocol used by our labs to process and profile tumor samples was digestion-independent and optimized for brain tumors39, capturing a higher number of transcripts than prior single-nucleus GBM studies (Extended Data Fig. 2e). This likely results in a more faithful representation of the tumor tissue, as evident by the higher diversity of TME cell types in our dataset and the discovery of new malignant cell states.

Neuronal pathways were consistently found to be upregulated in recurrent GBM8,9,12. However, it is important to note that this reflects only subsets of patients in each study and that we observe a wide diversity of trajectories from primary to matched recurrent samples. Leveraging the resolution and scale of our dataset, we showed that this phenomenon correlates with decreased malignant cell fraction and concomitant increased proportions of neurons in the TME; only in a small subset of cases, this is accompanied by the enrichment of NEU-like malignant state and the neuronal baseline expression profile of the tumors. These results suggest that, following treatment, integration of the residual GBM cells with the brain parenchyma is likely enhanced29,30.

Beyond defined subsets, our study makes the challenging observation that, for the majority of GBMs, longitudinal cellular trajectories are diverse and unpredictable. We speculate that this diversity reflects at least the following three phenomena: first, given the genetic and epigenetic heterogeneity in primary tumors, it might be expected that tumors with distinct underlying biology will also have distinct trajectories of recurrence. Second, even within a single GBM, there is extensive spatial heterogeneity23,40; as primary and recurrent samples are obtained from different locations, their differences might reflect such spatial heterogeneity and, therefore, depend on sampling40. Third, patients vary considerably both in their treatment histories and in their response to treatments, potentially leading to distinct recurrence trajectories. Many GBM patients are treated by additional therapies in diverse combinations beyond standard-of-care, which is a limitation in this study. Moreover, even standard-of-care induces distinct patient responses, and we identified the following two cases in which treatment responses are linked to recurrence trajectory: (1) MGMT-MET (MGMT-low expression) samples (more likely to respond to alkylating agents) are associated with depletion of MES-like states in recurrence and (2) the small deletion phenotype, previously linked to radiotherapy21, is associated with increased hypoxia states in recurrence.

In summary, we present a comprehensive analysis of GBM recurrence at single-cell resolution. Our analysis shows that, globally, recurrent GBMs are generally similar to primary GBMs in their cellular states, composition and other features of the GBM ecosystem. Accordingly, a wide range of recurrence trajectories are observed, highlighting extensive diversity in GBM evolution. Nevertheless, subsets of tumors with evidence for particular treatment responses are skewed toward specific transcriptional trajectories. These findings offer more detailed insights over prior observations and provide an opportunity to stratify recurrent patients more precisely, potentially leading to specific treatment strategies.

It was approved by the National Committee for Ethics in Research, Luxembourg, under the protocol 201201/06. Cohorts were added to the Institutional Review Board protocol Dana–Farber/Harvard Cancer Center 10-417. Patients were male and female. Clinical information of the cohorts is summarized in Supplementary Table 1.

No statistical method was used to determine the sample size. Data were excluded from select analyses when the number of malignant cells within a sample was low in at least one time point. Throughout the figures in this manuscript (Figs. 2–5 and Extended Data Figs. 1–3, 5 and 6), the boxplots reflect the following summary statistics: (1) the line splitting the box represents the median value; (2) the lower and upper edges correspond to the first and third quartiles (the 25th and 75th percentiles); (3) the upper whisker extends from the edge to the largest value no further than 1.5× interquartile range (IQR) from the edge; (4) the lower whisker extends from the edge to the smallest value at most 1.5× IQR of the edge; and (5) if the plots do not include jitter points representing the actual data, then data beyond the end of the whiskers are plotted individually as outlying points. The statistical analysis described in this work was done using R version 4.0.1 and above.

Protocol 1 (laboratory 1 and laboratory 2 for the cohorts from Duke University, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Tokyo University Hospital, St. Michael's Hospital and Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital)—nuclei from frozen tumor tissue were isolated as follows: tissue was thawed and mechanically dissociated in salt-Tris buffer (10 mM Tris–HCl (pH 7.5), 146 mM NaCl, 1 mM CaCl2 and 21 mM MgCl2) with 0.49% CHAPS (3-((3-cholamidopropyl) dimethylammonio)-1-propanesulfonate) (Millipore, 28300). Single-nuclei suspensions were filtered using a 40 μm strainer, centrifuged at 500g for 5 min and resuspended in salt-Tris buffer supplemented with 0.01% BSA (NEB, B9000S). Nuclear suspensions were inspected by microscope, counted using a hemocytometer and used for 10x Genomics workflow.

Protocol 2 (laboratory 3 for the cohorts from NORLUX and SNU cohorts)—tissue samples were thawed and mechanically dissociated in nuclei EZ lysis buffer (Millipore Sigma, NUC101) via Dounce homogenization. The solutions were incubated on ice for 5 min and mixed one to two times during incubation. Single-nuclei suspensions were filtered through a 70 μm strainer and centrifuged at 500g for 5 min at 4 °C, resuspended in nuclei EZ lysis buffer and incubated on ice for 5 min. The solutions were centrifuged at 500g for 5 min at 4 °C and resuspended in 1% BSA/0.2 U μl RNase inhibitor/PBS buffer (three times). For the final resuspension, the DAPI was added to the buffer, the solution was filtered through a 40 μm strainer, cells were counted on a Countess II automated cell counter (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and nuclei were taken into the 10x Genomics workflow.

The 10x Chromium Single Cell 3′ Reagent Kit v3 (10x Genomics, PN1000128) was used according to the manufacturer's protocol. In brief, nuclei were loaded on the Chromium Chip (10x Genomics, PN12000120) with a target cell recovery of 6,000–8,000 nuclei and processed in the Chromium Controller. Single nuclei were partitioned into gel beads-in-emulsion (GEMs), followed by RNA reverse transcription with barcoding. Libraries were created by breaking GEMs and pooling barcoded fractions, cDNA amplification, fragmentation and attachment of sample index and adapter and sequenced on NextSeq500 or NovaSeq (Illumina). For NORLUX and SNU cohorts, nuclei were loaded on a Chromium chip with a target cell recovery of 6,000 nuclei for single-cell multiome ATAC and gene expression according to the manufacturer's protocol. The gene expression chemistry for the 10x multiome possesses the same chemistry as the 10x v3 3′ snRNA-seq.

WES for the samples from Duke University, MDACC, Tokyo University Hospital and St. Michael's Hospital was performed as follows: DNA was extracted from each frozen tumor sample and blood sample corresponding to the patients using the DNeasy Blood & Tissue kit (Qiagen, 69504). The genomic DNA (100–250 ng) was acoustically sheared by an ultrasonicator (Covaris), targeting 150 bp fragments. Library preparation was performed by KAPA HyperPrep Kit (KAPA Biosystems, KK8504) followed by the enzymatic clean-up using AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter, A63882). Exome capture was performed using a custom exome bait (manufactured by Twist Biosciences to Broad Institute's specification). Captured libraries were sequenced with 150-base-pair paired-end sequencing on a NovaSeq 6000 (Illumina). For the samples from Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital, after the DNA was fragmented by a LE220 ultrasonicator (Covaris) and size selected, library preparation and capture were performed using the Twist Human Core Exome kit (Twist Bioscience) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Sequencing was performed on a NovaSeq 6000 (Illumina) with 200-base-pair paired-end sequencing.

Newly generated whole-genome DNA-sequencing data were collected for a cohort of frozen samples from the NORLUX Neuro-oncology Laboratory. Briefly, DNA was extracted from each tumor sample using the AllPrep DNA/RNA Minikit (Qiagen, 80204) for samples with sufficient tumor tissue and matched normal blood when it was available. Note that the selected tissue for bulk DNA isolation was adjacent to the tissue used for single-nuclei data generation. Briefly, DNA was sheared to 400 bp using a LE220 ultrasonicator (Covaris) and size-selected using AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter, A63882). Whole-genome libraries were prepared and sequenced with 150-base-pair paired-end sequencing on a NovaSeq 6000 (Illumina). WGS data for the SNU cohort were prepared identically and were previously reported in ref. 9. Data for the SNU cohort are available on Synapse (https://www.synapse.org/glass).

DNA-sequencing alignment, fingerprinting, somatic variant detection (Mutect2) and copy-number segmentation were performed in accordance with the Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK) best practices using GATK 4.0.10.1, as previously described7,9. Briefly, whole-exome and whole-genome reads were aligned to the b37 genome (human_g1k_v37_decoy) using BWA MEM 0.7.17. DNA fingerprint analysis using ‘CrosscheckFingerprints' (Picard) confirmed that all samples belonging to a patient came from the same individual, indicating that there were no sample mismatches in this study. Somatic mutations were detected using Mutect2 (v4.1.0.0) for tumor samples with a matched normal blood sample. A panel of normals was constructed for each sequencing batch to account for differences in DNA library prep (for example, whole genome versus whole exome) and used to filter out common artifactual and germline variants. Patient tumor samples without matched normal blood were analyzed for copy-number alterations and tumor-only SNV detection was performed with a panel of normal reference according to GATK best practices. Tumor-only somatic variants were used to identify hypermutant tumors. To identify samples with increased small deletion mutation burden, the following thresholds were applied: the recurrence-specific small deletion mutation burden needed to be greater than 0.2 Mut per Mb sequenced and greater than 0.1 Mut per Mb increase when comparing all small deletion variants in the recurrence versus the primary tumor. Mutational signature estimation was performed using COSMIC v3 signatures for the GLASS and CARE datasets according to previously published methods41. Briefly, all WGS samples were used to generate a mutational matrix and extract de novo signatures using SigProfilerExtractor (v.1.1.4)41 using maximum signatures set to 10 and NMF replicates set to 100. The de novo signatures were then deconvoluted to COSMIC v3.3 signatures. Finally, mutations for each sample were assigned to the most probable signature among the deconvoluted COSMIC signatures using the R package Palimpsest (v.2.0.0)42. Acquired SBS21 samples were denoted as those that were in the top quartile of SBS21 change at T2. For samples with matched blood, hypermutation was determined according to the cutoff of 10 Mut per Mb and further separated into de novo versus treatment-associated based on COSMIC mutational signatures. Treatment-associated hypermutation in samples with matched normal blood was classified by a longitudinal increase in mutation burden (that is, from <10 Mut per Mb to >10 Mut per Mb) and SBS11 signal (alkylating agent-associated signature). For samples without matched blood, a single recurrent sample with a large increase in mutation burden at recurrence compared to the initial tumor (18.3-fold increase) and SBS11 signature was indicative of treatment-associated hypermutation. Genetic distance between time-separated samples from the same patient was defined as the bulk DNA proportion of private mutations (SNV) and differences in CNA segments between the two samples.

For droplet-based snRNA-seq data, the Cellranger v3.1.0 pipeline provided by 10x Genomics was used for alignment (GRCh38 release 93) and to generate count matrices. We quantified the gene expression levels as \(\scriptstyle{E}_{i,j}=\log_2(\frac{{{\mathrm{CPM}}}_{i,j}}{10}+1)\), where CPMi,j refers to counts-per-million for gene i in sample j. We divided the TPM/CPM values by 10 as the size of single-cell libraries is estimated to be in the order of 100,000 transcripts, and we, therefore, would like to avoid inflating the expression levels by counting each transcript ~10 times. Following these normalization steps, initial filtering of low-quality cells was done based on low number of detected genes (less than 200 genes) or high expression of mitochondrially encoded genes (more than 3%). The majority of low-quality cells were removed downstream in case they could not be robustly classified as malignant or nonmalignant (see in later section on CNA analysis ‘Classification of cells into malignant or nonmalignant cell types'). Finally, we computed the average expression of each gene i as \(\scriptstyle\log_2((\frac{1}{n}{\sum }_{j=1}^{n}{{\mathrm{TPM|CPM}}}_{i,j}+1))\) and filtered out the lowly expressed genes by limiting the analyzed genes to the top 3,000 most highly expressed genes (using the Seurat v4.0.4 (ref. 43) function CreateSeuratObject). For the cells and genes that passed these quality control filters, we defined relative expression levels by centering the expression levels for each gene across all cells in the dataset as follows: \({{\mathrm{Er}}}_{i,j}={E}_{i,j}-\,\frac{1}{n}{\sum }_{k=1}^{n}{E}_{i,k}\), where n is the number of cells in the dataset.

To facilitate clustering, cell-type annotation and scoring of droplet-based data, we used the R package Seurat (v4.0.4)43. Unique molecular identifier counts data were normalized and scaled (using the NormalizeData and ScaleData functions) and then clustered (by projecting the data to a lower dimensional space using principal component analysis and then running FindNeighbors and FindClusters functions). Initial classification of tumor-associated macrophages, T cells, oligodendrocytes and endothelial cells was based on the expression of known marker genes16,17,18,19,44, whereas the rest of the cells were annotated as presumed malignant. Following classification of cells as malignant or nonmalignant (see sections ‘Inferring CNAs from gene expression data' and ‘Classification of cells into malignant or nonmalignant cell types'), the cells classified as nonmalignant were scored (using the AddModuleScore function) for known cell-type signatures and assigned with a cell type using the method explained in the section ‘Assignment of cells to states'. Finally, heterotypic doublets were filtered out using the R package scDblFinder45.

CNAs were estimated as previously described46,47,48,49 using the function infercna from the R package infercna (an implementation of the original method presented in ref. 50, which is available at https://github.com/jlaffy/infercna) with default parameters. Briefly, the algorithm sorts the analyzed genes in each sample according to their chromosomal location and applies a moving average with a sliding window of 100 genes within each chromosome to the relative expression values. The scores computed for the cells classified as nonmalignant (oligodendrocytes, macrophages and endothelial cells) define the baseline of normal karyotype, and their average CNA values are used to center the values of all cells.

In cells classified using single-nucleus droplet-based sequencing, we generally encountered lower CNA signal and continuous signal distributions related to (1) lower data quality relative to that observed in single-cell data and (2) inclusion of nonmalignant cell types such as ACs and neurons in the presumed malignant group, as these cell types could not be classified a priori as nonmalignant due to transcriptional similarity with the malignant cells.

We, therefore, used a multistep classification scheme for the droplet-based single-nucleus sequencing data.

For each cell j, we computed the CNA signal on each chromosome separately as \({{\mathrm{CNA}}}_{j}^{C}=\frac{1}{n}{\sum }_{i=1}^{n}{{\mathrm{CNA}}}_{i,j}^{C}\), where n is the number of genes on chromosome C included in the analysis. We fitted a normal distribution (that is, a classifier) to the signal distributions of the reference cells for each chromosome (using the function fitdistr from the R package MASS v.7.3-56). This enabled assigning each cell with a P value for each chromosome using a two-sided z test (function pnorm from the R package stats v.4.1.1), reflecting whether the cell has a CNA signal that is substantially different than expected from nonmalignant cells. These P values were further corrected for multiple testing (for each chromosome) using the Benjamini–Hochberg (BH) method, and cells with BH-adjusted P value < 0.05 for a particular chromosome were considered as having a copy-number event on that chromosome (either amplification or deletion based on the sign of the CNA signal). Cells with an unadjusted P value < 0.05 for a particular chromosome that failed to achieve statistical significance following adjustment were considered to have a ‘suspicious event' on that chromosome. Following this, inferred copy-number events were cross-referenced with copy-number calls from WES/WGS data, and only events detected in both methods were considered for classification and were termed ‘real' events. For a subset of samples, this procedure was not possible due to (1) lack of WES/WGS data or (2) inability to call CNA events from WES/WGS due to low purity/quality. For this subset of cases, we defined a panel of highly recurring CNA events (intersection of highly recurring events inferred from snRNA-seq and WES/WGS data) that were used as a short list of potential events. Cells classified a priori as nonmalignant were reclassified as ‘unresolved' in case a ‘real' or ‘suspicious' CNA event was detected and ‘nonmalignant' otherwise. Presumed malignant cells with at least one ‘real' CNA event were classified as ‘malignant', those with a ‘suspicious' event were classified as ‘unresolved' and those with no events at all (‘real' or ‘suspicious') were classified as ‘nonmalignant'.

We define the CNA correlation as the Pearson correlation between each cell and the average CNA profile of the tumor sample the cell originated from. We limit the computation to the chromosomes on which ‘real' events were detected and a control panel of ~1,000 genes from other chromosomes. Based on the distribution of CNA correlations across the cells classified as Malignant, we defined 0.5 as the lower threshold of malignancy. To determine the upper threshold for nonmalignancy, we performed SNV calling from the snRNA-seq data to estimate the algorithm misclassification rate. Briefly, for each sample with available WES data, we called SNVs for each cell using the Vartrix tool (https://github.com/10XGenomics/vartrix) from the FASTQ files. Misclassified cells were defined as cells harboring a malignant mutation that were classified as nonmalignant in step 1 of the algorithm. Following a cost-effectiveness analysis (misclassification rate versus percentage of excluded cells), we set 0.35 as the upper threshold for nonmalignancy. Finally, cells classified as ‘malignant' with CNAcor < 0.5 or cells classified as ‘nonmalignant' with CNAcor > 0.35 were reclassified as ‘Unresolved' and excluded from downstream analysis.

To refine the classification, we defined confidence levels. Confidence level 1 includes cells classified as malignant that harbor a malignant SNV, cells in which at least 50% of the expected CNA events were detected, including chromosome 7 amplification or chromosome 10 deletion, and cells classified as nonmalignant with CNAcor < 0.25. Confidence level 2 includes cells classified as malignant in which at least 50% of the expected CNA events were detected that do not include chromosome 7 amplification or chromosome 10 deletion, cells classified as malignant in which less than 50% of the expected CNA events were detected, including chromosome 7 amplification or chromosome 10 deletion, and cells classified as nonmalignant with CNAcor < 0.5. The rest of the cells classified as malignant or nonmalignant were assigned confidence level 3.

In the analysis presented in this work, we used only cells in confidence levels 1 and 2.

To capture the heterogeneity between cells from the same cell type, we leveraged NMF51. NMF was performed on the relative expression values of each sample independently after setting negative values to zero. The NMF algorithm requires defining a priori the ‘k' parameter, reflecting the expected number of latent features in the data. Because ‘k' varies between samples and is largely unknown, we ran the NMF algorithm on each sample using different values (3–10), thereby generating 52 programs for each sample. Each of these NMF programs was summarized by the top 50 genes based on the NMF coefficients. Derivation of the metaprograms from the NMF programs is described thoroughly in ref. 24 and will be described here briefly. The method first filters out NMF programs that are not robust (do not recur within the sample it originated from or across several samples) or are redundant within the sample (that is, it highly overlaps with other NMF programs within that sample). Following this, the robust NMF programs are clustered according to the Jaccard similarity using a customized clustering algorithm that iteratively considers the degree of overlap between robust NMF programs and combines the highly overlapping ones to form a cluster. The top 50 most recurring genes in each cluster define a metaprogram.

Overall, the algorithm yielded 16 metaprograms that were annotated based on functional enrichment analysis (using Gene Ontology (GO) terms, mSigDB Hallmark gene sets and gene sets derived from normal brain development datasets). MP 16 included genes from various cell types, resulting in a metaprogram that fits almost all cells and thereby did not reflect any heterogeneity and was therefore excluded from analysis. This same procedure was independently repeated for each nonmalignant cell type.

Malignant cells were scored for the NMF metaprograms using the Seurat function AddModuleScore. To facilitate cell classification, we generated 20 shuffled expression matrices by sampling 5,000 cells each time and shuffling the expression values for each gene. We then scored each shuffled matrix for the NMF metaprograms, thereby yielding 100,000 normally distributed scores for each expression program. These served as null distributions for cell state classification. For each original cell, we computed a P value for each of the expression programs with a z test (R's pnorm function) using the statistics of the null distributions that we previously generated. We adjusted all P values for multiple testing using the BH method. Each cell was classified into a specific state if the adjusted P value computed for that state was smaller than 0.05. Cells that achieved an adjusted P < 0.05 for multiple states were assigned to the state for which they scored maximally. Cells that did not achieve an adjusted P < 0.05 for any of the states were assigned an ‘unresolved' state.

Cells were assigned a ‘cycling' state on top of their cellular state if they achieved an adjusted P < 0.05 for the cell cycle metaprogram and ‘noncycling' otherwise.

We define hybrids as cells scoring significantly (that is, with adjusted P < 0.05) for at least two cellular states with a difference between the top two significant scores smaller than expected by chance. To quantify the score difference expected by chance, we leveraged the null distribution generated for the state classification algorithm and computed for each artificial cell the difference between the top two states. The 95 quantiles of this score difference distribution (equal to a difference of 0.24) were set as the threshold for determining if a state is singular or hybrid.

To estimate the expected frequency of technical hybrids, we first computed for each pair of states, \(\left(A,{B}\right)\), the expected frequency of hybrids, defined as \({\mathrm{Exp}}\left(A,B\right)={\mathrm{Freq}}\left(A\right)\times {\mathrm{Freq}}\left(B\right)\), and the O/E ratio defined as \({\log }_{2}(\frac{{\mathrm{Obs}}(A,{B})}{{\mathrm{Exp}}(A,B)})\). As this is an overestimation of the expected frequency attributed to technical effects, we estimated this technical factor by averaging across O/E ratios of hybrid pairs detected less than expected by chance (that is, O/E < 0). Following this, we computed the expected frequency of technical hybrids for each hybrid pair by multiplying the expected frequency with the technical factor and defined the O/tE ratio as \({\log }_{2}(\frac{{\mathrm{Obs}}(A,{B})}{{\mathrm{TF}}\times {\mathrm{Exp}}(A,B)})\). Finally, we filtered out insignificant hybrid pairs with large O/tE ratio (attributed to small numbers) using a one-sided Fisher test. The hybrid lineage model was generated using the R package igraph with cell states as nodes and edges connecting the states that form significant hybrid pairs. We did not include the ‘cycling' state in this analysis because we don't view ‘cycling' as an independent state but rather as an additional feature that cells can have on top of their neurodevelopmental identity (that is, AC-like, OPC-like, etc.).

Each tumor sample was decomposed into seven pseudobulk profiles (one for each of the common states—AC-like, MES-like, hypoxia, GPC-like, OPC-like, NPC-like and NEU-like—given at least 25 cells classified to the particular state) by averaging across the normalized unique molecular identifier counts and log2-transforming. Genes were included if their mean log2-expression value across all pseudobulks was at least 1 and if their median variance (computed separately within state) was at least 2.5. Overall, 1,005 genes passed these filters. Following this, the pseudobulks were analyzed within the state to remove the state-specific signal using principal component analysis. We then derived six gene programs from each state (top and bottom 50 genes of the first three principal components), computed the Jaccard similarity index between each pair of programs and clustered the similarity matrix using hierarchical clustering. This revealed five distinct clusters from which we derived five consensus signatures by including genes that recurred in at least 25% of programs in each of the clusters (with a hard minimum of at least three times). By manual inspection and GO enrichment, we annotated the consensus signatures. Two signatures were excluded due to short length or high suspicion of reflecting a technical artifact. To exclude the possibility that ambient RNA has a role in driving the baseline profiles, we estimated per sample using the R package SoupX the contamination by ambient RNA. There was no difference in the estimated contamination level across the different baseline profiles as well as no significant overlap between the topmost contaminated genes per sample and the metaprogram or baseline profile signatures (data not shown due to lack of significance).

To measure the differences in tumor composition, we generated for each tumor sample a composition vector reflecting the proportion of each cell type in the tumor sample. This enabled assigning tumors to the following three main composition groups: HMF (percentage of malignant cells >75%), IMF (percentage of malignant cells, 50–75%) and LMF (malignant cells <50%), where the LMF group could be further subdivided according to the dominant TME cell types (percentage of TAM/oligodendrocyte/glio-neural >40%, or mixed in case of no dominant TME cell type). Similarly, we defined proportion vectors for the malignant cell states and assigned tumors to six groups according to the dominant cell state (at least 25% of cells assigned to the particular state)—AC, MES/hypoxia, GPC, OPC/NPC, neuron and mixed (in case of no dominant state). Tumors were classified according to the baseline profile with a maximal score and to the mixed category if the maximal score was less than 0.25.

The association between each pair of features (A, B) was computed using a binomial test with the number of times the pair was observed as the number of successes, the number of tumor samples as the number of experiments and the frequency of feature A times the frequency of feature B as the expected probability of success (under the assumption that the features are independent). We then generated an undirected graph by defining each feature as a node and connecting the nodes with edges in case a statistically significant association (unadjusted for multiple testing) between the two features was observed.

To measure the transcriptional distance between matched pairs, we generated state-controlled pseudobulk profiles from each pair. State control was achieved by downsampling both samples to 25 cells from each state, given that both samples contain at least 25 cells from the particular state, resulting in samples that contain the same number of cells and are balanced across the different gene expression profiles of the cellular states. Following this, the pseudobulk profiles were computed by averaging for each gene across the selected cells, resulting in two pseudobulk profiles. Finally, the Euclidean distance between the two vectors was computed and served as the metric for transcriptional distance.

Survival analysis was performed using the R packages survival v.3.3-1 and survminer v.0.4.9. Kaplan–Meier estimates were computed using the survfit function and plotted using the ggsurvplot function (survminer package). Statistical significance of the difference between the survival curves was computed using the log-rank test (implemented in the function survdiff). Cox regression analysis and forest plots were performed and plotted using the same packages (coxph and ggforest functions).

To compute the differentially expressed genes between MGMT-low and MGMT-high pairs, we first computed the relative gene expression across time points in each group (that is, longitudinal expression difference), which is defined for each gene i as the average expression of the gene across all T2 samples in the group minus the average gene expression across all T1 samples in the group. Following, we computed the Euclidean distance between these two vectors. MGMT-low genes were defined as the top 100 genes with the largest distance between the groups and positive longitudinal expression difference in the MGMT-low group and negative longitudinal expression difference in the MGMT-high group. MGMT-high genes were defined as the top 100 genes with the largest distance between the groups and positive longitudinal expression difference in the MGMT-high group and negative longitudinal expression difference in the MGMT-low group.

How relatedness to nature is linked to well-being is determined by district-level socioeconomic status. The Kobe University analysis is based on survey results from two major Japanese metropolitan areas.

Hiking. Camping. Even just walking in the park. Be it a current hobby or a childhood pastime, many urban residents have engaged in activities that have nurtured in them a positive relationship with nature. But in our modern society, disparities in access to nature have only grown larger between residential areas. And while this especially affects those that face social and economic challenges, research that explores the relationship between district-level socioeconomic status, nature and well-being remains limited.

Kobe University human environmental scientist UCHIYAMA Yuta specializes in studying how differences in urban and rural lifestyles affect quality of life. He and his team surveyed 3,500 residents in two major metropolitan areas of Japan (Tokyo-Yokohama and Osaka-Kobe) in order to determine their relationship with nature both objectively (based on proximity and access to natural spaces) and subjectively (based on perceived relatedness to nature). The responses were then categorized based on socioeconomic status by area and the degree of urban development of their residential area to serve as a third dimension in clarifying the relationship between well-being and nature.

The results of this study, published in Landscape and Urban Planning, show that the more related to nature people feel, the better their overall well-being is, and that this relationship is particularly pronounced in urbanized areas with poorer socioeconomic conditions.

But why is this the case? Related studies have suggested that nature visits are important for maintaining and improving health for those under substantial stress, and that this is especially true for residents of areas with poorer socioeconomic conditions. Conversely, residents of areas with better socioeconomic conditions have access to additional resources for enhancing their health and overall well-being, making the effects of nature visits relatively less pronounced.

Uchiyama explains what this means for policies aimed at reducing inequality in well-being, saying: "We anticipate that conserving and enhancing existing natural spaces and organizing community events will have a positive effect on well-being in areas of relatively poor socioeconomic status. Interestingly, of the factors we surveyed, childhood experience with nature in particular was a significant predictor of adult well-being." This finding further emphasizes that early-life exposure and equitable access to nature are essential to public health.

Moving forward, further analysis of the relationships between independent variables as well as key factors that vary over time (e.g., moving between regions of differing socioeconomic level) should prove useful in obtaining a clearer picture of the relationship between nature relatedness, socioeconomic level and well-being. Uchiyama says, "As these findings are consistent with similar studies conducted in other regions, interventions for both subjective and objective factors should be applicable to other regions with similar socioeconomic contexts, such as other cities in Monsoon Asia. Currently, as part of an international collaborative project, we are analyzing how knowledge and perceptions influence well-being, resilience, and preparedness of citizens and decision-makers in major cities in Asia including Bangkok and Manila."

This research was funded by the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (grants JP23K25067, JP23K25106, JP23K28298, and JP23K28295), the Environment Research and Technology Development Fund (grant 1FS-2201), and Asia-Pacific Network for Global Change Research (CRRP2023-10MY-Uchiyama). It was conducted in collaboration with researchers from the University of the Ryukyus, the University of Tokyo and Nanzan University.

The U.S. Department of Labor has dropped its investigation into Scale AI's compliance with the Fair Labor Standards Act, according to a source directly familiar with the matter. 

The FLSA is a federal law that regulates misclassification of employees as independent contractors and unpaid wages. TechCrunch first reported that Scale was the subject of such an investigation in March. 

Upwork and Hireart, two of Scale AI's HR partners that were also being investigated for FLSA compliance per Inc. magazine, are also no longer being investigated by the DOL, they each confirmed to TechCrunch.

Scale AI, which was valued last year at $13.8 billion, depends on an army of workers it categorizes as contractors to do critical AI work, like labeling images for Big Tech. 

However, Scale has been sued by ex-workers alleging they were underpaid and misclassified as contractors instead of employees, denying them access to benefits like sick leave.

It's not clear exactly why the DOL dropped the probe. San Francisco-based Scale AI declined to comment, while the DOL didn't respond to a request for comment. 

There's several possible reasons, though. 

A recent move from the DOL hints at a friendlier approach to classifying workers as contractors, with the agency announcing on May 1 that it was no longer enforcing, at least for now, a Biden-era rule which made this more difficult.

Scale AI is also seeking favor with the Trump administration. Its CEO Alexandr Wang attended Trump's inauguration (like many other tech CEOs) and has published a letter urging Trump to “win the AI war.” 

Meanwhile, Scale AI's former managing director Michael Kratsios was confirmed in March as the new director of the White House's Office of Science and Technology Policy.

The position involves advising the President on science and tech issues, and has no oversight over the DOL. Kratsios didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.

San Francisco's widely relied upon public transportation system, Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART), went down early Friday morning due to a “computer networking problem,” according to city officials. The outage brought the entire system to a halt at around 5:00 am local time, forcing commuters to quickly find an alternative travel plan. BART officials announced that service had been restored across the entire system around 9:30 am local time, though a spokesperson for the agency told The San Francisco Standard, “Riders should expect residual major delays as we ramp back up.”

The system's shutdown, while temporary, caused a considerable number of logistical issues for riders. According to the San Francisco Chronicle, the transit system averaged about 175,000 riders on weekdays during the month of March. With BART out of order, riders were forced to shift their commute to buses, ride shares, and other alternatives. Some of those options are cost-prohibitive—San Francisco ranked in the top 10 for most expensive cities for ride sharing. The Chronicle spoke to one person who opted to wait for the trains to start running again rather than take a Lyft that would have cost $70 to get to his destination.

To accommodate the travelers stranded by BART, the San Francisco Municipal Railway offered additional buses and extra trains on some lines. The San Francisco Bay Ferry also used larger boats to make room for more riders, per the Chronicle.

The cause of the outage is still unclear, but a spokesperson for BART did further explain what happened to the SF Standard: “BART was unable to properly power up our train control system, which prevented us from safely operating trains,” the spokesperson said. According to the Chronicle, BART Chief Communications Officer Alicia Trost said the issue occurred after overnight maintenance work, but did not say that was specifically the cause. Instead, she said there were “a lot of different reasons” that could cause the issue. She did rule out the possibility that it was a cyber attack that knocked the system out.

Outages have gotten rarer in recent years for BART, according to the agency's own data, but delays have remained a major problem. The transport system has undergone cost-cutting measures, as well, which has led to some issues going unaddressed and a hiring freeze being put in place, though the city has spent on increasing police presence on the transit system and new methods for cracking down on unpaid fares.

Remember last week when Aurora met a major milestone — just squeaking by under its own deadline — and launched a driverless self-driving truck service? Welp, this week Aurora made headlines again, but for a surprising change in leadership. 

Co-founder Sterling Anderson, who has been chief product officer, is resigning from his position and the board. No real word on what prompted his resignation, beyond some comments he made during the company's Q1 earnings call. “Leaving Aurora is one of the most difficult decisions I've ever made, especially given the exciting stage Aurora is at,” he said. “This is precisely what gave me the confidence that now is the right time.”

He didn't say exactly where he was going, either, except that it will be an “exciting external opportunity in a senior leadership role at an iconic global company.” 

I'll let you all place your bets. 

Aurora is pressing on without Anderson. The company announced during its earnings call that it will start sending its self-driving trucks out at night and during adverse weather conditions like rain or heavy wind by the second half of 2025. The company also plans to expand its driverless trucking route beyond Dallas to Houston, and into El Paso and Phoenix.

It's not every day a public company reverses course and goes private. But then again, these aren't normal times. Especially for any company caught up in the U.S.-China trade war. 

Take Zeekr, for instance. One year ago, the Chinese EV company debuted on the New York Stock Exchange. Now, parent company Geely Auto wants to take Zeekr private in response to the Trump administration's idea to kick Chinese companies off American stock exchanges.

Other deals that got my attention …

Bosch Ventures has a new $270 million fund that will continue its tradition of investing in deep tech startups. Managing director Ingo Ramesohl told TechCrunch the plan is to put more of its money into North American startups.

Investors who previously backed Indian Uber rival BluSmart have proposed a plan to inject another $30 million into the struggling cab-hailing startup, which abruptly halted operations last month. But there's a catch.

Breathe, a battery software startup, raised $21 million in a Series B round led by Kinnevik Online AB, the company exclusively told TechCrunch. Lowercarbon Capital and Volvo Cars Tech Fund participated.

DoorDash announced two major acquisitions as it expands into Europe. The company agreed to buy its U.K. rival Deliveroo for about £2.9 billion (around $3.87 billion) and separately said it is buying SevenRooms — which provides CRM, marketing, and operations software to help restaurants, hotels, and public venues with reservations and guest management — for $1.2 billion in cash.

Meanwhile, Uber was busy this week, acquiring companies and investing in them. 

Uber increased its investment into Chinese autonomous vehicle company WeRide by $100 million as part of an expanded partnership deal to bring the service to another 15 cities over the next five years. In a separate deal, Uber also acquired an 85% controlling stake in Trendyol Go, the online meal and grocery delivery business based in Istanbul, for about $700 million in cash. 

Here's a personnel switch I didn't expect. Mo Elshenawy, the former president and CTO of now-shuttered self-driving car company Cruise, was just named the chief technology officer at telehealth and wellness company Hims & Hers. I spoke to Hims & Hers co-founder and CEO Andrew Dudum, and he said he specifically focused on the AV industry to find the next CTO. Here's why. 

Nuro has started testing its AV tech on the Las Vegas Strip. I recently sat down with co-founder and president Dave Ferguson. Stay tuned for an update on why the company shifted its business model. 

Tesla‘s “Robotaxi” and “Cybercab” trademarks have hit a few roadblocks. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office denied Tesla's attempt to trademark the term “Robotaxi” in reference to its vehicles because it's too generic. Meanwhile, applications from Tesla for the trademark on the term “Cybercab” were halted because of companies pursuing similar “Cyber” trademarks.

Uber locked up partnerships with three Chinese autonomous vehicle companies — Pony AI, Momenta, and WeRide — in a bid to gobble up robotaxi market share in the Middle East and Europe. Footnote: These deals are not to operate in China. 

Waymo announced it has a new 239,000-square-foot factory in the Phoenix suburb of Mesa through a deal with Magna to build more than 2,000 autonomous Jaguar I-Pace vehicles. That obviously got a lot of attention. But I was most interested in finally learning the size of Waymo's existing commercial fleet, which is now 1,500. 

Wayve is making the rounds on the high-profile executive set. You might remember the video of Bill Gates in one of Wayve's autonomous test vehicles. Now it's Virgin Group founder Sir Richard Branson's turn. P.S. Branson is a Wayve investor. BTW, Fortune Brainstorm held its AI conference in London, and Wayve CEO and co-founder Alex Kendall was there. He had some interesting comments about the company's end-to-end approach and Tesla's Elon Musk.

Zoox paused its driverless testing program for more than a week and issued a voluntary recall of its software following a crash in Las Vegas.

The Cadillac Celestiq EV — yep, that monster — is here, and contributor Emme Hall has thoughts after spending a day behind the wheel. 

It's earnings season, and the U.S.-China trade war is starting to leave a scratch on the paint of automakers everywhere. And, well, I don't think we'll be able to buff it out.

Ford and General Motors pulled their guidance for the year, citing economic uncertainty related to Trump's tariffs. Meanwhile, Rivian said it will likely deliver fewer vehicles this year (40,000 to 46,000 EVs) than previously forecasted due to tariffs and other regulatory changes. Reminder: The company was already tracking for its third straight year with no volume growth before the guidance cut. There was some good news for Rivian, though: It generated gross profit (yeah I know, gross profit isn't exactly my fave, either). But this met a contractual milestone that unlocked about $1 billion in funding from Volkswagen Group as part of a joint venture with the German automaker.

Ford is raising the price of the all-electric Mustang Mach-E SUV and the Maverick pickup by as much as $2,000 due to the import taxes Trump is placing on vehicles made in Mexico.

Lucid Motors has been working through some quality “hiccups” in the early stages of delivering its long-awaited electric Gravity SUV.

Mitsubishi Motors is in talks with Foxconn to source an electric car model the Japanese automaker plans to sell in Australia and New Zealand in the latter half of 2026.

Tesla sales continue to slump across Europe despite an April EV sales swell.

Joby Aviation seems to be settling on 2026 for its first commercial passenger service, according to its first-quarter earnings report. The electric vertical takeoff and landing startup-turned-SPAC was targeting 2025, then was stating “early 2026.” Now it's just 2026, which suggests it might not be early next year.

United States Customs and Border Protection plans to log every person leaving the country by vehicle by taking photos at border crossings of every passenger and matching their faces to their passports, visas, or travel documents, WIRED has learned.

The escalated documentation of travelers could be used to track how many people are self-deporting, or leave the US voluntarily, which the Trump administration is fervently encouraging to people in the country illegally.

CBP exclusively tells WIRED, in response to an inquiry to the agency, that it plans to mirror the current program it's developing—photographing every person entering the US and match their faces with their travel documents—to the outbound lanes going to Canada and Mexico. The agency currently does not have a system that monitors people leaving the country by vehicle.

“Although we are still working on how we would handle outbound vehicle lanes, we will ultimately expand to this area,” CBP spokesperson Jessica Turner tells WIRED.

Turner could not provide a timeline on when CBP would begin monitoring people leaving the country by vehicle.

She tells WIRED that CBP currently matches photos of people coming into the country with “all documented photos, i.e., passports, visas, green cards, etc,” and adds that all “alien/non-US citizens encounter photos taken at border crossing” are stored by CBP. “The encounter photos can be used for subsequent crossings to verify identity,” Turner says. She did not specify whether CBP may integrate additional photos or data sources in the future.

When asked, Turner says it's not currently evident that a purpose of the outbound face-matching system would be tracking self-deporations. “Not to say it won't happen in the future, though, with the way self-deportation is going,” Turner says. She later adds that the goal of an outbound system would be to “biometrically confirm departure from the US.” This differs from the purpose of tracking people coming into the US, she says, which also considers the “purpose and intent” of entering the country.

WIRED reported this week that CBP recently asked tech companies to send pitches on how they would ensure every single person entering the country by vehicle, including people two or three rows back, would be instantly photographed and matched with their travel documents. CBP has struggled to do this on its own. The results of a 152-day test of this system, which took place at the Anzalduas border crossing between Mexico and Texas, showed that the cameras captured photos of everyone in the car that met “validation requirements” for face-matching just 61 percent of the time.

Currently, neither CBP nor Immigration and Customs Enforcement have any publicly known tools for tracking self-deportations, aside from an ICE app that allows people to tell the agency when they leave the country.

Last month, ICE announced that it is paying the software company Palantir $30 million to build a tool called ImmigrationOS that would give the agency “near real-time visibility” on people self-deporting from the US, with the goal of having accurate numbers on how many people are doing so, according to a contract justification published a few days later.

When asked, CBP would not confirm or deny whether its monitoring of outbound vehicles would or could be integrated with ImmigrationOS. “CBP does not use Palantir Technologies,” Turner says. (CBP has paid for Palantir services three times, with the last payment in 2013.)

ICE has not specified where Palantir would get the data to power the ImmigrationOS. However, the agency notes that Palantir could create ImmigrationOS by configuring the case management system that the company has provided to ICE since 2014.

This case management system integrates all of the information ICE may have about a person from investigative records or government databases, according to a government privacy assessment published in 2016. At the time of the assessment, it stored information about people's physical attributes—like hair and eye color, height and weight, and any scars or tattoos—as well as any "location-related data” from “covert tracking devices” and any data from license plate readers, which can provide a detailed travel history.

DHS noted in a 2024 report that CBP has struggled to get biometric data from people leaving the country over land—meaning, people traveling via "cars, trains, buses, bicycles, trucks, and on foot.” The report says that CBP wants to create a “biometric-based departure program” to monitor when people considered aliens leave the country, which DHS notes is required under US law.

The Trump administration is strongly encouraging self-deportation. In March, the Department of Homeland Security revoked the legal status of more than half a million people from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela who were given temporary parole to stay in the US due to instability in their home countries. A judge temporarily blocked the move, but the government is challenging this in court.

In April, the Social Security Administration listed more than 6,000 of these people who had temporary parole as dead, as a way of effectively ending their financial lives in the US. DHS also sent emails to an unknown number of people claiming that their legal parole had been revoked and demanding them to self-deport. Then, this week, the Trump administration offered to pay people in the country illegally $1,000 for a plane ticket to self-deport.

In another unhinged social media rant, President Donald Trump once again demonstrated that words really don't mean anything anymore. This time, Trump directed his ire at a Biden-era program intended to bridge the digital divide. On Truth Social, Trump announced his intention to end the Digital Equity Act while labeling it as “racist” and “unconstitutional”.

In 2021, former president Joe Biden passed the Digital Equity Act as part of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. It provided $2.75 billion to establish three federal grant programs administered by the National Telecommunications and Information Administration. Per the agency, DEA's aim is to ensure that everyone “[has] the skills, technology, and capacity needed to reap the full benefits of our digital economy.” Think digital skills and workforce training,  promoting high-speed internet access in rural and tribal areas, and improving accessibility for disabled people.

Per the New York Times, $60 million went to funding states' and territories' programs, including in rural areas like Indiana, Alabama, Arkansas, Iowa, and Kansas. But of course, anything from Biden's administration can't continue. On Thursday, Trump wrote that he and Secretary of Commerce, Howard Lutnick, were in agreement about the DEA. He wrote, “No more woke handouts based on race! The Digital Equity Program is a RACIST and ILLEGAL $2.5 BILLION DOLLAR giveaway.” He added that he plans to end it “IMMEDIATELY”.

There's no need to give Trump an ounce of credence anytime he calls something racist. You wouldn't entertain a member of the National Socialist German Workers' Party telling you what constitutes anti-semitism, right? Or, to echo the words of Sen. Patty Murray (D-WA), who authored the bill: “As usual, the President has no idea what he's talking about.” That being said, it's still important to note that the DEA only mentions race once when saying that the program can cover racial or ethnic minorities. The law also has a general nondiscrimination clause that mentions race, but that's taken from the Civil Rights Act of 1964 so… Go beef with that.

In her statement, Murray added, “It's absolutely insane that resources meant to help red and blue communities — everyone from local school districts and libraries to workforce training programs and Tribes — close the digital divide will be illegally blocked because the President doesn't like the word equity. Americans are sick and tired of extremist right-wing culture wars being forced down our throats.”

The digital divide includes not only the ability to access devices or the internet but also a lack of skills to navigate them, poor infrastructure, etc. As more of our world moves online with tele-health appointments, digital applications for jobs or benefits, online schooling like during the pandemic, and etc, it's a pressing issue. But since DEA is so young, it hasn't had a chance to do much of anything yet. In fact, a chunk of funding announced on Jan. 6 and Jan. 17 of this year has yet to be distributed, and the Trump administration froze funding in April.

The National Digital Inclusion Alliance was one group impacted by the freeze. In a statement, NDIA said that out of its subgrantees' 13 programs waiting for funding, one would have served over 30,000 in the next five years alone. It added, “Now, a Truth Social post has put ours and 65+ other community-based digital trust inclusion programs at risk, and real people are about to pay the price.”

“This decision has no policy rationale and makes no economic sense,” the NDIA continued. “Cutting this funding will deepen the divide and force greater costs down the road.”

It's not clear if Trump has taken any concrete steps to end the DEA outside of posting on social media. But as with his administration's many other attempts to freeze federal funding, Trump's decision could be taken up in court if he makes any further moves.

Data center operator CoreWeave is reportedly seeking a $1.5 billion debt deal after a disappointing IPO. 

According to the Financial Times, CoreWeave is holding a roadshow this week with bankers at JPMorgan for debt options. The company's executives intend to use the meetings to gauge investor interest.

New Jersey-based CoreWeave listed its shares in March, initially targeting a $2.7 billion fundraise. The company was forced to slash that total to $1.5 billion following investor concern about its large debt burden and a weakening market for AI infrastructure.  

CoreWeave, which has customers including Microsoft, raised $12.9 billion of debt in the past two years to build data centers. The company had about $8 billion of total debt on its balance sheet as of December 2024, and is facing debt and interest payments of $7.5 billion by the end of 2026, the Financial Times previously reported.

TechCrunch has contacted CoreWeave for comment.

Less memory, less problems with regulators?


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Nvidia plans to introduce a cut-down version of its HGX H20 AI processor in China by July, aiming to retain access to the market after U.S. officials effectively barred the original version through updated export regulations, Reuters reports. According to preliminary information, the revised AI GPU will feature less onboard HBM memory to comply with newly imposed technical limits and replace the previously approved model.

Among the changes of the new AI GPU is reduced memory capacity, which will affect the ability of the processor to train large language models with tens and hundreds of billions of parameters, one Reuters source noted. In addition, the final performance characteristics may be adjustable depending on how end customers configure the HGX GPU modules, potentially enabling minor flexibility despite the overall downgrade.

In April, U.S. authorities restricted sales of AMD's Instinct MI308, Nvidia's HGX 20, and some other AI processors to China (including Hong Kong and Macau) due to unpublished export regulations. As a result, AMD and Nvidia had to write down inventory worth billions of dollars ($5.5 billion for Nvidia, $800 million for AMD) as export licenses for goods bound for China are reviewed with a presumption of denial.

However, to sustain access to the critical market, Nvidia is now incorporating a set of downgrades to ensure it stays within the permissible thresholds set by the U.S. government. Nvidia has already communicated these plans to major customers in China's cloud computing sector.

If the information about the downgraded HGX H20 processor is correct, it will be Nvidia's third Hopper-based GPU designed specifically for China that relies on cut-down H100 silicon. It is noteworthy that there is no word on Blackwell-based AI products for China.

After the U.S. government imposed its first set of restrictions on AI and HPC GPUs exported to China in 2022, Nvidia built its H800 processor with reduced networking capabilities. The H800 only represented a minor performance downgrade compared to the original H100. After the U.S. administration imposed new export rules that restricted the performance of processors shipped to China, Nvidia developed its HGX H20 based on the H100 for AI training as well as L20 PCIe and L2 PCIe cards based on the AD104 GPUs for AI inference.

My favorite place to wake up is in a sleeping bag, which is good because I tend to wake up a lot when sleeping in a sleeping bag. It's not the bag, it's the pad underneath me. I've tried them all (it's part of my job), and while some are definitely better than others, I've never found one that quite fulfilled every backpacker's dream—a lightweight, packable sleeping pad that feels just like the bed you left at home.

Until now, that is. The Therm-a-Rest NeoLoft sleeping pad isn't the lightest at 25 ounces—goodbye, ultralight readers—but the 4.6-inch cushion is a true luxury, and it offers a great night's rest, which can be more valuable than shedding a few ounces.

There are two problems with carrying a big sleeping pad in the backcountry. First, there's the weight you have to carry, and then there's the amount of room it takes up in your pack. The ultralight community online will try to convince you that camp comfort—that is, your shelter and your sleeping set up—aren't as important as keeping weight down, so you can move fast.

Depending on your goals in the backcountry, that may indeed be true. But after trying it for quite a few trips, I've found it's not the case for me. For me, carrying a little more weight in the form of a heavier tent and sleeping pad affords me a better night's sleep, which helps me (on average) to hike further than I do with less weight but poorer sleep.

Therm-a-Rest's new NeoLoft pad steps into this weight/size/comfort debate by leaning heavily on the side of comfort. It is undeniably big, relative to something like Therm-a-Rest's XLite pads or Sea to Summit's Ether Light series (our two favorite ultralight sleeping pads). For all that, though, the Neoloft isn't that big when packed down, especially considering how big it is when you inflate it.

The NeoLoft reliably packs down to a size that's just larger than a Nalgene water bottle—about an inch bigger around and an inch taller for the regular wide size pad that I tested. It's a tight squeeze fitting the NeoLoft in my Hyperlite Junction 40 with the rest of my gear, but it works for shorter trips where I'm not carrying a ton of food. For trips longer than three or four nights, I'd want a 55L pack. (Naturally, this will depend a lot on the size of the rest of your gear. You can see what I carry at LighterPack.)

I'll confess that I was dreading testing this pad. I didn't want to lug it with me, but when I actually loaded it up … I didn't really notice the extra 8 ounces over the Nemo Tensor I usually carry. Again though, I am not trying to win any ultralight prizes. Rather, I'm looking for the right balance between weight and comfort.

I test organic mattresses for WIRED, and I use roughly the same criteria to judge sleeping pads. Comfort while sleeping comes down to how well your pad keeps you warm, how well it relieves pressure, how well it provides support, and how stable it is to sleep on.

Therm-a-Rest NeoLoft Sleeping Pad

Warmth is regrettably subjective. I sleep hot, so I am generally fine with an R-7 pad even in the depths of Wisconsin winters. I normally carry a Nemo Tensor Trail with an R-value of 3 in summer and fall and am plenty warm with that down to freezing. Unsurprisingly, I was never cold on the NeoLoft even down to one night that hit 15 degrees Fahrenheit on my thermometer.

Internally, Therm-a-Rest has filled the NeoLoft with a trademark word salad of features dubbed ContourCore Matrix, ThermaCapture, and 3D Construction. The 3D construction is what makes the NeoLoft look like a plush car camping pad. It refers to the squared-off edges that come from having vertical sidewalls. This makes for a larger sleeping area, compared to a similar pad where the edges taper off. The NeoLoft gives you full height and excellent firmness all the way to the edge, much like our favorite car camping pad, the Therm-a-Rest MondoKing. There is also a side rail baffle all the way around the pad which acts as a kind of small barrier, helping to keep you on the pad.

ContourCore Matrix is Therm-a-Rest's name for the triangular horizontal baffles running through out the pad. There's two layers of baffles, with the top layer being of a stretchier fabric that helps provide pressure relief, especially for side sleepers. The baffles, combined with the stretch knit top fabric, make this pad so comfortable. The knit top is also excellent for pressure relief and the side baffles also help provide support. I never had this pad “taco” on me.

The ThermaCapture is a reflective coating inside the pad designed to radiate your body heat back up and keep you warmer. Pretty much every pad on the market uses some kind of reflective internal material, with all of them adding to the noise level of the pad. Thankfully, there's enough space here that the NeoLoft is quite quiet. The stretch knit top also helps cut down on that swishy nylon sound. It also makes sleeping on the pad with a quilt much more comfortable. It's not quite Zenbivy-sheet-level comfortable, but it's much better than the awful feeling of sleeping on plasticky nylon. It also does a much better job of keeping you from sliding off in the night.

Therm-a-Rest uses its twin-valve inflation system on the NeoLoft—one valve to inflate, one to deflate, which I happen to like because it saves fiddling with double-function valves. The Neoloft comes with the biggest pump sack I've ever used (54L). It took about 2 minutes to inflate the NeoLoft, about six to seven fills of the pump sack depending on how full you want the pad. It works, but I've long since gone to the motorized side, using a Flextail pump most of the time. The extra size of the NeoLoft does reduce the number of times the Flextail can fill it, though. In my testing, I could only fill the reliably NeoLoft 9 times with the Flextail, compared to 11 for my Nemo pad.

However you inflate the NeoLoft, my one tip would be to experiment with how full you fill it. With 4.6 inches of loft, there's quite a bit of room to remove air and find the most comfortable spot for your body and sleep habits. For me that was around 85 percent full, but even down to about 60 percent I didn't bottom out, which is unheard of in a backpacking pad. Keep in mind that the R-value is for a fully inflated pad. When you don't fill it up all the way, you lose some insulation, so you have to balance that with comfort and support.

Finally, one cautionary note: This is a big pad when inflated. Two would not fit side by side in many of the two-person ultralight tents I've tested, and fully inflated I can't quite sit up in the Hilleberg Akto. At 85 percent inflated, I can sit up in the Akto, so it's not a huge issue. It's just worth making sure that it will fit in your tent before you buy (especially if you're camping with a partner who will also have one).

The Therm-a-Rest NeoLoft is the most comfortable sleeping pad I've ever used. The nearest competition is the Big Agnes Rapide SL Insulated pad, which weights a bit less (17 ounces) with an R-value of 4.8 and thickness of 4.25. It's close on paper. While the Rapide SL is a very nice pad worth considering if you're really counting ounces, the NeoLoft wins when it comes to comfort. I think the NeoLoft is worth the space and weight for those who value a good night's sleep. It's a wonderfully comfortable pad that will have you forgetting that you're sleeping on the ground.

This LLM will unlock the possibilities with your LEGO bricks.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


A research team from Carnegie Mellon University built an AI model called LegoGPT that outputs valid LEGO designs from text inputs. According to the team's research paper that's posted on GitHub, they trained “an autoregressive large language model to predict the next brick to add via next-token prediction,” but the key takeway is that the AI LLM creates LEGO designs from scratch.

The AI was trained on a dataset with more than 47,000 LEGO structures that build over 28,000 unique 3D objects, including bookshelves, tables, chairs, cars, ships, guitars, and more. This was then used to train the AI model, allowing it to create unique and original designs solely from text inputs.

The tool is available for free on GitHub, and you can pair this with a computer vision model or image processing AI. For example, you can take a photo of your available LEGO bricks and let the AI give you a multitude of unique options for building with what you already have.

The team added a validity check and physics-aware rollback during autoregressive inference, ensuring that the final output will always be valid (i.e., no overlapping bricks) and stable (i.e., no floating bricks). Furthermore, LegoGPT's final output can be built by both humans and robots.

This is how the team created the dataset — StableText2Lego — used to train LegoGPT: a text prompt input is first converted into a ShapeNetCore mesh. This is then plugged into a 20 x 20 x 20 voxel grid from which the initial LEGO brick layout is determined.

This layout is then varied while still keeping the overall shape, and then unstable designs are filtered out from the final output. Those left are then rendered in 24 different viewpoints, and then GPT-4o is used to generate descriptions for the final output.



This is how it creates a new design through text: LegoGPT converts the text into a LEGO design, which is then converted into text tokens ordered from bottom to top. Instructions are then created to pair the structured LEGO bricks with annotations explaining the design, so that the AI will understand the relationships between the text prompt and the physical bricks.

From there, LegoGPT predicts the next brick needed to build the design using an autoregressive model. That means it will verify a brick's validity at each step, checking if it is well-formatted, exists in the library, and does not overlap with existing bricks. This will continue until the design is completed, after which its stability is tested.

If the AI determines that the output is unstable, it will roll back to the last stable state and continue generating from that point. Once it gets a stable final output, then the design is complete.



If you want to play with the AI yourself, the team released its dataset, code, and models, making it easier for anyone to fork the team's work. One development we can see is if someone converts this into a downloadable AI app with a customizable brick library.

Apple is reportedly developing new chips to drive smart glasses similar to Meta's Ray-Ban Meta as well as more powerful Macs and AI servers.

Bloomberg's Mark Gurman notes that one of the chips is inspired by the Apple Watch's low-power processors. Apple aims to put these chips into mass production with TSMC by the end of next year or 2027, according to the report.

Glasses are a big focus. Bloomberg has previously reported that Apple CEO Tim Cook is determined to beat Meta in the glasses market, where the latter has seen success in recent years. Since 2023, Meta has sold around 2 million pairs of Ray-Ban Metas.

According to Bloomberg, Apple is currently exploring non-AR glasses that use cameras to scan the surrounding environment and rely on AI to assist users. One of the processors under development will be able to control these cameras and other components without draining too much battery, per the report.

A Florida bill, which would have required social media companies to provide an encryption backdoor for allowing police to access user accounts and private messages, has failed to pass into law.

The Social Media Use by Minors bill was “indefinitely postponed” and “withdrawn from consideration” in the Florida House of Representatives earlier this week. Lawmakers in the Florida Senate had already voted to advance the legislation, but a bill requires both legislative chambers to pass before it can become law.

The bill would have required social media firms to “provide a mechanism to decrypt end-to-end encryption when law enforcement obtains a subpoena,” which are typically issued by law enforcement agencies and without judicial oversight.

Digital rights group the Electronic Frontier Foundation called the bill “dangerous and dumb.” Security professionals have long argued that it is impossible to create a secure backdoor that cannot also be maliciously abused, and encryption backdoors put user data at risk of data breaches.

A bug, or a feature?

The first benchmark results of Nvidia's GB10 Superchip for compact AI workstations in Geekbench 6 have been published. While the processor promises serious performance for AI applications, its compute capabilities seem relatively modest. The CPU trails behind Apple's entry-level M3 and Qualcomm's higher-end Snapdragon X Elite system-on-chip (SoC), and we are not even talking about high-end offerings. It should be noted that we are talking about a pre-release product running on Windows 11 Enterprise Insider Preview.

Nvidia's GB10 Superchip system-in-package (SiP) comprises a Grace CPU packing 10 high-performance Arm Cortex-X925 cores (at up to 3.90 GHz) and 10 energy-efficient Cortex-A725 cores, as well as a Blackwell GPU that can deliver 1 PetaFLOPS of FP4 compute performance for AI applications. The SiP has a 256-bit memory interface for 128 GB of unified LPDDR5X memory with an up to 273 GB/s bandwidth (so, the memory capabilities of the SiP are the same as in the case of Apple's M4 Pro).

Arm's Cortex-X925 core, clocked at 3.90 GHz, delivers fairly strong single-threaded performance, achieving a Geekbench 6 single-thread score of 2,960. This puts GB10 nearly on par with Qualcomm's Snapdragon X Elite and close to Apple's M3, which were launched in 2024 and 2023, respectively. Both processors are known for their high IPC performance, and since we are talking about a processor for an AI workstation here, single-thread performance matters.

However, by today's standards, roughly 3000 points in Geekbench 6 single-thread benchmark is a good, but hardly an outstanding result. Apple's M4, AMD's Ryzen 9950X, and Intel's Core Ultra 9 285K offer considerably higher single-thread performance despite having a significantly slower memory subsystem. Unlike Apple's M4 Pro, which has a 256-bit LPDDR5X memory subsystem with a massive 273 GB/s bandwidth, Nvidia's GB10 is 33%, or 1,000 points behind.

Of course, a 20-core configuration implies strong multi-thread performance. However, GB10's score of 10,682 points in Geekbench 6 is modest at best. The unit is behind Apple's M3 (which has eight cores) and is 39% behind Apple's M4 (which has 10 cores). Nvidia's GB10 also falls short of Qualcomm's 12-core Snapdragon X Elite's score of 15,654 and is dramatically behind Apple's M4 Max or AMD's Ryzen 9 9950X CPUs, all of which score above 20,000.

Such a poor result of Nvidia's GB10 may indicate that its Cortex-A725 efficiency cores contribute less to the overall score, or do not work at all due to issues with scheduling, which could be solved by Windows 11 or Nvidia microcode update. Alternatively, this may mean that GB10, in its current form, is not optimized for CPU-heavy workloads and is not delivering maximum performance in AI applications under strict power envelopes and thermal budgets of compact platforms like Nvidia's DGX Spark.



This assumption makes sense when considering GB10's general role as a solution for compact AI workstations. In AI workloads, the CPU is often relegated to scheduling, data staging, and light preprocessing tasks rather than being the primary computational driver. Hence, the CPU design prioritizes good-enough general-purpose performance while minimizing power draw and die area.

However, if we look more broadly, the situation seems mixed. Nvidia officially outlined its client PC processor ambitions by announcing its GB10 Superchip for compact AI workstations earlier this year at CES. However, a rumor is that the company will formally announce its N1 and N1X processors for desktop and laptop PCs at Computex later this month. The CPU configuration of N1 and N1X SoCs is expected to resemble that of GB10, so their compute capabilities will be close to GB10's. However, for now, GB10 does not impress in Geekbench 6 under Windows 11.

In summary, while Nvidia's GB10 CPU delivers modest single-thread performance that is compatible with Apple's M3, Qualcomm's Snapdragon X Elite X1E-100, and Intel's Core Ultra 5 235, it shows clear limits in multi-core scalability. This trade-off may either result from using a pre-release Windows 11 Enterprise Insider Preview or may even be intentional, given GB10's role in AI-centric workstations. Also, remember that Geekbench is an artificial benchmark, and the real-world performance of Nvidia's GB10 may be far more competitive.

When it comes to password hacking, the RTX 5090 is anywhere between 33% and twice as fast as the RTX 4090.

The RTX 5090 is not only good for gaming and AI — it also excels at password cracking. Hive Systems updated its password cracking benchmark suite with 12 RTX 5090 graphics cards — Nvidia's fastest and best graphics card for gaming currently, and found all twelve cards working together can break simple eight-character passwords in under 15 minutes.

Hive Systems is in its 5th year of benchmarking password cracking times on GPUs; the last update they made was in 2024, featuring the RTX 4090. Rather than cracking an actual password itself, the outlet cracks hashes, which are scrambled versions of reproducible text generated by software.

Hashes are a popular method for securing customer passwords against hackers by storing customer passwords as hashes on servers. When hackers go to steal a password database from a company's server that is secured with hashing, all they will see are hashes of the passwords they represent rather than the actual passwords themselves.



Cracking passwords with this method involves making a list of all possible combinations of characters to make a password, then matching them to a stolen database featuring password hashes. Graphics cards are particularly good at this methodology due to highly parallelized computing capabilities.

With 12 RTX 5090s, Hive Systems found Nvidia's latest flagship can crack the hash equivalent of eight-character passwords featuring numbers only in just 15 minutes. Passwords comprised of eight lower-case letters, the dozen RTX 5090s were able to crack in 3 weeks.

On the other end of the spectrum, passwords taking advantage of numbers, upper and lowercase letters would take 12 RTX 5090s 62 years to crack, and 164 years to crack with symbols added into the mix.

For a generation-on-generation perspective, a single RTX 5090 can crack a numerical-only password hash with eight characters in three hours. A single RTX 4090 can accomplish the same task in four hours, representing a 33% performance improvement for the RTX 5090 over the RTX 4090 in this specific scenario.

However, as the password complexity increases, the RTX 5090 becomes faster and faster in comparison. Moving up to a hash representing an eight-character password made up of numbers, upper and lowercase letters combined with symbols, the RTX 5090 is allegedly twice as fast as the RTX 4090. But cracking a password that complex would take the RTX 5090 a millennium to accomplish.

Hive Systems' research demonstrates the dangers of low complexity passwords and how adding just a bit of complexity in the form of symbols, capitalized letters, and numbers can make a huge difference for security. The good news is that cracking hashes in the way Hive Systems demonstrates requires hackers to have a stolen database of password hashes in the first place. Without this, hackers can't brute-force hack password hashes.

An attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) who's overseeing a high-profile deportation case in Louisiana says she was stripped of her electronics moments before a pivotal hearing, preventing her from accessing evidence and court records that remained available to the three US government attorneys in the room, each of whom were allowed use of a laptop by the court.

Louisiana immigration judge Jamee Comans ruled late last month that Columbia graduate student Mahmoud Khalil was eligible for deportation. During that hearing, however, Khalil's attorney Nora Ahmed says she was barred from bringing her laptop into the courtroom, despite having filed the proper paperwork in advance and being a frequent visitor to the immigration facility.

“There should not be an advantage, no matter how small or how large, provided to a particular party over the other,” says Ahmed. “Because that starts to infect the proceedings themselves and the notion of fundamental fairness that we all uphold in courtroom proceedings.”

The Justice Department did not respond to a request for comment. Attempts to reach Comans through the Executive Office of Immigration Review (EOIR) were unsuccessful.

The son of Palestinian refugees, Khalil,—a US green card holder—became a key figure last year in the Columbia University protests against the war in Gaza, joining a coalition of student organizations espousing outrage and calling for divestment over the Israeli military's bombings of hospitals, schools, and homes in the wake of the surprise attacks by Hamas-led militants in October 2023. Khalil remains one of the most high-profile targets of the Trump administration's ongoing push to expel foreign students protesting Israel's actions.

The US government has not accused Khalil, whose wife and newborn son were born in the US, of committing any crime. The government acknowledged last month that Khalil had been detained without a warrant due to “exigent circumstances,” claiming the 30-year-old graduate student, whose wife was eight months pregnant at the time, was a “flight risk.”

Following his arrest at his university-owned apartment complex in New York on March 8, Khalil was transported to the Central Louisiana ICE Processing Center, a for-profit prison overseen by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), where he is now subject to a tribunal system that bears little resemblance to the US courts that hear citizens' cases. A majority of people fighting deportation cannot afford—nor do they have any recognized right—to legal representation. (This includes, most glaringly, the tens of thousands of unaccompanied children who enter the US each year.) Political influence weighs heavily on the system, which, nestled under the Justice Department, is invariably subject to the whims of the current occupant of the White House, with its judges serving by appointment of the US attorney general.

In an unusual move, on April 8, Comans booted nearly 600 people attempting to observe one of Khalil's hearings over the court's videoconferencing software, declaring that, going forward, only his attorneys or wife would be permitted to view the proceedings online. Ahmed, legal director of the ACLU of Louisiana, appeared to argue against the enhanced secrecy on April 11.

Electronics in the detention area are strictly forbidden, but Ahmed had filed paperwork the previous night to ensure that when the hearing began, she'd be allowed, as Khalil's legal representative, to enter the courtroom with her laptop in line with EOIR policy. Nevertheless, in a sworn declaration, Ahmed says that minutes before the hearing began she was informed by the detention center staff that, on Comans' instructions, she was forbidden from bringing her devices inside, forcing her to turn over her laptop to the faculty and enter the courtroom empty-handed. Once the hearing began, Khalil says, she sat opposite three Homeland Security attorneys, with each their own laptop.

The Hollywood image of attorneys wheeling stacks of bankers' boxes into court is mostly antiquated, says Ahmed, whose gigabytes worth of trial data are digitally stored. “You effectively are using the technology that you have to be able to respond in real time, or inquire in real time, or to show your client in real time, what evidence the government may be talking about or responding to,” she tells WIRED. “That's always very critical, because you want to make sure that any representation that's being made by the other side is factual.”

Michelle Méndez, an attorney at the National Immigration Project, says the asymmetry in access to technology and resources between the government and non-citizens in court is a reflection of who controls it.

“As long as immigration courts are under the direction of the executive branch, non-citizens are never going to receive a fundamentally fair proceeding," she says.

Méndez notes that, since February 2022, the Justice Department has required all immigration attorneys to file documents with the courts electronically, effectively establishing the expectation that attorneys should rely on digital access for court filings, case citations, and other subject matter, rather than risk expensive continuances in notoriously backlogged courts.

"The image of somebody coming in with boxes is definitely apt in those circumstances," she says, of the sheer volume of material attorneys would be required to lug around without electronic access. “The worst-case scenario is that the attorney misses out on being able to offer the court whatever it is that the court seeks from them. They don't have it.”

According to Ahmed, both the ICE center's warden, Shad Rice, and Khalil's judge denied ordering the ban, which Ahmed says she received word of only minutes before the hearing began. “When I inquired as to why, I was told that it was the immigration judge that had made the determination,” she tells WIRED. She requested to speak with the judge privately before the hearing, she says, but her request was denied.

Ahmed says Comans eventually informed her that the electronics ban had come at the request of the ICE facility. But when pressed to allow Ahmed to confer with the warden, who was also in the room at the time, the request was denied. “It seemed particularly unjust to Mr. Khalil,” she says, “as he looked at the Department of Homeland Security attorneys who had three laptops at their table.” During the hearing, she adds, the government lawyers were conducting Google searches, writing emails, and reading from papers as the proceedings took place.

In a declaration filed with the court, Ahmed states that she spoke to Warden Rice after the hearing had concluded and that the warden indicated that the judge "appeared to contradict herself" when she blamed the faculty at the detention center for denying Amhed access to her devices. Ahmed corresponded with Rice over the following week, working to ensure that the computer ban would not remain in effect.

The warden eventually responded on April 25, saying they'd met with the EOIR, which oversees removal proceedings on behalf of the DOJ. Ahmed was informed there'd be no attempt from the facility to strip her of her devices going forward, but that the judge ultimately held the authority to remove any electronics deemed “a distraction” or inessential to “representing the client.”

In a subsequent motion, Ahmed wrote that the courts had long recognized the obligation of prison officials to refrain from “placing obstacles in the way” of an attorney communicating with a prisoner, adding that the denial of her electronics during the hearing not only contradicted DOJ policy, but “greater notions of fundamental fairness that animate our legal system.”

ICE declined to comment. Warden Rice could not be reached for comment. Christopher Ferreira, a spokesperson for GEO Group, which runs the ICE detention center, says the for-profit prison company follows the guidance handed to it by its government partners: "Decisions related to access to courtrooms and legal visitation areas at the ICE Processing Centers, where GEO provides support services, are made in consultation with ICE and EOIR.”

Anthony Enriquez, an attorney with RFK Human Rights, says much of what's happening in the Khalil case is emblematic of larger structural issues in the immigration system. “We talk a lot about due process, about how it applies to everyone in the country, whether or not you're a citizen or a non-citizen,” he says. "But the very procedures and the courts that we use to determine whether or not people do have a right to stay in the United States, there's a fundamental flaw in them where both the prosecutor and the adjudicator are part of the same prosecutorial branch, the executive branch."

"The judges that are presiding over immigration cases; they're called immigration judges in name," he adds. "But in actual form, they're really just employees of the Department of Justice."

Second only to Texas in number of detainees, Louisiana's nine immigration detention centers have faced allegations of human rights abuses in recent years, from physical and sexual assaults to medical neglect and bug-infested food. In an August 2024 report, compiled in part by the ACLU itself, the system was described by a coalition of civil rights organizations as an “inhumane” corporate “profit machine,” where “basic human rights are systematically ignored.”

Khalil's case in Louisiana is effectively on hold for much of this month following a ruling by a US District Court judge in New Jersey, who last week shot down the Trump administration effort to stop Khalil from suing the government. In a 108-page ruling, New Jersey District Judge Michael Farbiarz said the government had no authority to prevent the court from reviewing Khalil's claims. Khalil has accused the US government of unlawfully detaining him for political views in violation of the First Amendment.

In a statement, Khalil's wife, Noor Abdalla, a Michigan-born dentist, said the New Jersey ruling had come to her as a relief. “This is an important step toward securing Mahmoud's freedom. But there is still more work to be done,” she says. “I will continue to strongly advocate for my husband, so he can come home to our family and feel the pure joy all parents know of holding your first-born child in your arms.”

Jayde Powell doesn't plan on being an influencer forever. In fact, the 32-year-old's goal is to get off social media by the time she's 40.

Powell is also a social media marketing strategist and content creator who posts around one video per day, primarily on LinkedIn. She attends events by brands like Uber and Delta Airlines and advises others on how to land brand partnerships. A few weeks ago, she posted that she'd made over $50,000 in the first quarter of the year.

Despite her success, Powell says she has already suffered the negative effects of being chronically online.

“I just do not think it's OK to be waking up and looking at my phone every morning,” she says, noting she started wearing glasses that filter blue light in 2021 in an effort to relieve the migraines she has suffered from constantly staring at a screen. She admits she's addicted to social media and the dopamine that comes with the highs of engagement.

“It's embarrassing to say, but also it's true.”

Powell sees a therapist about once a month and says the “majority” of her sessions are spent talking about career-related issues, including burnout, the constant pressure to stay relevant in her field, and harassment from the public. While she says most of her creator friends want a therapist, due to the instability of their income “it's almost seen as a luxury.”

CreatorCare, a newly launched telehealth therapy service, aims to bridge that gap by providing sliding-scale therapy that's specifically tailored to people working in the creator economy. The venture—a joint initiative between the telehealth company Revive Health Therapy and the community group Creators 4 Mental Health—will provide people with access to human therapists, with virtual sessions ranging from $60 to $180.

The launch comes as more creators are speaking out about the industry's grind. In February, YouTuber Mr. Beast told host Steven Bartlett on the Diary of a CEO podcast, “If my mental health was a priority, I wouldn't be as successful as I am.” There have also been wider pushes to regulate how these workers are treated by the platforms they populate—and create profit for. A research study on influencers published in the journal Digital Health in 2024 found a “significant association” between extended social media use and heightened negative emotions, with those making less than $10,000 from their posting likely to feel worse.

CreatorCare cofounder Shira Lazar, 42, says although she loves the creativity and community that comes with working in the field, the “fear of disappearing fuels burnout in a system that constantly demands you feed the feeds.” Creators struggle with anxiety, depression, disordered eating, and income that can fluctuate wildly from month to month, she says. Creators can also struggle to form a strong sense of identity outside of who they present as on social media, Lazar says.

At the same time, she points out, it's a highly sought-after career choice, with 57 percent of Gen Z respondents saying they want to become an influencer, according to a 2023 survey by research firm Morning Consult.

Amy Kelly, cofounder of Revive Health Therapy, is a licensed family therapist who sees many creators. She is familiar with many of these issues, likening the growth of the industry to “a machine that's been built with zero maintenance.”

She says influencers and creators can also lose their sense of perspective, due to the constant synthetic connections they're forming online.

“When we are getting these likes and hearts and messages, we get these dopamine responses … It mocks and mimics in real-life interaction,” she says.

But on the flip side, when those comments aren't flattering, it can feel disproportionately bad. “My reaction is going to be heightened versus like a random person on the street shouting some bad words to me,” she says.

It's a problem Powell can relate to. She says she recently was called fat online simply for praising a performance by Beyoncé's daughter, Blue Ivy. When she helped launch a cannabis community for Black women in the industry, she says she was subjected to harassment on X—mostly by other Black people—and was accused of “trying to plant ideas about drug use and the Black community.”

When she's talking to executives, Powell sometimes emphasizes her marketing background rather than her status as an influencer. She says there's “definitely some stigma” around the latter, where it's perceived as “not a real job.”

But that perception is one that's changing, according to Danial Abas, president of the Creators Guild of America. The guild, which formed in 2023, is a nonprofit organization aimed at protecting and advocating for creators and influencers. It is not a union.

“I think that people and businesses don't quite recognize what influence means,” Abas says. “Attention is commerce, and every business requires attention … Creators are ahead of the curve in that they are creating attention for themselves.”

The guild, which says it represents more than 1,000 creators (Abas would not provide an exact number), recently released a “rider,” a set of standards that companies working with creators can adapt and legally comply with. One of the key principles is agreeing to pay creators within 90 days. Abas says lack of payment is a major stressor on creators.

“At a fundamental level, not knowing whether or not you're going to pay rent or your mortgage for work you've already done isn't right,” Abas says, noting that creators are often “not treated as professionals.” In terms of creating legitimacy for the profession, the guild is also looking at establishing accreditation for certain creators and establishing a database called Hue, similar to IMDB, to display their work.

The rider also stipulates that creators own the content they make. Abas says the rider has already been adopted by brands like Whalar and Linktree.

Abas says the guild is not a union because it wouldn't have the leverage of being able to strike, and “requiring payment terms can actually stifle creativity.” Likewise, he says the guild can't yet provide medical benefits to members, who pay $99 a year.

Lazar says she's been in talks with multiple associations to assess how creators might be able to qualify for health benefits, but it's still a work in progress. She's also hoping that others are inspired to follow CreatorCare's suit.

Unlike Powell, she doesn't see an off-ramp for herself and the pull of being a creator—so she wants to improve the conditions for everyone.

“I'm like Joan Rivers; I'll be creating until I die,” she says, “which is why I want to make sure I can thrive.”

Spatial Speech Translation addresses one of automatic translation's biggest challenges: lots of people speaking at the same time.

Imagine going for dinner with a group of friends who switch in and out of different languages you don't speak, but still being able to understand what they're saying. This scenario is the inspiration for a new AI headphone system that translates the speech of multiple speakers simultaneously, in real time.

The system, called Spatial Speech Translation, tracks the direction and vocal characteristics of each speaker, helping the person wearing the headphones to identify who is saying what in a group setting. 

“There are so many smart people across the world, and the language barrier prevents them from having the confidence to communicate,” says Shyam Gollakota, a professor at the University of Washington, who worked on the project. “My mom has such incredible ideas when she's speaking in Telugu, but it's so hard for her to communicate with people in the US when she visits from India. We think this kind of system could be transformative for people like her.”

While there are plenty of other live AI translation systems out there, such as the one running on Meta's Ray-Ban smart glasses, they focus on a single speaker, not multiple people speaking at once, and deliver robotic-sounding automated translations. The new system is designed to work with existing, off-the shelf noise-canceling headphones that have microphones, plugged into a laptop powered by Apple's M2 silicon chip, which can support neural networks. The same chip is also present in the Apple Vision Pro headset. The research was presented at the ACM CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems in Yokohama, Japan, this month.

Over the past few years, large language models have driven big improvements in speech translation. As a result, translation between languages for which lots of training data is available (such as the four languages used in this study) is close to perfect on apps like Google Translate or in ChatGPT. But it's still not seamless and instant across many languages. That's a goal a lot of companies are working toward, says Alina Karakanta, an assistant professor at Leiden University in the Netherlands, who studies computational linguistics and was not involved in the project. “I feel that this is a useful application. It can help people,” she says. 

They could help wearers focus on specific voices in noisy environments, such as a friend in a crowd or a tour guide amid the urban hubbub.

Spatial Speech Translation consists of two AI models, the first of which divides the space surrounding the person wearing the headphones into small regions and uses a neural network to search for potential speakers and pinpoint their direction. 

The second model then translates the speakers' words from French, German, or Spanish into English text using publicly available data sets. The same model extracts the unique characteristics and emotional tone of each speaker's voice, such as the pitch and the amplitude, and applies those properties to the text, essentially creating a “cloned” voice. This means that when the translated version of a speaker's words is relayed to the headphone wearer a few seconds later, it sounds as if it's coming from the speaker's direction and the voice sounds a lot like the speaker's own, not a robotic-sounding computer.

Given that separating out human voices is hard enough for AI systems, being able to incorporate that ability into a real-time translation system, map the distance between the wearer and the speaker, and achieve decent latency on a real device is impressive, says Samuele Cornell, a postdoc researcher at Carnegie Mellon University's Language Technologies Institute, who did not work on the project.

“Real-time speech-to-speech translation is incredibly hard,” he says. “Their results are very good in the limited testing settings. But for a real product, one would need much more training data—possibly with noise and real-world recordings from the headset, rather than purely relying on synthetic data.”

Gollakota's team is now focusing on reducing the amount of time it takes for the AI translation to kick in after a speaker says something, which will accommodate more natural-sounding conversations between people speaking different languages. “We want to really get down that latency significantly to less than a second, so that you can still have the conversational vibe,” Gollakota says.

This remains a major challenge, because the speed at which an AI system can translate one language into another depends on the languages' structure. Of the three languages Spatial Speech Translation was trained on, the system was quickest to translate French into English, followed by Spanish and then German—reflecting how German, unlike the other languages, places a sentence's verbs and much of its meaning at the end and not at the beginning, says Claudio Fantinuoli, a researcher at the Johannes Gutenberg University of Mainz in Germany, who did not work on the project. 

Reducing the latency could make the translations less accurate, he warns: “The longer you wait [before translating], the more context you have, and the better the translation will be. It's a balancing act.” 

The new general AI agent from China had some system crashes and server overload—but it's highly intuitive and shows real promise for the future of AI helpers.

What the firm found challenges some basic assumptions about how this technology really works.

The country poured billions into AI infrastructure, but the data center gold rush is unraveling as speculative investments collide with weak demand and DeepSeek shifts AI trends.

 May 09, 2025  

Living within a mile of a golf course is associated with a 126% increased risk for Parkinson's disease (PD), possibly due to increased pesticide exposure, results of a population-based case-control study suggest.

Results also showed drinking water from groundwater service areas with a golf course was associated with almost a twofold increased risk for the disease.

The study results imply that both vulnerable drinking water and airborne pollutant exposure may contribute to the risk of developing PD near golf courses, study investigator Brittany Krzyzanowski, PhD, assistant professor, Barrow Neurological Institute, Phoenix, told Medscape Medical News.

However, she cautioned that because the study is observational it cannot establish causality, so it is too early to recommend that individuals move away from golf courses.

Nevertheless, she added, the results suggest individuals should be aware of the potential risk and take steps to minimize their exposure.

The study was published online on May 8 in JAMA Network Open.

PD is likely caused by a complex interaction between genetic predisposition and environmental factors, including pesticide exposure. Previous research showed pesticides such as paraquat and rotenone induce Parkinson-like neurodegeneration in the substantia nigra, primarily through mechanisms involving oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and dopaminergic neuron apoptosis.

Golf courses are frequently treated with pesticides to uphold the visual and maintenance standards of putting greens and fairways. In the United States, the amount of pesticide used on golf courses can be up to 15 times greater than that in European countries.

One anecdotal report has suggested that living near golf courses may increase the risk for PD. However, few studies have explored the role of pesticide exposure from golf courses on PD risk, said Krzyzanowski.

Using the Rochester Epidemiology Project (REP) medical records linkage system, researchers identified patients with PD in Olmstead County, Minnesota, from 1991 to 2015. From medical records, a movement disorder specialist confirmed the PD diagnosis as well as the date of onset.

Investigators used home addresses 2 or 3 years prior to PD symptom onset to allow for a delay between potential environmental exposure and development of PD. Address-level data provide the most accurate distance-to-exposure values.

The study included 419 individuals with PD, median age of 73 years at diagnosis and 61% men, who were compared with 5113 age- and sex-matched control individuals without the disease.

Researchers collected data on 139 golf courses in the 27-county study region. Using satellite imagery, they manually digitized golf course data to confirm the correct placement of golf course boundaries in 2013, the earliest year relevant data were available.

After adjusting for age, sex, race and ethnicity, index year (date of PD symptom onset for cases), household income, and urban or rural category, the study found living within one mile of a golf course was associated with 126% increased odds of PD (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 2.26; 95% CI, 1.09- 4.70; P = .03) compared with those living more than 6 miles from a golf course.

The analysis uncovered a modest dose response. The odds of PD increased by 198% at 1-2 miles (aOR, 2.98; 95% CI, 1.46-6.06; P = .003), 121% at 2-3 miles (aOR, 2.21; 95% CI, 1.06-4.59; P = .03), and 92% at 3-6 miles (aOR, 1.92; 95% CI, 0.91-4.04; P = .09) compared with those living more than 6 miles away.

A sensitivity analysis showed the link between proximity to golf course and PD was stronger in urban areas. The authors speculate that greater density surrounding golf courses in urban areas may lead to higher levels of airborne pollutant exposure to nearby residents.

Researchers also assessed whether individuals received their drinking water from groundwater sources located either with, or without, a golf course or from private wells. Overall, 77.3% of the study population lived in areas served by groundwater-based water systems. They noted that pesticides used on golf courses can seep into groundwater, potentially contaminating drinking water supplies.

Results showed that individuals receiving tap water from groundwater service areas with a golf course had nearly a twofold increased risk for PD compared with those in groundwater areas without golf courses (aOR, 1.96; 95% CI, 1.20-3.23). They also had a 49% higher risk for PD than those using private wells as a drinking water source (aOR, 1.49; 95% CI, 1.05-2.13).

The researchers acknowledged the water distribution process is complex and varies from city to city, so it's possible not everyone within the same water service area shared the same water source.

The investigators also determined whether water services areas were within a vulnerable groundwater region, defined as those with coarse texture soils, shallow bedrock, or karst geology.

Krzyzanowski explained that karst topography describes a region with limestone bedrock that slowly dissolves over time, creating underground voids that allow water from the surface to move more rapidly through it.

“This means that pesticides applied to grass or crops can more readily move into the groundwater supply after a rain,” the investigators noted.

The analysis showed that individuals whose tap water was from service areas with a golf course located in vulnerable groundwater regions were 82% more likely to have PD compared with those in similar areas with a golf course but nonvulnerable groundwater (aOR, 1.82; 95% CI, 1.09-3.03).

Study limitations included the restricted geographic scope of the population-based dataset and the predominantly White study population. In addition, the lack of occupational history data may have led to exposure misclassification, as some individuals may have spent significant time away from their home address. The study also did not account for other relevant risk factors for PD, such as head trauma or genetic predisposition.

Commenting on the findings, David Dexter, PhD, director of Research, Parkinson's United Kingdom, raised a number of other potential limitations of the study.

In a statement from the Science Media Center, which features expert comment on science news, Dexter noted the study didn't restrict participants to those who lived permanently in the area, an important consideration as PD starts in the brain 10-15 years before diagnosis.

“This would not only affect participants' exposure but also suggests their Parkinson's could have started before they moved around a golf course,” he said.

Dexter also noted that 80% of individuals with PD lived in urban areas compared with only 30% of control individuals, so other factors such as air pollution from motor vehicles could have accounted for some of the increased incidence of the disease. He also noted that the drinking water wasn't analyzed for pesticide levels.

Commenting on the research for Medscape Medical News, Michael S. Okun, MD, Adelaide Lackner professor of Neurology, University of Florida, and executive director, Norman Fixel Institute for Neurological Diseases, both in Gainesville, Florida, said the study's findings “highlight a clear and urgent need to re-evaluate pesticide use on golf courses.”

Okun, who is also medial advisor for the Parkinson's Foundation said the link between proximity to golf courses and increased PD risk is “striking.” 

“These results raise concerns about how chemicals applied for aesthetics may silently shape neurological health,” he said. The fact that pesticides used to keep golf courses pristine may be seeping into local water supplies and increasing PD risk “is a hidden hazard we can no longer ignore,” said Okun.

The Rochester Epidemiology Project is supported by the National Institute on Aging of the National Institutes of Health. Krzyzanowski, Okun, and Dexter reported no relevant conflicts of interest.

Eyes may be the window to the soul, but a person's biological age could be reflected in their facial characteristics. Investigators from Mass General Brigham developed a deep learning algorithm called FaceAge that uses a photo of a person's face to predict biological age and survival outcomes for patients with cancer. They found that patients with cancer, on average, had a higher FaceAge than those without and appeared about five years older than their chronological age. Older FaceAge predictions were associated with worse overall survival outcomes across multiple cancer types. They also found that FaceAge outperformed clinicians in predicting short-term life expectancies of patients receiving palliative radiotherapy. Their results are published in The Lancet Digital Health.

We can use artificial intelligence (AI) to estimate a person's biological age from face pictures, and our study shows that information can be clinically meaningful. This work demonstrates that a photo like a simple selfie contains important information that could help to inform clinical decision-making and care plans for patients and clinicians. How old someone looks compared to their chronological age really matters-individuals with FaceAges that are younger than their chronological ages do significantly better after cancer therapy."

Hugo Aerts, PhD, co-senior and corresponding author, director of the Artificial Intelligence in Medicine (AIM) program at Mass General Brigham

When patients walk into exam rooms, their appearance may give physicians clues about their overall health and vitality. Those intuitive assessments combined with a patient's chronological age, in addition to many other biological measures, may help determine the best course of treatment. However, like anyone, physicians may have biases about a person's age that may influence them, fueling a need for more objective, predictive measures to inform care decisions.

With that goal in mind, Mass General Brigham investigators leveraged deep learning and facial recognition technologies to train FaceAge. The tool was trained on 58,851 photos of presumed healthy individuals from public datasets. The team tested the algorithm in a cohort of 6,196 cancer patients from two centers, using photographs routinely taken at the start of radiotherapy treatment.

Results showed that cancer patients appear significantly older than those without cancer, and their FaceAge, on average, was about five years older than their chronological age. In the cancer patient cohort, older FaceAge was associated with worse survival outcomes, especially in individuals who appeared older than 85, even after adjusting for chronological age, sex, and cancer type.

Estimated survival time at the end of life is difficult to pin down but has important treatment implications in cancer care. The team asked 10 clinicians and researchers to predict short-term life expectancy from 100 photos of patients receiving palliative radiotherapy. While there was a wide range in their performance, overall, the clinicians' predictions were only slightly better than a coin flip, even after they were given clinical context, such as the patient's chronological age and cancer status. Yet when clinicians were also provided with the patient's FaceAge information, their predictions improved significantly.

Further research is needed before this technology could be considered for use in a real-world clinical setting. The research team is testing this technology to predict diseases, general health status, and lifespan. Follow-up studies include expanding this work across different hospitals, looking at patients in different stages of cancer, tracking FaceAge estimates over time, and testing its accuracy against plastic surgery and makeup data sets.

"This opens the door to a whole new realm of biomarker discovery from photographs, and its potential goes far beyond cancer care or predicting age," said co-senior author Ray Mak, MD, a faculty member in the AIM program at Mass General Brigham. "As we increasingly think of different chronic diseases as diseases of aging, it becomes even more important to be able to accurately predict an individual's aging trajectory. I hope we can ultimately use this technology as an early detection system in a variety of applications, within a strong regulatory and ethical framework, to help save lives."

Acetaminophen is the most frequently taken fever and pain medication worldwide, but overdosing can be toxic to liver cells. In the United States, about 1,600 cases of acute liver failure and 500 deaths occur each year due to acetaminophen overuse and liver failure. Although the liver has a remarkable potential to regenerate and recover from injury, scientists are seeking to better understand how this happens after acetaminophen toxicity.

Liver regeneration has been studied for decades, primarily through removing sections of the organ, yet there is still controversy among researchers regarding the source of new liver cells, and whether they originate from stem cells in the liver or from pre-existing mature liver cells which start multiplying after injury. A deeper understanding of mechanisms at play is essential to come up with strategies to boost liver regeneration in patients.

Towards this goal, Tomomi Aoyagi and colleagues from Kyushu University, Japan, studied the behavior of single cells in the mouse liver after acetaminophen injury and noticed that regeneration likely originated from a specific type of cell. The work was recently published in Stem Cell Reports. In their experiments, mature liver cells which were in direct contact with injured or dying cells transitioned to a more immature state and started to divide rapidly. Direct contact to damaged tissue was crucial for this transition, suggesting that signals from dead or dying cells instructs neighboring cells to start a regenerative program. Importantly, the researchers found a similar population of immature, dividing liver cells adjacent to injured tissue in biopsies from patients with drug-induced liver injury, suggesting that liver regeneration in humans follows similar principles.

Understanding how injured tissues instructs the neighboring cells to start a repair program may lead to more effective treatments for drug-induced liver injury and insights into strategies to treat liver failure, which can only be cured by transplantation.

Lingering post-COVID symptoms are more than a nuisance, they're independently linked to poorer physical, mental, and daily functioning across all U.S. states, highlighting urgent needs for targeted care and recovery strategies.

Study: The health-related quality of life among survivors with post-COVID conditions in the United States. Image Credit: p.ill.i / Shutterstock

In a recent study published in the journal PLoS One, a group of researchers evaluated how post-Coronavirus Disease (COVID) conditions (PCCs) affect health-related quality of life (HRQL) among COVID-19 survivors in the United States.

For millions of Americans, recovering from COVID-19 is only the beginning. Nearly one in four survivors experience lingering symptoms like fatigue, brain fog, dizziness, and pain that persist for months and interfere with daily life. These lasting effects, known as PCCs, often go unnoticed as public attention shifts to infection control. While early studies have hinted at the burden PCCs place on individuals, their full impact on health-related quality of life remains poorly understood. To guide effective treatment and policy, there is an urgent need to identify who is most at risk and how best to support them.

Researchers analyzed data from the 2022 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), a national survey led by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which gathers health information via telephone from United States (U.S.) adults. They focused on individuals who had previously tested positive for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), excluding those with only at-home diagnoses or incomplete responses. Participants were divided into two groups: those reporting PCCs, defined as symptoms persisting at least three months after acute COVID-19, and those without.

The primary outcome was health-related quality of life (HRQL), assessed through four self-reported measures: general health, mental health, physical health, and daily functional ability. Sociodemographic characteristics, comorbidities, and behavioral habits (such as physical activity, smoking, and sleep patterns) were also recorded. Advanced statistical techniques, including multivariate logistic regression and data imputation via random forest modeling, were used to adjust for missing data and confounding factors. Survey weights and design adjustments were applied to reflect the U.S. adult population. The association between PCCs and unfavorable self-reported general health (SRGH) was analyzed after accounting for all relevant variables.

The researchers noted that the BRFSS relies on self-reported data, which may be subject to recall bias or reporting inaccuracies. Additionally, some variables that could influence PCC risk and outcomes, such as vaccination status, medications, or the timing and severity of initial COVID-19 infection, were not available in the dataset. Institutionalized individuals were not included in the survey, and the HRQL questions were not based on a standardized questionnaire. These limitations should be considered when interpreting the study's results.

The study included 108,237 adults with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, representing over 70 million Americans. Among them, 22.7% experienced PCCs. Individuals with PCCs were more likely to be female, middle-aged, obese, physically inactive, and report lower income and poor sleep habits.

Overall, 25.7% of those with PCCs rated their general health as “fair” or “poor,” compared to 15.5% of those without PCCs. These individuals also reported more days of poor mental and physical health, as well as greater disruption in daily activities. In adjusted regression models, having PCCs was independently associated with a 39% higher likelihood of unfavorable general health (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 1.39, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.28–1.52, p < 0.001).

When examining symptoms, dizziness on standing (38%), mood disorders (36.3%), and musculoskeletal pain (34.1%) were most strongly linked with poor health ratings. Conversely, symptoms like loss of taste or smell were less likely to impair overall well-being. Notably, the association between PCCs and lower HRQL remained significant across all age groups and states, suggesting a widespread and systemic burden.

Among those with PCCs, further analysis revealed that certain factors increased the risk of poor general health. These included being in late middle age (45–64 years old; aOR = 1.47), having obesity (aOR = 1.27), being physically inactive (aOR = 1.94), or sleeping too little or too much (aOR = 1.55 and 2.15, respectively). Chronic conditions such as diabetes (aOR = 2.29), heart disease (aOR = 2.01), and pulmonary diseases (aOR = 1.98) also significantly raised the odds of unfavorable health. Socioeconomic factors, including lower education and income, single marital status, and Hispanic ethnicity, were independently associated with worse outcomes.

Interestingly, while women with PCCs were more likely to report poor health, gender was not a significant factor after statistical adjustment. State-level analysis showed that regions like West Virginia, Kentucky, and Oregon reported the highest rates of impaired general health, underscoring geographic disparities in long COVID impact.

The study also emphasized that while PCCs were more prevalent among younger adults, the association between PCCs and impaired quality of life was particularly strong among those in their late middle age (45–64 years old). This highlights the complex relationship between age, risk of PCCs, and their impact on daily functioning.

To summarize, post-COVID conditions are linked to significantly reduced health-related quality of life across the U.S., affecting physical, mental, and daily functioning. Individuals with chronic illnesses, obesity, lower socioeconomic status, or unhealthy lifestyle habits are particularly vulnerable. These findings emphasize the need for multidisciplinary care models, long-term monitoring, and targeted rehabilitation strategies for COVID-19 survivors. The authors also call for further research to better understand and address the limitations of current data sources and to optimize support for those living with PCCs. As the pandemic's acute phase recedes, addressing the hidden burden of PCCs becomes essential for national health planning.

Mor than 800 million people worldwide are living with diabetes, according to World Health Organization (WHO) estimates, with numbers steadily increasing. Diabetic patients experience abnormally high levels of blood sugar, which can, over the long-term, damage organs and decrease the quality of life and life expectancy of patients.

Blood sugar levels are controlled by cells in the pancreas called beta-cells which secrete insulin to lower blood glucose levels. Another cell type in the pancreas called alpha-cells are the natural counterpart of beta-cells as they act to increase blood sugar levels by secreting the hormone glucagon. A precisely tuned secretion of insulin versus glucagon is required to keep blood sugar at the right level.

While much research has focused on understanding beta-cell dysfunction in diabetic patients, it has become clear that alpha-cells are also affected in diabetes. Lab-based models of human alpha cells are crucial for understanding alpha-cell (dys)function and blood sugar regulation. Recently, Quinn Peterson and colleagues from Mayo Clinic, USA, discovered a method for making human alpha cells from cultures of immature stem cells. This work was recently published in Stem Cell Reports.

These stem cell-derived alpha cells very closely resembled pancreas-derived alpha cells and secreted comparable levels of glucagon. Importantly, like alpha cells in diabetic patients, the stem cell-derived alpha cells responded to culture conditions mimicking a diabetic environment with elevated glucagon secretion and dysregulation of alpha cell gene expression and physiology. Encouragingly, abnormal glucagon secretion of these cells was reversed by a drug called Sunitinib (a clinically approved anti-cancer drug). The human alpha cells described in this research will be a useful model to understand diabetic alpha cell dysfunction and to screen for new therapeutics.

In a global trial of over 2,500 patients, obicetrapib dramatically reduced LDL cholesterol levels when added to standard lipid-lowering therapy, offering new hope for those at highest cardiovascular risk.

Study: Safety and Efficacy of Obicetrapib in Patients at High Cardiovascular Risk. Image Credit: Explode / Shutterstock

A recent New England Journal of Medicine study investigated the efficacy and safety of obicetrapib among patients at high risk of cardiovascular events.

Multiple clinical trials have shown that lowering LDL cholesterol levels decreases the risk of cardiovascular events. The class of drugs known as cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) inhibitors, to which obicetrapib belongs, has been explored for its potential to modify cholesterol levels. However, the development of CETP inhibitors has faced significant challenges; for instance, torcetrapib was associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and other agents like dalcetrapib and evacetrapib were discontinued due to a lack of efficacy in improving cardiovascular outcomes.

These past experiences have guided the development of newer agents like obicetrapib, which has a hydrophilic design intended to avoid some off-target effects and focuses on robust LDL cholesterol reduction in addition to raising HDL cholesterol. Low-intensity or high-intensity statin therapy focuses on lowering LDL cholesterol.

Combination therapy can help lower LDL cholesterol levels in patients at very high risk of cardiovascular events. However, the usage of combination lipid-lowering therapy is low, as evidenced by observational studies, which implies that more high-risk patients will receive inadequate treatment and potentially experience adverse cardiovascular outcomes.

Early trials have shown that obicetrapib lowers LDL cholesterol levels and raises high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels. When added to a maximum tolerated dose of lipid-lowering therapy, it can also help high-risk patients achieve LDL cholesterol treatment goals. Besides studying the effect of obicetrapib on lipid levels, examining its side effects and safety profile among patients at high risk of cardiovascular events is essential.

This study conducted a randomized, multinational, placebo-controlled trial with individuals aged 18 years or above. Participants had to have a history of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease or heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia and be on maximum tolerated doses of lipid-lowering therapy. Genotyping or clinical criteria were used to diagnose heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia.

Patients were eligible if they had an LDL cholesterol level of 100 mg per deciliter or higher or a non-high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol level of 130 mg per deciliter or higher. Alternatively, individuals with an LDL cholesterol level of 55 to 100 mg per deciliter or a non-HDL cholesterol level of 85 to 130 mg per deciliter were also eligible if they had at least one additional cardiovascular risk factor.

Two groups were created, and participants were assigned to them randomly in a 2:1 ratio. The groups received either 10 mg of obicetrapib once daily or a matching placebo for 365 days. The percentage change in LDL from baseline to day 84 formed the primary endpoint. There were secondary endpoints as well, namely, the levels of non-HDL cholesterol, apolipoprotein B, triglycerides, and total cholesterol at days 84, 180, and 365, the percent change in LDL levels at days 30, 180, 270, and 365, and levels of apolipoprotein A1 and lipoprotein(a) at day 84.

From December 2021 through August 2023, across multiple sites in China, Europe, Japan, and the United States, 2530 patients were randomly assigned to receive obicetrapib or placebo, of which 292 discontinued prematurely. The average age was 65 years, the average body mass index (BMI) was 29, and 34% were women. A total of 89% had atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, 38% had diabetes, and 17% reported heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia. Seventy percent were receiving high-intensity statins, while 27% were on ezetimibe. PCSK9 inhibitors were being administered to 4% of patients. At baseline, the average LDL and HDL levels were 98 mg per decilitre and 49 mg per decilitre, respectively.

The primary endpoints for patients receiving obicetrapib and placebo were estimated at −29.9% and 2.7%, respectively. A difference between groups of −32.6 percentage points was observed. At day 84, approximately 27.9% and 1.1% of patients in the obicetrapib and placebo groups exhibited LDL cholesterol levels below 40 mg per decilitre. Similarly, 51.0% and 8.0% of patients in the obicetrapib and placebo groups exhibited LDL cholesterol levels less than 55 mg per decilitre. The percentage of patients with LDL cholesterol levels below 70 mg per deciliter was 68.4% and 27.5% in the obicetrapib and placebo groups, respectively.

A secondary endpoint favored obicetrapib over placebo. A between-group difference at day 30 reduced the LDL cholesterol level by 36.6%, day 180 by 32.7%, day 270 by 30.2%, and day 365 by 24.0%. The study noted that the LDL cholesterol-lowering effect appeared to diminish somewhat by day 365, which the authors suggested might be partly due to discontinuation of the drug. The current study also estimated between-group differences in the apolipoprotein B level to be −18.9 percentage points at day 84, −18.3 percentage points at day 180, and −13.8 percentage points at day 365. A similar trend of reduction in between-group differences was observed in the non-HDL cholesterol level (−29.4 percentage points at day 84), lipoprotein(a) level (−33.5 percentage points at day 84), and triglyceride level (−7.8 percentage points at day 84). Conversely, obicetrapib led to significant increases in HDL cholesterol level (136.3 percentage points difference at day 84) and total cholesterol level (17.7 percentage points difference at day 84).

During the trial period, adverse events were observed in 59.7% of the obicetrapib patients and 60.8% of candidates in the placebo group. However, there were no apparent differences in the rates or severity of adverse events between the groups.

The paper also reported on 'adverse events of special interest.' Liver-enzyme abnormalities (alanine or aspartate aminotransferase levels >3 times the upper limit of normal) occurred in 0.6% of obicetrapib patients versus 0.9% in placebo patients, and muscle enzyme abnormalities (creatine kinase >5 times the upper limit of normal) occurred in 0.3% versus 0.4%, respectively. Worsening kidney function (defined as a decrease from baseline of more than 25% in the estimated glomerular filtration rate) was noted in 6.8% of obicetrapib patients compared to 8.3% in the placebo group. New-onset diabetes or worsening of glycemic control occurred in 35.1% of patients in the obicetrapib group and in 40.0% in the placebo group. The most frequently reported adverse events overall included COVID-19, hypertension, and upper respiratory tract infections, with similar incidences between groups. In 4.2% and 5.2% of patients belonging to the obicetrapib and placebo groups, respectively, experienced cardiovascular events, such as deaths from coronary heart disease, nonfatal myocardial infarction, coronary revascularization, or stroke. No significant changes in ambulatory blood pressure measurements at baseline and at day 270 were observed.

The current study revealed that obicetrapib treatment could effectively reduce LDL cholesterol levels by a placebo-adjusted 32.6 percentage points at day 84, among patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia or atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease who are at high risk of cardiovascular events. In the future, more clinical studies are required to determine the efficacy of this agent in preventing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, and the paper notes that a large, long-term cardiovascular outcomes trial is currently underway.

FIFA announced Friday its plans to expand the Women's World Cup to 48 teams starting in 2031.

"This is not just about having 16 more teams playing in the FIFA Women's World Cup but taking the next steps in relation to the women's game in general by ensuring that more FIFA Member Associations have the chance to benefit from the tournament to develop their women's football structures from a holistic point of view," FIFA president Gianni Infantino said.

Infantino added that the move "ensures we are maintaining the momentum in terms of growing women's football globally."

A 48-team field puts the Women's World Cup in line with the men's tournament. The 2026 World Cup will be the first to welcome 48 teams, up from 32.

More games inevitably means more revenue for FIFA and its individual federations, money that will get funneled down to the players.

However, some are likely to question the value of expanding the Women's World Cup for many of the same reasons that the idea of a 48-team men's event sparked criticism.

Matches in the group stage won't carry the same stakes when eight third-place finishers move on to the knockout phase. The gap between the best and worst teams in the World Cup is widening as well.

Exacerbating the second facet, women's soccer hasn't had as much time to build a broad infrastructure compared to when FIFA made 48 teams a reality on the men's side.

Whereas the men's World Cup dates back to 1930, the Women's World Cup was first staged in 1991. Established European powers such as England, Spain, and France only started to fully invest in their national teams within the last decade. Spain, which won the 2023 World Cup, didn't qualify for the first time until 2015.

Countries without prestigious domestic leagues or a successful men's national team are further behind the curve.

At the 2023 World Cup, Vietnam had a minus-12 goal differential in the group stage. The Philippines scored one goal and allowed eight in three matches. In Group C, Zambia and Costa Rica combined to earn three points with a minus-15 goal differential.

Even with the expected growth of women's soccer, lopsided games are bound to be more frequent at the 2031 World Cup. 

Some may argue that's an acceptable cost if it ultimately yields more money that can be spent to help raise the standard of the sport, though.

ATLANTA, Ga. (Atlanta News First) - A busy MARTA station in Downtown Atlanta with an often-confusing name will now be rebranded in time for the FIFA World Cup.

During a meeting Thursday, MARTA's board of directors approved renaming the Georgia World Congress Center/CNN Center station to the Sports, Entertainment and Convention District, or SEC, station.

Along with the World Congress Center and the former CNN Center, the station sits right next to State Farm Arena and near Mercedes-Benz Stadium, which will host eight World Cup games next summer.

MARTA leaders decided to rename the station as the more generic SEC District to cut down on confusion for visitors attending the games.

The name is also out of date. In April 2024, the new owners of the iconic CNN Center building announced they were renaming it “The Center.”

Signs and maps will be updated by Jan. 1, nearly six months before the first matches.

“The world coming to Atlanta for FIFA, the vast majority of patrons of FIFA will probably have English as a second language,” MARTA board member Thomas Worthy said during Thursday's meeting. “I think this will be their number-one station that they use. I think it needs to be clear.”

The World Cup games are expected to bring as many as 300,000 visitors to the city.

The rebranding of the GWCC/CNN Center station is just the latest of several name changes over the decades. When it opened in the early 70s, the station was simply called the Omni station for the nearby Omni Coliseum. The Omni was demolished in the late 90s and replaced with Philips Arena, which was eventually renamed State Farm Arena.

Editor's Note: USWNT Footnotes takes you inside the major talking points around the U.S. women's national team, the NWSL, European leagues, and all across American women's soccer.

The biggest news of the week is that Mallory Swanson announced on social media that she and her husband, Chicago Cubs shortstop Dansby Swanson, are expecting their first child.

Swanson's absence from both the U.S. women's national team and the Chicago Stars this calendar year now makes perfect sense. Both teams had said that the star forward was dealing with a "personal matter" without further explanation. Now we all know the good news.

Swanson signed a contract extension with the Stars ahead of last season through 2028. And while that's an important long-term move for the club, it is currently going through a rebuilding phase, having recently fired head coach Lorne Donaldson (who coached Swanson's youth team back in Colorado). The Stars currently sit in last place in the NWSL with a 1-5-1 record.

As for the USWNT, Emma Hayes has already been trying out new faces on the front line as she builds out the player pool ahead of the 2027 World Cup in Brazil. And Swanson hasn't been the only member of the "Triple Espresso" that's been unavailable for selection. Sophia Wilson is also pregnant and expecting her first child this year, while Trinity Rodman looked fit and in form last camp before re-aggravating a back injury and is now out until further notice.

Carli Lloyd inducted into National Soccer Hall of Fame

USWNT legend Carli Lloyd was inducted into the National Soccer Hall of Fame earlier this week. In her speech, the two-time World Cup champion and Olympic gold medalist apologized to her teammates for being an "emotionless machine."

"I wasn't there to make friends or follow the crowd," Lloyd said. "I was there to push myself to the very top while helping my team win championships. That drive often meant keeping people at a distance. 

"I avoided drama. I rarely showed weakness, and vulnerability wasn't something I allowed myself to express. I wouldn't say I have regrets, but if there is one thing I do wish, I wish I had let more people understand me over the years.

"... I was intense and I truly believed that the only way for me to survive in such a cutthroat environment was to be that way. So to my teammates, I want to say this: I'm sorry I wasn't always able to give you all of me."

Lloyd, who retired in 2021 and has been a FOX Sports analyst for several years, reflected on her career accomplishments and regrets. She noted that above all else, her "greatest joy" has been becoming a mom to six-month-old daughter Harper.

"I always knew I wanted a child, but I had no idea how this little baby could completely change me as a person," Lloyd said. "Unlike during my playing career, I have been present. I have allowed myself to be vulnerable, emotional and fully engaged in every moment I get to spend with her."

Sister-Sister goal

Over the weekend, Alyssa and Gisele Thompson became the first sister duo to combine for a goal in NWSL history as they helped Angel City defeat the Washington Spirit 4-3.

In the 22nd minute, with Angel City already leading 1-0, Alyssa Thompson streaked down the left side and sent a pinpoint left-footed cross into the box, where her younger sibling was waiting. Gisele, a defender, only needed one touch to net her first career NWSL goal.

"We've always dreamed about this, especially in this high level of football," Gisele said after the match. "Doing it together is amazing. Getting my first goal is so incredible. Dream come true."

This isn't the first time Alyssa, 20, and Gisele, 19, have made soccer history though. They both started for the USWNT during the SheBelieves Cup earlier this year, becoming just the third sister pair ever to start in a senior national team together.

Mikaela Shiffrin invests in women's soccer

Mikaela Shiffrin, the most decorated Alpine skier in history, has joined the ownership group for Denver's NWSL expansion team. The Colorado native is a two-time gold medalist, eight-time World Champion and has 101 World Cup victories among other achievements. Now she can add NWSL investor to her glowing resume.

The Denver team, which has yet to be named, will begin play in 2026 along with Boston Legacy FC, bringing the league up to 16 teams. The ownership group is also planning to build a 14,500-seat stadium in Denver that is expected to open in 2028.

Shiffrin joins a growing list of celebrity athlete NWSL investors, which includes Patrick and Brittany Mahomes (Kansas City Current), Lindsey Vonn (Utah Royals and Angel City), Naomi Osaka (North Carolina Courage), Billie Jean King and Mia Hamm (Angel City), James Harden (Houston Dash) and many more.

GOAL takes a look at some key storylines heading into Matchday 12 of MLS action in 2025

The weekend promises fireworks in MLS, with three of the season's potentially best matches yet on tap. 


First, it's a rematch of the 2024 MLS Cup final, the LA Galaxy clash with the New York Red Bulls - and though both teams are on a bit of a rocky course of late - the circumstances of the match present each club with a unique opportunity to capitalize on the moment.


 Minnesota United host Lionel Messi and Inter Miami in a rare cross-conference meeting, as the two clubs meet for the first time since the Argentine's arrival to the league. The Loons, who sit second in the West, will look to keep their red-hot form to start 2025 going against the Herons in a clash at Allianz Field.


And atop the Eastern Conference, the first-place Columbus Crew take to the road this weekend to take on second-place Philadelphia Union in a meeting between the conference's best teams heading into the Matchday.


As Matchday 12 kicks off, these fixtures promise to deliver some of the most exciting action yet this season.

GOAL dives into all that and more in The Kickoff, a weekly preview of each MLS Matchday.

With just over a year until the 2026 FIFA World Cup takes the United States, Canada, and Mexico by storm, fans might need to start squirreling cash away now in order to afford tickets.

The first packages of World Cup tickets went on sale earlier this week in the form of hospitality packages on the higher end of the pay scale. 

While many fans likely won't be able to afford the suites that start at $3,500 and run as high as over $70,000, the average ticket price won't be much better. 

As reported by Adam Crafton of The Athletic, the united bid for the World Cup estimated that the average cost of a group stage ticket would be around $305.

Of course, non-hospitality tickets have yet to go on sale and those prices could change drastically between now and then.

But football fans have already voiced their anger on social media over the tournament that has been a pet project of President Donald Trump.

Fans are outraged after the average price of a World Cup group stage ticket in 2026 is revealed

The tournament, which is a pet project of President Trump's, will kick off in just over a year

Full-session hospitality tickets for every game at MetLife Stadium cost up to $73,000

'305 for group stage tickets?? Weasels. Thieves. Rat bastards. Robbery in broad daylight and FIFA's holding the flashlight,' one user posted on X, formerly Twitter.

Another remarked, 'Hmmm that's quite expensive.'

'Made by the poor, stolen by the rich,' said another user.

'Way to ruin the world cup,' one user complained.

'Can almost see it now, half empty stadiums and terrible atmosphere. They don't want the average working person anymore. All corpo and celebrity's,' predicted another.

One post read, 'America hosting a world cup is woke nonsense and the stadium and fans are cringe.'

'Don't send a world cup to the USA ever again,' one person posted.

Another remarked, 'Pure f**kery, FIFA is literally extorting the US market.'















Fans have taken their anger to social media to express their outrage at FIFA and the tournament

Among the ticket packages already on sale in hospitality includes a full eight-game package for every match in New York - including the Round of 32, Round of 16, and the Final.

Those tickets start at $25,800 and balloon up to $73,200 for the higher end.

On the opposite coast, a similar package is being sold for Los Angeles - where the United States national team will play its first and final games of the group stage. SoFi Stadium is also set to host two Round of 32 games and a quarterfinal match.

Tickets for LA will begin at $20,300 and go up to $35,350.

Among the full-slate ticket packages, the cheapest could be found in Santa Clara in the Bay Area - where fans can pay $8,275 for tickets to all six matches to be played at the Levi's Stadium, including one Round of 32 match. 

The draw for the World Cup will take place in December.

From Inter Miami CF's home ground of Chase Stadium to anywhere else in the world a soccer ball is being kicked around, the odds of seeing a Lionel Messi jersey are always high.

It's a phenomenon that even Germany and Bayern Munich legend Lothar Matthäus notices in his own country, despite his homeland producing some of the game's all-time greats.

“He is an idol for most kids. Not only in America. In Germany, too,” said Matthäus, who, like the superstar Argentine No. 10, has the rare distinction of winning both a FIFA World Cup and Ballon d'Or award.

“I have a son. He's 11 years old, and I sometimes follow his football games. And when they have training sessions, you see a lot of Messi shirts," he said. "The old shirt from Barcelona, the new shirt from Inter Miami.

“This means that the name Messi is so important for football, not only what he's doing on the field, [but] what he's doing outside the field.”

That's the power of Messi and the Inter Miami project he's spearheaded since mid-2023, transforming the Herons into a global attraction with the help of fellow Barça alums Luis Suárez, Sergio Busquets and Jordi Alba.

The 2024 MLS Supporters' Shield winners and 2023 Leagues Cup champions are just over a month away from their next high-profile venture: competing at this summer's FIFA 2025 Club World Cup in the United States as the host side of the expanded, 32-team tournament that runs from June 14 to July 13.

Seattle Sounders FC, via their 2022 Concacaf Champions Cup (née League) title, will also represent Major League Soccer at the competition, while LAFC are set to face LIGA MX titans Club América for Club León's recently vacated spot.

For Matthäus, Messi gives Miami an unrivaled edge in a highly competitive Group A that also features Al Ahly (Egypt), FC Porto (Portugal) and Palmeiras (Brazil).

“It's not too much pressure because Messi has had pressure all his life: World Cup finals, Copa América, national [team] games, club games, Champions League finals, El Clásico in Spain between Real Madrid and Barcelona,” the five-time World Cup veteran said.

“He knows what pressure means.”

While Matthäus believes Messi and Miami can “make a run” at the CWC, the current pundit and Bayern Munich ambassador envisions an all-European semifinal bracket, given the sporting and financial implications of the competition that will distribute an unprecedented $1 billion prize pool.

“This is a tournament where you can win a very important title: best club in the world. And a lot of money,” he said. “I think every team is motivated.

“… They'll [be] playing with their best first XI, they will give their best to win the title.”

Still, Matthäus isn't taking Miami, Seattle and possibly LAFC lightly, given the worldwide exposure the league has received in recent years thanks to Messi and its historic broadcasting deal with Apple via MLS Season Pass.

“Twenty or 15 years ago, it was not possible for us Germans to watch MLS on our TVs,” he said. “Now it's possible and you can see how football [in the United States] is getting focus from other countries.”

#FIFACWC 2025: Group A. 🔢

This summer's Club World Cup comes a year before the United States will co-host the 2026 FIFA World Cup with Canada and Mexico. It's a full-circle moment for a country that hosted its first World Cup in 1994 - a watershed event that led to the birth of Major League Soccer.

Matthäus, who participated in that World Cup six years before spending the 2000 season with the New York/New Jersey MetroStars (now New York Red Bulls), is excited for how both upcoming tournaments will play out.

“I think now, especially a year before the World Cup starts in the U.S. in 2026, this is good preparation for the organization in the U.S. - the stadiums, the security and everything,” he said.

“… It's a good test for the World Cup in 2026, and the clubs are motivated.”

According to Matthäus, that motivation will make for some riveting club soccer across the United States come this summer.

“Everything is possible,” he said. "Like at the World Cup in 2026, you have the favorites and you have the teams who are maybe not so famous, but make surprises.

“And this is football.”

All of the 63 games from the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup will be shown live through this agreement.

EverPass Media, the platform dedicated to commercial businesses, has struck a distribution deal in the US with sports streaming heavyweight DAZN, covering men's soccer's upcoming FIFA Club World Cup (CWC) tournament.

Through a commercial agreement unveiled today, EverPass will act as the exclusive rights-holder for CWC action across bars, restaurants, and other commercial venues, with the deal covering all 63 games between the 32 teams taking part in this year's expanded CWC (which will from now on be held as a quadrennial tournament, featuring a much larger number of sides than previous editions).


                        The gold standard of business intelligence.

It represents the first such tie-up between DAZN, which holds global rights to the tournament through a deal with FIFA worth $1 billion – announced late last year, and EverPass.

It also adds to the existing distribution deals DAZN has struck in the US for the CWC, including with media heavyweight Warner Bros. Discovery, and with Mexican-language TelevisaUnivision. The tournament will run between June 14 and July 13.

In terms of recent EverPass activity, meanwhile, in mid-February, US media giant Paramount announced a multi-year agreement with the platform, around coverage of matches from European soccer's UEFA Champions League.

Launched in April 2023 as a joint venture between the investment arm of American football's NFL and RedBird Capital Partners, EverPass is a content distribution service aimed at bringing live sports and entertainment content to commercial establishments, such as bars, restaurants, hotels, and gyms, in the US.

Don't let policy changes catch you off guard. Stay proactive with real-time data and expert analysis.

The firm's chief executive, Alex Kaplan, said: "We're excited to partner with DAZN to deliver the FIFA Club World Cup to the commercial market, further cementing EverPass' leadership position in bringing the world's most popular sport to bars and restaurants across the US.

"This agreement underscores our commitment to closing the gap between rightsholders and commercial venues by offering seamless access to premium live global sports content."

EverPass' stable of rights includes top-tier English soccer, American football's NFL Sunday Ticket, Big Ten college football, and basketball, as well as the UCL.

Pete Oliver, CEO of the DAZN Growth Markets division, added: "It [this deal] reinforces our commitment to making the tournament the most accessible in the history of football. With 63 matches featuring the biggest clubs from every continent, this tournament is built for shared moments, and commercial venues are a key part of that experience."

In terms of other recent deals DAZN has put in place for the CWC, in late April, Russian sports streaming service Okko secured exclusive rights to the tournament.

The original deal between DAZN and soccer's global governing body FIFA was unveiled in advance of Saudi Arabia's Surj Sports Investments announcing last month that it had taken a minority stake in the streaming service, also for $1 billion. That figure is also the total prize and appearance fund available from the event.

There have been plenty of bad omens for the U.S. men's national team of late but on Thursday, the team's luck may have just turned around.

The election of Chicago native Robert Prevost to become Pope Leo XIV is (at least according to some denizens of the internet) a surefire sign that the USMNT is destined for big things at the World Cup next summer.

A curious pattern has emerged over the past several decades: Popes' teams tend to experience big success on the biggest stage in men's soccer.

Pope Francis saw his native Argentina win the last World Cup in 2022. Eight years before that, Pope Benedict XVI (at the time, Pope emeritus) watched Germany lift the 2014 World Cup.

Sure, but that's Argentina and Germany, right? They tend to do well no matter who is sitting on the throne in the Vatican.

But consider Benedict's predecessor John Paul II, who saw his Poland side achieve a third-place finish in the 1982 World Cup. If Poland can do it, why not the USMNT?

Sure, this line of justification is admittedly thin, but after the Concacaf Nations League, USMNT fans will take any hope they can get.

The 2025 Europa League Final will be contested between two Premier League teams after Manchester United and Tottenham both booked their place on Thursday night. 

In a season that has seen both teams fall woefully short in the league, where they sit in 15th and 16th place, for one of them, the campaign could end with qualification for the Champions League. 

United came through 4-1 on the night to beat Athletic Bilbao 7-1 over the two ties, while Spurs 2-0 win in Norway meant they overcame Bodo/Glimt 5-1 across the two legs. 

They will now meet in Bilbao at the end of the month, but speaking exclusively to DAZN News, thanks to talkSPORT BET, Ally McCoist thinks it's difficult to pick a winner from the inconsistent pair. 

"For me, that's the flip of the coin. It really is," McCoist said. 

"I couldn't split them. Maddison would be a massive miss for Tottenham. There's no doubt about it. Bruno (Fernandes) turns up on the big occasions. So my first thought would be there would be a slight favouritism towards Manchester United because they're key players playing.

"But I probably think Spurs for no other reason than sometimes that's football, especially when big Ange is convinced he can win things in the second year.

"I actually said, believe it or not, I said about six, seven weeks ago that it wouldn't surprise me if they did win that tournament. So I would stick with that hunch, and it's nothing more than a hunch.

"Because of the form of both sides, you could argue United's form in Europe has been slightly better than Spurs, even though the last two results for Tottenham have been very, very good.

"But I defy anybody,  whether you know football or don't know football, to confidently predict the outcome of a game between two teams that have lost 35 league games between them. And they've shown a ridiculous level of inconsistency.

"So I would slightly go for Tottenham but with no degree of confidence.  Let's be honest about it.  We all want to see it, don't we?"

Just over one year out from the FIFA World Cup 2026, United States President Donald Trump says there are no tensions between the co-hosting nations of the U.S., Canada and Mexico, which could pose issues to the tournament. 

Speaking alongside FIFA President Gianni Infantino while officially launching the FIFA World Cup Task Force, Trump insisted that there were no issues, despite an ongoing trade war and suggestions towards their northern neighbours that he would like to make Canada the “51st state.”

“I don't see any tension here, we get along very well with both,” he said, having met with newly-elected Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney earlier in the day. 

“We had a great meeting today,” he added. “It went very well. We had a very great meeting and no tension. We want to do what's right for respective peoples, and that's what's going to happen.”

The U.S. will have 11 cities hosting the tournament, accounting for 74 of the World Cup's 104 matches. Canada will host 13 games in Toronto and Vancouver, and Mexico the same number, shared between Mexico City, Monterrey and Guadalajara. 

It's the first time the tournament will be hosted in North America since the U.S. last hosted in 1994. 

Trump said that he and Carney spoke about the tournament during their meeting, the first between the two leaders since Carney's election on April 28, which reportedly focused primarily on international trade and Canada's sovereignty.

The President's tone with Carney, Canada's 24th Prime Minister, is a noted shift from his previous relationship with Canada's last Prime Minister, Justin Trudeau, whom Trump regularly called “Governor” before Trudeau resigned. 

In their Oval Office media availability earlier in the day, Carney diplomatically insisted to Trump in front of the cameras that Canada was “not for sale,” adding that it would “never” be the 51st state. Trump responded with “never say never,” while calling Carney –a former central banker– "a very talented, very good person.”

Carney's statements, echoed largely by the Canadian public, are also shared by Canada men's national team head coach Jesse Marsch, who spoke about Trump's treatment of Canada ahead of March's Concacaf Nations League Finals.

“If I have one message to our president, it's lay off the ridiculous rhetoric about Canada being the 51st state,” Marsch said in February. “As an American, I'm ashamed of the arrogance and disregard that we've shown one of our historically oldest, strongest and most loyal allies.”

The primary message from Tuesday's meetings was that the U.S. would go to great lengths to ensure the tournament's success. 

Trump stated that the cooperation between the three nations is “total, complete...[The World Cup is] going to be perfect, it's going to be beautiful,” and that the U.S. is prepared to “not hold back” on security costs. 

However, cooperation between the three nations was far from the only topic discussed by the Task Force. The administration and Task Force were clear on the other priority: People and fans are welcome, but they must go home after the tournament. 

“We want everyone to come to America. We want everyone to spend a lot of money in America,” said Trump's Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy. “And so, if you're coming to see some soccer … go on a road trip, see America. Don't overstay your visa. Don't stay too long.”

With the World Cup set to kick off on June 11, 2026, all eyes will be on the organizers and governments putting the tournament together, as well as the national teams of all three nations, which aim to make deep runs as co-hosts.

A Saudi Arabian side are ready to sign Darwin Nunez as soon as the summer transfer window opens, according to a report.

The striker has made just eight starts in the Premier League in 2024-25 and just one in 2025, as it appears he is at the bottom of Arne Slot's pecking order when it comes to Liverpool's attacking weapons.

Nunez's future on Merseyside has been the subject of heavy speculation, with the club previously rejecting an approach from Al-Nassr to sign him in January.

Now, Al-Hilal are plotting a move for the Urguayan on June 1 - the first day of the transfer window - in order to have him available for the Club World Cup, according to Liverpool Echo.

FIFA's annual competition begins in mid-June, with clubs expected to field stronger sides for the tournament this year. 

The number of teams competing has increased from seven to 32, and the prize money has rised concurrently - now at £30million for the winners.

When clubs came knocking for Nunez in January, Slot was hesitant to see his squad break apart as he bid to win silverware in his first season.

However, Liverpool are expected to be more willing to listen to offers for their No 9 this summer. 

Liverpool splashed out £85m on Nunez to snap him up from Benfica in 2022 but he has struggled since his arrival.

The frontman has scored 40 goals in 140 appearances since landing in England.

In his two full seasons at Liverpool, he has ranked in the top three for big chances missed in the Premier League, with 21 in 2022-23 and 27 the year after.

Nunez has scored only one goal in his last 19 appearances and has made seven big chances in the league in 2024-25.

This season, he has netted just seven goals and registered four assists in his 42 appearances across all competitions.

The report continued to state that Al-Hilal are also interested in Luis Diaz, whose future is unknown as he enters the last two years of his current deal.  

Diaz arrived from Porto midway through the 2021-22 season, and won the Carabao Cup and FA Cup in his first four months at Anfield.

He has since won the Carabao Cup again and has starred under Slot this season to lead Liverpool to their 20th league title.

Mail Sport understands the Colombian winger is due to sit down with Liverpool chiefs to make a decision on his future this summer.

He has become a major asset under Slot due to his versatility, with the Dutch head coach happy to play him on the left wing or up front.

As Europe's domestic seasons slowly draw to a close, the excitement builds for the showcase of football on show this summer as the USA hosts the FIFA Club World Cup, with every game live on DAZN. 

The tournament has been revamped for 2025 and will now see 32 of the world's greatest teams compete in a new format akin to a major international competition. 

It means fans in America and beyond will get to experience the buzz of a major finals, a year before they co-host the World Cup in 2026, a feeling that US legend Landon Donovan is already looking forward to. 

Speaking exclusively to DAZN, the former Everton, Bayern Munich and LA Galaxy player believes the US is the perfect setting for fans to come together and experience a feast of tournament football. 

"It is a World Cup, but just with your club team, right? That is quite literally what it is," he said.

"The beauty of the World Cup is that I've gone now as a fan and I've gone as a player, and I went when I was 12 years old in the Rose Bowl from my first ever professional soccer game that I got to see. I watched Argentina play Romania that day.

"You can sit at a table with someone from Algeria, next to someone from Sweden, next to someone from Argentina, next to someone from Egypt, and they're all hanging out, drinking beer, having fun and enjoying it together. 

"They don't speak the language. Nobody knows what anyone's saying, but they're just having fun together. And it's gonna be the same. 

"And the beauty of having it in America is that there will be Al Ahly fans, Boca Junior fans, Inter Milan fans, and obviously MLS fans. 

"I don't think there's another country in the world where you'd have fans from literally every single team participating that are gonna show up and support their teams.

"That's gonna make it incredible. It is."

There are four clubs from Africa among the 32 teams that have qualified for the FIFA Club World Cup, which will kick off on June 15.

World football's governing body FIFA are hoping the new-look Club World Cup, which will be hosted in the United States next month, will mark a new era for the game and develop a four-yearly competition that has as much relevance and reverence as the World Cup for national teams.

Africa will play a part in the new vision: there are four clubs from the continent among the 32 teams that have qualified for the tournament, which will kick off on June 15.

It includes Mamelodi Sundowns, who are through to this season's African Champions League final later in May and will be hoping to make some impact on the new-look Club World Cup.

It is a momentous opportunity for a South African side, rubbing shoulders with the most successful club sides from across the globe over the last years.

Egypt's Al Ahly, Wydad Casablanca from Morocco and Esperance of Tunisia are the other three African clubs who have qualified on the basis of their performances in the last four years of the African Champions League competition.

In their group, Sundowns have been drawn against Borussia Dortmund, who were runners-up in the UEFA Champions League last season; Rio de Janeiro giants Fluminense and Ulsan from South Korea.

It will be something of an upset if the Pretoria club progress past the first stage but even if they return home without a win, the tournament promises to be a massive learning curve and its financial spin off means Sundowns are set to continue their long-standing hegemony on the local scene.

They will reportedly receive a minimum of $9-million for participating in the tournament, with more money on offer for any victories they might achieve; $2 million is paid for winning group stage games, $7.5 million for playing in the round of 16 and $40 million to the team that wins the final at MetLife Stadium near New York on July 13.

FIFA aims to share $250 million among clubs worldwide who did not qualify for the tournament. But it is not yet clear how many clubs will be paid, or how much they will get.

The $1 billion Club World Cup prize pot is more than double the $440 million that FIFA shared among the 32 federations whose teams played at the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, further proof of their desire to make this new project work.

It is massive money for Sundowns to continue to buy the best players and extend their record-breaking run of championship success in South Africa's Premier Soccer League.

Emma Raducanu to face world No 50 and former finalist Veronika Kudermetova in third round of Italian Open in Rome; watch all the action from the ATP and WTA Tours on Sky Sports Tennis and Sky Sports+, NOW and the Sky Sports app

Emma Raducanu produced an impressive 6-2 6-2 victory over lucky loser Jil Teichmann to reach the third round of the Italian Open in Rome.

Raducanu originally was scheduled to play Ekaterina Alexandrova but the 21st seed pulled out before the match with a right shoulder injury, replaced by Switzerland's Teichmann, who lost in the last round of qualifying to Hailey Baptiste.

The former US Open champion served well, hitting six aces and facing only one break point.

"To be honest it was pretty mental, as I was warming up for my match against Alexandrova and, all of a sudden, I get told I'm playing Jil," Raducanu told Sky Sports Tennis.

"On top of that she's a left, so a completely different challenge. Honestly, I haven't practised with a lefty and haven't played one since February.

"I'm really proud of myself for how I fought through. This is her favourite surface."

"The first few games I was adjusting to the way the ball curls, but I'm really proud of myself. I fought through and I'm really proud of how I came through that."

Raducanu turned in a thoroughly accomplished performance to cruise past the Swiss. Although ranked 94th in the world she has been as high as 21 in the past but could not match Raducanu's power and tempo in a one-sided contest that saw the 22-year-old break twice in each set and hold her own increasingly impressive serve throughout.

Raducanu defended resolutely from the baseline, hit a handful of line-hugging forehand winners and racked up six aces, including a fiery effort down the middle to seal the match in one hour and 22 minutes to set up a clash against world No 50 Veronika Kudermetova.

With her latest coach Mark Petchey watching on alongside mentor Jane Donoghue, she grew effortlessly into her work.

Discussing how she has changed her service action, Raducanu said: "If you look at my serve now compared to Australia, compared to the Middle East, even Miami, I changed it after Miami with some tweaks and it's a completely different motion. I'm trying to make it a bit more fluid, a bit longer, so it's hopefully more robust under pressure, but it's by no means a finished product.

"I feel there's so much more room to grow it. I think this way I can maximise the potential."

As for how she feels on the clay, Raducanu admitted she was slowly warming to it.

"I still don't really feel comfortable on clay but in a way it helps me because I have to be super focused on every single point, just getting my feet right and to try and not fall over, so it is a big challenge," she said.

"The points are long, the balls do get heavier, and when I was serving it out, it was getting slower and slower, so it is physical but I'm slowly finding my feet."

It was just Raducanu's third match of the season on clay - and only the 20th of her entire career.

Russian Kudermetova defeated American Amanda Anisimova, the No 15 seed, 7-6 (7-5) 7-5 to move through to a meeting with Raducanu this weekend.

Miles Maclagan speaking on Sky Sports Tennis:

"It really was [an impressive performance]. Without getting carried away it's a player just inside the top 100 who has already lost this week but Raducanu answered every question that was asked of her. A really positive performance.

"She was aggressive, kept her foot on the pedal throughout on a day when things could have got tricky.

"She'll take some stopping if she continues that kind of form."

Marion Bartoli speaking on Sky Sports Tennis:

"I think she's moving better which is crucial on clay. The surface is lively and you're sliding all over the place so you need to get your legs extremely strong. You need to feel the ground really well and when I look at her muscle from the lower body she has been really putting in the work in the gym, which is probably why she decided to take a break after Miami to get those hours in the gym to make sure she was physically ready for the clay and grass too."

On her coaching set up, the former Wimbledon champion said: "Emma is probably looking for a coach who is not too technical. She will really need someone on the court with her every day if she wants to work on her technique. She's probably wanting someone to explain to her how the tactics work for that specific opponent.

"They had to reposition her around the court because she had to cover the left side of the court [against Teichmann] so when you have the experience of someone as Mark, you can bring that on the table very quickly and sometimes that takes away the stress from the player.

"I think that's what she's looking for in that dynamic. She's going to her box quite often with eye contact which means she trusts the people inside that box."

Cameron Norrie had no answers for 10th seed Daniil Medvedev as he was knocked out in the second round in Rome.

Norrie was handed a lucky loser lifeline after failing to make it through qualification and took his chance with a straight-sets victory over Christopher O'Connell in the opening round.

But he was unable to keep pace with the 2023 champion on Friday afternoon, succumbing 6-4 6-2. The Russian broke his British opponent four times and wrapped up a clinical victory with back-to-back aces.

He will now move on to face Australia's Alexei Popyrin in the last 32.

In the women's draw, Sonay Kartal was also ousted in the second round. Having come from behind to beat Kimberly Birrell in her previous match, she fell 6-4 6-2 at the hands of 30th seed Linda Noskova.

Kartal struggled consistently to hold serve, being broken five times across the two sets and clawing two back in response.

Daniil Medvedev is the latest player to share his thoughts on Jannik Sinner's return to the ATP Tour.

The World number one is free to return to action after his three-month doping ban came to an end on May 4.

Sinner's first tournament is on home soil at the Italian Open and the 23-year-old is relishing the chance to start competing again.

Sinner will play his first match since January on Saturday against Mariano Navone, and while his return has been met with a positive response, Daniil Medvedev has now shared his point of view.

There were multiple points of view that were given about Sinner's three month ban from professional tennis. Three-time Grand Slam champion Sinner tested positive for clostebol at the 2024 Indian Wells Masters.

This resulted in a suspension, and while some players criticised the decision for Sinner to be banned, others took an opposing view.

Now Medvedev has shared his view on his rival's return, and said the ATP Tour just continued as usual in his absence, but he is pleased Sinner is now back.

“I honestly first of all did not speak to any other player about it. But tennis is such a strange sport where everything goes very fast and I really love what Casper said about the hamster in the wheel,” Medvedev told Sky Sports.

“It is an individual sport, so I would even continue what he said. It is a hamster in the wheel but there are 100 of us near each other and unfortunately when you replace one of the hamsters they don't really care.

“I actually saw something Jannik said and I can tell from my side I am really happy to have him back. I respect Jannik a lot and I am really happy to see him back on tour.”

During Sinner's absence he missed four Masters 1000 tournaments, in addition to some important 500 events such as the Rotterdam and Barcelona Open events.

But Carlos Alcaraz as well as Alexander Zverev, who are closest to Sinner in the rankings, each won a title in the three-time major winner's absence.

However, they were unable to produce the consistency to close in on or dethrone Sinner as the number one player. This surprised Medvedev, especially in the case of Alcaraz.

“I know Carlos and Sascha had big chances to get a lot of points and catch him. But they played strong opponents and everyone wants to win,” Medvedev said.

“Carlos said that it did put pressure on him but I would be a little bit surprised because Carlos is so strong. He can beat anyone on a good day.

“I think he may just have had some bad days. So surprised? Not really. It is a tough sport and we are all trying our best and sometimes it works out, but let's see what happens now he's back.”

Brad Gilbert is one of the sport's most legendary tennis coaches, leading several players to Grand Slam glory.

The American began his coaching career in 1994, working alongside Andre Agassi for eight years, helping him achieve great success.

Moving on in 2002, Gilbert joined Andy Roddick's team as he rose to number one in the world rankings.

A short stint working with Andy Murray followed, with Gilbert guiding the Scot into the top ten back in 2007.

During the late 2000s and 2010s, the 63-year-old helped several players, including Alex Bogdanovic, Kei Nishikori, and Sam Querrey, before returning to full-time coaching in 2023.

Gilbert coached American star Coco Gauff for over a year, helping her win the biggest titles of her young career.

Now working in the media following Gilbert's departure from Gauff's team, he has highlighted the key differences between coaching Agassi, Roddick, and Murray.

Appearing as a guest on the Tennis Channel, Gilbert reflected on the time he spent coaching Roddick and Agassi, explaining how the reverse psychology he used on the former would've had the latter ban him from the courts.

“Andy [Roddick] is a unique character. Especially going from Andre [Agassi] to coaching Andy,” he said.

“Andy is like the Metallica song Fuel to the Fire. That's Andy. Whatever you say, he is going to say the opposite. That is his bravado and how you would pump him up.

“Andre, you could talk for three hours the night before. With Andy, you might get 10 seconds, like Mission Impossible, this message is going to implode. He is just how he is.

“Quite a few times with him, I would do my best coaching when literally I wanted him to play the forehand. I would tell him to play the backhand. Then he would look up at me in the stands and tell me how wrong I was when the guy was missing forehands.

“But if I did that with Andre, he would be like don't come to the courts. That is the nuance that you have to learn in coaching every player that you coach.”

Gilbert went on to explain what it was like coaching Murray and highlighted just how detail-oriented the three-time Major champion was.

“Andy Murray, I would give him the game plan, and he would always, no matter what, ask why? How did you come to this conclusion?, Where are your 1000 words? Where is your data?” he said.

“I am like, I just think of this s— and give it to you! I am not going to get into too much detail.

“But no matter what, he would ask why, how did you come to this, what about if you're wrong?”

As one of the sport's most experienced coaches, Gilbert knows all too well how every player is different in how they approach the game.

“Part of being a coach is that you set a game plan, and sometimes it doesn't work. Sometimes your opponent has the answer,” said Gilbert.

“But you have to be willing to make changes and find things.

“It's the communication that is really important, but I found with all the different players that I have worked with that the communication lines can be completely different with each player that you coach.”

Three players won Grand Slam titles with Gilbert as their coach, as the American guided many to the top of the game.

Gilbert enjoyed the majority of his coaching success working with Agassi between 1994 and 2002.

Agassi won six Major titles during this period, enjoying multiple stints as world number one.

The eight-time Major champion once described Gilbert as the ‘Greatest coach of all time'.

Joining Roddick's team in 2003, the pair quickly found success together, as the big-serving star won his sole Major title in New York a few months later.

Roddick beat Juan Carlos Ferrero to win the 2003 US Open title, ascending to number one in the world rankings shortly after.

They qualified for one further Grand Slam final together at Wimbledon in 2004, before parting ways later that same year.

Gilbert ended his 20-year wait for an eighth Grand Slam title as a coach when Gauff beat Aryna Sabalenka in the final of the 2023 US Open.

The WTA star had enjoyed a fantastic summer on North American hard courts since Gilbert joined her team, winning in Washington and Cincinnati prior to her maiden Major victory at Flushing Meadows.

Failing to defend her title in 2024, Gilbert and Gauff parted ways, with the 63-year-old now enjoying time away from the sport.

It remains to be seen if Gilbert chooses to return to coaching, but he certainly won't be short of suitors, should he decide to do so.

Tsitsipas praised Badosa for taking the time to heal from a chronic back injury.ByDavid KanePublished May 09, 2025 copy_link

ROME, Italy—Only one half of “Tsitsidosa” is competing at the Internazionali BNL d'Italia this week, Stefanos Tsitsipas lending support to girlfriend Paula Badosa as she recovers from a recurring back injury that has ruled her out of action since the end of March.“I feel like currently, she's very close to 100% but not there yet,” Tsitsipas said after a 6-2, 7-6 (3) victory over Alexandre Müller. “I can sort of guess on the outside.Badosa began struggling with back issues in 2023, a year after her rise to No. 2 in the WTA rankings. Tsitsipas spoke of “finding solutions” with Badosa, his partner of now over two years, at the 2024 BNP Paribas Open.

Badosa ultimately turned to injections to treat the injury later that spring, speaking openly about the rollercoaster of emotions that led her to briefly end her relationship with Tsitsipas. The pair reunited 10 days later.She appeared to make a full recovery last summer she stormed back up the rankings, culminating with a semifinal finish at this year's Australian Open that brought her back into the Top 10. But the injury cropped up again before Indian Wells, and she has played just one tournament since, withdrawing from both major clay-court warm-up events in Madrid and Rome.She spoke to the press before pulling out of Rome, predicting this injury would force her to “retire young.”

“I have been trying my best to support her in whichever way I can and know,” Tsitsipas said. “Only she knows what her limits are.“I think she's being smart. She was very naïve and stubborn when it first happened about two years ago. She really wanted to get back as soon as possible. I remember telling her she's rushing and doing things too fast.“I'm happy that she learned how to listen to her body and knows how to respond accordingly to the pain and discomfort she might have. So, I'm happy she's taking the necessary time that is required for her to be 100%.”Both Badosa and Tsitsipas are entered to play Roland Garros at the end of the month.

Following a clinical first-round victory (6-3,6-3) at the Rome Open, Carlos Alcaraz shared heartfelt praise for fellow rising star Jannik Sinner, highlighting the Italian's return to the tour as a major boost not just for him personally, but for the sport of tennis as a whole.

“It is great, honestly, to have him around for me, for me, it's great to have him back,” he said in an interview with Tennis Channel. “Honestly, I'm going to say I need him, you know, on the tour, because, I mean, he forces me to be a better player, to give 100% of me every day, just to be better,” he added.

Alcaraz said that, other than personal favoritism, he was also an advocate for growing tennis and that Sinner's absence was hurting tennis as a sport.

“And, of course, I defend always tennis, and I think tennis needs him as well,” he said. “You know, to bring, to bring new fans. You know, he's his tennis is huge. He's insane. I love watching him play. So having the chance to see him and watch his tennis again, it is great so I'm just, that really happy, but it's not a different feeling. Just, that it's great for me, for tennis and I'm sure for the fans here in Rome, it's a special thing,” he added.

Alcaraz said he was happy after his first match and that he exceeded his own expectations for the first round in Rome. “I'm happy with this first match. The most important thing was to test myself be able to play the way I want and that was what happened. I was able to sprint left and right and feel good. I'm confident for the rest of the week,” said Alcaraz during his post-match press conference.

Djokovic has lost three matches in a row after early exits in Monte Carlo and Madrid

Novak Djokovic has taken a wildcard to play the upcoming Geneva Open as he looks to find form and match fitness before the French Open.

Djokovic, who is aiming for a standalone record 25th Grand Slam title in Paris, pulled out of this week's Italian Open.

The 37-year-old Serb has lost his past three matches after early exits at clay-court events in Monte Carlo and Madrid last month.

Djokovic did not give a reason for missing the ATP Masters tournament in Rome - where he is a six-time champion.

Now the three-time French Open champion has decided to return to Geneva in an effort to spend more time on the red dirt before heading to Roland Garros.

It has been a patchy season by Djokovic's high standards. 

A positive start saw him reach the Australian Open semi-finals, although he had to pull out injured against Germany's Alexander Zverev after losing the first set.

The world number six, who turns 38 this month, lost three matches in a row on his comeback before rediscovering form at the Miami Open.

However, he was overwhelmed by powerful Czech teenager Jakub Mensik in the final, costing him another chance to win his 100th ATP title.

Overall, he has won 12 of his 19 matches this season and hopes to improve that record in Geneva.

Last year, Djokovic reached the semi-finals on his first appearance in the Swiss city.

He went on to reach the Roland Garros quarter-finals, but had to withdraw from his last-eight match against Casper Ruud with a knee injury picked up in the previous round.

Norway's Ruud, who beat Britain's Jack Draper in the Madrid final on Sunday, is also in this year's Geneva field, along with American world number four Taylor Fritz.

The ATP 250 event begins on 18 May, with the French Open starting a week later on 25 May.

Tennis legend Kim Clijsters has spoken out in admiration of Serena Williams, highlighting what she sees as an underappreciated chapter in the 23-time Grand Slam champion's storied career—her remarkable return to tennis after giving birth. Reflecting on her own career and the era she played in, Clijsters expressed deep pride in sharing the court with some of the sport's most iconic names.

“When you think back about it now it's amazing and the women that we had growing up too - Steffi Graf, Monica Seles, Lindsay Davenport I mean she was so important for me also,” said Kim Clijsters in a recent podcast.

However, one name stood out for Clijsters and that was Serena Williams. Clijsters even recalled the first match she ever played against Serena, which she ended up losing and Serena went on to win her first US open.

“My first US open I qualified and played against Serena in the second round and that was her first US open title and she ended up being the GOAT in our sport right?” said Clijsters.

Clijsters also mentioned how Serena's achievements after she came back from child birth, were underappreciated. Clijsters as we all know is the only WTA player in the open era to win a grand slam as a mother. Many expected Serena would be the one to extend that list to two. However, she failed to do so, falling short of just one match multiple times. She made it to four grand slam finals- twice at US open and Wimbledon, falling short all 4 times.

“I feel very fortunate that we had great rivalries and seeing Venus and Serena develop into just multiple Grand Slam champions, especially Serena being what she did after she you know had her daughter and coming back and being so close to winning more titles was, I feel like doesn't get enough recognition, but yeah, I'm very very proud to be part of that generation,” stated Clijsters.

With multiple mothers competing in the top 50 of the current WTA roster, it remains to be seen if anyone joins Kim Clijsters on the elite list.

Mariano Navone already beat one Italian in Rome; can he beat the world No. 1?ByDavid KanePublished May 09, 2025 copy_link

Published May 09, 2025

ROME, Italy—The atmosphere for Jannik Sinner's return from a three-month suspension is likely to be the highlight of the week at the Internazionali BNL d'Italia.Can No. 99-ranked Mariano Navone crash the party?The 24-year-old Argentine got some practice against a partisan crowd on Thursday when he defeated Italian wild card Federico Cina, 6-3, 6-3 on Grand Stand Arena to book the meeting with Sinner.“It's always special when you play like this,” a smiling Navone told me after the match. “It's like an NBA, home-away match! Of course, it was tough because Federico was such a good player and also many are in the crowd who want to see him and want him to win. There are many things under you, but it was a really special match because I've played at Grand Slams but this is one of the biggest stages outside that, making it a very special tournament for us.”

Navone's match against Cina was his 20th of the season on clay; for Sinner, it will not only be his first on the surface since playing the semifinals of Roland Garros in June, it will also be his first since February, when he won the Australian Open.Read more: A complete timeline of Jannik Sinner's doping caseSinner's suspension stemmed from two positive tests for the banned substance Clostebol last spring. Though the International Tennis Integrity Association (ITIA) initially declined to suspend the three-time Grand Slam champion, the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) appealed the ruling and Sinner ultimately accepted a settlement that required him to sit out the last three months—and miss four Masters 1000 tournaments.“For me, look, last year was very difficult,” Sinner said in his pre-tournament press conference. “I had a lot of personal pressure, holding everything. I couldn't talk with many people about what happened. I was in a tough situation at the beginning of the Australian Open. I struggled a lot, so it was nice to take a small break. Three months…but it is what it is. A small break was good. I could feel that I'm not playing for quite a long time.”

He stopped three months ago and this is his first match, so it's not easy for him either. Mariano Navone on Jannik Sinner

Sinner described having low expectations in his return to the Foro Italico, mainly eager for the feedback opponents like Navone will give him on the court.A two-time ATP finalist, Navone will be playing only his third match against a Top 10 player—he's 2-9 vs. the Top 20—but has risen to the occasion in the past, pushing Rafael Nadal to a 7-5 third set last summer in Bastad.“It's like a challenge,” Navone told me. “It's not often you have the chance to play against the No. 1 player in the world. So, it's special for me. It would be the biggest victory of my career. But for sure, it's challenge and I have to take it like that for me and my game.“He stopped three months ago and this is his first match, so it's not easy for him either.”

Navone called Sinner's suspension “not my problem,” and described zero animosity towards the top seed in the locker room.“Now he's a normal player,” said Navone, who peaked at No. 29 in the ATP rankings in 2024.“He stopped, he completed his suspension, and it's really safe. He took some time. Three months is time. It's tough to be out for three months, but he completed his suspension and that's it.”Navone will next look to have the last word on Saturday, in front of the biggest crowd of his young career.

Novak Djokovic will for the second consecutive year play in an ATP 250 tournament the week before the French Open after making a late change to his calendar.

The 24-time Grand Slam winner has accepted a late wildcard entry into the Geneva Open with the move coming on the back of his withdrawal from the Italian Open.

The world No 6 will join Taylor Fritz (No 4), Casper Ruud (No 7), Grigor Dimitrov (No 15) and Tomas Machac (No 20) as the highest-ranked players in the draw at the event.

It is certainly a move away from the traditional schedule for the top-ranked players as they often prefer not to play competitive matches the before a Grand Slam.

Djokovic will start the tournament on a three-match losing streak as he lost in the final of the Miami Open and followed it up with defeats in his opening matches at the Monte Carlo Masters and the Madrid Open.

Having played only two competitive matches on clay – one each in Monte Carlo and Madrid – his decision to skip the Rome ATP Masters 1000 event raised eyebrows as many felt he was undercooked on the surface.

But Djokovic has maintained in recent years that his main focus is the Grand Slams and he hopes to peak at Roland Garros.

“I was hoping I can play one more match than I played in Monte Carlo,” he said after his defeat to Matteo Arnaldi in Madrid.

“Kind of new reality for me, I have to say. You know, trying to win a match or two, not really thinking about getting far in the tournament. 

“It's a completely different feeling from what I had in 20-plus years of professional tennis, so it's kind of a challenge for me mentally to really face these kind of sensations on the court, going out early now regularly in the tournaments.

“But, you know, that's, I guess, the circle of life and the career (smiling), eventually it was going to happen. 

“Now I'm trying to, you know, use this as a driving force for the future. Obviously Grand Slams, I was saying many times, are the most important tournaments for me.”

The Geneva Open – which runs from May 18-24 – will now give him an opportunity to get more matches on clay under his belt before the French Open starts on May 26.

Djokovic had a similar calendar in 2024 as he played at the Monte Carlo Masters and Italian Open, but skipped the Madrid Open and then signed up for the Geneva Open.

He will defend 100 points at the Swiss event as he defeated Yannick Hanfmann in his opener and Tallon Griekspoor in the quarter-final before going down in three sets against Machac in the last four.

Italian feeling like he belongs as makes top-10 debut

Four years ago, a teenaged Lorenzo Musetti enjoyed an impressive Grand Slam main draw debut at Roland-Garros.

The then 19-year-old Italian stormed to the fourth round in Paris, and led a top-ranked Novak Djokovic by two sets to love before he eventually retired late in the fifth.

Ahead of the start of that 2021 tournament, Musetti got a chance to hit with Spanish legend Rafael Nadal on the practice courts at the nearby Jean Bouin facility, just down the road from Roland-Garros.

“I remember I lost, like, 6-1 against him. And I was a little bit scared, playing against him,” Musetti recalls.

That feeling, and those days, must feel like a lifetime ago for Musetti, who this week has entered the top-10 in the world rankings for the first time, landing at No.9.

Over the past couple of seasons, Musetti strengthened his belief that he belonged amongst the world's best.

Last year, he had an excellent grass-court campaign, reaching the semi-finals in Stuttgart, the final at Queens, and his first Grand Slam semi-final at Wimbledon.

“Honestly, it was a little bit of a surprise, I would say, because I didn't experience so much grass. But when I started playing on grass, I always fell in love with it,” Musetti told rolandgarros.com in a recent interview.

“And I see some similarities on grass with clay, I would say, because now grass is not like 30 years ago that was so fast that you cannot have a rally. Of course, serve and return are really important, much more than on the clay. But I think with the slice, with all the variations that I have in my background, I can really use it as a weapon. So I really love to play on both, honestly.”

This spring, Musetti is perhaps putting together a similarly impressive run, but on clay – the surface he grew up on – with a final at the Masters 1000 in Monte-Carlo and semis at the Madrid Open under his belt heading into his home tournament in Rome.

Those results have helped the 23-year-old lock down his place in the top 10, a career milestone he always dreamed of.

“I think the level that I'm showing this year and I would say also the last year, it confirmed my level and the consistency that I showed, especially last year. It probably gave me that extra motivation and confidence of deserving where I am today,” said the talented Tuscan.

Musetti told reporters in Rome he will try to “keep the momentum alive” starting with his opener against Finnish qualifier Otto Virtanen.

While he feels not much will change now that he is a top-10 player, he knows that mentally, things might be a bit different.

“Making final of a Masters 1000, like in Monte-Carlo, with a lot of ups and down during my matches, then stopped one week, almost two because I played in the weekend of the second week. Going through the Madrid Open to the semi-finals without losing a set, it's a confirmation of my level, of my mentality I would say, because the top 10 mentality is of course, you try not to lose with somebody who is lower than you, you know?” he explained.

“It was something that I was feeling when I was outside, when I was 50 or whatever. Playing against a top 10 is something different. Is something different even if you win against top 10. Now I feel the opposite, of course.”

As a crafty player with lots of variety in his game, Musetti feels he has fully grasped the true identity of his playing style, and steps on court with a purpose.

He hopes march to the final four at Wimbledon last year will help him have a successful Roland-Garros, a place where he has already made the second week twice.

“My best results in Paris were the two times fourth round. And honestly, my goal this year and my expectations are to set the goal a little bit higher. But I just don't want to think too much in the future,” he says.

“I had the experience in Wimbledon and the positive thing that I had in Wimbledon was the mentality that I was playing match by match and I was not looking too much forward. So definitely I will try to experience the same.”

Wimbledon 2024 isn't the only positive experience Musetti can draw on when it comes to Roland-Garros.

On Parisian clay later in the summer, the Italian secured a bronze medal at the Olympics, becoming the first from his country to make the podium in tennis in the history of the Games. His compatriots Sara Errani and Jasmine Paolini went two steps better and clinched gold in women's doubles a day later.

“I always felt great in the conditions of Roland-Garros. And even if it was like two months later, I definitely felt great also at the Olympics,” he said.

“It was probably my best achievement so far in my career. Probably the most emotional, I would say. So, having great memories, I think it's not bad to have that in mind when you play.”

Halfway through his fifth year on tour, Musetti is feeling like a seasoned player.

“I remember when I was really, really fresh on tour and when it was my first year or the first two years, where every tournament that you play is new. You've never been there. You don't know the people, the condition, the hotels, the city,” he recalls.

“Now, I don't want to say that I'm a veteran, but I saw a lot of things and, of course, a lot of things changed. I became a father. I have a family to handle. So a lot more responsibility, even on the human side. But they brought me a better version, I think, of myself also into the court.”

Musetti and his partner Veronica Confalonieri welcomed their first child, Ludovico a little over a year ago.

He says being a father has inspired him to embrace the idea of being a role model to others. 

“Probably having more responsibilities and becoming a sort of example, not just for my kid, but also for all the kids that watch tennis and they dream about becoming a professional tennis player or they love the sport,” he says when asked how fatherhood has changed him.

“Try to be an example also on the court, on the court and off the court. That's my main goal, I would say.”

Given that's his goal, it's no surprise that what Musetti was proud of the most about his runner-up showing in Monte-Carlo was his attitude; more than anything else.

“It's easy. The spirit that I showed on the court, I think. The fighter that I showed up in Monte-Carlo was really surprising also for me. And I would say that I need to be more like that during my career, during hopefully all my seasons,” he concludes.

Fabio Fognini was the Italian number one for several years, leading the way for his country on the world's stage.

Italian tennis is in as good a place as ever, as the nation prepares to welcome back Jannik Sinner, who will return from suspension in Rome.

Sinner isn't the only Italian star ranked in the top ten, with Lorenzo Musetti reaching a career-high rank of ninth following his run to the last four of the Madrid Open.

However, before Sinner and Musetti rose to the top, it was Fognini flying the flag for Italy, producing several stand-out performances on clay.

The world number 107 is set to retire from tennis at some point in 2025 and has just played his final match at the Italian Open.

Speaking after Fognini's defeat to Jacob Fearnley, one ATP Tour legend revealed what the 37-year-old was really like behind the scenes.

On the Tennis Channel Live Podcast, 2003 US Open champion Andy Roddick gave his verdict on Fognini.

“He was the last guy I beat,” said Roddick.

“It's funny, you have some people who how they are on court does not really tell the entire story.

“I do not know if I ever saw a bad moment with Fabio [Fognini] when he wasn't between the lines

“He had a lot of disagreements with a lot of players. We both got along famously. 

“We both had a little edge to us when we played.”

Roddick beat Fognini in both of their two ATP Tour meetings, the last of which was the American's final victory before retiring at Flushing Meadows 13 years ago.

The former world number one went on to explain how well the pair got on off the court.

“Off the court, easy to talk to, always up for a joke, willing to laugh at himself if he had done something crazy a couple of days earlier,” said Roddick.

“He was always in on the joke with himself. I always really got along and had a lot of respect for Fognini.”

Prior to 2019, Fognini had won eight tour-level titles, (seven ATP 250s), (one ATP 500).

Using all of his clay court experience, Fognini broke through at the Masters 1000 level six years ago, to win title number nine.

Traveling to the principality as the 13th seed, everything fell into place as the Italian stormed into the semi-finals of the Monte-Carlo Masters.

Andrey Rublev, Alexander Zverev, and Borna Coric were all no match for Fognini as he booked his place in the last four, where he faced off against the tournament's greatest ever player, and three-time defending champion.

When Fognini took to the court against Rafael Nadal he did so against an 11-time champion and someone who hadn't lost in Monaco for 1,463 days.

Never one to shy away from the big occasion, Fognini produced arguably the greatest performance of his tennis career.

Dismantling the Spaniard in straight sets, Fognini shocked the tennis world by qualifying for his first Masters 1000 final.

In one of the most unlikely finals in recent memory, Fognini came face to face with unseeded Serb, Dusan Lajovic, who himself had shocked both Dominic Thiem and Daniil Medvedev in Monte-Carlo.

Producing another vintage display, Fognini won in straight sets, 6-3, 6-4, to lift his one and only Masters 1000 title.

The 37-year-old hasn't returned to an ATP final since, but will never forget what happened six years ago at the Monte-Carlo Masters.

After losing his opening match in Rome, Fognini is next scheduled to appear at a Challenger Tour event in Turin, Italy, which begins on May 12.

Alex de Minaur, Australia (world No. 8)Ruud bounced back into the Top 10—to No. 7—after winning Madrid, and you only have to go down one spot to find the new highest-ranked player seeking his first big title in No. 8-ranked De Minaur.De Minaur has firmly established himself as a top player over the last few years, reaching his first big final in Canada in 2023, falling to Jannik Sinner—he was two points away from another big final just a few weeks ago in Monte Carlo, falling to Lorenzo Musetti in a third set tie-break in the semifinals. He also has nine career titles, including two ATP 500s, and has reached the quarterfinals at the last four Grand Slams in a row—the only man other than Sinner to achieve that feat.Having gone deep at big events on every surface in the last few years, it's only a matter of time before he goes all the way at one of them.

DID YOU KNOW❓By reaching the final of the ATP 500 event in Munich today, 🇺🇸 @BenShelton has become the first American man to make a clay court final above ATP 250 level since Andre Agassi at Rome in 2002. 💥That was 5 months before Shelton was born:https://t.co/vXKNPOToUJ

Ben Shelton, United States (world No. 13)The 22-year-old American's biggest results have come on hard courts—both of his Grand Slam semifinals (one at the US Open and one at the Australian Open), his other Grand Slam quarterfinal (at the Australian Open), all three of his Masters 1000 quarterfinals, and his biggest career title at the ATP 500 event in Tokyo two years ago.But like Paul, Shelton has been getting more and more dangerous on clay, winning the title in Houston last year and, just a few weeks ago, reaching the final of the ATP 500 clay-court event in Munich—that was the biggest clay-court final an American man has reached since before he was even born, since Andre Agassi won Rome in 2002.If it doesn't happen for him during the rest of the clay-court season or the grass-court season, he'll definitely be one to watch in the summer.

He reached his first second week at a major last year too, at Wimbledon.But it's his results at Masters 1000s this year that have propelled him into the Top 15 for the first time—he reached the quarterfinals of Indian Wells, Miami and Monte Carlo, which actually made him the youngest player to reach the quarterfinals of the first three Masters 1000 events of the year since Masters 1000 tournaments began in 1990.The question for Fils isn't if he'll win a big title, it's just how soon.Honorable MentionsOutside the Top 15, there are plenty of active players who've reached big finals before but who are still seeking their first big title.Some have even reached multiple big finals: Matteo Berrettini with two (Madrid, Wimbledon); David Goffin with two (ATP Finals, Cincinnati); Nick Kyrgios also with two (Cincinnati, Wimbledon); Gael Monfils with three (Paris, Paris and Monte Carlo); Kei Nishikori with five (Madrid, US Open, Miami, Canada and Monte Carlo); and Milos Raonic also with five (Canada, Paris, Indian Wells, Wimbledon, Cincinnati).There's also Richard Gasquet, a three-time Masters 1000 finalist with 16 career titles all at the ATP 250 level. The Frenchman doesn't have much time left, though—he's set to retire at Roland Garros in a few weeks.And finally, a trio of current Top 30 players—Frances Tiafoe, Felix Auger-Aliassime and Denis Shapovalov—all former Top 10 players who've been to a Masters 1000 final before. The two Canadians have also both won ATP 500s—Shapovalov one, Auger-Aliassime three.

There are now five players in the ATP Top 15 without one, and they're the main suspects for the next big breakthrough.ByJohn BerkokPublished May 09, 2025 copy_link

Big titles—everyone wants them, but not everyone has them.For the men, “big titles” are the three highest levels of title: Grand Slams, the ATP Finals and Masters 1000s. The Olympic gold medal, which only comes around once every four years, also counts.They're not easy to come by, even for the best players in the world. For instance, until his triumph in Madrid last weekend, Casper Ruud was objectively the most accomplished active men's player without a big title, with a resume that included six previous big finals (including three Grand Slam finals), 12 career titles and a career-high ranking of No. 2.But with Ruud now removing himself from the list of best active men's players yet to win a big title, who are the new frontrunners?Here are the five biggest suspects at the moment—the five highest-ranked players on the ATP rankings seeking their first big title.

Alex de Minaur, Australia (world No. 8)Ruud bounced back into the Top 10—to No. 7—after winning Madrid, and you only have to go down one spot to find the new highest-ranked player seeking his first big title in No. 8-ranked De Minaur.De Minaur has firmly established himself as a top player over the last few years, reaching his first big final in Canada in 2023, falling to Jannik Sinner—he was two points away from another big final just a few weeks ago in Monte Carlo, falling to Lorenzo Musetti in a third set tie-break in the semifinals. He also has nine career titles, including two ATP 500s, and has reached the quarterfinals at the last four Grand Slams in a row—the only man other than Sinner to achieve that feat.Having gone deep at big events on every surface in the last few years, it's only a matter of time before he goes all the way at one of them.

Lorenzo Musetti, Italy (world No. 9)De Minaur isn't the only member of the Top 10 chasing his first big title—Musetti, who just made his Top 10 debut at No. 9, is on the hunt too.The Italian rising star has come close over the last month—he made his first big final in Monte Carlo, falling to Carlos Alcaraz in three sets, and another semifinal in Madrid last week, falling to Jack Draper. He has two career titles, including an ATP 500, and—like De Minaur—he's shown he's more than capable of doing it on any surface, having reached his first Grand Slam semifinal at Wimbledon last year.Having won 18 of his last 22 matches on clay, Musetti might take his name off this list sooner than we think, in Rome or even in Paris...

Tommy Paul reaches the fourth round for the first time in Madrid 🏄#MMOpen pic.twitter.com/mwP7a1mMCq

Tommy Paul, United States (world No. 12)The American may not have been to a big final yet, but he's come close several times in the last few years, reaching two big semifinals in 2023 (Australian Open and Canada) and another two in 2024 (Indian Wells and Rome). He's been to another five big quarterfinals, too.There's no reason he can't win his first big title in the next few months, either, having had lots of success on every surface—in addition to reaching the semifinals in Rome last year, he's a former junior champion at Roland Garros, and he won the biggest of his four career titles at Queen's Club—an ATP 500 event on grass—just before Wimbledon last year (where he reached the quarterfinals).

DID YOU KNOW❓By reaching the final of the ATP 500 event in Munich today, 🇺🇸 @BenShelton has become the first American man to make a clay court final above ATP 250 level since Andre Agassi at Rome in 2002. 💥That was 5 months before Shelton was born:https://t.co/vXKNPOToUJ

Ben Shelton, United States (world No. 13)The 22-year-old American's biggest results have come on hard courts—both of his Grand Slam semifinals (one at the US Open and one at the Australian Open), his other Grand Slam quarterfinal (at the Australian Open), all three of his Masters 1000 quarterfinals, and his biggest career title at the ATP 500 event in Tokyo two years ago.But like Paul, Shelton has been getting more and more dangerous on clay, winning the title in Houston last year and, just a few weeks ago, reaching the final of the ATP 500 clay-court event in Munich—that was the biggest clay-court final an American man has reached since before he was even born, since Andre Agassi won Rome in 2002.If it doesn't happen for him during the rest of the clay-court season or the grass-court season, he'll definitely be one to watch in the summer.

Arthur showing that consistency 👏Fils is the only player in 2025 to reach the quarterfinals at all first three ATP Masters 1000 events!#RolexMonteCarloMasters pic.twitter.com/IiaveOZpel

Arthur Fils, France (world No. 14)The only other man in the Top 15 without a big title is Arthur Fils, but if his trajectory keeps going the way it is, that could change at any time.At just 20 years old, and having only played his first full year on the tour in 2023, he's already captured three career titles, including two ATP 500s at Hamburg and Tokyo last year—one on clay, one on hard. He reached his first second week at a major last year too, at Wimbledon.But it's his results at Masters 1000s this year that have propelled him into the Top 15 for the first time—he reached the quarterfinals of Indian Wells, Miami and Monte Carlo, which actually made him the youngest player to reach the quarterfinals of the first three Masters 1000 events of the year since Masters 1000 tournaments began in 1990.The question for Fils isn't if he'll win a big title, it's just how soon.Honorable MentionsOutside the Top 15, there are plenty of active players who've reached big finals before but who are still seeking their first big title.Some have even reached multiple big finals: Matteo Berrettini with two (Madrid, Wimbledon); David Goffin with two (ATP Finals, Cincinnati); Nick Kyrgios also with two (Cincinnati, Wimbledon); Gael Monfils with three (Paris, Paris and Monte Carlo); Kei Nishikori with five (Madrid, US Open, Miami, Canada and Monte Carlo); and Milos Raonic also with five (Canada, Paris, Indian Wells, Wimbledon, Cincinnati).There's also Richard Gasquet, a three-time Masters 1000 finalist with 16 career titles all at the ATP 250 level. The Frenchman doesn't have much time left, though—he's set to retire at Roland Garros in a few weeks.And finally, a trio of current Top 30 players—Frances Tiafoe, Felix Auger-Aliassime and Denis Shapovalov—all former Top 10 players who've been to a Masters 1000 final before. The two Canadians have also both won ATP 500s—Shapovalov one, Auger-Aliassime three.

He reached his first second week at a major last year too, at Wimbledon.But it's his results at Masters 1000s this year that have propelled him into the Top 15 for the first time—he reached the quarterfinals of Indian Wells, Miami and Monte Carlo, which actually made him the youngest player to reach the quarterfinals of the first three Masters 1000 events of the year since Masters 1000 tournaments began in 1990.The question for Fils isn't if he'll win a big title, it's just how soon.Honorable MentionsOutside the Top 15, there are plenty of active players who've reached big finals before but who are still seeking their first big title.Some have even reached multiple big finals: Matteo Berrettini with two (Madrid, Wimbledon); David Goffin with two (ATP Finals, Cincinnati); Nick Kyrgios also with two (Cincinnati, Wimbledon); Gael Monfils with three (Paris, Paris and Monte Carlo); Kei Nishikori with five (Madrid, US Open, Miami, Canada and Monte Carlo); and Milos Raonic also with five (Canada, Paris, Indian Wells, Wimbledon, Cincinnati).There's also Richard Gasquet, a three-time Masters 1000 finalist with 16 career titles all at the ATP 250 level. The Frenchman doesn't have much time left, though—he's set to retire at Roland Garros in a few weeks.And finally, a trio of current Top 30 players—Frances Tiafoe, Felix Auger-Aliassime and Denis Shapovalov—all former Top 10 players who've been to a Masters 1000 final before.

Tiger Woods' teenage son Charlie fell at the first hurdle in his bid to qualify for next month's US Open.

The 16-year-old was one of 10,202 golfers who entered the 125th US Open and Woods Jr. this week began the long road to Oakmont in Pennsylvania.

He took part in one of the regional qualifying events, teeing it up at Wellington Golf Club in Florida. But Woods' score of three-over-par was not good enough to progress.

Only a handful of players from each event make it through to final qualifying and Woods finished seven shots off the four-under-par cutoff.

It nevertheless marked a huge improvement on last year, when Woods finished nine-over-par in his bid to reach the 2024 tournament.

Charlie did qualify for his first US Junior Amateur Championship last year but failed to reach the match play knockout stages.

Tiger Woods' son Charlie fell at the first hurdle in his bid to qualify for next month's US Open

The 16-year-old finished three-over-par at the qualifying event at Wellington Golf Club

Charlie is the eldest son of Tiger, a three-time US Open champion and 15-time major winner

Back in March, meanwhile, he joined Donald Trump's granddaughter Kai in the field at the Sage Valley Junior Invitational. Woods finished 20 shots off the eventual winner.

Charlie is the eldest son of Tiger Woods, a three-time US Open champion who is recovering from surgery on a ruptured Achilles. 

Tiger and Charlie have teamed up for several events in recent years but neither will be in the field at Oakmont next month. 

Charlie was not the only big name who entered one of the 100-plus qualifying events around the country.

Former NFL quarterback Tony Romo, ex-tennis star Mardy Fish and New York Rangers player J.T. Miller are also among those hoping to reach Oakmont.

Mikey Madison may have found her first post-Oscar project: “Reptilia.” The “Anora” Best Actress winner will co-star alongside Kirsten Dunst in the latest film from director Alejandro Landes Echavarría (“Monos”), which will be presented to buyers at the Cannes Film Market beginning next week. 

The film will be produced by Barry Jenkins' Pastel, along with Imperative Entertainment, AF Films, and Black Bear, who is providing financing. Landes Echavarría will also produce under his A Stela Cine banner. 

“Reptilia” is about “a dental hygienist who is seduced by a mysterious mermaid into the dark and wet underworld of Florida's exotic animal trade.” Landes Echavarría co-wrote the script with Duke Merriman.

Madison was rumored to be offered a role alongside Ryan Gosling in the latest “Star Wars” installment. She also was believed to be in talks for Luca Guadagnino's now-shelved DC Studios Film “Sgt. Rock.” The actress has voiced her desire to collaborate with prolific auteur Guadagnino soon.

NBC will pitch its new and returning fall series to advertisers at Monday's upfront.



		By Rick Porter, Tony Maglio 

	May 9, 2025 10:50am	




NBC has canceled Lopez vs. Lopez and Night Court after three seasons apiece. The cancellations come on the final business day before NBC's upfront — when networks pitch advertisers on their coming slates — on Monday.


Night Court aired its third season finale, which will now serve as a series ender, on Tuesday — although sources say Warner Bros. TV, which produces the show with Universal TV, may try to find a new home for the series.




	This Night Court stars Melissa Rauch (who also executive produces) as Abby Stone, a judge in Manhattan's often chaotic night court and the daughter of Harry Stone, the lead character in the original 1984-92 series (who was played by the late Harry Anderson).

Ahmir “Questlove” Thompson had a tall order to one-up himself after he and producer Joseph Patel won the Best Documentary Feature Oscar in 2022 for “Summer of Soul.” But he found it with “Sly Lives!,” the story of Sly Stone and his revolutionary music with Sly & the Family Stone. Beyond just a biographical account, the documentary, subtitled “(aka The Burden of Black Genius),” examined something bigger: The extraordinary representational burden Black artists carry. 

Asking the 20 or so artists who appear in “Sly Lives!” about that — from Jimmy Jam to D'Angelo to André 3000 — Questlove had a realization: It's “probably the most frightening question they've ever been asked,” he said at a Q&A for the film, which occurred at IndieWire's Pass the Remote event, presented by Disney and Hulu. The screening and Q&A at Vidiots Foundation in Los Angeles on May 3 drew a packed house, and Questlove and Patel both mingled with attendees afterward at the beer and wine reception in the lobby that followed, much as the interviewees did for our previous Pass the Remote panels in April about casting and TV music. (Watch the full panel above.)

But as celebratory as the event was, it was thoughtful — and thought-provoking — too. Questlove said that asking that question of his interviewees was like “Jedi mind tricking people.” Stone's life meandered from extraordinary creative highs to long periods of creative inactivity marked by questionable choices, in his career and in his life. “What we're not trying to do is pile on,” Questlove said. (See photos from all our 2025 Pass the Remote events here.)

“It would've been so easy just to tell the worst stories and the worst experiences and take advantage of peoples' poor choices in life just to benefit our film and tell a more sensational story,” the director continued. “Especially with Black artists, they're not treated as human beings. Even the Family Stone members [we interviewed] were like, ‘Boy, what is this? Therapy? You trying to make me go to therapy?' That sort of thing. A lot of them aren't asked half the time how they feel. I put out feelers to about 19, 20 of my peers. I wish I could probably say this is probably the most frightening question they've ever been asked. And a lot of them didn't want to do it because they couldn't allow themselves to go there. Some agreed to do it and then day of, hours before were like, ‘Are you showing up?'”

 










Needless to say there was a lot of anxiety there, because the experience of having to be all things to all people as a Black artist — while putting the best foot forward to represent Black excellence — and continually delivering at the highest level, is pretty universal. With all of that pressure, fissures can reveal themselves. “This is also Lauryn Hill's story,” Questlove said. “This is also D'Angelo's story. This is Frank Ocean's story. This is Kanye's story right now. You have everything you ever wanted in the world. Why are you purposely trying to mess this up? And it's so much deeper. From afar, we think we want things. But there's so much under the surface that we have to explore it. And I think that's frightening for people sometimes.”

Producer Patel added, “D'Angelo [who's interviewed in the film] also suffered through some of the same things Sly did when he was successful, he put out one album and everyone called him the next Marvin Gaye. And then he does Voodoo and he releases a single, ‘How Does It Feel?,' with a video that people can't stop talking about. Ahmir was witness to D'Angelo struggling to go on stage, every night getting later and later, because he knows he has to be in top physical condition to perform that song with his shirt off to a screaming, sold out room every night. He's been through that. So everyone in the movie, whether people pick up on it or not, it was really intentional. We spent a lot of time in pre-production figuring out who are the people that could speak to Sly's story as proxies.”

 










That's also because the 82-year-old Stone wasn't interviewed for the movie. “Sly Lives!” is fundamentally more concerned with his impact and influence on other artists — one sequence narrated by Jimmy Jam showing how “Dance to the Music” influenced “Rhythm Nation” is particularly extraordinary — and what he represents about Black artistry, than it is about parsing his biography.

“When we really actually set out to work on this, I asked Ahmir, ‘What's the story?'” Patel said. “And he said, ‘It's about Sly. But also when you trace back all the Black artists who find success,' including Ahmir, including his peers. He was like, ‘Sly was really the first to go through this thing that we all experience.' And I think for us and the films that we do together, it's about one specific thing, but really something that resonates more to a bigger idea. And so he, Ahmir, in the very first conversation was like, ‘It's about Sly, but it's really about the burden of Black genius.'”

The film is also about how artists are remembered, and the particular set of circumstances that result in certain artists being particularly celebrated. It makes a convincing case Sly Stone is one of the most influential artists of all time… so why isn't he revered even more?

 










“We talked about very, very, very early was telling Sly's story with empathy,” Patel said. “That's important. But also the fact that he's still alive is important. It's why the film is titled ‘Sly Lives!' because had he passed away at 27, like a lot of people of his generation, famous and on top, would we revere him more? You know what I mean? And it's like he… Ahmir also talks about the run of genius. He talks about how most artists have a genius run of max seven years. And then a lot of those artists that he's referencing died before we could find out. Sly didn't, and Sly probably had more down years than up years, but does that mean he's any less of a genius? I think those are the subtext questions of the film.”

Documentary Editor, Awards


	One of the new pope's brothers has given an interview to a Chicago TV station, shedding light on how Cardinal Robert Prevost prepared for the Vatican conclave that elected him pontiff. Turns out the prelate boned up with help from an Oscar-nominated film.


	John Prevost, the middle of three Prevost brothers (Louis is the eldest and Robert – now Pope Leo XIV — is the youngest) told Chicago's NBC affiliate WMAQ-TV that he talked with Robert a day before the conclave began.


	“I said, ‘Are you ready for this? Did you watch the movie Conclave, so you know how to behave?' And he had just finished watching the movie,” Prevost laughed, “so he knew how to behave.”

	Prevost explained, “I wanted to take his mind off of it [the real conclave], you know, laugh about something because this is now an awesome responsibility.”




			Watch on Deadline		







	The drama-thriller directed by Edward Berger and starring Ralph Fiennes, John Lithgow, Stanley Tucci, Isabella Rossellini, and Carlos Diehz, presents a fictional story of intrigue over the selection of a new pope to lead the Roman Catholic Church. After numerous ballots, a surprise candidate becomes the Vicar of Christ.


	In the real conclave that ended Thursday, Cardinal Prevost was also considered by many observers to be an unlikely choice given that no American had ever been named pope. Even the Chicago-native Prevost apparently doubted his odds of being chosen.


	“He didn't think so,” John Prevost said. “I didn't believe it and Rob didn't believe it – I should say Pope Leo didn't believe it at all, because there's not going to be an American pope was the attitude.”


	On the other hand, Prevost did think his brother was under serious consideration. “What I was reading and what I was hearing was that there were three outstanding candidates that were in first, second and third place,” he noted, “the cardinal from the Philippines, the [Vatican] secretary of state, and him [Robert].”


	Pope Leo XIV, who succeeds Pope Francis after the previous pontiff's death at the age of 88, may not have a lot of time to watch movies now that he will be shepherding the world's 1.4 billion Catholics. However, John Prevost offered some insight into how his younger likes to take a break from weighty ecclesiastical issues when the two get a chance to talk.

	











	“First we do Wordle, because this is a regular thing, okay,” he explained. “We do Words with Friends. It's something to keep his mind off life in the real world.”


	On a somewhat more sober note, Prevost talked about the family reaction to the stunning news of Cardinal Prevost's elevation to become only the 267th pope in history. 


	“It's totally unreal, it's totally surreal,” he said. “It's a tremendous thing to take in, but it's something to be very proud of.”

The celebration of independent film has been held in a tent alongside the Santa Monica pier since 1993.


							By 

	Scott Feinberg


Executive Editor of Awards


	Film Independent's Spirit Awards, the industry's highest-profile celebration of independent film, is leaving the beach in Santa Monica, where it has been held for decades, and relocating to the heart of Hollywood, specifically the Hollywood Palladium, for its 41st edition on Sunday, Feb. 15, 2026.


	The Spirit Awards have been held in a tent alongside the Santa Monica Pier since its eighth edition in 1993, with the exception of its 9th edition, which, too, was held at the Hollywood Palladium.




	It is unclear if the just-announced move is temporary or permanent, though it reportedly was triggered by the city of Los Angeles' preparations for the 2028 Summer Olympics.

	











	“Following the celebration of 40 years of the Spirit Awards earlier this year, we are excited to have the opportunity to reimagine the Spirit Awards experience during a moment of tremendous growth and transformation for our organization,” Brenda Robinson, Film Independent's acting president said in a statement. “We are proud to continue to be a beacon for the bold and resilient independent storytelling community and to honor excellence in storytelling in all its forms.”


	Added Shawn Davis, executive producer of the Spirit Awards: “We're thrilled to bring the Spirit Awards to the historic Hollywood Palladium. This move represents our continued evolution while staying true to our roots of celebrating fearless independent voices of film and television.”

Pearl Jam brought out surprise guest Peter Frampton during their concert Thursday in Nashville, with the two Rock Hall-inducted artists linking up for a rendition of the band's “Black.” 


	“This gentleman was someone we looked up to before the Ramones. Some of our first guitar heroes, [like] Jimmy Page and Pete Townshend, he was right up there,” Eddie Vedder told the crowd before the Frampton Comes Alive rocker took the stage. 


	“It was one of reasons why we loved live records, and later we decided to release bootlegs because of his influence. He's such an incredible human being on top of it. It is our honor, because at this point he's become a good friend to the group. He's recorded with Mike [McCready] and [drummer] Matt Cameron and we get to play with him tonight.”


	Frampton, a longtime resident of Nashville, then joined the band to perform the Ten classic, wailing away alongside McCready on guitar solos that included Vedder teasing Frampton's own “Do You Feel Like We Do.”

	Frampton will embark on a North American tour later this month, six years after the guitarist announced a farewell tour due to his battle with inclusion body myositis. However, as evidenced by Frampton's “Black” solo, the rocker has soldiered on despite the degenerative disease.

	“We all have our battles. We're all fighting something. I'm just a person who is out there, doing the best he can, and bringing awareness to IBM [inclusion body myositis], raising money where I can. We've got a lovely foundation at Johns Hopkins, the Peter Frampton Fund. People are still sending in money, which is wonderful. It'll help us with clinical trials. Those are expensive. I'm raising money for them so we can find that magic bullet,” Frampton told Rolling Stone in 2024.


	“I'm very optimistic. I'm speaking with my doctors all the time, and hearing all the new stuff that's coming along, and the new technologies the scientists are finding in the lab. It looks like something could be coming around the corner. We're always hoping for that.”

Charlize Theron is back in action at Netflix with the long-awaited graphic novel adaptation sequel “The Old Guard 2.” And this time? She's joined by “Kill Bill” action star alum Uma Thurman.

“The Old Guard 2,” which will be released five years after the first film, has been in the throes of production delays at the streamer. Lead star Theron, who also produces the feature, told Variety in 2024 that it was due to the “changeover” at Netflix that in part led to the film‘s post-production being shut down; the feature wrapped filming in 2022. 

 










Now, “The Old Guard” is new again.




			Popular on IndieWire		






Victoria Mahoney directs from a script by Greg Rucka and Sarah L. Walker. The film is based on the 2017 graphic novel from Rucka, which is illustrated by Leandro Fernandez. Gina Prince-Bythewood previously helmed the first installment that became a hit on the platform.

“The Old Guard 2” brings back Andy (Theron) and her team of immortal warriors. Booker (Matthias Schoenaerts) is still in exile, while Quynh (Veronica Ngô) is out for revenge after escaping an underwater prison. The film's official synopsis reads: “Andy grapples with her newfound mortality as a mysterious threat emerges that could jeopardize everything she's worked towards for thousands of years. Andy, Nile (KiKi Layne), Joe (Marwan Kenzari), Nicky (Luca Marinelli), and James Copley (Chiwetel Ejiofor) enlist the help of Tuah (Henry Golding), an old friend who may provide the key to unlocking the mystery behind immortal existence.” Thurman's role is currently undisclosed.

The feature is produced by Theron, AJ Dix, Beth Kono, Marc Evans, David Ellison, Dana Goldberg, and Don Granger of Skydance. 

IndieWire's Kate Erbland previously deemed the first “Old Guard” film to be Netflix's best action movie of 2020, writing in her review, “It's a movie that wants its audience to think and if that sounds like a weird fit for the genre, you've surely never pondered what it would mean to be all-powerful in a world that only wants to see things go boom.” The feature was a “deep-thinking” rife on the superhero genre, while the first film “also sets up plenty of ideas worth exploring in its inevitable sequel (which, yes, we can only hope will sport even more nutso action).”

Netflix will release “The Old Guard 2” on its streaming platform on Wednesday, July 2. Check out the film's first trailer below.

All of the Backstreet Boys voted for Baylee Littrell when he competed on season 23 of “American Idol,” but it wasn't enough to keep member Brian Littrell's son from going home. 

During a red carpet appearance at the ACMs on May 8, 2025, the iconic boy band told “Entertainment Tonight” they “all voted for him” as Brian got choked up talking about his son's journey on the show. The 22-year-old, who made it to the top 20, was widely criticized online by viewers who labeled him a “nepo baby” who was riding on the coattails of his famous dad. 

Baylee auditioned with his parents in tow and made it to the top 20 of “American Idol.” He was sent home on April 21 after viewer votes weren't enough to get him through to the top 14 and judges Luke Bryan, Carrie Underwood, and Lionel Richie opted not to save him. 

When ET correspondent Cassie DiLaura asked Brian about how proud he was of his son's journey on May 8, he immediately got choked up, telling her, “I mean, you can't really put it in words. But, I mean, he's just living the dream. He's a talented young man so, you know, we'll see — the sky's the limit.” 

“You know, it's tough,” Brian continued. “This business isn't easy, it'll chew you up and spit you out. But, uh, I think he's in good hands.” 

BSB member Kevin Richardson chimed in, “He's a talented young man. He's just beginning his journey.”

On May 2, Baylee told CCM Magazine that “American Idol” producers had encouraged him to audition for four years before he finally said yes. 

“I've been doing music on my own for really the past, like six years, seven years, mostly spending my time in Nashville and touring,” Baylee said. “But it just never was really working out like I had hoped. I was never getting the big break that I needed or the exposure.” 

“People barely know my name,” the college student acknowledged. “They just know my background or where I come from. It's definitely hard. During my time in the industry, people would try to sign me, then find out where I come from, and never talk to me again.” 

But Baylee was nervous about auditioning for a TV show, telling CCM, “I didn't want to be a viral bad moment on American Idol. I didn't want to not get the golden ticket. I was terrified to be vulnerable.”

Brian told ET that Baylee will soon release “Hey Jesus” as a single, a faith-driven song he wrote at age 19 and performed during Hollywood Week. 

“This song truly, like I wrote it in a very dark time in my life,” Baylee told CCM. “It's more about the struggle with faith, the struggle with finding your way. A big common misconception is that God won't let us fall down. But falling is part of the journey.”

The case claims the superstar and his team have "turned a blind eye" to copyright infringement and left a lesser-known artist with "no choice but to file this lawsuit."

	Bill Donahue



Bad Bunny is facing a lawsuit over allegations that a track from his chart-topping Un Verano Sin Ti featured an unlicensed sample from a Nigerian artist – and that the superstar's reps later “stonewalled” efforts to resolve the problem.


	In a copyright case filed May 2 in Los Angeles federal court, attorneys for the artist Dera (Ezeani Chidera Godfrey) claim that Bad Bunny's “Enséñame a Bailar” illegally sampled from a 2019 track called “Empty My Pocket.”


	Dera's lawyers say they've raised the issue with reps for Bad Bunny and others behind the song, but that they've “turned a blind eye” and left him with “no choice but to file this lawsuit.”


	“It is not very often that a musical artist of Bad Bunny's caliber and sophistication uses someone else's music without permission, and then ignores the person's efforts to resolve the problem,” writes Dera's attorney Robert A. Jacobs, a litigator at the top music law firm Manatt Phelps & Phillips. “Such a response is especially surprising when the unauthorized use pervades the entirety of the musical artist's work. Unfortunately, these are the circumstances here.”


	The lawsuit also names as defendants The Orchard, which distributed the album, and Bad Bunny's Rimas Entertainment, among others. Representatives for both Bad Bunny and The Orchard did not immediately return requests for comment.


	Released in 2022, Un Verano Sin Ti was a mega-hit – spending 13 weeks atop the Billboard 200 and more than 150 weeks total on the album chart. “Enséñame a Bailar” was a hit in its own right, charting on the Hot 100 for two weeks and earning 72 million views on YouTube.


	In his lawsuit, Dera says Bad Bunny's song was essentially built on top of his “Empty My Pocket” – that the usage is so “extensive” that the sampling itself is “beyond question.”


	“Plaintiffs' works comprise virtually the entirety of the musical bed and a portion of the lyrics in the infringing recording and infringing composition, and, as such, account for a significant portion of the appeal of the infringing works,” his lawyers write.


	They claim access to Dera's song was provided by a producer named Lakizo (Lekan Adesina), but that he had no authority to clear the use of the sample: “Lakizo … is not an author of ‘Empty My Pocket' … and does not have – and never had – the right to prepare or authorize others to prepare derivative works.”


	According to the lawsuit, when Dera discovered the unauthorized sample he tried to negotiate a good-faith resolution with Bad Bunny's team, saying he wanted to “address past unauthorized uses” but also “allow future uses.” He says he also “unconditionally complied” with requests to substantiate his claim, including sharing documents showing that Lakizo had not been authorized to clear the sample.


	“Despite plaintiffs' cooperation, these defendants stonewalled plaintiffs after receiving the requested information, making clear that plaintiffs' only option for obtaining redress for the violation of their rights would be through the courts,” Dera's lawyers write.

Are the guys OK? So rarely do we get smart, subversive screen comedies about male friendship these days, and writer/director Andrew DeYoung's feature directing debut “Friendship” turns the genre inside out. 

Casting Paul Rudd as forlorn weatherman Austin Carmichael, neighbor to Tim Robinson's anxiously neurotic Craig Waterman, in his A24 movie will immediately bring to mind another male friendship comedy, “I Love You, Man.” “Friendship” is like the dark mirror of John Hamburg's 2009 cult classic, as the desperately friendless Craig strikes up (or even forces) a bond with the charismatic man across the street who keeps getting his packages. It proves ruinous for all, including Craig's wife Tami (played by Kate Mara), who is obsessed with an ex and oh-so eager to get Craig out of the house.

The Los Angeles-based DeYoung, who has directed episodes of you-name-it every beloved single-camera streaming comedy series from “PEN15” to “Dave” and “Our Flag Means Death,” was inspired by his own brush with a male companionship that wasn't gelling.




			Popular on IndieWire		






“It was less of an established friendship and more of a wanting,” he told IndieWire. “I thought there was a friendship blossoming, and that person didn't seem to be as interested as I thought. And I'm like, wow, you see the romance version of it constantly. I've never seen the middle-aged version between two straight men. That's happening all the time. Men have friendships, and they have issues with their friends, and I know it's most predominantly portrayed in ‘I Love You, Man,' but what's my version of that that's closer to my reality? And so that's where it started from.”

The arthouse-cringe, let's call it, comedy of “Friendship” is filled with the familiar and not-so-familiar iconography of male buddy comedies: Craig is trying to bond with his son Steven (Jack Dylan Grazer) over the latest “Marvel,” Craig and his corporate co-workers at a company that makes their clients' products more addictive hang out in the garage over beers, and Craig and Austin seek bond-forming adventure in the most unlikely of places (here, a sewer system, for one). But Craig's agonized fixation on finding a new friend only turns alienating for Austin, who has it all figured out, unlike his neighbor, who's no longer having sex with his wife since she had cancer.

 










“Tim's a friend, and as I wrote, I was imagining him and I never told him about it until I finished it and sent it to him,” said DeYoung, who next directs “I Think You Should Leave” star Robinson in HBO's half-hour comedy pilot “The Chair Company.” “The Austin character was kind of an amalgamation of all kinds of different archetypes and people in my head, so I never knew who that quite would be, but when Paul's name came up, I was like, that guy is perfect.”

DeYoung said that Rudd “asked to be in the movie more” and “it really made the movie even better. I imagined in my head I was going to get someone totally on the drama side. [Paul] has a little bit or a lot of everything he could do. He's this handsome guy who's really funny, but also such a good actor and will be able to play off Tim in such an incredible way and knows the comedy moves without winking at it.”

DeYoung shot “Friendship” in Yonkers, giving his A24 buddy comedy a wintry, folksy twinge that wouldn't have been possible had he shot the film in California, where he's from.

“I grew up in Fresno, California. It was a gift to have to shoot in Yonkers during the dead of winter because I'm a California boy — it just sounds like pure pain, but it added all these gifts with the coats and the snow. There's an underlying sadness and grief to it, and the weather really helps set that tone in place. Split-level homes were a new thing that I didn't know, and I just had to embrace that.”

 










“Friendship” is unusual for a studio-adjacent comedy in that it's rife with moments of portentous dread, cinematographer Andy Rydzewski's camera slowly zooming at times like a horror movie. In one sequence of the film, Craig takes a strange drug trip after licking an amphibian, which sends him into a hallucinated Subway franchise brick-and-mortar. Meanwhile, there's Tami, lost for half the movie in the sewers underground after Craig leads her down there trying to spice things up (whoever thought that would end well?). There's even some straight-up horror violence toward the film's end that feels ripped out of A24's arsenal of chillers.

With Rudd and Robinson on board, DeYoung said he had the “leverage” in terms of pitching the movie, and at a moment where he was “so kind of disappointed by the overall state of cinema that I'm like, ‘I'm not going to make anything that's not exactly what I'm going to make,'” he said. “We're going to shoot it with these high-arthouse aesthetics.” He pitched the film as in a vein more like “The Master,” “The King of Comedy,” “Toni Erdmann,” or “Force Majeure” than “I Love You, Man,” “all movies that are successful and work. So I'm not pointing to things that are shaky.” (“Friendship” was produced by Fifth Season and BoulderLight Pictures, with A24 acquiring it out of the 2024 Toronto International Film Festival, where the film premiered.)

 










DeYoung added, “Paul and Tim have massive cult followings, and to me it [felt] so safe. I never tried to soften the movie. I only tried to make it feel scarier to financiers, to be honest, to see who is actually down to get in the mud with me and try something different.”

I asked why DeYoung is “disappointed by the overall state of cinema,” and he said, “I just feel like there are a lot of safe choices that don't respect the audience. It's so nice to feel respected by a filmmaker, even if I don't like the movie or agree with what it's trying to do. If it feels like it's trying to do something and treat us as the intelligent people that I like to imagine we are, I'll respect it. A lot of films really sell out the audience and treat us dumber than we are.”

DeYoung pointed to Sean Baker as one such filmmaker whose smart work “sneaks through” and doesn't pander to audiences. Beyond his work, the Oscar-winning director's recent comments about the financial headwinds faced by indie filmmakers resonated with the “Friendship” director, too.

“If I didn't have TV, I would be trying to slum it in the commercial world or flipping houses, I don't know,” DeYoung said. “Some working at the highest levels [are] still getting fucked over financially. People project onto us as having a certain kind of financial life, but it's actually not the case. The system's rigged against us, and I love A24, truly such good partners, but the culture is rigged against the filmmaker. And there's a lot of people who didn't do much on these movies who are getting paid more than the filmmaker.”

 










Speaking of filmmakers pulling it in financially, there's a running gag throughout “Friendship” in which Craig is just dying to see “the new Marvel” because it's apparently so good that it's driving people crazy. “I have to choose my words wisely because I know these things bring a lot of joy to people,” DeYoung said. “The reason why maybe talented filmmakers go to bigger tentpole projects is kind of none of my business, and I hope they're getting paid to do it regardless, but it just doesn't interest me… [Marvel is] almost boring to make fun of. But I think a character who likes it is interesting, and it's a way to comment on it without the usual tearing down of it. All those arguments have already been made.”

“Friendship” is now in select theaters from A24. It goes into wide release on Friday, May 23.

One year ago last week, Kendrick Lamar set flames to Drake's reputation that the rap world is still feeling the embers from. In just a week, songs like “Euphoria,” “6:16 In LA,” and yes, “Not Like Us,” bested Drake's offering in their quick-draw war of words, and subsequently crowned Lamar the rapper of his generation in the eyes of many. He rode that momentum into GNX, a 12-track album that debuted at Number One on the Billboard 200. That's the tidal wave of energy he rode into the MetLife Stadium stop of his Grand National Tour, alongside Jersey girl SZA. He and SZA are in high demand. The 35-year-old singer-songwriter is a bona fide music superstar in her own right, and the two offered the tristate area a special main event concert.


	The show started with DJ Mustard, who did his best to warm up the crowd with rap standards before Lamar and SZA hit the stage. The stage design somewhat resembled the diamond design of Lamar's Super Bowl halftime set, with a giant stage leading out toward three smaller bases. The design gave the two ample room to roam and get decent face time with fans in the lower levels, which they both took advantage of throughout the set. (The stage also rose during the show.) Behind them was a giant three-panel screen. From my stage-right vantage point, I could see how the two used the stage's angles to project a panoramic view of certain visuals. The screen served different purposes at different junctures. For SZA, there were multiple serene landscapes aiding her dreamy catalog, while Lamar used videos of himself in March 1992 during “DNA,” and hammered home his attack on Drake's identity with a collage of Black iconography during “Not Like Us.”

	Lamar came out first, rising from a black Grand National car below the stage and tearing into “Wacced Out Murals” (the Grand National SZA rose from was naturally covered with ivy). The two alternated between sets all night with a slick interplay. Lamar turned the mood down with “Man at the Garden,” leading into SZA's “Scorsese Baby Daddy,” while she ended her solo set with “Kiss Me More,” leading into Lamar's final tracks; they also had moments when they did collaborations such as “30 for 30” and “Luther.” Their switches also gave the two time to switch attire multiple times. While Lamar alternated from a mostly camo fit, putting his jacket on and off, SZA was in full starlet mode, with four different outfits. But no matter what they were wearing, they had the crowd captivated. SZA stuck to lights and fireworks, whereas Lamar had fireballs going off, especially during his Drake disses.

	The mixed-aged crowd, seemingly mid-thirties and down, likely discovered Lamar and SZA at various points along their decades-plus journeys, and some may have just tapped in last year. It seems like Lamar's more recent output got the most recognition. He even noted the dynamic, jokingly telling fans to turn to their neighbors, church-style, and ask if they knew one of his earlier singles. I've seen Lamar play arenas and festival stages multiple times, and he carried the same craft into his stadium show, delving into his rapid-fire rhymes without missing a beat. He also introduced some flourishes for his live show, performing a new verse on “Family Ties” and remixing songs like “mA.A.d city” over Anita Baker.


	While the tour's title and the moment at large belonged to Lamar, the Jersey crowd loved SZA. They popped for her pop hits, like “Kill Bill,” and for heartrending tracks, like “Nobody Gets Me,” which were all sung solidly with no backing vocals. She had guitarists play during multiple songs, including “F2F.” She acknowledged the magnitude of the moment by raving, “Am I home or what?” And later declared alongside Kendrick that “the myth of New York having no energy is over.” And though she didn't do her in-air routine because of the Northeast winds, she still gave a varied set, dancing all over the stage. 


	Both artists took the elephant in the room head on. Lamar performed his verse of “Poetic Justice,” while SZA recited her verse on “Rich Baby Daddy.” Curiously, Lamar refrained from saying “Oakland” when he rhymed “That __ show gonna be your last stop” on “Not Like Us.” But that's not to be confused with mercy. Lamar performed “Euphoria” and “Not Like Us,” with the former song inspiring his barest, most intentional usage of the giant screen behind him (placing “Lies About Me, Truth About You” in red font over a black background). And while the crowd went up for “A minor…,” and “we don't wanna hear you say nigga no more,” it wasn't a bash-Drake event. The audience seemed just as excited to sing the “Don't Kill My Vibe” chorus and “I do,” during SZA's rendition of “I Hate U.”

	Both artists tore through their catalog standards, utilizing the full stage, as did dancers accompanying them in various fashions. When several women popped their asses out as Lamar rapped “Show me something natural” during “Humble,” they were a visual ad-lib. Some of them picked up SZA during one track, and bolstered her choreography on many others. When a man did a solo dance routine at the end of “Squabble Up,” he felt like a co-star.

	Between songs were humorous clips of the two being “deposed.” While the clip that played before “Not Like Us” has gone viral, the show displayed several other clips. In one, Lamar chides the interviewer for nonsensically implying he disappears from the public yet seeks attention. In another clip, they struggle to pronounce SZA's name, which may have something to do with her saging the room in another snippet. And toward the end of the set, the two dig into their natural-comedian bags during a clip of a gas station snack run. Their years of musical chemistry played out well onscreen and onstage.


	Both artists tried their best to engage the hefty crowd, and mostly succeeded with movement, strong vocals, and a mesh of creative screen animations, pyrotechnics, and lighting. While the set lasted two and a half hours, it rarely lulled, with both doing a solid job of imbuing their set portions with energetic songs to keep the crowd into it. Lamar and SZA are seasoned veterans at this point in their respective careers, and that was reflected even during their first stadium tour. They were strictly business — in a good way.

Carrie Coon has found her next project post-“The White Lotus.” The acclaimed actress, who also recently starred in “His Three Daughters” and soon returns for “The Gilded Age” Season 3, has joined Guy Nattiv‘s cult thriller “Harmonia” alongside Lily James.

Nattiv reunites with Bleecker Street after the company distributed his 2023 film “Golda.” Bleecker Street acquired the U.S. rights to “Harmonia” and plans to release the film in theaters nationwide in 2026.

As previously announced, “Harmonia” will also star Bella Ramsey and “My First Film” breakout star Odessa Young. Nattiv co-wrote “Harmonia” with Noa Berman-Herzberg; the film is inspired by Nattiv's family's real-life story. Production is set to begin this summer.

The official synopsis reads: “Set in the 1980s, the film is based on Nattiv's grandmother's experience with an insidious cult. Rita (Coon), unraveling from past wounds, meets a radiant young spiritual leader (James) after a chance encounter. Following her into the all-female commune known as Harmonia, Rita leaves her life and family behind until her daughters, Ella (Ramsey), and Jo (Young), embark on a dangerous journey to rescue their mother. Once immersed in the commune, they find themselves inexorably drawn into the leader's labyrinthine web of pseudo-spiritual and psychological manipulation.”

Nattiv, whose 2023 film “Tatami” also recently received distribution from Westend Films, said in a press statement, “‘Harmonia' is born from the true story of my grandmother — a woman whose quiet strength and unspoken pain left an indelible mark on our family. For years, her story lived in the shadows, and now, at last, I'm giving it voice. I couldn't ask for more soulful collaborators than Carrie, Lily, Bella, and Odessa. Each of them brings a deep, intuitive grace to these layered characters, and their commitment to tell my story is tremendously moving.” 

Julia Lebedev and Eddie Vaisman produce the film for Sight Unseen, with Jaime Ray Newman and Nattiv producing for New Native Pictures, along with Oren Moverman. Leonid Lebedev will serve as an executive producer.  

Embankment Films represents international rights. CAA Media Finance and Range Select brokered the deal with Miranda King, Kent Sanderson, and Avy Eschenasy of Bleecker Street, while CAA and Range Media Partners represent the filmmakers.

 










Coon is represented by United Talent Agency, Foundation Talent Management, and attorney Peikoff Mahan. James is repped by UTA, Tavistock Wood, Sloane Weber Offer Dern, and Narrative PR.

Bleecker Street additionally recently acquired “Bone Lake,” set to release in October, as well as the re-release of the 1984 cult classic “This Is Spinal Tap” and its upcoming sequel, “Spinal Tap II: The End Continues,” both directed by Rob Reiner. Christopher Guest, Michael McKean, and Harry Shearer reprise their iconic roles for the sequel, which also brings real-life rockers Paul McCartney, Elton John, and Questlove into the mix.

Other 2025 Bleecker Street releases include “Relay,” starring Riz Ahmed, “Harmonia” star James, and Sam Worthington; the feature will be released on August 22 after its U.S. premiere at Tribeca this year. Max Walker-Silverman's “Rebuilding,” starring Josh O'Connor, will also be in theaters after its Sundance premiere. Walker-Silverman previously helmed “A Love Song” for Bleecker Street, too.

Judas Priest found out too late that Ozzy Osbourne and Black Sabbath would be playing a star-studded farewell concert this summer to join in on the festivities, frontman Rob Halford recently told Metal Hammer. A talent agent in Germany recruited the band to perform at the 60th anniversary concert for another venerated metal band, the Scorpions, on July 5, and despite Sharon Osbourne offering to fly the band to and from Birmingham, England for Ozzy's final bow in time to honor their Scorpions commitment, Judas Priest declined.


	“It all got announced and was a big deal — Scorpions and Priest — and suddenly I get this phone call [from Sharon Osbourne]: ‘Robbie, I know you've got this gig with Scorpions, but could you consider coming over to do a thing with Ozzy and the guys, he'd love to see you.'”


	Halford mulled over Sharon's offer to ferry the band via private jet between the concerts, but the singer didn't want to leave anything to chance. “Even with a private plane, there's a word called ‘technical', where something could go wrong, or the weather that time of year could cause problems… I was absolutely gutted,” he said.

	He nevertheless said that he was excited for the concert, even Judas Priest would be there, since it reinforces Birmingham's status as the birthplace of heavy metal. Like Black Sabbath, Judas Priest formed in the city. (And incidentally, ex-Priest guitarist, K.K. Downing, will be performing at the event.


	In addition to Osbourne and Black Sabbath, the concert, dubbed Back to the Beginning, will feature sets by Metallica, Guns N' Roses, Tool, Slayer, Pantera, Gojira, Alice in Chains, and many others. It will take place at Birmingham's Villa Park. “All my mates are going to be there though, great bands and artists,” Halford told Metal Hammer. “It's a wonderful and epic moment for Sabbath and heavy metal.”

	Halford may be missing out on Black Sabbath's farewell, but he should take some comfort that he was actually one of the few headbangers to have been there at the actual beginning. In 2020, he told Rolling Stone what it was like to see Sabbath's early club gigs in Birmingham. “I have vague memories of seeing them as Earth in an obscure club in Birmingham, and they were in a sort of heavy-blues, jazzy-prog mode musically,” he said. “I can only recall the very first Sabbath songs like [Crow's] ‘Evil Woman,' which was a cover. There was still some freeform noodling going on when they played live, but essentially the heaviness was dominating.”

	He was also present for the first time when the original Black Sabbath lineup said goodbye at the conclusion of Osbourne's No More Tours tour in 1992. At the time, Osbourne had been worried about his health and decided to take a final bow, before reversing course a couple of years later with the Retirement Sucks tour. Black Sabbath had reunited with Ronnie James Dio. When the idea of Black Sabbath opening for Osbourne's final shows came up, Dio quit, and Halford became their frontman for two shows. The rest of the band — guitarist Tony Iommi, bassist Geezer Butler, and drummer Bill Ward — then joined Osbourne for encores later in the evening. Halford also fronted Sabbath for a short set in Camden, New Jersey, in 2004 when Osbourne fell ill.

Jane Schoenbrun‘s latest feature film “Teenage Sex and Death at Camp Miasma” has been boarded by MUBI, which will finance and distribute the film in select territories. 

Newly announced by MUBI on Friday, “Camp Miasma” will star “Hacks” star Hannah Einbinder and “X-Files” star Gillian Anderson, and it will go into production this summer in British Columbia. 

Schoenbrun wrote and will direct the film about a director hired to yet again reboot a slasher horror franchise called “Camp Miasma.” But when the latest movie's director becomes obsessed with the mysterious, reclusive actress who played the “final girl” in the original film, a whole new kind of slasher emerges from the bottom of the lake.

Brad Pitt's Plan B has also boarded the film and is producing. Daniel Bekerman, who is executive producing, will provide local production services via his Scythia Films. MUBI is financing the film and will distribute in select territories, including North America, Latin America, UK, Ireland, Germany, Austria, Benelux, Turkey, India, Australia, and New Zealand, with The Match Factory handling remaining worldwide sales.

“I make movies I wish existed when I was a kid,” said Schoenbrun, “and ‘Teenage Sex and Death at Camp Miasma' is my best attempt at the ‘sleepover classic:' an insane yet cozy midnight odyssey that beckons to unsuspecting viewers from the horror section at the local video store. I couldn't be more excited to be heading to sleepaway camp this summer with the mad comic genius Hannah Einbinder, the legendary Gillian Anderson, and the daring folks at MUBI and Plan B, who by greenlighting this movie have summoned a plague-like flood of blood, guts, and various other fluids to rain down on us all.”

Schoenbrun's most recent film “I Saw the TV Glow” premiered at Sundance in 2024 and was released by A24, becoming an instant critical darling and one of the best reviewed films of the year. It was also nominated for six Independent Spirit Awards and three Gotham Awards. Their prior films include “We're All Going to the World's Fair” and “A Self-Induced Hallucination,” and Schoenbrun is also working on a novel set to be published by Hogarth in 2026 called “Public Access Afterworld.” 

Einbinder currently stars in Max's hit comedy series “Hacks,” now in its fourth season, and she just released her first stand-up special “Everything Must Go” on Max last year. Anderson is a two-time Emmy winner known for “The X-Files,” “The Crown,” “The First Lady,” “The Great,” and the recent “Scoop.” She'll next be seen in “Tron: Ares” this fall.

 










MUBI has several films premiering at Cannes next week, including Kelly Reichardt's “The Mastermind” and Oliver Hermanus' “The History of Sound,” and it will also soon be releasing Karim Aïnouz's “Rosebush Pruning,” and Jim Jarmusch's “Father Mother Sister Brother.”

Jane Schoenbrun is represented by CAA, Entertainment 360, and Kimberly Jaime at Jackoway Austen. Hannah Einbinder is represented by CAA, The Lede Company, Cary Dobkin and David Krintzman at Yorn, Levine, Barnes, Krintzman, Rubenstein, Kohner, Endlich, Goodell & Gellman. Gillian Anderson is represented by UTA, Independent Talent, and Premier Communications.

	In Teenage Sex and Death at Camp Miasma, the infamous Camp Miasma slasher franchise is getting rebooted yet again. But when the latest movie's director becomes obsessed with the mysterious, reclusive actress who played the “final girl” in the original film, a whole new kind of slasher emerges from the bottom of the lake.

	“I make movies I wish existed when I was a kid,” Schoenbrun said, “and Teenage Sex and Death at Camp Miasma is my best attempt at the ‘sleepover classic:' an insane yet cozy midnight odyssey that beckons to unsuspecting viewers from the horror section at the local video store. I couldn't be more excited to be heading to sleepaway camp this summer with the mad comic genius Hannah Einbinder, the legendary Gillian Anderson, and the daring folks at MUBI and Plan B, who by greenlighting this movie have summoned a plague-like flood of blood, guts, and various other fluids to rain down on us all.”


	Best known for starring on Max's hit comedy Hacks, Einbinder is an actor and comedian who released her debut stand-up special, Everything Must Go, on Max last year. She's repped by CAA, Cary Dobkin and David Krintzman at Yorn, Levine, Barnes.


	Recently starring in Netflix's Sex Education, as well as projects like Scoop, White Bird, and The Pale Blue Eye, Anderson is also in Disney's Tron: Ares, which releases October 10. She is repped by UTA and Independent Talent.


	Schoenbrun's most recent film, A24's I Saw the TV Glow, was nominated for six Independent Spirit Awards, including Best Picture, Screenplay and Director, as well as three Gotham Awards. Their earlier films include We're All Going to the World's Fair and A Self-Induced Hallucination. Their first novel, Public Access Afterworld, will be published by Hogarth in 2026. The filmmaker is repped by CAA, Entertainment 360, and Kimberly Jaime at Jackoway Austen.

	











	Recent and upcoming Mubi Productions include Kelly Reichardt's The Mastermind, which is premiering at Cannes, as well as Karim Aïnouz's Rosebush Pruning, and Jim Jarmusch's Father Mother Sister Brother.

"Enter Sandman" has been the home team's pump-up tune for 25 years.


													By
												

	Gil Kaufman



	It's one thing for the Virginia Tech Hokies to blast Metallica‘s “Enter Sandman” as the football team's game-day hype song when they take the field at Lane Stadium for home games. It's quite another thing for the band to play the song on the team's home field for the first time in front of a sold-out crowd primed to set things off.


	In fact, on Wednesday night (May 7) during Metallica's first-ever appearance at Lane Stadium on their M72 world tour, Hokie fans got so hyped that the Virginia Tech Seismological Observatory said the jumping up and down set off the Richter scale. For the past 25 years, the team's entrance soundtrack has become legendary in college sports, a moment of collective joy when 60,000 fans jump up and down to the metal anthem to welcome their team onto the field.

	











	In fact, according to Hokie Sports, Wednesday night was not even the first time a seismograph was set off thanks to the reaction to the lead single from Metallica's 1991 self-titled fifth album, which topped out at Nov. 16 on the Billboard Hot 100. Back in 2011, in a game against ACC rival Miami (FL), a seismograph detected seismic activity when the team entered the stadium, then again in 2015 during a game against Ohio State and one more time in 2021 during their home opener against North Carolina.


	Though playing the song has long been a tradition, one fan told ABC 13 News that watching the band open with a snippet of the instrumental intro — while flashing the team's logo on the big screen — and then close out the show with the anthem was something else entirely. “The fact that we're here, Metallica is playing ‘Enter Sandman' – they started with it; this stadium's been asking for it, we all need it,” VT junior Wesley Metcalf said. “We're getting it; it's a great night tonight, and I can't believe it's happening.” VT junior Luke Dalton added, “Experiencing that live; the actual band playing it rather than the games because we already get hyped from the games themselves, but hearing Metallica playing in the stadium live, it's awesome, man.”


	The band got all into it as well, meeting up with VT football coach Brent Pry before the show, where he presented them with No. 25 Hokies jerseys and a No. 72 jersey commemorating their ongoing M72 world tour. The tour marches on Friday night (May 9) when Metallica play the first of two takeover events at the Sonic Temple Festival in Columbus, OH.

EXCLUSIVE: Stranger Things and Elvis star Dacre Montgomery‘s directorial debut is gaining traction ahead of a planned shoot later this year.


	Montgomery will star in the film alongside Lily Sullivan (Evil Dead Rise), Abbey Lee (Mad Max: Fury Road) and Arlo Green (M3GAN) and Metro International has boarded sales for the Cannes market. Madman Entertainment is aboard as Australia/NZ distributor.


	The synopsis reads: “On a beautiful, secluded island, amidst the golden rays and ocean breeze of a stunning beach house, two couples reunite to celebrate a momentous occasion. Until a conflicting memory arises which threatens to tear their relationships apart. With each wave crashing against the shore, the line between memory and manipulation blurs, forcing them to confront a question they've tried to forget: What really happened that night?”

Leonardo DiCaprio made a discreet entrance at his first-ever Met Gala. The “Titanic” superstar low-key attended the iconic fashion event and opted not to walk the blue carpet.

DiCaprio, 50, quietly joined his 26-year-old girlfriend, Vittoria Ceretti, inside the  Metropolitan Museum of Art. Vogue's photographer, Andre D. Wagner, captured the couple inside the venue, with the actor shielding his face from the camera.

A post shared by Vogue (@voguemagazine)

For his Met Gala debut, DiCaprio wore a sleek tuxedo and bowtie to match this year's theme, “Superfine: Tailoring Black Style.”

The magazine shared the black-and-white snap on Instagram, which already gained over 100,000 likes.

When it comes to fashion, Leonardo DiCaprio's on-screen looks are the stuff of legend. Fitting then that for the 2025 #MetGala—the actor's first ever!—DiCaprio didn't hold back. The star, joined by his supermodel girlfriend Vittoria Ceretti, wore a sleek tuxedo—just the thing to complement the night's “Tailored For You” dress code.

While DiCaprio stayed behind the scenes, Ceretti confidently walked the steps and posed for the cameras at the 2025 Met Gala. The model donned a Moncler pin-striped minidress with a head-turning oversized hood. She matched the look with full-length gloves and a diamond necklace.

DiCaprio's stealthy Met Gala debut quickly sparked buzz online. While some were happy to see the actor at the event, others were more critical of his sneaky moves.

One commenter wrote, “Omg they went TOGETHER?! FINALLY,” while another commented in disbelief, “Wait…he was there..?”

Others noted that the actor appeared to keep his distance from the model, with one asking, ‘Why is he always running away from her?' Meanwhile, another commenter chimed in, “Why did he come there if he doesn't want to be photographed?”

A post shared by Vittoria Ceretti (@vittoria)

Meanwhile, Ceretti shared some rare insight into her relationship with DiCaprio. In an interview with Vogue France published on March 24, the model said she learned to focus on her experiences with the actor instead of his high-profile romances in the past.

Ceretti is also aware of the scrutiny that comes with dating a superstar like DiCaprio. In the same interview, she finds it annoying that people label someone depending on who's more popular.

As soon as you're in a relationship with someone who has a larger following than you, you become ‘girlfriend of'—or ‘boyfriend of,' for that matter. And that can be extremely annoying.

DiCaprio and Ceretti first started dating rumors in August 2023.

	Lainey Wilson, Reba McEntire & Miranda Lambert sit down ahead of the ACM's and share how they came together to create their new collab, “Trailblazer.” They share how Brandy Clark, Dolly Parton and more influenced the song, producing and recording together and more!


	Are you excited for “Trailblazer?” Let us know in the comments!


Melinda Newman:


I wanna start by just asking how the song came together.


	Miranda Lambert:


	The first conversation was an idea that we could write a song for all of us to sing together, right? 


	And you brought up Brandy because we all love her so much.


	Reba McEntire:


	Love Brandy Clark. 


	Miranda Lambert:


	Yes. 


	Reba McEntire:


	Her writing, her singing, everything about her. 


	Miranda Lambert:


	Yeah, so we went to my back porch and- 


	Lainey Wilson:


	Yeah, we were like, okay, we're gonna get to do a song with Reba. So what kind of song do you think that like, what do we write, you know? 


	Miranda Lambert:


	And she was on set, so we were calling her and trying to FaceTime and figure out, like, what's the right message for this, this trio, like, what do we really want to say in a three minute song? Because it felt really important to all of us, I think. 


	Reba McEntire:


	And I had texted with Brandy the day before, giving her some ideas, and then when I finally got to hear it, I was ecstatic. Thrilled to pieces, and Brandy said that was the fastest she's ever written a song because they gelled so well together. 


	Lainey Wilson:


	We were just having a conversation about how both of y'all have influenced me, and how it's just it's kind of like passing the torch and blazing trails for each other. And so it's just like, you know, generation after generation it's going to continue. Well, we got to keep blazing those trails for the next ones.

							By 

	Nancy Dillon



Lil Durk appeared today in a federal courtroom in downtown Los Angeles, where a judge denied his souped-up bid to be released on bond pending his Oct. 14 trial on charges he orchestrated a murder-for-hire plot that led to a man's death.


	Moments after the the Grammy-winning “All My Life” rapper heard the ruling, he was asked to enter a plea to the second superseding indictment filed in the case last week. “Not guilty,” he said while seated at a defense table wearing a beige jail uniform and knit kufi cap in keeping with him Muslim faith.


	At the end of the hourlong hearing, the 32-year-old artist stood up and smiled broadly at a group of nearly two dozen supporters seated in the gallery. He raised his right hand to his heart and nodded at various family and friends before U.S. Marshals led him back into detention.


	“He's strong and focused,” the rapper's dad, Dontay “Big Durk” Banks, tells Rolling Stone. “You saw the smile that was on his face, both during the time and afterwards, after the ruling. He's still smiling. He's still strong. He's standing on his faith, you know, and believing that God will make a way for him.”

	











	Lil Durk, born Durk Banks, had proposed paying Beverly Hills-based ARSEC Security to enforce a strict home detention program with around-the-clock armed guards while he prepares for his upcoming trial. He also increased the cash portion of his proposed bail package, adding $150,000 to the $1 million previously offered by Alamo Records.


	In oral arguments, Banks' lead lawyer, Drew Findling, said the “robust” proposal was more than adequate considering Banks has no prior criminal record. Findling said the circumstances of the case also changed when prosecutors filed their updated indictment last week. He said they “removed” two of the three “specific facts” in the prior indictment that purportedly connected Banks to the August 2022 shooting death of Saviay'a Robinson at a gas station near the Beverly Center mall in Los Angeles.

	Speaking to the judge, Findling said prosecutors not only eliminated the allegation that Banks “monetized and celebrated the death” with song lyrics, they also removed the allegation that Banks directed a co-defendant to pay “the bounty” for Robinson's death. Findling argued the new indictment now hinges on only “sweeping generalizations” that Banks offered a bounty for the death of Robinson's cousin, Tyquian Terrel Bowman, also known as Quando Rondo. (Prosecutors allege Banks wanted Bowman dead because he blamed him for the death of a childhood friend. Robinson was traveling with Bowman the day a group of alleged hitmen opened fire on Bowman's car, killing Robinson.)

	











	When it was his turn to speak, Assistant U.S. Attorney Ian Yanniello disputed the claim that the murder-for-hire indictment rises or falls on the lyrics no longer specifically cited. “This murder case is not about [Banks'] lyrics, and it's not about his music. It's about his conduct, and the steps he allegedly took when he allegedly dispatched hitmen to hunt, stalk and kill a rival,” Yanniello said. He also claimed the government hadn't “conceded” anything.


	“The government stands by the allegation that [Banks] did in fact commercialize his violence. But that's a question for another day,” Yanniello said. He said the matter would be decided when the court takes up motions on the evidence to be allowed at trial.


	Before she issued her ruling denying Banks' bond, U.S. Magistrate Judge Patricia Donahue said she had received a report claiming Banks “repeatedly used at least 13 other inmate phone accounts to make phone calls” from his detention center. She said it was a violation of the facility's rules. She also said Banks appeared to be engaging in three-way calls.

	Findling argued that inmates using other inmates' phone accounts is a common practice inside federal detention centers. He said there was no evidence Banks was doing anything other than connecting with his family. The lawyer said he's in regular contact with officials at Banks' detention facility and that he's heard “nothing but praise for Mr. Banks' conduct” and his “commitment to his Muslim faith.”


	The judge still cited the phone issue when she issued her ruling. She said while the practice of using other inmates' phone accounts “might not be uncommon, it showed a disrespect for the rules, and that's precisely the court's concerns with regard to risk of flight.”


	In denying Banks' release, Donahue said the charges against the rapper “remain the most serious, as reflected in the potential punishment.” According to prosecutors, the indictment's charge of murder for hire resulting in death carries a mandatory minimum penalty of life in prison.


	Speaking after the hearing, Findling tells Rolling Stone he plans to appeal the bail decision. He says the “only” remaining fact-based allegation left in the indictment is an Aug. 18, 2022, text in which Banks purportedly told a co-conspirator: “Don't book no flights under no names involved wit me.” Prosecutors claim the text shows that Banks was trying to conceal his involvement in the movement of the alleged hitmen.

	











	“The superseding indictment is really only down to one specific fact. And it's an out-of-context text message,” Findling, a prominent lawyer known for representing NBA YoungBoy, Cardi B, and President Donald Trump, says. “It's just completely out of context. They don't know what the meaning of it was. And other than that, there's nothing that sets forth any direct evidence tying him to anything that's alleged in the indictment.”


	As Rolling Stone first reported back in December, Banks has denied since last year that he “sought to commercialize” the shooting at the center of the case. In the prior indictment, prosecutors alleged that Bank's song “Wonderful Wayne & Jackie Boy,” released in December 2022 with Babyface Ray, referenced Banks' alleged revenge on Bowman. In the song, Banks raps, “Look on the news and see your son, You screamin', ‘No, no.” Prosecutors claimed it was a reference to Bowman seeing Robinson's dead body. At the prior bond hearing on Dec. 12, 2024, Findling argued that the song was recorded months before the shooting. He offered a sworn declaration from the song's producer, Justin Gibson, supporting the point.

	“The proverbial smoking gun is that this incident takes place, and then months later, Mr. Banks puts out a song to celebrate it and commercialize it,” Findling told the court in December. “That song was recorded approximately eight months before that incident took place.… We have all the time stamps from the producer. This took place not in August 2022, when the [shooting] took place. This music was produced, these lyrics performed by my client approximately seven months before in January of 2022.”


	Findling and his co-counsel attacked the use of the lyrics in a prior motion to dismiss. Prosecutors then filed the second superseding indictment without any lyrics last week. A hearing on the dismissal motion is set for June 2.

Pour some coffee for our exclusive chat with the talented Scandinavian filmmaker, Victor Danell, as he talks about the influence of Spielberg, nostalgia, and the Swedish tradition of Fika.

When XYZ Films' Swedish sci-fi adventure movie "Watch the Skies" has its American debut on May 9, 2025, Hollywood and fans will also get a remarkable look at its AI-driven TrueSynch “visual dubbing” administered by the British startup firm Flawless AI.

This nostalgic feature film is set in 1996 and focuses on a small town teenage girl named Denise, whose father mysteriously vanished one night years ago while investigating a flying saucer sighting in the nearby forested hills. Determined to unravel the reality behind his disappearance, the feisty girl bonds with a group of antisocial enthusiasts at a local UFO club called UFO Sweden, who aid her in searching out the truth about her dad in true "The X-Files"-like fashion.

Directed by Victor Danell for his Crazy Pictures production shingle, "Watch the Skies" will be the first flick to demonstrate this immersive technology, where the film's original Swedish-speaking cast has re-recorded their lines in English for AI tools to match lip movements. Once foreign films leave their home territory, an immediate language barrier exists. This pioneering new AI technology of "visual dubbing" opens up a whole new way to release and introduce their Swedish film (and countless others) to a far wider audience and helps retain the actors' screen performances.

Part of the movie's originality and warmth comes from the natural inclusion of cultural customs unique to the Swedish people, and that means the obligatory communal sipping of coffee and munching on tarts.

"It's a traditional Swedish thing that we do called Fika, where you have kind of a coffee break," Danell explains to Space.com. "Especially in these types of volunteer associations, what you do is have meetings where you're drinking coffee and having Fika and eating buns and tarts. And that's something we wanted to bring into the movie, because it's a bunch of outsiders that want to solve this big mystery, but they also just want to be together having Fika, coffee, and tarts."



The misfit UFO cult that forms "Watch the Skies"' core is based on an actual flying saucer society in the country called UFO Sweden, giving the project an engaging authenticity.

"We all grew up in the '80s and '90s with these old-fashioned sci-fi movies as our base in our filmmaking," he adds regarding project influences. "Who doesn't love early Steven Spielberg and films like that? So we were inspired by those movies and we heard about this group in Sweden, a real association called UFO Sweden. We saw a documentary about them and knew we had to look them up. Are they for real? What we found out is that UFO Sweden is based in our hometown called Norrköping.

"Not only that, but their headquarters are across the street from my apartment. So we just went down the street and knocked on the door and asked if we could come in to learn about their work. So we all sat down for Swedish Fika and they told us that they're a UFO investigation group and if you see something in the sky you can call them and they'll help find out what you saw. They're gathering an archive of UFO sightings from around the world in their basement and it's the largest UFO archive in the world. They showed us around and when we left their headquarters we knew that this was our next movie. We just needed to find a story that could take these lovely guys out on an adventure larger than they usually went on."



"Watch the Skies" is imbued with a heartfelt reality even though its story is rooted in paranormal events, and its striking cinematography enhances a certain retro appeal.

"The cinematographer is Hannes Krantz, one of our partners in Crazy Pictures. Actually, I built the lenses for this movie myself. It's a mix of old Contex still photography lenses with the anamorphic block off an old projector combined together. It's kind of nerdy but the look of the movie is a big part of making the audience feel like this is an old nostalgic throwback to the ‘70s and ‘80s. It was hard work making that look.

"Sweden doesn't do a lot of genre movies. We went into this thinking it would be quite hard to make a Swedish science fiction movie. It actually wasn't. I think the Swedish audience also is ready for one so it went quite easily. But it's still hard to make a good sci-fi movie. We're so excited to see what will happen with this movie. We released it in Sweden and now it's coming out in the U.S. and we're so thrilled to see how it will go."

"Watch the Skies" stars Inez Dahl Torhaug, Eva Melander, Jesper Barkselius, Sara Shirpey, Håkan Ehn, Isabelle Kyed, Niklas Kvarnbo Jönsson, and Mathias Lithner.

A wild conspiracy theory has emerged from the depths of the internet, claiming that new Mountain Dew flavors have foretold deadly disasters across the US. 

The unusual claim comes from content creator Maverick Bailey, known for his unconventional takes, who believes major events have strangely coincided with the launch of certain Mountain Dew flavors.

'It seems like every time they make a big push with a new flavor, it correlates with a certain event,' Bailey said during a recent interview.

He pointed out that Star Spangled Splash was released in 2024, shortly before the collapse of the Francis Scott Key Bridge—its patriotic name eerily echoing the national symbolism of the event. 

Similarly, hit shelves just three months before 9/11, with theorists drawing a connection between the flavor's name and the emergency alert status that followed the attacks.

Bailey also connected other flavors to the Maui wildfires and the global CrowdStrike blackout that crippled millions of Windows devices last year.

Now, he's sounding the alarm over Mountain Dew's upcoming flavor, Baja Midnight, set to launch this summer.

'This new flavor could be referring to the Witching Hour, which is at 12:00,' Bailey shared in an Instagram video.

'My guess is that we are going to see something very weird, on a paranormal level, or something that is going to make us question everything.' He added that it could even signal a devastating cyber blackout.

Mountain Dew commented on Bailey's Instagram video discussing the wild theory, saying: 'Keep your voice down.' 

While Mountain Dew made a joke about the theory, there is no evidence to support any of Bailey's claims 

Bailey shared his latest update on The Maverick Files, where he outlined connections he's drawn between Mountain Dew flavors and major disasters. 

He pointed to Code Red that launched in May 2001, just months before the 9/11 attacks—an event widely referred to as a 'Code Red' emergency.

In 2019, Mountain Dew introduced Maui Burst, a pineapple-flavored soda. 

Bailey claims it foreshadowed the 2023 wildfires that devastated Maui.

While the devastating event happened in 2023, years after the flavor hit shelves, Bailey and other conspiracy theorists are sure there is a link.

A Facebook user shared an image showing a can of Maui Blast with the caption: 'No such thing as coincidence.

'It's not predictive programming. It's the script—they know it, write it, and implement it.'

On August 8, 2023, high winds and dry weather caused wildfires to develop in Lāhainā, Upper Kula, Upper Makawao and Olinda on the island of Maui.

These wildfires affected approximately 1,550 parcels and 2,200 structures and were one of the deadliest US wildfires in at least the past 100 years.

At least 201 people were confirmed dead as a result.

Bailey also linked the 2024 flavor Star Spangled Splash to the collapse of Baltimore's Francis Scott Key Bridge, noting that Key wrote the 'Star-Spangled Banner.' 

The patriotic theme, he suggests, is no accident.

On March 26, the ship suffered a power outage and crashed into one of the Key Bridge's support columns, causing the entire bridge to come down and killing six construction workers.

Mountain Dew reintroduced its Pitch Black in 2023 for a limited-time and made it exclusive in October 2024.

Bailey believes the flavor foretold the July 2024 CrowdStrike outage that caused widespread IT disruptions.

Bailey also believes Mountain Dew's Pitch Black predicted the CrowdStrike blackout, which affected more than eight million devices around the globe

He pointed out that Pitch Black, with its ominous name and dark branding, coincided eerily with what he called the 'biggest IT blackout of all time.'

The CrowdStrike blackout affected more than eight million devices around the globe, shutting down airlines, airports, public transit, healthcare and financial services.

Bailey's theory was discussed on the Sunday Cool podcast this month, which focuses on comedy and conspiracy theories.

The hosts, Josh Hooper and and Andy DeNoon, also highlighted that Mountain Dew is owned by Pepsi that worked with the CIA in the 1970s.

Worried that President Salvador Allende's socialist agenda could jeopardize PepsiCo's operations in Chile, then-chairman Donald Kendall contacted President Nixon directly. 

Following Kendall's requests, the CIA organized a plot to overthrow Allende, including providing arms to the Chilean opposition. 

'Does the CIA work with Pepsi?' Hooper asked during the podcast.

DeNoon replied: 'I think it is confirmed at this point.'

SCIENTISTS are studying a mysterious "UFO orb" which landed in Colombia and is said to be "alien".

Boffins released X-ray images of the mind-boggling sphere, after witnesses claimed to have seen it flying over the town of Buga in March.

It was said to have been zig-zagging through the skies in an unconventional flying pattern.

The "UFO sphere" was reportedly recovered shortly after landing.

It has since been analysed by scientists who have now revealed their groundbreaking research on the "extraterrestrial item".

They discovered that it featured three layers of metal-like material and 18 micro-spheres inside which surrounded a central nucleus.

Scientists are calling this core "a chip".

A radiologist who examined the sphere Dr Joe Luis Velazquez said that they found "no welds or joints", which usually indicate human production.

The scientist concluded: "It is of artificial origin, in that it shows no evidence of welding, and its internal structure is composed of high-density elements. 

"More testing is needed to establish its origin."

The mind-blowing object also displayed symbols that the team compared to ancient scripts. 

These included runes, Ogham and Mesopotamian writing systems.

The scientists used AI to help them decode the bizarre text.

They interpreted it as saying: "The origin of birth through union and energy in the cycle of transformation, meeting point of unity, expansion, and consciousness—individual consciousness."

The researchers said that they understood the text to be a "message to humanity, encouraging a collective shift in consciousness to help Mother Earth".

The object was recovered on March 2 by a group of people who said it weighed about four and a half pounds.

They described it as having "the temperature of a refrigerator" when they touched it.

One of the individuals who recovered the object David Velez el Potro said that the object was authentic, and claimed to have found it in the woods in Buga.

He also said the man who found and touched it, Jose, felt sick for days after touching the alien sphere.

Velez el Potro said: "When I poured water on it, it started to smoke and the water vaporised instantly."

There are yet to be any official reports or scientific analysis to confirm claims of a sphere falling over Buga - only eyewitness reports.

Velez el Potro added the government contacted him to hand over the sphere, but he refused, arguing that it would "never be seen again".

Researchers found that the sphere had irregular edges which indicated "that it is a solid object".

The outer layer was said to be the most dense area, almost possessing human bone density.

The breakthrough research suggests that the outer layer could be made of titanium or steel.

The ‘Night of the UFOs' is among many famous unexplained encounters with strange objects in the sky that have happened down the years.

Perhaps the most striking was a video known as the 'Tic-Tac' – which showed an unidentified object being pursued by fighter planes.

While flying off the coast of California 2004, two pilots from the USS Nimitz on a routine training mission spotted an object "shaped like a 40ft Tic Tac sweet".

Then in 2005, a veteran pilot of an F/A - 18 fighter aircraft witnessed a raft of strange objects in the sky during a training exercise off the coast of Florida.

The two videos were sensationally released by the Pentagon in 2017.

Tragically the pursuit of UFOs has also claimed lives, notably that of US Air Force Captain Thomas Mantell.

He died after being sent to chase a mysterious object in his fighter aircraft in 1948.

Other encounters with the air force include a claim that UFOs disabled weapons at a nuclear base.

Captain Robert Salas said the bizarre incident unfolded in 1967 while he was the on-duty commander of a secret underground launch control facility at Montana's Malmstrom Air Force Base.

US forces based in Britain also had an encounter with a strange glowing in the sky in Rendlesham Forest in Suffolk.

Two airmen, Staff Sgt Jim Penniston and Airman John Burroughs, claim they got so close to a triangular craft they actually touched it.

Earlier this year, US military documents were released showing how a warship was shadowed by two "ball of light" UFOs deepening the mystery around the case.

But the scientists still need a full composition analysis to confirm this.

The 18 smaller spheres within the object's centre appeared to be aligned in a non-randomised pattern.

Boffins are currently referring to the 18 points as "a chip" due to their precise arrangement and location within the spherical object.

The team also observed a central band composed of a different material, which contained more small spheres.



They think that these may have been placed inside before the object was sealed.

But the X-rays did not reveal any visible signs of assembly techniques by humans.

The Boys has been igniting rumors of a Supernatural reunion since Soldier Boy's inclusion in The Boys season 3, but now that they are confirmed, I'm amazed by how good it sounds. When I heard that Eric Kripke was behind Prime Video's seminal The Boys, I couldn't believe my luck. Kripke had secretly been one of TV's most hilarious writers and showrunners for decades, long before The Boys rose to prominence. In Supernatural, Kripke proved why he was perfect to tackle The Boys — and now he can bring both shows together.

Launching in 2005, Supernatural managed to run until 2020, presenting America's longest-running live-action fantasy TV show. The Boys appears to be adopting the opposite tactics, with Kripke putting a hard stop to it at the end of The Boys season 5. Knowing that The Boys was due to end in season 5, I was watching season 4 anxiously for a sign of the Supernatural reunion I've been longing for since Jensen Ackles joined the cast. Kripke finally confirmed that it will indeed be coming, and it's beyond my wildest dreams.

Kripke has confirmed to TV Insider that the Supernatural reunion of everyone's dreams will include not just Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki, but also Misha Collins. By the ending of The Boys season 4, it was starting to look like Ackles and Padalecki, who played Sam and Dean Winchester in Supernatural, might never reunite in The Boys. Some were even hoping for Collins to join the proceedings. Collins played Castiel, an angel who was the Winchesters' ally from Supernatural season 4 to its final, epic season, ending on November 19, 2020.

As if all the actors appearing in the same season of The Boys wasn't enough, having them share a story is bound to be epic.

Frenchie and Kimiko's hookup in The Boys was one of the highlights of the whole show, but I'm relieved to know that Kripke hasn't yet pulled all of his tricks out of his sleeve just yet. Kripke may have saved the coup de grâce to The Boys' competition for season 5, finally treating fans to a reunion between Ackles, Padalecki, and Collins in the same season — and in the "same frame" and "same storyline" as well. As if all the actors appearing in the same season of The Boys wasn't enough, having them share a story is bound to be epic.

In his interview with TV Insider, Kripke did not reveal the parts that Padalecki and Collins will play in The Boys season 4, but they will inevitably be wickedly appropriate. Ackles is incredible as Soldier Boy, and I can't wait to see his old chemistry with Padalecki and Collins fired back up. I'm even more intrigued to see which absurd subversion of American culture and superhero tropes Kripke will be pasting onto this trio. I hope the trio's roles in The Boys will somehow parallel their roles in Supernatural.

I can see Padalecki playing a supe opposite Ackles in The Boys.

If anyone is capable of performing such blatant fan service in a way that slots perfectly into the plot of season 5, it is Kripke. Soldier Boy's appearance in Gen V proved his ongoing importance to the overall The Boys franchise, so Kripke clearly has no intention of sidelining him in season 5. Ackles' role will get bigger, as it seems that Homelander may wake him up from his slumber. I can see Padalecki playing a supe opposite Ackles in The Boys, paralleling Ackles and Padalecki's partnership in Supernatural, before Padalecki is killed off in some hilarious way.

The Last of Us is back this week on HBO and Max with season 2, episode 5. Here's exactly when and how you can watch the show on TV or streaming.

Doctor Who's villain arcs are often clear and quick, but Russell T. Davies has really taken his time with this very minor character's development.

Jun-ho didn't have much to do after the beginning of Squid Game season 2, but he will now finally reach the island and confront his brother.

The Handmaid's Tale season 6, episode 7 has introduced an all-new character, and here's who she is and why she is so important to the show.

Piper ended up backing out of her original Thailand plans in The White Lotus season 3, which would have resembled a season 1 character's story.

A second season of Netflix's The Four Seasons could easily work thanks to the Tina Fey comedy show's big changes from the original movie.

As Doctor Who season 15 returned to Earth in episode 4, "Lucky Day", the series may have addressed why humans can never remember alien incursions.

The Boys has been igniting rumors of a Supernatural reunion since Soldier Boy's inclusion in The Boys season 3, but now that they are confirmed, I'm amazed by how good it sounds. When I heard that Eric Kripke was behind Prime Video's seminal The Boys, I couldn't believe my luck. Kripke had secretly been one of TV's most hilarious writers and showrunners for decades, long before The Boys rose to prominence. In Supernatural, Kripke proved why he was perfect to tackle The Boys — and now he can bring both shows together.

Launching in 2005, Supernatural managed to run until 2020, presenting America's longest-running live-action fantasy TV show. The Boys appears to be adopting the opposite tactics, with Kripke putting a hard stop to it at the end of The Boys season 5. Knowing that The Boys was due to end in season 5, I was watching season 4 anxiously for a sign of the Supernatural reunion I've been longing for since Jensen Ackles joined the cast. Kripke finally confirmed that it will indeed be coming, and it's beyond my wildest dreams.

Kripke has confirmed to TV Insider that the Supernatural reunion of everyone's dreams will include not just Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki, but also Misha Collins. By the ending of The Boys season 4, it was starting to look like Ackles and Padalecki, who played Sam and Dean Winchester in Supernatural, might never reunite in The Boys. Some were even hoping for Collins to join the proceedings. Collins played Castiel, an angel who was the Winchesters' ally from Supernatural season 4 to its final, epic season, ending on November 19, 2020.

As if all the actors appearing in the same season of The Boys wasn't enough, having them share a story is bound to be epic.

Frenchie and Kimiko's hookup in The Boys was one of the highlights of the whole show, but I'm relieved to know that Kripke hasn't yet pulled all of his tricks out of his sleeve just yet. Kripke may have saved the coup de grâce to The Boys' competition for season 5, finally treating fans to a reunion between Ackles, Padalecki, and Collins in the same season — and in the "same frame" and "same storyline" as well. As if all the actors appearing in the same season of The Boys wasn't enough, having them share a story is bound to be epic.

In his interview with TV Insider, Kripke did not reveal the parts that Padalecki and Collins will play in The Boys season 4, but they will inevitably be wickedly appropriate. Ackles is incredible as Soldier Boy, and I can't wait to see his old chemistry with Padalecki and Collins fired back up. I'm even more intrigued to see which absurd subversion of American culture and superhero tropes Kripke will be pasting onto this trio. I hope the trio's roles in The Boys will somehow parallel their roles in Supernatural.

I can see Padalecki playing a supe opposite Ackles in The Boys.

If anyone is capable of performing such blatant fan service in a way that slots perfectly into the plot of season 5, it is Kripke. Soldier Boy's appearance in Gen V proved his ongoing importance to the overall The Boys franchise, so Kripke clearly has no intention of sidelining him in season 5. Ackles' role will get bigger, as it seems that Homelander may wake him up from his slumber. I can see Padalecki playing a supe opposite Ackles in The Boys, paralleling Ackles and Padalecki's partnership in Supernatural, before Padalecki is killed off in some hilarious way.

With HBO's celebrated comedy series The Righteous Gemstones coming to an end, here's how all four seasons stack up against each other.

Andor season 2, episodes 7-9 is the best Star Wars story ever told, with strong action scenes, intense emotion, and brilliant performances.

The Handmaid's Tale season 6, episode 7 sees June come up with an all-new plan of attack, but it risks leading to the death of Nick Blaine.

The first episode of Poker Face season 2 features several new characters, primarily Cynthia Erivo in multiple roles, and the return of Charlie Cale.

The Lincoln Lawyer isn't just a great small-screen legal drama. The show warrants comparisons with some of the big-screen legal thrillers, too. 

Piper ended up backing out of her original Thailand plans in The White Lotus season 3, which would have resembled a season 1 character's story.

Blood of Zeus season 3 brings the Greek-inspired show to an end, wrapping up most storylines satisfyingly, though not without certain flaws.

The U.K. government is developing a program that seeks to identify murderers before they commit the ultimate crime. The real-world application of this type of tool will have devastating consequences.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Describing the horrors of communism under Stalin and others, Nobel laureate Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn wrote in his magnum opus, "The Gulag Archipelago," that "the line dividing good and evil cuts through the heart of every human being." Indeed, under the communist regime, citizens were removed from society before they could cause harm to it. This removal, which often entailed a trip to the labor camp from which many did not return, took place in a manner that deprived the accused of due process. In many cases, the mere suspicion or even hint that an act against the regime might occur was enough to earn a one way ticket with little to no recourse. The underlying premise here that the officials knew when someone might commit a transgression. In other words, law enforcement knew where that line lies in people's hearts.



The U.K. government has decided to chase this chimera by investing in a program that seeks to preemptively identify who might commit murder. Specifically, the project uses government and police data to profile people to "predict" who have a high likelihood to commit murder. Currently, the program is in its research stage, with similar programs being used for the context of making probation decisions.

Such a program that reduces individuals to data points carries enormous risks that might outweigh any gains. First, the output of such programs is not error free, meaning it might wrongly implicate people. Second, we will never know if a prediction was incorrect because there's no way of knowing if something doesn't happen — was a murder prevented, or would it never have taken place remains unanswerable? Third, the program can be misused by opportunistic actors to justify targeting people, especially minorities — the ability to do so is baked into a bureaucracy.

Consider: the basis of a bureaucratic state rests on its ability to reduce human beings to numbers. In doing so, it offers the advantages of efficiency and fairness — no one is supposed to get preferential treatment. Regardless of a person's status or income, the DMV (DVLA in the U.K.) would treat the application for a driver's license or its renewal the same way. But mistakes happen, and navigating the labyrinth of bureaucratic procedures to rectify them is no easy task.

In the age of algorithms and artificial intelligence (AI), this problem of accountability and recourse in case of errors has become far more pressing.

Mathematician Cathy O'Neil has documented cases of wrongful termination of school teachers because of poor scores as calculated by an AI algorithm. The algorithm, in turn, was fueled by what could be easily measured (e.g., test scores) rather than the effectiveness of teaching (a poor performing student improved significantly or how much teachers helped students in non quantifiable ways). The algorithm also glossed over whether grade inflation had occurred in the previous years. When the teachers questioned the authorities about the performance reviews that led to their dismissal, the explanation they received was in the form of "the math told us to do so" — even after authorities admitted that the underlying math was not 100% accurate.

If a potential future murderer is preemptively arrested, "Minority Report"-style, how can we know if the person may have decided on their own not to commit murder? 

As such, the use of algorithms creates what journalist Dan Davies calls an "accountability sink" — it strips accountability by ensuring that no one person or entity can be held responsible, and it prevents the person affected by a decision from being able to fix mistakes.

This creates a twofold problem: An algorithm's estimates can be flawed, and the algorithm does not update itself because no one is held accountable. No algorithm can be expected to be accurate all the time; it can be calibrated with new data. But this is an idealistic view that does not even hold true in science; scientists can resist updating a theory or schema, especially when they are heavily invested in it. And similarly and unsurprisingly, bureaucracies do not readily update their beliefs.

To use an algorithm in an attempt to predict who is at risk of committing murder is perplexing and unethical. Not only could it be inaccurate, but there's no way to know if the system was right. In other words, if a potential future murderer is preemptively arrested, "Minority Report"-style, how can we know if the person may have decided on their own not to commit murder? The UK government is yet to clarify how they intend to use the program other than stating that the research is being carried for the purposes of "preventing and detecting unlawful acts."



We're already seeing similar systems being used in the United States. In Louisiana, an algorithm called TIGER (short for "Targeted Interventions to Greater Enhance Re-entry") — predicts whether an inmate might commit a crime if released, which then serves as a basis for making parole decisions. Recently, a 70-year-old nearly blind inmate was denied parole because TIGER predicted he had a high risk of re-offending..

In another case that eventually went to the Wisconsin Supreme Court (State vs. Loomis), an algorithm was used to guide sentencing. Challenges to the sentence — including a request for access to the algorithm to determine how it reached its recommendation — were denied on grounds that the technology was proprietary. In essence, the technological opaqueness of the system was compounded in a way that potentially undermined due process.

Equally, if not more troublingly, the dataset underlying the program in the U.K. — initially dubbed the Homicide Prediction Project — consists of hundreds of thousands of people who never granted permission for their data to be used to train the system. Worse, the dataset — compiled using data from the Ministry, Greater Manchester Police of Justice, and the Police National Computer — contains personal data, including, but not limited to, information on addiction, mental health, disabilities, previous instances of self-harm, and whether they had been victims of a crime. Indicators such as gender and race are also included.

—Climate wars are approaching — and they will redefine global conflict

—'It is a dangerous strategy, and one for which we all may pay dearly': Dismantling USAID leaves the US more exposed to pandemics than ever

These variables naturally increase the likelihood of bias against ethnic minorities and other marginalized groups. So the algorithm's predictions may simply reflect policing choices of the past — predictive AI algorithms rely on statistical induction, so they project past (troubling) patterns in the data into the future.

In addition, the data overrepresents Black offenders from affluent areas as well as all ethnicities from deprived neighborhoods. Past studies show that AI algorithms that make predictions about behavior work less well for Black offenders than they do for other groups. Such findings do little to allay genuine fears that racial minority groups and other vulnerable groups will be unfairly targeted.

In his book, Solzhenitsyn informed the Western world of the horrors of a bureaucratic state grinding down its citizens in service of an ideal, with little regard for the lived experience of human beings. The state was almost always wrong (especially on moral grounds), but, of course, there was no mea culpa. Those who were wronged were simply collateral damage to be forgotten.

Now, half a century later, it is rather strange that a democracy like the U.K. is revisiting a horrific and failed project from an authoritarian Communist country as a way of "protecting the public." The public does need to be protected — not only from criminals but also from a "technopoly" that vastly overestimates the role of technology in building and maintaining a healthy society.

If you've ever cried during a medium's reading, you're not alone. And if you've ever cried during a courthouse wedding post, well—same hat, different tears.

Celebrity clairvoyant and former Kardashian spiritual consultant (yes, that's a job) Tyler Henry just announced that he's officially off the market, having married longtime partner Clint Godwin in what can only be described as a gay millennial's dream ceremony: low-key, high-love, and very Beverly Hills.

RELATED: Tyler Henry's Supernatural Abilities are Gay

With a single understated Instagram photo and the caption, “Today, we are married! Life with you is an endless sleepover with my best friend and life's just getting started,” Tyler delivered the soft-launch of a lifetime. And yes, in case you were wondering, the sleepover line made half the internet dissolve into a mist of feelings and glitter.

For anyone who's followed Tyler's journey—from emotional readings with Ricki Lake and Chrishell Stause to having the Kardashians on speed dial—it's touching (and a little poetic) that his most meaningful connection was never with a celebrity, but with someone who DM'd him after watching Keeping Up with the Kardashians. Real gay love in the time of reality TV.

“He had seen me on [Keeping Up With the Kardashians]. He messaged me and said that he'd be interested in a reading,” Tyler told GLAAD in 2022. But the moment they met, this wasn't just another booked session. “I knew the second I saw him that I had something that I needed to share with him regarding his grandfather, who had died.” That reading turned into a relationship, and that relationship turned into marriage. Honestly? Netflix could never.

Tyler added, “His grandfather had recently taken his own life. As I connected with him, I relayed exactly why that decision was made. Immediately, I found myself a part of his family, being immersed in what they were going through.” It's a heavy beginning for a love story—but it's also heartbreakingly beautiful. Because queer love often starts in the trenches and builds cathedrals out of shared grief, trust, and resilience.

While no public engagement was ever announced (psychics, they're just like us—secretive about proposals), Tyler told E! News back in 2019 that he'd likely be the one to propose. He didn't spill when or how, but we can only assume it involved candles, possibly crystals, and a sense of otherworldly knowing.

The newlyweds didn't opt for a Kardashian-scale spectacle (no Versace tuxedos or drones), but the intimacy of their courthouse ceremony was perfectly on-brand. The cake? Coconut-covered and topped with two little men, because if gay weddings have taught us anything, it's that dessert can be political.

The couple has been making us soft for years. On Valentine's Day, Tyler shared a photo of the two in wetsuits (the gayest beach uniform, no notes), writing: “We've grown up together and there's no one else I'd rather grow through time with. Whether I'm 29 or 92, this love will always be my guiding force, a reprieve from all of life's heaviness. That's what @clintxgodwin is for me.”

In March, Clint's birthday got another loving tribute: “Hurtling toward 30 isn't so bad with coconut cake and good company.” Who said psychics can't be poets?

As for the rest of us? We'll be here—ugly crying into our matcha lattes, scrolling back to their cake pic, and maybe DMing a psychic just in case our own love story is waiting in the stars… or the comment section.

What kind of wedding story makes your inner queer romantic scream-cry the most?

A Greek woman decided to divorce her husband of 12 years after ChatGPT told her he was having an affair, simply by “reading” the coffee grounds in his coffee cup.

OpenAI's ChatGPT chatbot is great for a lot of things, but it can ruin your life if you blindly put your trust in it. One Greek man recently appeared on the Greek TV morning show To Proino to complain about ChatGPT destroying his marriage by painting him as an adulterer simply by interpreting the coffee grounds in a cup of coffee he had posed with for his wife. Allegedly following a social media trend, the man's wife thought it would be fun to have the world's most popular chatbot “read” their coffee cups in a sort of modern twist on the art of tasseography. She made coffee for both of them and then uploaded photos of the grounds in their cups for ChatGPT to “read”. The chatbot claimed that the woman's husband was having an affair with another woman, which made his wife furious enough to file for divorce without even asking him if it was true.

“I laughed it off as nonsense,” the husband said on the show. “But she took it seriously. She asked me to leave, told our kids we were getting divorced, and then I got a call from a lawyer. That's when I realized this wasn't just a phase.”

According to ChatGPT, the man was fantasizing about a mysterious woman whose name started with the initial “E”,  and with whom he was destined to begin a relationship. To make matters worse, the chatbot's interpretation of the wife's coffee cup revealed that her spouse was already cheating and that this mystery woman was hell-bent on destroying their family.

After he refused to agree to a separation, the poor husband was served divorce papers just three days later. However, his lawyer warned that they would contest the divorce actions because the claims made by an AI chatbot have no legal standing, and his client was innocent until proven guilty.

Apparently, the woman is very sensitive to divinatory practices. The husband said that a few years ago, she visited an astrologer and became obsessed with astrology. “It took a whole year for her to accept that none of it was real,” the man said.

After the bizarre divorce case went viral in Greece, seasoned tasseography practitioners explained that reading into a cup of coffee involves more than the grounds. Masters of the trade also analyze the foam and the saucer, and ChatGPT is definitely not a master.

In this age of info war, it is becoming increasingly difficult to know what the reality is on the India-Pakistan front. In a sense, the disinformation war that was seen during the war in Ukraine is being replicated now in the ongoing drone/missile war between India and Pakistan over the last three days.

If you watch the Indian television news channels, India is winning the war overwhelmingly by attacking all parts of Pakistan. But if you read the social media of Pakistan (as one cannot see their news channels in India), then Pakistan has already attained a massive victory over India by not only foiling the Indian attacks but also destroying its military installations in Punjab and Jammu and Kashmir and shooting down highly expensive fighter planes like Rafale and Su-30.

According to a dispassionate and respected source, India is more systematic in the ongoing disinformation war than Pakistan.

While New Delhi has ensured that Pakistani channels are not easily accessible to Indians, it is deliberately feeding all misinformation to Indian news channels that are watched by millions of Pakistanis. The idea is to inject elements of fear among the Pakistanis.

Interestingly, while Pakistan has banned many things Indian, including films, it has not done so effectively as far as Indian news channels are concerned.

There is a theory that the Pakistani establishment needs Indian news channels the most when it launches a terrorist attack or wages limited wars against India.

Both during the Kargil war and the attacks on Mumbai, the Pakistani handlers were getting all the information about what the Indian security forces were planning and how they were fighting the terrorists/aggressors on the ground, thanks to the hyperactive Indian news channels and journalists.

Of course, now the Indian authorities have curtailed the easy access that the Indian news channels had those days when operations were on. But Pakistanis still think that the Indian channels are sources of authentic information.

And this being the case, in the ongoing artillery exchanges between the two countries, the military leadership in India is deliberately feeding misinformation to the Pakistanis, the argument goes.

Therefore, nobody can be sure what India is doing or will do.

For instance, Indian media has been flashing reports about JF-17 shootdown, capturing F-16 pilot, hunting Pakistan's AWACS, bombing Karachi port, etc. Some even claimed seizing Pakistan's capital, Islamabad, and some reported the arrest of General Asif Munir!

This could well be an Indian strategy to unnerve Pakistan and pressure its ‘rogue' military.

This big question still remains: “How should India deal with Pakistan?” So far, the standard Indian policy towards Islamabad is that “ a stable and secure Pakistan is in India's national interest.”

It is now time to revisit that policy.

Let us point out some hard facts about Pakistan. First, it is meaningless for India to talk to any civilian leader of Pakistan. The ultimate decision-maker in Pakistan, as far as India is concerned, happens to be the Army Chief.

Therefore, if there is to be any breakthrough in the India-Pakistan impasse, New Delhi should insist that the Pakistani Army Chief, Asim Munir, be directly involved in the talks.

Let us not forget that Pakistan is essentially an “Army with a country”.

Secondly, unlike China, which is and can be India's rival and partner simultaneously, Pakistan will always behave as India's enemy. Come what may, it will continue to promote jihad in Kashmir and other parts of India.

Indeed, it is a huge myth that Pakistan will shed its hostility to India if the Kashmir issue is resolved on Islamabad's terms. Even if Kashmir joins Pakistan, Islamabad will find another issue to trouble India.

This is because Pakistan's antipathy towards India is deep-rooted. Pakistan's very existence as an entity depends on hostility towards India. Take India away, and Pakistan's justification as a separate country on the map of the world will hold no water.

And this explains why the Pakistan Army promotes fundamentalist mullahs in the country and uses them in tirades against India through terrorist organisations like the LeT. Their fundamentalist Wahhabi Islam negates the Sufi tradition that promoted Hindu-Muslim amity and coexistence in the subcontinent for centuries.

So much so that many Pakistanis now suffer from some identity crisis — they are not sure whether they should retain their age-old cultural roots (that are influenced by Hinduism) or develop totally new “Arab identities”.

It is increasingly becoming obvious that General Munir is the most communal Army Chief after Zia-ul Haq. It is he who orchestrated the latest terror attack on India at Pahalgam.

Just days before that dastardly attack, General Munir had boasted of how Pakistan has a “superior ideology and culture” than that of India and how “our forefathers thought that we are different from the Hindus in every aspect of life. Our religions, our customs, traditions, thoughts, and ambitions are different. That was the foundation of the two-nation theory that was laid.”

It is true that Pakistan was created as “a state for Muslims”. But for the likes of General Munir and hardliner Mullahs, Pakistan is an “Islamic state”. For them, India is an eternal enemy, and the very identity of Pakistan is based on hatred and animosity towards India. And they seem to be increasingly dominant in Pakistan's political and public discourse.

Not long ago, in one of his judgments, Pakistan's former Chief Justice Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry reportedly asked, “Should we accept if tomorrow Parliament declares secularism, and not Islam, as the state policy?” Another judge asked, “Will it be called a rightful exercise of authority if tomorrow parliament amends Article 2 of the constitution, which states that Islam will be the state religion?”

However, this most unfortunate trend is spreading among the Pakistani intelligentsia as well. For instance, Majid Nizami, editor-in-chief of The Nation, one of Pakistan's leading newspapers, had once written that “Pakistan is destined to defeat India because our horses in the form of atomic bombs and missiles are far better than Indian ‘donkeys.'

According to him, “if one wants to have an idea as to what would have been our condition, had Pakistan not come into existence, he should visit India to apprise himself about the untold pathetic living conditions of the Muslims there at this point of time.”

Nizami added, “We were grateful to the Almighty Allah that today we had been blessed with Independence. The day is not far off when we would once again conquer India.”

If one goes by the history books written for students in Pakistan, the intensity of the anti-India venom and the ferocity with which it is being injected into young minds are mind-blowing. They are taught that  “Previously, India was part of Pakistan.”

In these books, Muhammad bin Qasim, the first Muslim conqueror of the Hindu-dominated Sindh province in the 8th century, is declared the first Pakistani citizen. In Social Studies for Class VI (Sindh Textbook Board, 1997), the story of the Arabs' arrival in Sindh is counted as the first moment of Pakistan, with the glorious ascendancy of Islam.

This textbook teaches that “The Muslims knew that the people of South Asia were infidels and they kept thousands of idols in their temples.” The Sindhi king, Raja Dahir, is described as cruel and despotic. “The non-Brahmans who were tired of the cruelties of Raja Dahir joined hands with Muhammad bin Qasim because of his good treatment.”

According to this historical narration, “Pakistan came to be established for the first time when the Arabs led by Muhammad-bin-Qasim occupied Sindh and Multan in the early years of the eighth century, and established Muslim rule in this part of the South Asian subcontinent. Pakistan under the Arabs comprised the Lower Indus Valley.”

It is interesting to note the flight of imagination of this author: “During the 11th century, the Ghaznavid Empire comprised what is now Pakistan and Afghanistan. During the 12th century, the Ghaznavids lost Afghanistan, and their rule came to be confined to Pakistan…By the 13th century, Pakistan had spread to include the whole of Northern India and Bengal…Under the Khiljis, Pakistan moved further southward to include a greater part of Central India and the Deccan… Many Mongols accepted Islam. As such, Pakistan remained safe for Islam… During the 16th century, ‘Hindustan' disappeared and was completely absorbed in ‘Pakistan'…Although Pakistan was created in August 1947, yet except for its name, the present-day Pakistan has existed, as a more or less single entity, for centuries.”

Interestingly, Pakistani students are being taught that though Akbar was a great Mughal ruler, Islam declined during his rule as he was influenced by the Bhakti movement that began during the Sultanate period and propounded Hindu-Muslim unity. They are also taught that the glory of Islam was at its best during the reign of Aurangzeb, displaying “the Pakistan spirit.”

Thus, systematic attempts are being made by the Pakistani government to brainwash the students in schools and universities that there are irreconcilable differences between the Hindus and Muslims and that they, with their diametrically opposed world views and interests, could not have stayed together in an undivided country that India was until 1947.

In fact, Pakistan's National Education Policy of Pakistan clearly says that the curricula should be specifically designed to “inculcate among the students the sense of gratitude to Almighty Allah”, to “promote the unity of Muslim Ummah in the world”, to “develop and practice the spirit of the ideology of Pakistan and Islam”, and to “inculcate a strong sense of gratitude to Almighty Allah for his blessings providing us an independent state”.

With such tendentious imaginings against India being legitimised by the successive governments in Pakistan, the Muslims there are forgetting the centuries-old tradition of pluralism that enriched the subcontinent, giving rise to many faiths and religions, including Sufism that guided them. Unless this entrenched anti-India mindset of the Pakistanis is changed, India will remain their eternal enemy.

Erosion of Indian power, dismemberment of its territories, and consolidation of an anti-India geostrategic nexus are Pakistan's predominant strategic goals.

Pakistan's war against India is no longer confined to Kashmir. Pakistan wants to Balkanise India by cutting off the country's northern, eastern (North-East), and southern (Kerala) wings.

In fact, Mushahid Hussain, once a former information minister under Nawaz Sharif, has argued that Pakistan should work towards dividing India into three or four independent countries. Simultaneously, Pakistan's ISI machinery will concentrate on widening the Hindu-Muslim divide, spreading hatred, and destroying India's inherent ethos of communal harmony.

This being the case, India needs to reappraise its fundamental policy towards Pakistan. Fortunately, India has a Prime Minister in Narendra Modi, who hails from the south of Vindya and can think rationally about Pakistan.

It may be recalled that WikiLeaks documents revealed how the then Indian national security advisor M K Narayanan had once indicated to his American interlocutors, and that too, in the presence of the then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, that persons living in the south of Vindhyas were better placed to frame India's policy towards Pakistan. One sees some merits in that argument.

Invariably, we have seen that leaders hailing from North India, including those who were born in what is today Pakistan, are often more emotional rather than rational when dealing with Pakistan.

No wonder Prime Ministers like Manmohan Singh, I K Gujral, or, for that matter, even Atal Behari Vajpayee always found virtues in Pakistani leaders' India-related “statements” by overlooking their India-related “activities.”

Pakistan needs to be handled realistically, not emotionally, by India. Modi seems to have initiated this process by suspending the Indus-Water treaty, arguably one of the most unequal treaties in the world. Bringing back the Pakistan-occupied Kashmir to the Indian national mainstream should at least be the logical corollary.

Batman is widely praised and well-known in the modern age as one of DC Comics' more grounded heroes. Blending the inherent fantasy of superheroes with grittier crime-noir elements makes for a winning combination, but James Gunn's DC Universe paves the way for more. Alongside co-CEO Peter Safran, the DCU, kicking off theatrically with this summer's Superman, is already promising sci-fi and fantasy aspects.

What works for one character doesn't necessarily mean it will work for another, but there are plenty of ways the supernatural can be introduced in the DCU Batman's world. This is abundantly evident by looking at the Caped Crusader's extensive comic book history. With stories set in the hero's early days, like Batman and the Mad Monk, and mind-bending thrillers like R.I.P., there are plenty of Batman comics the DCU could borrow from.

While Dick Grayson's star continued to rise as Nightwing, hos start as the first Robin has been wonderfully explored in a few amazing Batman comics.

One of the '00s most interesting Batman comic miniseries was Matt Wagner's Dark Moon Rising. This was broken into two story arcs, each remaking Golden Age comics to fit within the then-new mainline canon. Batman and the Mad Monk is one such arc, fleshing out one of the Dark Detective's earliest supernatural encounters. The fresh-faced vigilante finds himself investigating a string of ruthless killings from a vampiric cult. Telling Batman stories focusing on his early years is likely something the DCU (at least in film) should avoid, given earlier theatrical adaptations.

However, seeing the hero to be introduced in Andy Muschietti's The Brave and the Bold go up against a similar supernatural threat creates an enticing premise. It wouldn't need to be in his DCU debut movie, but a shadowy group of villains like this organically weaves in the otherworldly of DC's world into Batman's sandbox. This eases audiences into the DCU's different tone compared to The Dark Knight Trilogy or The Batman while using the detective theme and darker atmosphere to feel familiar enough.

Considering that the upcoming The Brave and the Bold will focus on Bruce Wayne as Batman and his biological son, Damian, as Robin, Birth of the Demon could provide great inspiration. Iconic Batman writer Dennis O'Neil and artist Norm Breyfogle created this one-shot comic to expand on the origin story for Batman villain Ra's al Ghul—Damian Wayne's eventual grandfather. Readers are shown the beginnings of the Head of the Demon's story 600 years earlier, while the hero attempts to destroy the Lazarus Pits he uses to rejuvenate himself.

Whatever way The Brave and the Bold develops story-wise, it's hard to imagine the DCU's iteration of Batman won't have a narrative connection to his son's grandfather or mother, Talia al Ghul. Borrowing from O'Neil and Breyfogle's Birth of the Demon would be an elegant way to weave in Ra's' origins tastefully through flashbacks in a present-day story. As the DCU will inherently have fantastical elements, this could be a chance to introduce the supernatural elements of Ra's al Ghul's lore rather than the grounded interpretation from Batman Begins.

While something like Arkham Asylum: A Serious House on Serious Earth is more akin to a psychological horror movie, there are certainly elements capable of being adapted to the DCU. James Gunn has made a point to champion this DC cinematic universe for exploring different stories, tones, and corners of the world. With that stipulation, legendary Batman writer Grant Morrison and artist Dave McKean's surrealist Arkham Asylum comic presents a wealth of opportunities.

The Dark Knight is called in to end a violent riot at Arkham that devolves into a gruesome exploration of the hero's rogues, the bloody origins of the asylum, and introspection on Batman's part. The nature of the setting alone paves the way for introducing several larger-than-life villains, and even the plot could inspire a claustrophobic thriller. However, a DCU Batman film adopting the supernatural elements of Morrison's story in a similar way to Rocksteady's Arkham Asylum video game would be more tonally fitting for a PG-13 blockbuster movie.

For recent comics from the pages of DC's mainline Batman titles, Ram V's Gotham Nocturne is an engrossing odyssey. The storyline fits well within the mainline DC canon while telling a solid standalone story in its own right. This arc is sparked by an unmistakable and unshakable sense of dread that slowly creeps into Bruce Wayne's mind. It's soon revealed to have roots in a darker, supernatural conspiracy with ties to an ancient house.

Batman's origins are rooted in the Crime-Noir genre, and the iconic DC Comics character has starred in quite a few stories to appeal to the same fans.

Ram V tells a tantalizing and slow-burning saga in Gotham Nocturne ​​​​​​that effortlessly makes its fantasy feel at home in Batman's world. With at least one aspect of the Ra's al Ghul family confirmed to debut in Brave and the Bold—Damian Wayne—the DCU could flesh out this side of Batman's rogues gallery to include their ties to the mysterious Orgham family. Gotham Nocturne has a moody atmosphere that's fundamentally Batman enough to feel familiar to moviegoing audiences. At the same time, this Detective Comics arc uses its premise to give it a distinctly gothic, operatic, and dark fantasy flair.

Matt Wagner's The Mad Monk ​​​​​​remakes and chronicles the hero's first clash with magical, cultish foes. But in Batman and the Monster Men, the writer and artist reimagined his first encounter with Dr. Hugo Strange and the metahuman-level enemies he paves the way for. This early-years vigilante faces the combined threat of Gotham's seedy underworld and super-powered threats when mobster Sal Maroni funds Strange's cruel experiments on Arkham inmates.

Batman and the Monster Men is another tasteful modernization of a Golden Age comic. It perfectly captures the pulpy, crime-noir atmosphere of the plot and setting while making the fantasy fit seamlessly. This combination feels right for a DCU movie, as it contains the gloomy tone most fans appreciate from the Dark Knight's world while fashioning it with an almost Dr. Frankenstein-style whimsy. Strange is another rogue who would be a perfect fit for Matt Reeves' world, but the genetic experiment angle can justify its place in the DCU.

Many fans know the sinister Court of Owls villains from their debut in writer Scott Snyder and artist Greg Capullo's Batman ​​​​​​run. They added an exciting new dimension to Gotham City's history, but Christian Ward's City of Madness ​​​​​​gives them a new twist. The writer and artist's DC Black Label Batman series depicts the Court as the guardians of an ominous door beneath the city, and they turn to the Dark Knight when something creeps in.

City of Madness is a brilliant take on Batman's mythos and the Court of Owls' place in it from a cosmic horror perspective. It even combines a more vibrant art direction with the surrealism of McKean's Arkham Asylum ​​​​​​artwork. Ironically, the Court could fit well into director Matt Reeves' The Batman's "Elseworld" canon. However, the way City of Madness cleverly toys with more abstract supernatural ideas could fuel the premise of a DCU Batman movie. A similar concept could be a bold way to connect a live-action Court to the cosmic elements of the character's lore rather than a grounded crime syndicate.

Even concerning the World's Greatest Detective's street-level affairs, talented DC Comics writers find ways to let ominous, supernatural forces creep in. Peter Milligan and Kieron Dwyer's brief Dark Knight, Dark City arc does precisely that to shocking effects. This storyline sees Riddler sink to sinister new lows in an attempt to drive Batman to madness, using demonic forces as his weapon.

It would be somewhat poetic to take inspiration from Dark Knight, Dark City to introduce the supernatural to audiences unaccustomed to the supernatural in Batman's world. The Dark Detective isn't a stranger to sci-fi and fantasy elements, even before this. Even so, this arc is notable for directly incorporating occult, dark fantasy elements into Batman's mythos and backstory. The obvious caveat would be the repeated use of Riddler after Paul Dano's recent excellent take in The Batman, but the hero's deep bench of villains could find a suitable replacement in a movie following a vaguely similar plot.

DC Studios co-CEO James Gunn made it clear that Grant Morrison's influence is already baked into his DCU plans. Their work on All-Star Superman with artist Frank Quitely will be felt in Gunn's upcoming movie, and their epic Batman run will inspire Brave and the Bold. Beyond that, Morrison, DC Animated Universe writer Paul Dini, and more's Resurrection of Ra's al Ghul has the potential to be a DCU event and introduce the Dark Knight to the supernatural. The Demon's Head threatens the world again with his presence and ties into Damian's significant role in the Bat-Family.

Batman is often considered a loner, though he has gathered a close family of both biological and adopted children from across DC's entire multiverse.

The Resurrection of Ra's al Ghul has the narrative scope to justify a Batman crossover movie in the DCU, especially with Brave and the Bold ​​​​​​set to explore the supporting cast in his extended family, namely, Damian. Moreover, a loose movie adaptation could combine elements of Birth of the Demon and Resurrection. A climactic event film could dive into the villain's backstory, reveal how he's lived for centuries, and introduce the fantasy of the Lazarus Pit.

Alongside artist Tony Daniel, Grant Morrison's R.I.P. is the climax of act one of their Dark Knight odyssey, as the seedy Black Glove organization executes a meticulous scheme to tear the hero apart physically and psychologically. The syndicate attempts to strike at the core of what makes Bruce Wayne function as a man and Gotham's symbol. R.I.P. easily leaves a permanent mark on what makes the character so celebrated in the modern era of superheroes, championing the hero's indomitable spirit.

Brave and the Bold will pull from Morrison's Batman and Son and Batman and Robin, so the groundwork could be laid for a loose R.I.P. adaptation. It would make a rousing sequel and event film that combines Batman storytelling approaches from mystery to supernatural thrillers, thanks to the enigmatic Dr. Simon Hurt, who seemingly has occult roots in Gotham's history. The campy Bat-Mite and Bruce's Zur-En-Arrh personality are likely out of the question, but between R.I.P.'s Black Glove and Hurt's potential roots in demonology, there's room for a DCU movie to be dark and zany simultaneously.

There are certainly ways the pulpy, more realistic version of the first Clayface could cause problems for Robert Pattinson's Dark Detective. But to embrace the character's "creature feature" elements, One Bad Day: Clayface ​​​​​​is the perfect template for not only crossing paths against the DCU's Batman, but also his upcoming solo movie. This one-shot comic takes a Killing Joke-like approach to the villain, exploring how Basil Karlo attempts to forge a new identity for himself away from Gotham—and how he psychologically unravels at the seams.

One Bad Day: Clayface excels as a harrowing character profile of a tragic villain who's far more nuanced than his monstrous form would suggest. Director James Watkins is directing a Clayface movie written by Mike Flanagan for the DCU, and pulling from Collin Kelly, Jackson Lanzing, and Xermánico's short but impactful comic couldn't be more appropriate. Whether the filmmakers opt for an antihero or villainous approach, it lends itself beautifully to a body-horror-fueled movie delving into meta themes of self-obsession and Hollywood vanity.

Batman is one of the oldest comic superheroes, with nearly a century of comics, TV-shows, films, and video games. The mild-mannered Bruce Wayne becomes Gotham City's caped crusader, protecting it from villains like The Joker, Killer Croc, The Penguin, and more. Batman is also one of DC comics' "Big Three" alongside Superman and Wonder Woman, and together the three help keep the earth safe as founding members of the Justice League. 

Get ready for a brand new DC experience! The DC Universe (DCU) is coming soon, bringing together familiar comic book heroes in a connected storyline across movies, TV shows, animation, and even video games. It is an upcoming American media franchise and shared universe based on characters from DC Comics publications.

The Vatican has been buzzing with the news that Cardinal Robert Francis Prevost is the newly elected Pope Leo XIV, sparking debates about the influence of affluent MAGA Catholics on this crucial choice.

On May 8, it was officially declared by the Vatican that Cardinal Prevost will take up the papal mantle following the passing of Pope Francis last month.

Originating from Chicago, 69-year-old Cardinal Prevost's election is a momentous occasion as he becomes the first American to head the worldwide Catholic Church and its roughly 1.4 billion adherents, reports Daily Express US.

US President Donald Trump wasted no time in offering his congratulations to the new Pope on Truth Social, stating, "Congratulations to Cardinal Robert Francis Prevost, who was just named Pope."

Trump added with evident excitement, "It is such an honor to realize that he is the first American Pope. What excitement, and what a Great Honor for our Country. I look forward to meeting Pope Leo XIV. It will be a very meaningful moment!"

Yet amidst the fanfare, there are lingering doubts; writer Gareth More suggested possible clandestine maneuvers in his piece published two days earlier, on May 6 - before the Conclave's decision on Leo XIV.

More referred to a significant photo showing Cardinal Juan Luis Cipriani Thorne, 81, paying respects next to the open casket of Pope Francis before the funeral.

The scandal broke out as Cipriani, clad in cardinal attire - a direct defiance of Francis' ban due to allegations of sexually abusing a minor in 1983 - showed no signs of remorse. The 81-year-old, who is Opus Dei's first cardinal, represents a conservative stronghold within the Catholic Church that is accused of exerting significant influence.

More weighed in on the controversy, stating: "Ultra-conservatives have spent the last 12 years quietly – and sometimes not so quietly – seething at Pope Francis' progressivism and his attempts to open up the Church."

His analysis of Cipriani's bold move suggests turmoil ahead for the Vatican hierarchy.

"They have longed for a return to tradition and have been emboldened in recent years by a resurgence in support for right-wing, traditionalist political parties across the globe. The time is ripe for a MAGA-style papacy, they argue," More asserted.

However, More is not the only one expressing concerns about the upcoming Papal conclave. American news program The Young Turks released a video on May 7, entitled MAGA lobbies Vatican with lavish gifts to pick the 'right' Pope.

Reporter Yasmin Khan provided insights into the Papal Foundation, an exclusive Catholic nonprofit with a steep membership fee, sharing details from a recent gathering in Rome.

Khan reported: "One guest did tell reporters, this room could raise a billion to help the church so long as we have the right Pope. "

Recently in Rome, the NAPA Institute, described as a Catholic group with ties to the MAGA movement by the Daily Beast, made an appearance.

Its members attended a dinner at the prestigious Pontifical University of St. Thomas Aquinas, also referred to as the Angelicum or Collegio Angelico.

During the event, Tim Busch, the institute's founder, treated cardinals to wine bottles valued at up to $125.

Busch has previously lauded the Trump administration as "the most Christian" he's ever encountered, despite President Trump himself admitting to a deficiency in "charity."
