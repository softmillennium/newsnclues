                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The FLSA is a federal law that regulates misclassification of employees as independent contractors and unpaid wages. TechCrunch first reported that Scale was the subject of such an investigation in March. Upwork and Hireart, two of Scale AI's HR partners that were also being investigated for FLSA compliance per Inc. magazine, are also no longer being investigated by the DOL, they each confirmed to TechCrunch. Scale AI, which was valued last year at $13.8 billion, depends on an army of workers it categorizes as contractors to do critical AI work, like labeling images for Big Tech. However, Scale has been sued by ex-workers alleging they were underpaid and misclassified as contractors instead of employees, denying them access to benefits like sick leave. Meanwhile, Scale AI's former managing director Michael Kratsios was confirmed in March as the new director of the White House's Office of Science and Technology Policy.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>San Francisco's widely relied upon public transportation system, Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART), went down early Friday morning due to a “computer networking problem,” according to city officials. The outage brought the entire system to a halt at around 5:00 am local time, forcing commuters to quickly find an alternative travel plan. BART officials announced that service had been restored across the entire system around 9:30 am local time, though a spokesperson for the agency told The San Francisco Standard, “Riders should expect residual major delays as we ramp back up.” The system's shutdown, while temporary, caused a considerable number of logistical issues for riders. With BART out of order, riders were forced to shift their commute to buses, ride shares, and other alternatives. To accommodate the travelers stranded by BART, the San Francisco Municipal Railway offered additional buses and extra trains on some lines. The cause of the outage is still unclear, but a spokesperson for BART did further explain what happened to the SF Standard: “BART was unable to properly power up our train control system, which prevented us from safely operating trains,” the spokesperson said. Instead, she said there were “a lot of different reasons” that could cause the issue. Outages have gotten rarer in recent years for BART, according to the agency's own data, but delays have remained a major problem. The transport system has undergone cost-cutting measures, as well, which has led to some issues going unaddressed and a hiring freeze being put in place, though the city has spent on increasing police presence on the transit system and new methods for cracking down on unpaid fares.

Sign up here for free — just click TechCrunch Mobility! Remember last week when Aurora met a major milestone — just squeaking by under its own deadline — and launched a driverless self-driving truck service? Welp, this week Aurora made headlines again, but for a surprising change in leadership. Co-founder Sterling Anderson, who has been chief product officer, is resigning from his position and the board. No real word on what prompted his resignation, beyond some comments he made during the company's Q1 earnings call. “Leaving Aurora is one of the most difficult decisions I've ever made, especially given the exciting stage Aurora is at,” he said. He didn't say exactly where he was going, either, except that it will be an “exciting external opportunity in a senior leadership role at an iconic global company.” The company announced during its earnings call that it will start sending its self-driving trucks out at night and during adverse weather conditions like rain or heavy wind by the second half of 2025. It's not every day a public company reverses course and goes private. Especially for any company caught up in the U.S.-China trade war. Bosch Ventures has a new $270 million fund that will continue its tradition of investing in deep tech startups. Managing director Ingo Ramesohl told TechCrunch the plan is to put more of its money into North American startups. Investors who previously backed Indian Uber rival BluSmart have proposed a plan to inject another $30 million into the struggling cab-hailing startup, which abruptly halted operations last month. DoorDash announced two major acquisitions as it expands into Europe. Meanwhile, Uber was busy this week, acquiring companies and investing in them. Uber increased its investment into Chinese autonomous vehicle company WeRide by $100 million as part of an expanded partnership deal to bring the service to another 15 cities over the next five years. Mo Elshenawy, the former president and CTO of now-shuttered self-driving car company Cruise, was just named the chief technology officer at telehealth and wellness company Hims & Hers. I spoke to Hims & Hers co-founder and CEO Andrew Dudum, and he said he specifically focused on the AV industry to find the next CTO. Nuro has started testing its AV tech on the Las Vegas Strip. I recently sat down with co-founder and president Dave Ferguson. Stay tuned for an update on why the company shifted its business model. Tesla‘s “Robotaxi” and “Cybercab” trademarks have hit a few roadblocks. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office denied Tesla's attempt to trademark the term “Robotaxi” in reference to its vehicles because it's too generic. Uber locked up partnerships with three Chinese autonomous vehicle companies — Pony AI, Momenta, and WeRide — in a bid to gobble up robotaxi market share in the Middle East and Europe. Footnote: These deals are not to operate in China. Waymo announced it has a new 239,000-square-foot factory in the Phoenix suburb of Mesa through a deal with Magna to build more than 2,000 autonomous Jaguar I-Pace vehicles. But I was most interested in finally learning the size of Waymo's existing commercial fleet, which is now 1,500. Now it's Virgin Group founder Sir Richard Branson's turn. He had some interesting comments about the company's end-to-end approach and Tesla's Elon Musk. And, well, I don't think we'll be able to buff it out. Ford and General Motors pulled their guidance for the year, citing economic uncertainty related to Trump's tariffs. Meanwhile, Rivian said it will likely deliver fewer vehicles this year (40,000 to 46,000 EVs) than previously forecasted due to tariffs and other regulatory changes. There was some good news for Rivian, though: It generated gross profit (yeah I know, gross profit isn't exactly my fave, either). But this met a contractual milestone that unlocked about $1 billion in funding from Volkswagen Group as part of a joint venture with the German automaker. Lucid Motors has been working through some quality “hiccups” in the early stages of delivering its long-awaited electric Gravity SUV. The electric vertical takeoff and landing startup-turned-SPAC was targeting 2025, then was stating “early 2026.” Now it's just 2026, which suggests it might not be early next year.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>United States Customs and Border Protection plans to log every person leaving the country by vehicle by taking photos at border crossings of every passenger and matching their faces to their passports, visas, or travel documents, WIRED has learned. Turner could not provide a timeline on when CBP would begin monitoring people leaving the country by vehicle. She tells WIRED that CBP currently matches photos of people coming into the country with “all documented photos, i.e., passports, visas, green cards, etc,” and adds that all “alien/non-US citizens encounter photos taken at border crossing” are stored by CBP. “The encounter photos can be used for subsequent crossings to verify identity,” Turner says. She did not specify whether CBP may integrate additional photos or data sources in the future. When asked, Turner says it's not currently evident that a purpose of the outbound face-matching system would be tracking self-deporations. WIRED reported this week that CBP recently asked tech companies to send pitches on how they would ensure every single person entering the country by vehicle, including people two or three rows back, would be instantly photographed and matched with their travel documents. CBP has struggled to do this on its own. Currently, neither CBP nor Immigration and Customs Enforcement have any publicly known tools for tracking self-deportations, aside from an ICE app that allows people to tell the agency when they leave the country. Last month, ICE announced that it is paying the software company Palantir $30 million to build a tool called ImmigrationOS that would give the agency “near real-time visibility” on people self-deporting from the US, with the goal of having accurate numbers on how many people are doing so, according to a contract justification published a few days later. When asked, CBP would not confirm or deny whether its monitoring of outbound vehicles would or could be integrated with ImmigrationOS. (CBP has paid for Palantir services three times, with the last payment in 2013.) This case management system integrates all of the information ICE may have about a person from investigative records or government databases, according to a government privacy assessment published in 2016. DHS noted in a 2024 report that CBP has struggled to get biometric data from people leaving the country over land—meaning, people traveling via "cars, trains, buses, bicycles, trucks, and on foot.” The report says that CBP wants to create a “biometric-based departure program” to monitor when people considered aliens leave the country, which DHS notes is required under US law. In March, the Department of Homeland Security revoked the legal status of more than half a million people from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela who were given temporary parole to stay in the US due to instability in their home countries. In April, the Social Security Administration listed more than 6,000 of these people who had temporary parole as dead, as a way of effectively ending their financial lives in the US. DHS also sent emails to an unknown number of people claiming that their legal parole had been revoked and demanding them to self-deport.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In another unhinged social media rant, President Donald Trump once again demonstrated that words really don't mean anything anymore. This time, Trump directed his ire at a Biden-era program intended to bridge the digital divide. On Truth Social, Trump announced his intention to end the Digital Equity Act while labeling it as “racist” and “unconstitutional”. It provided $2.75 billion to establish three federal grant programs administered by the National Telecommunications and Information Administration. Per the agency, DEA's aim is to ensure that everyone “[has] the skills, technology, and capacity needed to reap the full benefits of our digital economy.” Think digital skills and workforce training,  promoting high-speed internet access in rural and tribal areas, and improving accessibility for disabled people. Per the New York Times, $60 million went to funding states' and territories' programs, including in rural areas like Indiana, Alabama, Arkansas, Iowa, and Kansas. But of course, anything from Biden's administration can't continue. On Thursday, Trump wrote that he and Secretary of Commerce, Howard Lutnick, were in agreement about the DEA. He wrote, “No more woke handouts based on race! There's no need to give Trump an ounce of credence anytime he calls something racist. In her statement, Murray added, “It's absolutely insane that resources meant to help red and blue communities — everyone from local school districts and libraries to workforce training programs and Tribes — close the digital divide will be illegally blocked because the President doesn't like the word equity. Americans are sick and tired of extremist right-wing culture wars being forced down our throats.” As more of our world moves online with tele-health appointments, digital applications for jobs or benefits, online schooling like during the pandemic, and etc, it's a pressing issue. But since DEA is so young, it hasn't had a chance to do much of anything yet. In fact, a chunk of funding announced on Jan. 6 and Jan. 17 of this year has yet to be distributed, and the Trump administration froze funding in April. In a statement, NDIA said that out of its subgrantees' 13 programs waiting for funding, one would have served over 30,000 in the next five years alone. It added, “Now, a Truth Social post has put ours and 65+ other community-based digital trust inclusion programs at risk, and real people are about to pay the price.” It's not clear if Trump has taken any concrete steps to end the DEA outside of posting on social media. But as with his administration's many other attempts to freeze federal funding, Trump's decision could be taken up in court if he makes any further moves.

Nvidia plans to introduce a cut-down version of its HGX H20 AI processor in China by July, aiming to retain access to the market after U.S. officials effectively barred the original version through updated export regulations, Reuters reports. According to preliminary information, the revised AI GPU will feature less onboard HBM memory to comply with newly imposed technical limits and replace the previously approved model. In April, U.S. authorities restricted sales of AMD's Instinct MI308, Nvidia's HGX 20, and some other AI processors to China (including Hong Kong and Macau) due to unpublished export regulations. Nvidia has already communicated these plans to major customers in China's cloud computing sector. If the information about the downgraded HGX H20 processor is correct, it will be Nvidia's third Hopper-based GPU designed specifically for China that relies on cut-down H100 silicon. After the U.S. government imposed its first set of restrictions on AI and HPC GPUs exported to China in 2022, Nvidia built its H800 processor with reduced networking capabilities.

My favorite place to wake up is in a sleeping bag, which is good because I tend to wake up a lot when sleeping in a sleeping bag. I've tried them all (it's part of my job), and while some are definitely better than others, I've never found one that quite fulfilled every backpacker's dream—a lightweight, packable sleeping pad that feels just like the bed you left at home. The Therm-a-Rest NeoLoft sleeping pad isn't the lightest at 25 ounces—goodbye, ultralight readers—but the 4.6-inch cushion is a true luxury, and it offers a great night's rest, which can be more valuable than shedding a few ounces. There are two problems with carrying a big sleeping pad in the backcountry. First, there's the weight you have to carry, and then there's the amount of room it takes up in your pack. The ultralight community online will try to convince you that camp comfort—that is, your shelter and your sleeping set up—aren't as important as keeping weight down, so you can move fast. Depending on your goals in the backcountry, that may indeed be true. For me, carrying a little more weight in the form of a heavier tent and sleeping pad affords me a better night's sleep, which helps me (on average) to hike further than I do with less weight but poorer sleep. Therm-a-Rest's new NeoLoft pad steps into this weight/size/comfort debate by leaning heavily on the side of comfort. It is undeniably big, relative to something like Therm-a-Rest's XLite pads or Sea to Summit's Ether Light series (our two favorite ultralight sleeping pads). For all that, though, the Neoloft isn't that big when packed down, especially considering how big it is when you inflate it. The NeoLoft reliably packs down to a size that's just larger than a Nalgene water bottle—about an inch bigger around and an inch taller for the regular wide size pad that I tested. It's a tight squeeze fitting the NeoLoft in my Hyperlite Junction 40 with the rest of my gear, but it works for shorter trips where I'm not carrying a ton of food. For trips longer than three or four nights, I'd want a 55L pack. You can see what I carry at LighterPack.) Again though, I am not trying to win any ultralight prizes. Rather, I'm looking for the right balance between weight and comfort. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. I normally carry a Nemo Tensor Trail with an R-value of 3 in summer and fall and am plenty warm with that down to freezing. Unsurprisingly, I was never cold on the NeoLoft even down to one night that hit 15 degrees Fahrenheit on my thermometer. Internally, Therm-a-Rest has filled the NeoLoft with a trademark word salad of features dubbed ContourCore Matrix, ThermaCapture, and 3D Construction. It refers to the squared-off edges that come from having vertical sidewalls. There's two layers of baffles, with the top layer being of a stretchier fabric that helps provide pressure relief, especially for side sleepers. I never had this pad “taco” on me. The ThermaCapture is a reflective coating inside the pad designed to radiate your body heat back up and keep you warmer. Thankfully, there's enough space here that the NeoLoft is quite quiet. The stretch knit top also helps cut down on that swishy nylon sound. It also makes sleeping on the pad with a quilt much more comfortable. It's not quite Zenbivy-sheet-level comfortable, but it's much better than the awful feeling of sleeping on plasticky nylon. It also does a much better job of keeping you from sliding off in the night. It works, but I've long since gone to the motorized side, using a Flextail pump most of the time. In my testing, I could only fill the reliably NeoLoft 9 times with the Flextail, compared to 11 for my Nemo pad. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. However you inflate the NeoLoft, my one tip would be to experiment with how full you fill it. With 4.6 inches of loft, there's quite a bit of room to remove air and find the most comfortable spot for your body and sleep habits. For me that was around 85 percent full, but even down to about 60 percent I didn't bottom out, which is unheard of in a backpacking pad. Keep in mind that the R-value is for a fully inflated pad. Finally, one cautionary note: This is a big pad when inflated. Two would not fit side by side in many of the two-person ultralight tents I've tested, and fully inflated I can't quite sit up in the Hilleberg Akto. At 85 percent inflated, I can sit up in the Akto, so it's not a huge issue. It's just worth making sure that it will fit in your tent before you buy (especially if you're camping with a partner who will also have one). The nearest competition is the Big Agnes Rapide SL Insulated pad, which weights a bit less (17 ounces) with an R-value of 4.8 and thickness of 4.25. While the Rapide SL is a very nice pad worth considering if you're really counting ounces, the NeoLoft wins when it comes to comfort. I think the NeoLoft is worth the space and weight for those who value a good night's sleep. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This LLM will unlock the possibilities with your LEGO bricks. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. A research team from Carnegie Mellon University built an AI model called LegoGPT that outputs valid LEGO designs from text inputs. The AI was trained on a dataset with more than 47,000 LEGO structures that build over 28,000 unique 3D objects, including bookshelves, tables, chairs, cars, ships, guitars, and more. This was then used to train the AI model, allowing it to create unique and original designs solely from text inputs. The tool is available for free on GitHub, and you can pair this with a computer vision model or image processing AI. The team added a validity check and physics-aware rollback during autoregressive inference, ensuring that the final output will always be valid (i.e., no overlapping bricks) and stable (i.e., no floating bricks). Furthermore, LegoGPT's final output can be built by both humans and robots. This is how the team created the dataset — StableText2Lego — used to train LegoGPT: a text prompt input is first converted into a ShapeNetCore mesh. This layout is then varied while still keeping the overall shape, and then unstable designs are filtered out from the final output. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. That means it will verify a brick's validity at each step, checking if it is well-formatted, exists in the library, and does not overlap with existing bricks. Once it gets a stable final output, then the design is complete. One development we can see is if someone converts this into a downloadable AI app with a customizable brick library.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Apple is reportedly developing new chips to drive smart glasses similar to Meta's Ray-Ban Meta as well as more powerful Macs and AI servers. Apple aims to put these chips into mass production with TSMC by the end of next year or 2027, according to the report. Bloomberg has previously reported that Apple CEO Tim Cook is determined to beat Meta in the glasses market, where the latter has seen success in recent years. Since 2023, Meta has sold around 2 million pairs of Ray-Ban Metas. One of the processors under development will be able to control these cameras and other components without draining too much battery, per the report.

The first benchmark results of Nvidia's GB10 Superchip for compact AI workstations in Geekbench 6 have been published. While the processor promises serious performance for AI applications, its compute capabilities seem relatively modest. It should be noted that we are talking about a pre-release product running on Windows 11 Enterprise Insider Preview. Nvidia's GB10 Superchip system-in-package (SiP) comprises a Grace CPU packing 10 high-performance Arm Cortex-X925 cores (at up to 3.90 GHz) and 10 energy-efficient Cortex-A725 cores, as well as a Blackwell GPU that can deliver 1 PetaFLOPS of FP4 compute performance for AI applications. Arm's Cortex-X925 core, clocked at 3.90 GHz, delivers fairly strong single-threaded performance, achieving a Geekbench 6 single-thread score of 2,960. Both processors are known for their high IPC performance, and since we are talking about a processor for an AI workstation here, single-thread performance matters. However, by today's standards, roughly 3000 points in Geekbench 6 single-thread benchmark is a good, but hardly an outstanding result. Apple's M4, AMD's Ryzen 9950X, and Intel's Core Ultra 9 285K offer considerably higher single-thread performance despite having a significantly slower memory subsystem. However, GB10's score of 10,682 points in Geekbench 6 is modest at best. Such a poor result of Nvidia's GB10 may indicate that its Cortex-A725 efficiency cores contribute less to the overall score, or do not work at all due to issues with scheduling, which could be solved by Windows 11 or Nvidia microcode update. Alternatively, this may mean that GB10, in its current form, is not optimized for CPU-heavy workloads and is not delivering maximum performance in AI applications under strict power envelopes and thermal budgets of compact platforms like Nvidia's DGX Spark. This assumption makes sense when considering GB10's general role as a solution for compact AI workstations. In AI workloads, the CPU is often relegated to scheduling, data staging, and light preprocessing tasks rather than being the primary computational driver. Hence, the CPU design prioritizes good-enough general-purpose performance while minimizing power draw and die area. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. However, if we look more broadly, the situation seems mixed. However, a rumor is that the company will formally announce its N1 and N1X processors for desktop and laptop PCs at Computex later this month. However, for now, GB10 does not impress in Geekbench 6 under Windows 11. In summary, while Nvidia's GB10 CPU delivers modest single-thread performance that is compatible with Apple's M3, Qualcomm's Snapdragon X Elite X1E-100, and Intel's Core Ultra 5 235, it shows clear limits in multi-core scalability. Also, remember that Geekbench is an artificial benchmark, and the real-world performance of Nvidia's GB10 may be far more competitive.

The RTX 5090 is not only good for gaming and AI — it also excels at password cracking. Hive Systems updated its password cracking benchmark suite with 12 RTX 5090 graphics cards — Nvidia's fastest and best graphics card for gaming currently, and found all twelve cards working together can break simple eight-character passwords in under 15 minutes. Hive Systems is in its 5th year of benchmarking password cracking times on GPUs; the last update they made was in 2024, featuring the RTX 4090. Rather than cracking an actual password itself, the outlet cracks hashes, which are scrambled versions of reproducible text generated by software. When hackers go to steal a password database from a company's server that is secured with hashing, all they will see are hashes of the passwords they represent rather than the actual passwords themselves. Graphics cards are particularly good at this methodology due to highly parallelized computing capabilities. With 12 RTX 5090s, Hive Systems found Nvidia's latest flagship can crack the hash equivalent of eight-character passwords featuring numbers only in just 15 minutes. Passwords comprised of eight lower-case letters, the dozen RTX 5090s were able to crack in 3 weeks. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. Moving up to a hash representing an eight-character password made up of numbers, upper and lowercase letters combined with symbols, the RTX 5090 is allegedly twice as fast as the RTX 4090. Hive Systems' research demonstrates the dangers of low complexity passwords and how adding just a bit of complexity in the form of symbols, capitalized letters, and numbers can make a huge difference for security. Without this, hackers can't brute-force hack password hashes. Aaron Klotz is a contributing writer for Tom's Hardware, covering news related to computer hardware such as CPUs, and graphics cards.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>An attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) who's overseeing a high-profile deportation case in Louisiana says she was stripped of her electronics moments before a pivotal hearing, preventing her from accessing evidence and court records that remained available to the three US government attorneys in the room, each of whom were allowed use of a laptop by the court. Louisiana immigration judge Jamee Comans ruled late last month that Columbia graduate student Mahmoud Khalil was eligible for deportation. During that hearing, however, Khalil's attorney Nora Ahmed says she was barred from bringing her laptop into the courtroom, despite having filed the proper paperwork in advance and being a frequent visitor to the immigration facility. “There should not be an advantage, no matter how small or how large, provided to a particular party over the other,” says Ahmed. “Because that starts to infect the proceedings themselves and the notion of fundamental fairness that we all uphold in courtroom proceedings.” The Justice Department did not respond to a request for comment. Attempts to reach Comans through the Executive Office of Immigration Review (EOIR) were unsuccessful. Khalil remains one of the most high-profile targets of the Trump administration's ongoing push to expel foreign students protesting Israel's actions. The US government has not accused Khalil, whose wife and newborn son were born in the US, of committing any crime. The government acknowledged last month that Khalil had been detained without a warrant due to “exigent circumstances,” claiming the 30-year-old graduate student, whose wife was eight months pregnant at the time, was a “flight risk.” Following his arrest at his university-owned apartment complex in New York on March 8, Khalil was transported to the Central Louisiana ICE Processing Center, a for-profit prison overseen by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), where he is now subject to a tribunal system that bears little resemblance to the US courts that hear citizens' cases. A majority of people fighting deportation cannot afford—nor do they have any recognized right—to legal representation. In an unusual move, on April 8, Comans booted nearly 600 people attempting to observe one of Khalil's hearings over the court's videoconferencing software, declaring that, going forward, only his attorneys or wife would be permitted to view the proceedings online. Nevertheless, in a sworn declaration, Ahmed says that minutes before the hearing began she was informed by the detention center staff that, on Comans' instructions, she was forbidden from bringing her devices inside, forcing her to turn over her laptop to the faculty and enter the courtroom empty-handed. Once the hearing began, Khalil says, she sat opposite three Homeland Security attorneys, with each their own laptop. “You effectively are using the technology that you have to be able to respond in real time, or inquire in real time, or to show your client in real time, what evidence the government may be talking about or responding to,” she tells WIRED. “As long as immigration courts are under the direction of the executive branch, non-citizens are never going to receive a fundamentally fair proceeding," she says. Méndez notes that, since February 2022, the Justice Department has required all immigration attorneys to file documents with the courts electronically, effectively establishing the expectation that attorneys should rely on digital access for court filings, case citations, and other subject matter, rather than risk expensive continuances in notoriously backlogged courts. “When I inquired as to why, I was told that it was the immigration judge that had made the determination,” she tells WIRED. Christopher Ferreira, a spokesperson for GEO Group, which runs the ICE detention center, says the for-profit prison company follows the guidance handed to it by its government partners: "Decisions related to access to courtrooms and legal visitation areas at the ICE Processing Centers, where GEO provides support services, are made in consultation with ICE and EOIR.” Anthony Enriquez, an attorney with RFK Human Rights, says much of what's happening in the Khalil case is emblematic of larger structural issues in the immigration system. Second only to Texas in number of detainees, Louisiana's nine immigration detention centers have faced allegations of human rights abuses in recent years, from physical and sexual assaults to medical neglect and bug-infested food. In an August 2024 report, compiled in part by the ACLU itself, the system was described by a coalition of civil rights organizations as an “inhumane” corporate “profit machine,” where “basic human rights are systematically ignored.” Khalil's case in Louisiana is effectively on hold for much of this month following a ruling by a US District Court judge in New Jersey, who last week shot down the Trump administration effort to stop Khalil from suing the government. In a 108-page ruling, New Jersey District Judge Michael Farbiarz said the government had no authority to prevent the court from reviewing Khalil's claims. “This is an important step toward securing Mahmoud's freedom. But there is still more work to be done,” she says. “I will continue to strongly advocate for my husband, so he can come home to our family and feel the pure joy all parents know of holding your first-born child in your arms.” Big Story: The worm that no computer scientist can crack Yuval Noah Harari: “Prepare to share the planet with AI superintelligence” WIRED may earn a portion of sales from products that are purchased through our site as part of our Affiliate Partnerships with retailers.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Jayde Powell doesn't plan on being an influencer forever. Powell is also a social media marketing strategist and content creator who posts around one video per day, primarily on LinkedIn. Despite her success, Powell says she has already suffered the negative effects of being chronically online. “I just do not think it's OK to be waking up and looking at my phone every morning,” she says, noting she started wearing glasses that filter blue light in 2021 in an effort to relieve the migraines she has suffered from constantly staring at a screen. While she says most of her creator friends want a therapist, due to the instability of their income “it's almost seen as a luxury.” CreatorCare, a newly launched telehealth therapy service, aims to bridge that gap by providing sliding-scale therapy that's specifically tailored to people working in the creator economy. Beast told host Steven Bartlett on the Diary of a CEO podcast, “If my mental health was a priority, I wouldn't be as successful as I am.” There have also been wider pushes to regulate how these workers are treated by the platforms they populate—and create profit for. A research study on influencers published in the journal Digital Health in 2024 found a “significant association” between extended social media use and heightened negative emotions, with those making less than $10,000 from their posting likely to feel worse. CreatorCare cofounder Shira Lazar, 42, says although she loves the creativity and community that comes with working in the field, the “fear of disappearing fuels burnout in a system that constantly demands you feed the feeds.” Creators struggle with anxiety, depression, disordered eating, and income that can fluctuate wildly from month to month, she says. At the same time, she points out, it's a highly sought-after career choice, with 57 percent of Gen Z respondents saying they want to become an influencer, according to a 2023 survey by research firm Morning Consult. Amy Kelly, cofounder of Revive Health Therapy, is a licensed family therapist who sees many creators. She says influencers and creators can also lose their sense of perspective, due to the constant synthetic connections they're forming online. But on the flip side, when those comments aren't flattering, it can feel disproportionately bad. When she helped launch a cannabis community for Black women in the industry, she says she was subjected to harassment on X—mostly by other Black people—and was accused of “trying to plant ideas about drug use and the Black community.” She says there's “definitely some stigma” around the latter, where it's perceived as “not a real job.” “I think that people and businesses don't quite recognize what influence means,” Abas says. The guild, which says it represents more than 1,000 creators (Abas would not provide an exact number), recently released a “rider,” a set of standards that companies working with creators can adapt and legally comply with. One of the key principles is agreeing to pay creators within 90 days. Abas says lack of payment is a major stressor on creators. “At a fundamental level, not knowing whether or not you're going to pay rent or your mortgage for work you've already done isn't right,” Abas says, noting that creators are often “not treated as professionals.” In terms of creating legitimacy for the profession, the guild is also looking at establishing accreditation for certain creators and establishing a database called Hue, similar to IMDB, to display their work. Abas says the rider has already been adopted by brands like Whalar and Linktree. Abas says the guild is not a union because it wouldn't have the leverage of being able to strike, and “requiring payment terms can actually stifle creativity.” Likewise, he says the guild can't yet provide medical benefits to members, who pay $99 a year. Lazar says she's been in talks with multiple associations to assess how creators might be able to qualify for health benefits, but it's still a work in progress. She's also hoping that others are inspired to follow CreatorCare's suit. Unlike Powell, she doesn't see an off-ramp for herself and the pull of being a creator—so she wants to improve the conditions for everyone.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Imagine going for dinner with a group of friends who switch in and out of different languages you don't speak, but still being able to understand what they're saying. This scenario is the inspiration for a new AI headphone system that translates the speech of multiple speakers simultaneously, in real time. “My mom has such incredible ideas when she's speaking in Telugu, but it's so hard for her to communicate with people in the US when she visits from India. We think this kind of system could be transformative for people like her.” While there are plenty of other live AI translation systems out there, such as the one running on Meta's Ray-Ban smart glasses, they focus on a single speaker, not multiple people speaking at once, and deliver robotic-sounding automated translations. The new system is designed to work with existing, off-the shelf noise-canceling headphones that have microphones, plugged into a laptop powered by Apple's M2 silicon chip, which can support neural networks. The research was presented at the ACM CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems in Yokohama, Japan, this month. Over the past few years, large language models have driven big improvements in speech translation. As a result, translation between languages for which lots of training data is available (such as the four languages used in this study) is close to perfect on apps like Google Translate or in ChatGPT. But it's still not seamless and instant across many languages. That's a goal a lot of companies are working toward, says Alina Karakanta, an assistant professor at Leiden University in the Netherlands, who studies computational linguistics and was not involved in the project. The second model then translates the speakers' words from French, German, or Spanish into English text using publicly available data sets. Given that separating out human voices is hard enough for AI systems, being able to incorporate that ability into a real-time translation system, map the distance between the wearer and the speaker, and achieve decent latency on a real device is impressive, says Samuele Cornell, a postdoc researcher at Carnegie Mellon University's Language Technologies Institute, who did not work on the project. “Their results are very good in the limited testing settings. But for a real product, one would need much more training data—possibly with noise and real-world recordings from the headset, rather than purely relying on synthetic data.” Gollakota's team is now focusing on reducing the amount of time it takes for the AI translation to kick in after a speaker says something, which will accommodate more natural-sounding conversations between people speaking different languages. “We want to really get down that latency significantly to less than a second, so that you can still have the conversational vibe,” Gollakota says. This remains a major challenge, because the speed at which an AI system can translate one language into another depends on the languages' structure. The new general AI agent from China had some system crashes and server overload—but it's highly intuitive and shows real promise for the future of AI helpers. What the firm found challenges some basic assumptions about how this technology really works. The country poured billions into AI infrastructure, but the data center gold rush is unraveling as speculative investments collide with weak demand and DeepSeek shifts AI trends.
