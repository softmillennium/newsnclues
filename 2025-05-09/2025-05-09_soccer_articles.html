                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>"This is not just about having 16 more teams playing in the FIFA Women's World Cup but taking the next steps in relation to the women's game in general by ensuring that more FIFA Member Associations have the chance to benefit from the tournament to develop their women's football structures from a holistic point of view," FIFA president Gianni Infantino said. Infantino added that the move "ensures we are maintaining the momentum in terms of growing women's football globally." More games inevitably means more revenue for FIFA and its individual federations, money that will get funneled down to the players. Exacerbating the second facet, women's soccer hasn't had as much time to build a broad infrastructure compared to when FIFA made 48 teams a reality on the men's side. Whereas the men's World Cup dates back to 1930, the Women's World Cup was first staged in 1991. Established European powers such as England, Spain, and France only started to fully invest in their national teams within the last decade. Countries without prestigious domestic leagues or a successful men's national team are further behind the curve. The Philippines scored one goal and allowed eight in three matches. In Group C, Zambia and Costa Rica combined to earn three points with a minus-15 goal differential. Even with the expected growth of women's soccer, lopsided games are bound to be more frequent at the 2031 World Cup. Some may argue that's an acceptable cost if it ultimately yields more money that can be spent to help raise the standard of the sport, though.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The biggest news of the week is that Mallory Swanson announced on social media that she and her husband, Chicago Cubs shortstop Dansby Swanson, are expecting their first child. Swanson's absence from both the U.S. women's national team and the Chicago Stars this calendar year now makes perfect sense. Both teams had said that the star forward was dealing with a "personal matter" without further explanation. Swanson signed a contract extension with the Stars ahead of last season through 2028. And while that's an important long-term move for the club, it is currently going through a rebuilding phase, having recently fired head coach Lorne Donaldson (who coached Swanson's youth team back in Colorado). Sophia Wilson is also pregnant and expecting her first child this year, while Trinity Rodman looked fit and in form last camp before re-aggravating a back injury and is now out until further notice. Carli Lloyd inducted into National Soccer Hall of Fame USWNT legend Carli Lloyd was inducted into the National Soccer Hall of Fame earlier this week. In her speech, the two-time World Cup champion and Olympic gold medalist apologized to her teammates for being an "emotionless machine." "I wasn't there to make friends or follow the crowd," Lloyd said. That drive often meant keeping people at a distance. I was intense and I truly believed that the only way for me to survive in such a cutthroat environment was to be that way. Lloyd, who retired in 2021 and has been a FOX Sports analyst for several years, reflected on her career accomplishments and regrets. She noted that above all else, her "greatest joy" has been becoming a mom to six-month-old daughter Harper. "Unlike during my playing career, I have been present. I have allowed myself to be vulnerable, emotional and fully engaged in every moment I get to spend with her." Over the weekend, Alyssa and Gisele Thompson became the first sister duo to combine for a goal in NWSL history as they helped Angel City defeat the Washington Spirit 4-3. In the 22nd minute, with Angel City already leading 1-0, Alyssa Thompson streaked down the left side and sent a pinpoint left-footed cross into the box, where her younger sibling was waiting. Gisele, a defender, only needed one touch to net her first career NWSL goal. This isn't the first time Alyssa, 20, and Gisele, 19, have made soccer history though. Mikaela Shiffrin, the most decorated Alpine skier in history, has joined the ownership group for Denver's NWSL expansion team. The Colorado native is a two-time gold medalist, eight-time World Champion and has 101 World Cup victories among other achievements. Now she can add NWSL investor to her glowing resume. The Denver team, which has yet to be named, will begin play in 2026 along with Boston Legacy FC, bringing the league up to 16 teams. The ownership group is also planning to build a 14,500-seat stadium in Denver that is expected to open in 2028. Shiffrin joins a growing list of celebrity athlete NWSL investors, which includes Patrick and Brittany Mahomes (Kansas City Current), Lindsey Vonn (Utah Royals and Angel City), Naomi Osaka (North Carolina Courage), Billie Jean King and Mia Hamm (Angel City), James Harden (Houston Dash) and many more. She previously wrote for Sports Illustrated, USA Today and The Indianapolis Star. She is the author of "Strong Like a Woman," published in spring 2022 to mark the 50th anniversary of Title IX.</p>

GOAL takes a look at some key storylines heading into Matchday 12 of MLS action in 2025

The weekend promises fireworks in MLS, with three of the season's potentially best matches yet on tap. 


First, it's a rematch of the 2024 MLS Cup final, the LA Galaxy clash with the New York Red Bulls - and though both teams are on a bit of a rocky course of late - the circumstances of the match present each club with a unique opportunity to capitalize on the moment.


 Minnesota United host Lionel Messi and Inter Miami in a rare cross-conference meeting, as the two clubs meet for the first time since the Argentine's arrival to the league. The Loons, who sit second in the West, will look to keep their red-hot form to start 2025 going against the Herons in a clash at Allianz Field.


And atop the Eastern Conference, the first-place Columbus Crew take to the road this weekend to take on second-place Philadelphia Union in a meeting between the conference's best teams heading into the Matchday.


As Matchday 12 kicks off, these fixtures promise to deliver some of the most exciting action yet this season.

GOAL dives into all that and more in The Kickoff, a weekly preview of each MLS Matchday.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>With just over a year until the 2026 FIFA World Cup takes the United States, Canada, and Mexico by storm, fans might need to start squirreling cash away now in order to afford tickets. While many fans likely won't be able to afford the suites that start at $3,500 and run as high as over $70,000, the average ticket price won't be much better. Of course, non-hospitality tickets have yet to go on sale and those prices could change drastically between now and then. But football fans have already voiced their anger on social media over the tournament that has been a pet project of President Donald Trump. Fans are outraged after the average price of a World Cup group stage ticket in 2026 is revealed The tournament, which is a pet project of President Trump's, will kick off in just over a year Full-session hospitality tickets for every game at MetLife Stadium cost up to $73,000 Robbery in broad daylight and FIFA's holding the flashlight,' one user posted on X, formerly Twitter. 'Way to ruin the world cup,' one user complained. 'Can almost see it now, half empty stadiums and terrible atmosphere. They don't want the average working person anymore. 'Don't send a world cup to the USA ever again,' one person posted. Another remarked, 'Pure f**kery, FIFA is literally extorting the US market.' Among the ticket packages already on sale in hospitality includes a full eight-game package for every match in New York - including the Round of 32, Round of 16, and the Final. Those tickets start at $25,800 and balloon up to $73,200 for the higher end. On the opposite coast, a similar package is being sold for Los Angeles - where the United States national team will play its first and final games of the group stage. SoFi Stadium is also set to host two Round of 32 games and a quarterfinal match. Tickets for LA will begin at $20,300 and go up to $35,350. By posting your comment you agree to our house rules.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>From Inter Miami CF's home ground of Chase Stadium to anywhere else in the world a soccer ball is being kicked around, the odds of seeing a Lionel Messi jersey are always high. It's a phenomenon that even Germany and Bayern Munich legend Lothar Matthäus notices in his own country, despite his homeland producing some of the game's all-time greats. In Germany, too,” said Matthäus, who, like the superstar Argentine No. 10, has the rare distinction of winning both a FIFA World Cup and Ballon d'Or award. He's 11 years old, and I sometimes follow his football games. And when they have training sessions, you see a lot of Messi shirts," he said. The 2024 MLS Supporters' Shield winners and 2023 Leagues Cup champions are just over a month away from their next high-profile venture: competing at this summer's FIFA 2025 Club World Cup in the United States as the host side of the expanded, 32-team tournament that runs from June 14 to July 13. Seattle Sounders FC, via their 2022 Concacaf Champions Cup (née League) title, will also represent Major League Soccer at the competition, while LAFC are set to face LIGA MX titans Club América for Club León's recently vacated spot. For Matthäus, Messi gives Miami an unrivaled edge in a highly competitive Group A that also features Al Ahly (Egypt), FC Porto (Portugal) and Palmeiras (Brazil). “It's not too much pressure because Messi has had pressure all his life: World Cup finals, Copa América, national [team] games, club games, Champions League finals, El Clásico in Spain between Real Madrid and Barcelona,” the five-time World Cup veteran said. While Matthäus believes Messi and Miami can “make a run” at the CWC, the current pundit and Bayern Munich ambassador envisions an all-European semifinal bracket, given the sporting and financial implications of the competition that will distribute an unprecedented $1 billion prize pool. And a lot of money,” he said. “… They'll [be] playing with their best first XI, they will give their best to win the title.” Still, Matthäus isn't taking Miami, Seattle and possibly LAFC lightly, given the worldwide exposure the league has received in recent years thanks to Messi and its historic broadcasting deal with Apple via MLS Season Pass. “Twenty or 15 years ago, it was not possible for us Germans to watch MLS on our TVs,” he said. “Now it's possible and you can see how football [in the United States] is getting focus from other countries.” This summer's Club World Cup comes a year before the United States will co-host the 2026 FIFA World Cup with Canada and Mexico. Matthäus, who participated in that World Cup six years before spending the 2000 season with the New York/New Jersey MetroStars (now New York Red Bulls), is excited for how both upcoming tournaments will play out. According to Matthäus, that motivation will make for some riveting club soccer across the United States come this summer.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>EverPass Media, the platform dedicated to commercial businesses, has struck a distribution deal in the US with sports streaming heavyweight DAZN, covering men's soccer's upcoming FIFA Club World Cup (CWC) tournament. Through a commercial agreement unveiled today, EverPass will act as the exclusive rights-holder for CWC action across bars, restaurants, and other commercial venues, with the deal covering all 63 games between the 32 teams taking part in this year's expanded CWC (which will from now on be held as a quadrennial tournament, featuring a much larger number of sides than previous editions). It represents the first such tie-up between DAZN, which holds global rights to the tournament through a deal with FIFA worth $1 billion – announced late last year, and EverPass. The tournament will run between June 14 and July 13. In terms of recent EverPass activity, meanwhile, in mid-February, US media giant Paramount announced a multi-year agreement with the platform, around coverage of matches from European soccer's UEFA Champions League. Launched in April 2023 as a joint venture between the investment arm of American football's NFL and RedBird Capital Partners, EverPass is a content distribution service aimed at bringing live sports and entertainment content to commercial establishments, such as bars, restaurants, hotels, and gyms, in the US. Don't let policy changes catch you off guard. "This agreement underscores our commitment to closing the gap between rightsholders and commercial venues by offering seamless access to premium live global sports content." EverPass' stable of rights includes top-tier English soccer, American football's NFL Sunday Ticket, Big Ten college football, and basketball, as well as the UCL. With 63 matches featuring the biggest clubs from every continent, this tournament is built for shared moments, and commercial venues are a key part of that experience." The original deal between DAZN and soccer's global governing body FIFA was unveiled in advance of Saudi Arabia's Surj Sports Investments announcing last month that it had taken a minority stake in the streaming service, also for $1 billion.

There have been plenty of bad omens for the U.S. men's national team of late but on Thursday, the team's luck may have just turned around.

The election of Chicago native Robert Prevost to become Pope Leo XIV is (at least according to some denizens of the internet) a surefire sign that the USMNT is destined for big things at the World Cup next summer.

A curious pattern has emerged over the past several decades: Popes' teams tend to experience big success on the biggest stage in men's soccer.

Pope Francis saw his native Argentina win the last World Cup in 2022. Eight years before that, Pope Benedict XVI (at the time, Pope emeritus) watched Germany lift the 2014 World Cup.

Sure, but that's Argentina and Germany, right? They tend to do well no matter who is sitting on the throne in the Vatican.

But consider Benedict's predecessor John Paul II, who saw his Poland side achieve a third-place finish in the 1982 World Cup. If Poland can do it, why not the USMNT?

Sure, this line of justification is admittedly thin, but after the Concacaf Nations League, USMNT fans will take any hope they can get.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The 2025 Europa League Final will be contested between two Premier League teams after Manchester United and Tottenham both booked their place on Thursday night. In a season that has seen both teams fall woefully short in the league, where they sit in 15th and 16th place, for one of them, the campaign could end with qualification for the Champions League. They will now meet in Bilbao at the end of the month, but speaking exclusively to DAZN News, thanks to talkSPORT BET, Ally McCoist thinks it's difficult to pick a winner from the inconsistent pair. Maddison would be a massive miss for Tottenham. So my first thought would be there would be a slight favouritism towards Manchester United because they're key players playing. "But I probably think Spurs for no other reason than sometimes that's football, especially when big Ange is convinced he can win things in the second year. "I actually said, believe it or not, I said about six, seven weeks ago that it wouldn't surprise me if they did win that tournament. "Because of the form of both sides, you could argue United's form in Europe has been slightly better than Spurs, even though the last two results for Tottenham have been very, very good. "But I defy anybody,  whether you know football or don't know football, to confidently predict the outcome of a game between two teams that have lost 35 league games between them. And they've shown a ridiculous level of inconsistency. "So I would slightly go for Tottenham but with no degree of confidence.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Speaking alongside FIFA President Gianni Infantino while officially launching the FIFA World Cup Task Force, Trump insisted that there were no issues, despite an ongoing trade war and suggestions towards their northern neighbours that he would like to make Canada the “51st state.” “I don't see any tension here, we get along very well with both,” he said, having met with newly-elected Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney earlier in the day. “We had a great meeting today,” he added. We had a very great meeting and no tension. Trump said that he and Carney spoke about the tournament during their meeting, the first between the two leaders since Carney's election on April 28, which reportedly focused primarily on international trade and Canada's sovereignty. The President's tone with Carney, Canada's 24th Prime Minister, is a noted shift from his previous relationship with Canada's last Prime Minister, Justin Trudeau, whom Trump regularly called “Governor” before Trudeau resigned. In their Oval Office media availability earlier in the day, Carney diplomatically insisted to Trump in front of the cameras that Canada was “not for sale,” adding that it would “never” be the 51st state. Trump responded with “never say never,” while calling Carney –a former central banker– "a very talented, very good person.” Carney's statements, echoed largely by the Canadian public, are also shared by Canada men's national team head coach Jesse Marsch, who spoke about Trump's treatment of Canada ahead of March's Concacaf Nations League Finals. “If I have one message to our president, it's lay off the ridiculous rhetoric about Canada being the 51st state,” Marsch said in February. “As an American, I'm ashamed of the arrogance and disregard that we've shown one of our historically oldest, strongest and most loyal allies.” Trump stated that the cooperation between the three nations is “total, complete...[The World Cup is] going to be perfect, it's going to be beautiful,” and that the U.S. is prepared to “not hold back” on security costs. We want everyone to spend a lot of money in America,” said Trump's Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy. With the World Cup set to kick off on June 11, 2026, all eyes will be on the organizers and governments putting the tournament together, as well as the national teams of all three nations, which aim to make deep runs as co-hosts.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>There are four clubs from Africa among the 32 teams that have qualified for the FIFA Club World Cup, which will kick off on June 15. World football's governing body FIFA are hoping the new-look Club World Cup, which will be hosted in the United States next month, will mark a new era for the game and develop a four-yearly competition that has as much relevance and reverence as the World Cup for national teams. It includes Mamelodi Sundowns, who are through to this season's African Champions League final later in May and will be hoping to make some impact on the new-look Club World Cup. In their group, Sundowns have been drawn against Borussia Dortmund, who were runners-up in the UEFA Champions League last season; Rio de Janeiro giants Fluminense and Ulsan from South Korea. It will be something of an upset if the Pretoria club progress past the first stage but even if they return home without a win, the tournament promises to be a massive learning curve and its financial spin off means Sundowns are set to continue their long-standing hegemony on the local scene. They will reportedly receive a minimum of $9-million for participating in the tournament, with more money on offer for any victories they might achieve; $2 million is paid for winning group stage games, $7.5 million for playing in the round of 16 and $40 million to the team that wins the final at MetLife Stadium near New York on July 13. FIFA aims to share $250 million among clubs worldwide who did not qualify for the tournament. But it is not yet clear how many clubs will be paid, or how much they will get. It is massive money for Sundowns to continue to buy the best players and extend their record-breaking run of championship success in South Africa's Premier Soccer League.
