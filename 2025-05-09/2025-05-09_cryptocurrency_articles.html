Shares of Next Technology Holding Inc NXTT surged by 706% to $2.50 on Friday afternoon, driven by an extremely large spike in trading volume over the company's Bitcoin BTC/USD assets. What To Know: Fueling the rally was the company's latest disclosure revealing it held approximately 5,833 Bitcoins as of March 31, 2025, with a carrying value of $481.7 million, up from just 833 Bitcoins at the end of 2024. Next Technology, which has dual business focuses in software development and Bitcoin investment, also reported $193.4 million in net income for the first-quarter—almost entirely from unrealized gains on digital assets. With seemingly little traditional revenue and limited cash on hand, the company's stock price Friday appears to be riding the momentum of its crypto-centric strategy.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Law enforcement detained the wrong person for a 2022 scam that pilfered more than $1 million worth of Bored Ape non-fungible tokens (NFTs), cybersecurity researcher ZachXBT said. In a May 9 X post, ZachXBT said he identified the wallet behind the scam and linked it to an X account that has since been deleted. But in 2023, law enforcement detained Sam Curry, a former Yuga Labs security researcher, at an airport as a suspect in the incident, ZachXBT said. In December 2022, an anonymous attacker stole 14 Bored Ape Yacht Club NFTs, which at the time traded for roughly $86,000 each, according to data from CoinSlam. Law enforcement then “mistakenly reviewed logs from OpenSea which included [Curry's] home IP address and used this to incorrectly link him as the suspect,” ZachXBT wrote. ZachXBT said he used forensic tracing — including reconstructing the flow of funds through Tornado, an Ethereum mixer — to identify a person he alleges is a likely suspect in the 2022 theft. He said law enforcement officials should “request all data related to [the individual's] social media accounts” and dig into on-chain transactions associated with their alleged wallet. Launched in 2021, Bored Ape Yacht Club is among the most valuable NFT collections, with a cumulative market capitalization of more than $300 million, according to data from CoinGecko. As of May 9, Bored Ape NFTs trade for roughly $30,000 each, according to NFT marketplace OpenSea.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Crypto Liquidations Top $1.1 Billion as Bitcoin, Ethereum and Solana Prices Spike According to data from CoinGlass, shorts make up the bulk of that figure, with nearly $777 million worth of positions liquidated over the past day. Some $350 million worth of longs were zapped in the same span. That's because of Ethereum's incredible price rise, with the asset skyrocketing nearly 25% over the last week to a current price of $2,303. Ethereum isn't the only big gainer this week, however, even if its rise has outpaced most other giants. Bitcoin is up 5% to a current price of $102,858, topping $100,000 on Thursday for the first time since February. The top cryptocurrency touched a high of $103,890 earlier Friday, with $307 million worth of Bitcoin liquidations piling up over the last day. Other big movers in the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market cap this week include Solana with a 12% rise and Dogecoin with a more than 11% climb on the week. Solana yielded the third-most liquidations for any single asset over the last day with over $40 million worth, with Dogecoin a little further down the list with $19 million worth of liquidations.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This is a daily technical analysis by CoinDesk analyst and Chartered Market Technician Omkar Godbole. About two weeks ago, I discussed bitcoin's (BTC) bullish breakout above a technical resistance called the Ichimoku cloud and potential for a rally to $100,000. This week, the cryptocurrency obligingly surged into six figures. Now, top alternative cryptocurrencies such as memecoin DOGE, payments-focused XRP, the Ethereum blockchain's ether (ETH) and Solana's SOL have also crossed above the cloud, flashing bullish signals. The analysis, developed by a Japanese journalist in the 1960s, is used to identify support and resistance, momentum and trend change in price actions. The indicator comprises five lines: Leading Span A, Leading Span B, Conversion Line or Tenkan-Sen (T), Base Line or Kijun-Sen (K), and a lagging closing price line. The chart shows XRP and DOGE moving above their respective Ichimoku clouds, signaling more gains. In XRP's case, the breakout shifts focus to resistance at around 30 cents, characterized by the trendline falling from February highs. DOGE is trading close to its bear market trendline, which, if topped, would expose resistance at $3.02, the lower high created on March 2. Omkar holds small amounts of bitcoin, ether, BitTorrent, tron and dot.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In recent years, the global demand for sustainable practices has grown, with industries across the world rethinking how they can reduce their environmental impact. So, how exactly can blockchain be leveraged for sustainable packaging, and what are the benefits it brings? Traditional packaging supply chains can be opaque, making it difficult for consumers to know the true environmental impact of the products they purchase. In an age where customers are increasingly interested in the sustainability credentials of the brands they support, blockchain offers a solution by providing a decentralised, immutable ledger that records every transaction made along the packaging supply chain. With blockchain, every step of a product's packaging journey can be tracked, from the sourcing of raw materials to manufacturing, distribution, and end-of-life disposal. This transparency allows consumers to verify claims about the sustainability of products, including the use of eco-friendly materials, recycling efforts, and carbon footprint reduction strategies. This level of traceability not only builds consumer trust but also helps companies adhere to regulations and certifications that require proof of sustainability, such as the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) certification for paper products. According to a report from the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, over 80% of packaging is not recycled properly, leading to vast amounts of waste that pollute landfills and oceans. This is where blockchain can help drive change by promoting circularity — the process of reusing, recycling, and regenerating materials within the supply chain. By using smart contracts and tokens, businesses can reward customers who return packaging for reuse, further encouraging sustainable behaviour. Additionally, blockchain can assist in monitoring the effectiveness of recycling programs, ensuring that materials are returned and processed correctly, ultimately reducing the need for new resources. With these advanced tracking systems in place, businesses can make more informed decisions about the design of their packaging. For example, a company can identify packaging that is not being recycled effectively and shift towards more recyclable or compostable materials. Furthermore, blockchain allows for more efficient waste management practices, improving the ability to sort and process waste, which in turn reduces landfill usage. Companies often work with a multitude of suppliers, manufacturers, and logistics providers, all of whom may have different practices when it comes to sustainability. By creating a single, transparent ledger that all stakeholders can access, blockchain enables real-time sharing of data across the supply chain. This collaboration can lead to the sharing of best practices, the development of joint sustainability initiatives, and more consistent standards across industries. With verified data available to all parties, companies are held accountable for their sustainability claims, creating a more truthful and consistent approach to sustainable packaging. These could include packaging manufacturers, brands, recyclers, and even waste management organisations. By using blockchain to coordinate efforts, these diverse parties can work together more effectively, ensuring that packaging materials are sourced, used, and disposed of responsibly. This level of collaboration could result in more efficient systems that reduce waste and improve recycling rates across industries. The potential for blockchain to enhance transparency, reduce waste, and foster collaboration makes it a powerful tool for tackling the environmental challenges posed by traditional packaging methods. In the future, we may see widespread adoption of blockchain in the packaging industry, with companies and consumers alike benefiting from a more sustainable and circular system. As more organisations embrace this innovative approach, we can expect to see an acceleration in the development of new sustainable packaging solutions, which could ultimately lead to a reduction in waste, a decrease in the carbon footprint of packaging, and a cleaner, more sustainable environment for future generations. Ultimately, blockchain presents an exciting opportunity for revolutionising the packaging industry. By improving traceability, reducing waste, and fostering collaboration, blockchain can help businesses achieve their sustainability goals while providing consumers with greater confidence in the products they purchase. As the world continues to face pressing environmental challenges, blockchain for sustainable packaging could be a pivotal solution in the ongoing pursuit of a greener planet.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>According to a recent CryptoQuant Quicktake post by on-chain analyst BorisVest, Ethereum (ETH) appears to be stuck in a state of limbo. While retail investors are increasingly sending ETH to exchanges such as Binance – typically a sign of selling pressure – large investors are steadily withdrawing ETH from these platforms, indicating accumulation and long-term confidence. Optimism is building around the potential for a trend reversal, but on-chain data continues to deliver mixed signals regarding Ethereum's short- to medium-term direction. In his analysis, BorisVest highlighted that Ethereum metrics from Binance are sending ‘mixed signals.' Notably, mean exchange inflows have increased significantly since late 2024, suggesting growing sell pressure from retail traders. Similarly, mean exchange outflows have also been rising steadily since October 2023. However, these outflows are largely linked to whale wallets – addresses holding large amounts of ETH – implying that high-net-worth individuals are accumulating rather than selling. This divergence highlights a classic tug-of-war between retail fear and institutional confidence. He noted that during ETH's rally to $4,000 in early 2025, funding rates became overly positive as bullish sentiment took hold. This over-leveraged long positioning resulted in a sharp correction, driving ETH's price down to $1,400 by April. At present, funding rates are hovering in neutral territory, indicating a lack of clear leverage bias. BorisVest noted that if short interest rises and funding rates fall below zero, a short squeeze could ensue – potentially driving prices higher. Meanwhile, the taker buy/sell ratio, which tracks aggressive market orders, showed heavy selling pressure in late 2024 and early 2025 – right before Ethereum's steep decline. This ratio is now stabilizing, suggesting that sellers may be exhausted and buyers are gradually regaining strength. Although ETH is down 34.3% over the past year, several technical and on-chain indicators point toward a potential bullish trend reversal for the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap. For instance, Ethereum recently flashed a golden cross on the daily chart, a bullish indicator that typically leads to major upward moves. Further, there are signs that the cryptocurrency may have already bottomed out for this market cycle.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Square Enix's Symbiogenesis Web3 game was slated to be discontinued in July 2025, but Sony said the game will now expand to Sony's Soneium blockchain. Sony said that game studios and entertainment giants are choosing Soneium as a channel to collaborate, distribute, and connect with a new generation of builders. As more IP-driven titles enter the ecosystem, they're not just launching onchain, they're choosing a place where cross-game collaboration, interoperability, and creative ownership are part of the foundation, Sony said. But it's not clear how much Symbiogenesis will be expanded with new content, as the content hasn't proven that popular so far. Sony is also connecting the game with others, offering rewards and status to players who complete the Symbiogenesis experience. Those who complete it will be greenlit to participate in the Evermoon and Sleepagotchi games that are also on Soneium. This initiative begins in the expansive world of Symbiogenesis, the blockchain-based narrative game from Square Enix. Sony called Symbiogenesis the flagship Web3 entertainment project, blending interactive storytelling, non-fungible token (NFT) ownership, and game progression into a single immersive experience. Gamers can collect unique character NFTs, unlock episodes, and shape the game's story. But so far, only hundreds of fans have collected the NFTs. This initiative involving the three distinct gaming worlds offers players a shared quest, collectible rewards, and a new way to engage through blockchain gaming on Soneium. Now, players who complete a limited-time quest in Symbiogenesis will receive a commemorative NFT collectible on Soneium, which opens the door to additional in-game benefits in Evermoon and Sleepagotchi. Symbiogenesis has a sprawling narrative told through 10,000 character NFTs, six chapters, and over 1.1 million words of interactive storytelling. Every NFT unlocks new story content and choices that shape the game world. The onchain MOBA, Evermoon, leads onchain interactive entertainment with fast-paced 5v5 battles, interoperable NFTs, and DeFi rewards—built on Soneium. The Evermoon x Symbiogenesis collection introduces limited-edition digital stickers with perks like profile customization and rewards for gamers. Sleepagotchi LITE launches a hit mini-app on LINE in collaboration with Soneium, after topping charts on Telegram with over a million users in its first month. It rewards daily engagement through light gameplay—and in this initiative, players can unlock the Epic Rarity One-Horned Dragon, exclusive to Symbiogenesis quest participants. Sleepagotchi brings daily habit loops and mobile-native simplicity. Soneium brings the infrastructure to make these experiences interoperable, onchain, and meaningful. Square Enix is the example of top game publishers choosing Soneium to build a new kind of entertainment layer of the internet, where characters, rewards, and narratives travel across games, communities, and apps.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The president also said that further deals could be on the way and expressed optimism about trade talks with China that are slated to take place this weekend. Bitcoin was trading at $102,700 late Thursday evening, up from an intraday low of around $96,000. Below, we take a closer look at Bitcoin's chart and apply technical analysis to identify crucial price levels worth watching out for. After reclaiming the 200-day moving average (MA) last month, bitcoin traded within a narrow consolidation period before today's strong breakout above the all-important $100,000 mark. It's important to note that trading volumes on Coinbase (COIN), the largest crypto exchange in the United States, have declined since bitcoin's move higher started in early April, indicating larger market participants may be sitting out the current rally. Let's identify two crucial overhead areas on bitcoin's chart worth watching while also locating key support levels to monitor. The first overhead area to watch sits around $107,000. This location will likely attract significant attention near the prominent December and January peaks that marked a double top pattern on the chart. Investors can forecast an overhead area to watch above the cryptocurrency's record high by using bars pattern analysis. To apply this technique, we take the price bars comprising bitcoin's move higher that preceded the recent consolidation period and reposition them from today's breakout point. Following today's breakout above this key psychological area, the region may flip from prior resistance into future support. This region finds a confluence of support from the nearby upward sloping 200-day MA and a trendline that connects a range of corresponding trading activity on the chart stretching back to late November last year.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Launching Summer 2025, T-Rex's built-in distribution engine introduces a radically simple idea: rewarding people seamlessly for doing what they already love online. “Arbitrum Gaming Ventures recognizes the transformative potential of platforms like T-Rex that are expanding Web3 beyond DeFi. EVG's strong regional influence and deep understanding of the Southeast Asian market, projected to reach $7 billion by 2028, provide a strategic gateway for us to significantly scale our footprint within this high-growth region. Combining our robust scaling capabilities with EVG's extensive ecosystem expertise, we are strategically positioned to penetrate the entertainment industry and broader consumer market in a pivotal and rapidly expanding part of the world,” said Dan Peng, Partner at Arbitrum Gaming Ventures. ​​T-Rex leverages Arbitrum's powerful Layer-2 scaling solution, delivering ultra-fast, secure, and low-cost transactions essential for consumer-scale adoption. Arbitrum Gaming Ventures has specifically identified T-Rex as key to its regional growth strategy. (UI screenshot: A user earning rewards while browsing YouTube with T-Rex's browser extension.) T-Rex flips the model with its simple first principle: stop trying to reinvent user habits and instead enhance them invisibly. Its core innovation, Proof-of-Engagement (PoE) mechanism, automatically rewards users on apps they already use daily through a privacy-preserving browser extension, turning everyday online actions like watching videos, liking posts, and sharing memes into tangible, valuable digital ownership and offline perks. Our blockchain stays invisible, letting them effortlessly turn their online fun into meaningful rewards. (UI screenshot: Home Discovery pushing relevant content and dApps to user.) At launch, users simply install T-Rex's browser extension and continue browsing popular social media platforms. “The next wave of breakout applications will be defined by distribution, UI / UX, and product differentiation. They're building a protocol that seamlessly onboards social media users and allows them to monetize their data through network rewards. We're excited to back T-Rex as they merge protocol-native network design with clean consumer product expertise,” said Evan Fisher, Founder and General Partner of Portal Ventures. “Web3 infrastructure has matured, but it still lacks consumer momentum because only a few use cases resonate with the masses. The $8 million Incubation Fund backed by EVG with support from the Arbitrum Gaming Ventures will accelerate ecosystem growth, offering comprehensive developer support beyond capital, including engineering resources, media partnerships, community activations, premium events, Key Opinion Leader (KOL) networks, and strategic Intellectual Property (IP) applications. “We provide real firepower, not just capital”, Joyce Yim, Co-founder of T-Rex emphasised. “Developers gain immediate user traffic, creators grow loyal audiences effortlessly, and users become not just spectators, but stakeholders in the success of viral content.” Set to launch in Summer 2025, T-Rex's distribution layer and browser extension create the railroads linking popular online consumer applications such as gaming, music, interactive media, and Web3. From creators rewarding top users with digital assets, to new projects gaining instant discovery, to active users earning a stake, T-Rex's ecosystem is designed for intuitive use, cultural resonance, and economic empowerment at scale. T-Rex is a new blockchain ecosystem purpose-built for consumer-facing applications, designed to transform the Web3 attention layer through its innovative Proof of Engagement (PoE) mechanism. With 200+ engineers and 10+ millions of users, EVG has built a complex of innovative products across consumer infrastructures (e.g Edgen AI, T-Rex), entertainment / culture dApps (e.g Deek, Last Odyssey, LiveArt), and fintech platforms (e.g Aspen Digital). EVG's corporate venture arm also owns strategic stakes across 100+ Web3 companies including the likes of Celestia, Wormhole, Berachain, Pudgy Penguins, Abstract, Infinex, Dapper Labs, Animoca Brands, The Sandbox, Stacks, Immutable, Kraken and Dunamu.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) short traders took a major hit on Thursday, sparking nearly $1 billion in crypto liquidations. The value may be understated, considering Coinglass' aggregated liquidation data from exchanges delays a few hours. Bitcoin accounted for $416 million in liquidations as the sudden price rebound caught short sellers off guard. The largest liquidated position occurred on Binance, wiping out a BTC/USDT trade worth $11.97 million. Despite the increased bullish sentiment dominating the market, Bitcoin's march to $102,000 could have mixed implications for its price, according to an X post from on-chain analytical platform Santiment. However, similar crypto rallies in the past have been halted due to increased calls of "higher or above like we're seeing now," the analysts wrote. The asset saw significant sell pressure following a negative price response to the Pectra upgrade, with many traders rotating into meme coins and urging others to do the same, noted Santiment analysts. Santiment noted that the turnaround came as crowd sentiment hit heightened negative levels, a dynamic that has historically preceded strong price recoveries. The crypto market rally began following President Donald Trump's announcement of a trade agreement with the United Kingdom (UK) to ease some of the tariffs imposed on British goods on Liberation Day.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This timely initiative introduces a Four-Pillar Framework for the responsible adoption of crypto currencies in Pakistan and outlines a strategic Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) Development and Regulatory Launch Plan. In view of the rapidly evolving global landscape of digital finance and crypto investments, ICMAP's proposal serves as a much-needed foundation for Pakistan's policy direction. The Four-Pillar Framework focuses on key dimensions necessary for crypto integration, each supported by international case studies to guide implementation. This includes full compliance with Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Counter-Terrorism Financing (CFT) measures, as well as lessons from other jurisdictions that have effectively implemented such frameworks. The second pillar advocates for alignment with global crypto and blockchain standards. The third pillar calls for active industry-government collaboration to encourage responsible innovation while maintaining financial stability. ICMAP highlights that close coordination between regulators and industry stakeholders is essential to strike a balance between enabling innovation and safeguarding the economy. The included case study illustrates how a country effectively fostered such cooperation, promoting growth while ensuring regulatory oversight. A case study demonstrates how another country implemented robust consumer safeguards in the crypto sector, ensuring both user confidence and market stability. Complementing the crypto framework, ICMAP has proposed a structured Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) Development and Regulatory Launch Plan. Recognizing the need for a state-backed digital alternative to crypto currencies, this plan recommends that the State Bank of Pakistan introduce a CBDC to enhance regulatory control, reduce volatility, and expand financial inclusion. The proposal also reflects on global investment trends, noting that crypto currencies have attracted investors due to their higher returns compared to traditional stock markets and real interest rates. As more countries increase their exposure to digital assets, ICMAP believes Pakistan must take strategic steps to prepare for the financial future. The document also provides valuable insights into global developments in CBDC implementation, drawing lessons from countries at the forefront of digital currency adoption. Through this initiative, ICMAP reaffirms its role as a leading policy advisor and thought leader in Pakistan's financial landscape. The Institute remains committed to supporting policymakers in developing forward-looking, well-regulated frameworks that enable innovation, protect consumers, and preserve economic stability.</p>
