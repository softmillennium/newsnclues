                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Results also showed drinking water from groundwater service areas with a golf course was associated with almost a twofold increased risk for the disease. The study results imply that both vulnerable drinking water and airborne pollutant exposure may contribute to the risk of developing PD near golf courses, study investigator Brittany Krzyzanowski, PhD, assistant professor, Barrow Neurological Institute, Phoenix, told Medscape Medical News. However, she cautioned that because the study is observational it cannot establish causality, so it is too early to recommend that individuals move away from golf courses. The study was published online on May 8 in JAMA Network Open. PD is likely caused by a complex interaction between genetic predisposition and environmental factors, including pesticide exposure. Previous research showed pesticides such as paraquat and rotenone induce Parkinson-like neurodegeneration in the substantia nigra, primarily through mechanisms involving oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and dopaminergic neuron apoptosis. One anecdotal report has suggested that living near golf courses may increase the risk for PD. However, few studies have explored the role of pesticide exposure from golf courses on PD risk, said Krzyzanowski. Using the Rochester Epidemiology Project (REP) medical records linkage system, researchers identified patients with PD in Olmstead County, Minnesota, from 1991 to 2015. The study included 419 individuals with PD, median age of 73 years at diagnosis and 61% men, who were compared with 5113 age- and sex-matched control individuals without the disease. Researchers collected data on 139 golf courses in the 27-county study region. Using satellite imagery, they manually digitized golf course data to confirm the correct placement of golf course boundaries in 2013, the earliest year relevant data were available. After adjusting for age, sex, race and ethnicity, index year (date of PD symptom onset for cases), household income, and urban or rural category, the study found living within one mile of a golf course was associated with 126% increased odds of PD (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 2.26; 95% CI, 1.09- 4.70; P = .03) compared with those living more than 6 miles from a golf course. A sensitivity analysis showed the link between proximity to golf course and PD was stronger in urban areas. Researchers also assessed whether individuals received their drinking water from groundwater sources located either with, or without, a golf course or from private wells. Overall, 77.3% of the study population lived in areas served by groundwater-based water systems. They noted that pesticides used on golf courses can seep into groundwater, potentially contaminating drinking water supplies. Results showed that individuals receiving tap water from groundwater service areas with a golf course had nearly a twofold increased risk for PD compared with those in groundwater areas without golf courses (aOR, 1.96; 95% CI, 1.20-3.23). The investigators also determined whether water services areas were within a vulnerable groundwater region, defined as those with coarse texture soils, shallow bedrock, or karst geology. The analysis showed that individuals whose tap water was from service areas with a golf course located in vulnerable groundwater regions were 82% more likely to have PD compared with those in similar areas with a golf course but nonvulnerable groundwater (aOR, 1.82; 95% CI, 1.09-3.03). In addition, the lack of occupational history data may have led to exposure misclassification, as some individuals may have spent significant time away from their home address. “This would not only affect participants' exposure but also suggests their Parkinson's could have started before they moved around a golf course,” he said. He also noted that the drinking water wasn't analyzed for pesticide levels. Commenting on the research for Medscape Medical News, Michael S. Okun, MD, Adelaide Lackner professor of Neurology, University of Florida, and executive director, Norman Fixel Institute for Neurological Diseases, both in Gainesville, Florida, said the study's findings “highlight a clear and urgent need to re-evaluate pesticide use on golf courses.” Okun, who is also medial advisor for the Parkinson's Foundation said the link between proximity to golf courses and increased PD risk is “striking.” “These results raise concerns about how chemicals applied for aesthetics may silently shape neurological health,” he said. The fact that pesticides used to keep golf courses pristine may be seeping into local water supplies and increasing PD risk “is a hidden hazard we can no longer ignore,” said Okun. Krzyzanowski, Okun, and Dexter reported no relevant conflicts of interest.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>They found that patients with cancer, on average, had a higher FaceAge than those without and appeared about five years older than their chronological age. Older FaceAge predictions were associated with worse overall survival outcomes across multiple cancer types. They also found that FaceAge outperformed clinicians in predicting short-term life expectancies of patients receiving palliative radiotherapy. We can use artificial intelligence (AI) to estimate a person's biological age from face pictures, and our study shows that information can be clinically meaningful. This work demonstrates that a photo like a simple selfie contains important information that could help to inform clinical decision-making and care plans for patients and clinicians. How old someone looks compared to their chronological age really matters-individuals with FaceAges that are younger than their chronological ages do significantly better after cancer therapy." Hugo Aerts, PhD, co-senior and corresponding author, director of the Artificial Intelligence in Medicine (AIM) program at Mass General Brigham Those intuitive assessments combined with a patient's chronological age, in addition to many other biological measures, may help determine the best course of treatment. However, like anyone, physicians may have biases about a person's age that may influence them, fueling a need for more objective, predictive measures to inform care decisions. With that goal in mind, Mass General Brigham investigators leveraged deep learning and facial recognition technologies to train FaceAge. The tool was trained on 58,851 photos of presumed healthy individuals from public datasets. Results showed that cancer patients appear significantly older than those without cancer, and their FaceAge, on average, was about five years older than their chronological age. In the cancer patient cohort, older FaceAge was associated with worse survival outcomes, especially in individuals who appeared older than 85, even after adjusting for chronological age, sex, and cancer type. Estimated survival time at the end of life is difficult to pin down but has important treatment implications in cancer care. The team asked 10 clinicians and researchers to predict short-term life expectancy from 100 photos of patients receiving palliative radiotherapy. While there was a wide range in their performance, overall, the clinicians' predictions were only slightly better than a coin flip, even after they were given clinical context, such as the patient's chronological age and cancer status. Yet when clinicians were also provided with the patient's FaceAge information, their predictions improved significantly. Further research is needed before this technology could be considered for use in a real-world clinical setting. The research team is testing this technology to predict diseases, general health status, and lifespan. Follow-up studies include expanding this work across different hospitals, looking at patients in different stages of cancer, tracking FaceAge estimates over time, and testing its accuracy against plastic surgery and makeup data sets. "This opens the door to a whole new realm of biomarker discovery from photographs, and its potential goes far beyond cancer care or predicting age," said co-senior author Ray Mak, MD, a faculty member in the AIM program at Mass General Brigham. "As we increasingly think of different chronic diseases as diseases of aging, it becomes even more important to be able to accurately predict an individual's aging trajectory. I hope we can ultimately use this technology as an early detection system in a variety of applications, within a strong regulatory and ethical framework, to help save lives."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Acetaminophen is the most frequently taken fever and pain medication worldwide, but overdosing can be toxic to liver cells. In the United States, about 1,600 cases of acute liver failure and 500 deaths occur each year due to acetaminophen overuse and liver failure. Although the liver has a remarkable potential to regenerate and recover from injury, scientists are seeking to better understand how this happens after acetaminophen toxicity. Liver regeneration has been studied for decades, primarily through removing sections of the organ, yet there is still controversy among researchers regarding the source of new liver cells, and whether they originate from stem cells in the liver or from pre-existing mature liver cells which start multiplying after injury. A deeper understanding of mechanisms at play is essential to come up with strategies to boost liver regeneration in patients. Towards this goal, Tomomi Aoyagi and colleagues from Kyushu University, Japan, studied the behavior of single cells in the mouse liver after acetaminophen injury and noticed that regeneration likely originated from a specific type of cell. The work was recently published in Stem Cell Reports. In their experiments, mature liver cells which were in direct contact with injured or dying cells transitioned to a more immature state and started to divide rapidly. Direct contact to damaged tissue was crucial for this transition, suggesting that signals from dead or dying cells instructs neighboring cells to start a regenerative program. Importantly, the researchers found a similar population of immature, dividing liver cells adjacent to injured tissue in biopsies from patients with drug-induced liver injury, suggesting that liver regeneration in humans follows similar principles. Understanding how injured tissues instructs the neighboring cells to start a repair program may lead to more effective treatments for drug-induced liver injury and insights into strategies to treat liver failure, which can only be cured by transplantation. Two types of regenerative cell populations appear in acute liver injury. Learn how experts are advancing benzodiazepine analysis and detection using insights from the lab.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Lingering post-COVID symptoms are more than a nuisance, they're independently linked to poorer physical, mental, and daily functioning across all U.S. states, highlighting urgent needs for targeted care and recovery strategies. In a recent study published in the journal PLoS One, a group of researchers evaluated how post-Coronavirus Disease (COVID) conditions (PCCs) affect health-related quality of life (HRQL) among COVID-19 survivors in the United States. For millions of Americans, recovering from COVID-19 is only the beginning. Nearly one in four survivors experience lingering symptoms like fatigue, brain fog, dizziness, and pain that persist for months and interfere with daily life. While early studies have hinted at the burden PCCs place on individuals, their full impact on health-related quality of life remains poorly understood. Researchers analyzed data from the 2022 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), a national survey led by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which gathers health information via telephone from United States (U.S.) adults. They focused on individuals who had previously tested positive for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), excluding those with only at-home diagnoses or incomplete responses. Participants were divided into two groups: those reporting PCCs, defined as symptoms persisting at least three months after acute COVID-19, and those without. Sociodemographic characteristics, comorbidities, and behavioral habits (such as physical activity, smoking, and sleep patterns) were also recorded. Advanced statistical techniques, including multivariate logistic regression and data imputation via random forest modeling, were used to adjust for missing data and confounding factors. Survey weights and design adjustments were applied to reflect the U.S. adult population. The association between PCCs and unfavorable self-reported general health (SRGH) was analyzed after accounting for all relevant variables. The researchers noted that the BRFSS relies on self-reported data, which may be subject to recall bias or reporting inaccuracies. Additionally, some variables that could influence PCC risk and outcomes, such as vaccination status, medications, or the timing and severity of initial COVID-19 infection, were not available in the dataset. Institutionalized individuals were not included in the survey, and the HRQL questions were not based on a standardized questionnaire. These limitations should be considered when interpreting the study's results. The study included 108,237 adults with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, representing over 70 million Americans. Individuals with PCCs were more likely to be female, middle-aged, obese, physically inactive, and report lower income and poor sleep habits. Overall, 25.7% of those with PCCs rated their general health as “fair” or “poor,” compared to 15.5% of those without PCCs. These individuals also reported more days of poor mental and physical health, as well as greater disruption in daily activities. In adjusted regression models, having PCCs was independently associated with a 39% higher likelihood of unfavorable general health (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 1.39, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.28–1.52, p < 0.001). When examining symptoms, dizziness on standing (38%), mood disorders (36.3%), and musculoskeletal pain (34.1%) were most strongly linked with poor health ratings. Conversely, symptoms like loss of taste or smell were less likely to impair overall well-being. Among those with PCCs, further analysis revealed that certain factors increased the risk of poor general health. Socioeconomic factors, including lower education and income, single marital status, and Hispanic ethnicity, were independently associated with worse outcomes. Interestingly, while women with PCCs were more likely to report poor health, gender was not a significant factor after statistical adjustment. State-level analysis showed that regions like West Virginia, Kentucky, and Oregon reported the highest rates of impaired general health, underscoring geographic disparities in long COVID impact. The study also emphasized that while PCCs were more prevalent among younger adults, the association between PCCs and impaired quality of life was particularly strong among those in their late middle age (45–64 years old). This highlights the complex relationship between age, risk of PCCs, and their impact on daily functioning. To summarize, post-COVID conditions are linked to significantly reduced health-related quality of life across the U.S., affecting physical, mental, and daily functioning. Individuals with chronic illnesses, obesity, lower socioeconomic status, or unhealthy lifestyle habits are particularly vulnerable. The authors also call for further research to better understand and address the limitations of current data sources and to optimize support for those living with PCCs. As the pandemic's acute phase recedes, addressing the hidden burden of PCCs becomes essential for national health planning.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Mor than 800 million people worldwide are living with diabetes, according to World Health Organization (WHO) estimates, with numbers steadily increasing. Diabetic patients experience abnormally high levels of blood sugar, which can, over the long-term, damage organs and decrease the quality of life and life expectancy of patients. Blood sugar levels are controlled by cells in the pancreas called beta-cells which secrete insulin to lower blood glucose levels. A precisely tuned secretion of insulin versus glucagon is required to keep blood sugar at the right level. While much research has focused on understanding beta-cell dysfunction in diabetic patients, it has become clear that alpha-cells are also affected in diabetes. Lab-based models of human alpha cells are crucial for understanding alpha-cell (dys)function and blood sugar regulation. Recently, Quinn Peterson and colleagues from Mayo Clinic, USA, discovered a method for making human alpha cells from cultures of immature stem cells. This work was recently published in Stem Cell Reports. These stem cell-derived alpha cells very closely resembled pancreas-derived alpha cells and secreted comparable levels of glucagon. Importantly, like alpha cells in diabetic patients, the stem cell-derived alpha cells responded to culture conditions mimicking a diabetic environment with elevated glucagon secretion and dysregulation of alpha cell gene expression and physiology. Encouragingly, abnormal glucagon secretion of these cells was reversed by a drug called Sunitinib (a clinically approved anti-cancer drug). The human alpha cells described in this research will be a useful model to understand diabetic alpha cell dysfunction and to screen for new therapeutics.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In a global trial of over 2,500 patients, obicetrapib dramatically reduced LDL cholesterol levels when added to standard lipid-lowering therapy, offering new hope for those at highest cardiovascular risk. Study: Safety and Efficacy of Obicetrapib in Patients at High Cardiovascular Risk. Multiple clinical trials have shown that lowering LDL cholesterol levels decreases the risk of cardiovascular events. The class of drugs known as cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) inhibitors, to which obicetrapib belongs, has been explored for its potential to modify cholesterol levels. However, the development of CETP inhibitors has faced significant challenges; for instance, torcetrapib was associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and other agents like dalcetrapib and evacetrapib were discontinued due to a lack of efficacy in improving cardiovascular outcomes. These past experiences have guided the development of newer agents like obicetrapib, which has a hydrophilic design intended to avoid some off-target effects and focuses on robust LDL cholesterol reduction in addition to raising HDL cholesterol. Low-intensity or high-intensity statin therapy focuses on lowering LDL cholesterol. Combination therapy can help lower LDL cholesterol levels in patients at very high risk of cardiovascular events. However, the usage of combination lipid-lowering therapy is low, as evidenced by observational studies, which implies that more high-risk patients will receive inadequate treatment and potentially experience adverse cardiovascular outcomes. Early trials have shown that obicetrapib lowers LDL cholesterol levels and raises high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels. When added to a maximum tolerated dose of lipid-lowering therapy, it can also help high-risk patients achieve LDL cholesterol treatment goals. Besides studying the effect of obicetrapib on lipid levels, examining its side effects and safety profile among patients at high risk of cardiovascular events is essential. This study conducted a randomized, multinational, placebo-controlled trial with individuals aged 18 years or above. Participants had to have a history of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease or heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia and be on maximum tolerated doses of lipid-lowering therapy. Genotyping or clinical criteria were used to diagnose heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia. Patients were eligible if they had an LDL cholesterol level of 100 mg per deciliter or higher or a non-high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol level of 130 mg per deciliter or higher. Alternatively, individuals with an LDL cholesterol level of 55 to 100 mg per deciliter or a non-HDL cholesterol level of 85 to 130 mg per deciliter were also eligible if they had at least one additional cardiovascular risk factor. The groups received either 10 mg of obicetrapib once daily or a matching placebo for 365 days. From December 2021 through August 2023, across multiple sites in China, Europe, Japan, and the United States, 2530 patients were randomly assigned to receive obicetrapib or placebo, of which 292 discontinued prematurely. PCSK9 inhibitors were being administered to 4% of patients. At baseline, the average LDL and HDL levels were 98 mg per decilitre and 49 mg per decilitre, respectively. A difference between groups of −32.6 percentage points was observed. At day 84, approximately 27.9% and 1.1% of patients in the obicetrapib and placebo groups exhibited LDL cholesterol levels below 40 mg per decilitre. Similarly, 51.0% and 8.0% of patients in the obicetrapib and placebo groups exhibited LDL cholesterol levels less than 55 mg per decilitre. The percentage of patients with LDL cholesterol levels below 70 mg per deciliter was 68.4% and 27.5% in the obicetrapib and placebo groups, respectively. A secondary endpoint favored obicetrapib over placebo. The current study also estimated between-group differences in the apolipoprotein B level to be −18.9 percentage points at day 84, −18.3 percentage points at day 180, and −13.8 percentage points at day 365. A similar trend of reduction in between-group differences was observed in the non-HDL cholesterol level (−29.4 percentage points at day 84), lipoprotein(a) level (−33.5 percentage points at day 84), and triglyceride level (−7.8 percentage points at day 84). Conversely, obicetrapib led to significant increases in HDL cholesterol level (136.3 percentage points difference at day 84) and total cholesterol level (17.7 percentage points difference at day 84). However, there were no apparent differences in the rates or severity of adverse events between the groups. The paper also reported on 'adverse events of special interest.' Liver-enzyme abnormalities (alanine or aspartate aminotransferase levels >3 times the upper limit of normal) occurred in 0.6% of obicetrapib patients versus 0.9% in placebo patients, and muscle enzyme abnormalities (creatine kinase >5 times the upper limit of normal) occurred in 0.3% versus 0.4%, respectively. Worsening kidney function (defined as a decrease from baseline of more than 25% in the estimated glomerular filtration rate) was noted in 6.8% of obicetrapib patients compared to 8.3% in the placebo group. The most frequently reported adverse events overall included COVID-19, hypertension, and upper respiratory tract infections, with similar incidences between groups. In 4.2% and 5.2% of patients belonging to the obicetrapib and placebo groups, respectively, experienced cardiovascular events, such as deaths from coronary heart disease, nonfatal myocardial infarction, coronary revascularization, or stroke. The current study revealed that obicetrapib treatment could effectively reduce LDL cholesterol levels by a placebo-adjusted 32.6 percentage points at day 84, among patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia or atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease who are at high risk of cardiovascular events. In the future, more clinical studies are required to determine the efficacy of this agent in preventing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, and the paper notes that a large, long-term cardiovascular outcomes trial is currently underway.
