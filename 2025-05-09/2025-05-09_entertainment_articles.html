                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>NBC will pitch its new and returning fall series to advertisers at Monday's upfront. Night Court aired its third season finale, which will now serve as a series ender, on Tuesday — although sources say Warner Bros. TV, which produces the show with Universal TV, may try to find a new home for the series. John Larroquette reprised his role from the original series as attorney Dan Fielding; the season three cast also includes Lacretta, Nyambi Nyambi and Wendie Malick. Marsha Warfield made several appearances as Roz, her character in the prior series.

Creator and showrunner Debby Wolfe (The Conners, One Day at a Time) executive produces with Bruce Helford, George Lopez, Michael Rotenberg and Katie Newman. NBC will likely reduce the number of primetime hours devoted to entertainment programming next season as it makes room for primetime NBA telecasts.

Ahmir “Questlove” Thompson had a tall order to one-up himself after he and producer Joseph Patel won the Best Documentary Feature Oscar in 2022 for “Summer of Soul.” But he found it with “Sly Lives!,” the story of Sly Stone and his revolutionary music with Sly & the Family Stone. Asking the 20 or so artists who appear in “Sly Lives!” about that — from Jimmy Jam to D'Angelo to André 3000 — Questlove had a realization: It's “probably the most frightening question they've ever been asked,” he said at a Q&A for the film, which occurred at IndieWire's Pass the Remote event, presented by Disney and Hulu. The screening and Q&A at Vidiots Foundation in Los Angeles on May 3 drew a packed house, and Questlove and Patel both mingled with attendees afterward at the beer and wine reception in the lobby that followed, much as the interviewees did for our previous Pass the Remote panels in April about casting and TV music. Related Stories Sony and Tom Rothman Agree to Multi-Year Contract Extension Film Independent Spirit Awards Unveils New 2026 Location Away from the Beach Amid L.A. Summer Olympics Prep Questlove said that asking that question of his interviewees was like “Jedi mind tricking people.” Stone's life meandered from extraordinary creative highs to long periods of creative inactivity marked by questionable choices, in his career and in his life. “What we're not trying to do is pile on,” Questlove said. (See photos from all our 2025 Pass the Remote events here.) “It would've been so easy just to tell the worst stories and the worst experiences and take advantage of peoples' poor choices in life just to benefit our film and tell a more sensational story,” the director continued. “Especially with Black artists, they're not treated as human beings. Even the Family Stone members [we interviewed] were like, ‘Boy, what is this? A lot of them aren't asked half the time how they feel. I put out feelers to about 19, 20 of my peers. And a lot of them didn't want to do it because they couldn't allow themselves to go there. Some agreed to do it and then day of, hours before were like, ‘Are you showing up? Needless to say there was a lot of anxiety there, because the experience of having to be all things to all people as a Black artist — while putting the best foot forward to represent Black excellence — and continually delivering at the highest level, is pretty universal. With all of that pressure, fissures can reveal themselves. “This is also Lauryn Hill's story,” Questlove said. Why are you purposely trying to mess this up? But there's so much under the surface that we have to explore it. And I think that's frightening for people sometimes.” Producer Patel added, “D'Angelo [who's interviewed in the film] also suffered through some of the same things Sly did when he was successful, he put out one album and everyone called him the next Marvin Gaye. And then he does Voodoo and he releases a single, ‘How Does It Feel?,' with a video that people can't stop talking about. We spent a lot of time in pre-production figuring out who are the people that could speak to Sly's story as proxies.” “Sly Lives!” is fundamentally more concerned with his impact and influence on other artists — one sequence narrated by Jimmy Jam showing how “Dance to the Music” influenced “Rhythm Nation” is particularly extraordinary — and what he represents about Black artistry, than it is about parsing his biography. “When we really actually set out to work on this, I asked Ahmir, ‘What's the story? And I think for us and the films that we do together, it's about one specific thing, but really something that resonates more to a bigger idea. And so he, Ahmir, in the very first conversation was like, ‘It's about Sly, but it's really about the burden of Black genius. The film is also about how artists are remembered, and the particular set of circumstances that result in certain artists being particularly celebrated. It makes a convincing case Sly Stone is one of the most influential artists of all time… so why isn't he revered even more? But also the fact that he's still alive is important. because had he passed away at 27, like a lot of people of his generation, famous and on top, would we revere him more? And it's like he… Ahmir also talks about the run of genius. He talks about how most artists have a genius run of max seven years. And then a lot of those artists that he's referencing died before we could find out. Sly didn't, and Sly probably had more down years than up years, but does that mean he's any less of a genius?

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>One of the new pope's brothers has given an interview to a Chicago TV station, shedding light on how Cardinal Robert Prevost prepared for the Vatican conclave that elected him pontiff. Turns out the prelate boned up with help from an Oscar-nominated film. White Smoke Above The Vatican: A New Pope Elected By Conclave Prevost explained, “I wanted to take his mind off of it [the real conclave], you know, laugh about something because this is now an awesome responsibility.” The drama-thriller directed by Edward Berger and starring Ralph Fiennes, John Lithgow, Stanley Tucci, Isabella Rossellini, and Carlos Diehz, presents a fictional story of intrigue over the selection of a new pope to lead the Roman Catholic Church. After numerous ballots, a surprise candidate becomes the Vicar of Christ. In the real conclave that ended Thursday, Cardinal Prevost was also considered by many observers to be an unlikely choice given that no American had ever been named pope. Even the Chicago-native Prevost apparently doubted his odds of being chosen. “I didn't believe it and Rob didn't believe it – I should say Pope Leo didn't believe it at all, because there's not going to be an American pope was the attitude.” On the other hand, Prevost did think his brother was under serious consideration. “What I was reading and what I was hearing was that there were three outstanding candidates that were in first, second and third place,” he noted, “the cardinal from the Philippines, the [Vatican] secretary of state, and him [Robert].” However, John Prevost offered some insight into how his younger likes to take a break from weighty ecclesiastical issues when the two get a chance to talk. “First we do Wordle, because this is a regular thing, okay,” he explained. It's something to keep his mind off life in the real world.” Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Pearl Jam brought out surprise guest Peter Frampton during their concert Thursday in Nashville, with the two Rock Hall-inducted artists linking up for a rendition of the band's “Black.” “This gentleman was someone we looked up to before the Ramones. He's such an incredible human being on top of it. It is our honor, because at this point he's become a good friend to the group. Frampton, a longtime resident of Nashville, then joined the band to perform the Ten classic, wailing away alongside McCready on guitar solos that included Vedder teasing Frampton's own “Do You Feel Like We Do.” Frampton will embark on a North American tour later this month, six years after the guitarist announced a farewell tour due to his battle with inclusion body myositis. MAGA Melts Down Over New Pope's Anti-Trump, Pro-Immigrant Social Media People Are Losing Loved Ones to AI-Fueled Spiritual Fantasies I'm just a person who is out there, doing the best he can, and bringing awareness to IBM [inclusion body myositis], raising money where I can. We've got a lovely foundation at Johns Hopkins, the Peter Frampton Fund. People are still sending in money, which is wonderful. I'm raising money for them so we can find that magic bullet,” Frampton told Rolling Stone in 2024. It looks like something could be coming around the corner. Rolling Stone is a part of Penske Media Corporation.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>All of the Backstreet Boys voted for Baylee Littrell when he competed on season 23 of “American Idol,” but it wasn't enough to keep member Brian Littrell's son from going home. Baylee auditioned with his parents in tow and made it to the top 20 of “American Idol.” He was sent home on April 21 after viewer votes weren't enough to get him through to the top 14 and judges Luke Bryan, Carrie Underwood, and Lionel Richie opted not to save him. When ET correspondent Cassie DiLaura asked Brian about how proud he was of his son's journey on May 8, he immediately got choked up, telling her, “I mean, you can't really put it in words. BSB member Kevin Richardson chimed in, “He's a talented young man. On May 2, Baylee told CCM Magazine that “American Idol” producers had encouraged him to audition for four years before he finally said yes. “I've been doing music on my own for really the past, like six years, seven years, mostly spending my time in Nashville and touring,” Baylee said. “But it just never was really working out like I had hoped. “People barely know my name,” the college student acknowledged. “They just know my background or where I come from. During my time in the industry, people would try to sign me, then find out where I come from, and never talk to me again.” But Baylee was nervous about auditioning for a TV show, telling CCM, “I didn't want to be a viral bad moment on American Idol. I didn't want to not get the golden ticket. Brian told ET that Baylee will soon release “Hey Jesus” as a single, a faith-driven song he wrote at age 19 and performed during Hollywood Week. A big common misconception is that God won't let us fall down.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The case claims the superstar and his team have "turned a blind eye" to copyright infringement and left a lesser-known artist with "no choice but to file this lawsuit." Bad Bunny is facing a lawsuit over allegations that a track from his chart-topping Un Verano Sin Ti featured an unlicensed sample from a Nigerian artist – and that the superstar's reps later “stonewalled” efforts to resolve the problem. Dera's lawyers say they've raised the issue with reps for Bad Bunny and others behind the song, but that they've “turned a blind eye” and left him with “no choice but to file this lawsuit.” “It is not very often that a musical artist of Bad Bunny's caliber and sophistication uses someone else's music without permission, and then ignores the person's efforts to resolve the problem,” writes Dera's attorney Robert A. Jacobs, a litigator at the top music law firm Manatt Phelps & Phillips. Released in 2022, Un Verano Sin Ti was a mega-hit – spending 13 weeks atop the Billboard 200 and more than 150 weeks total on the album chart. “Enséñame a Bailar” was a hit in its own right, charting on the Hot 100 for two weeks and earning 72 million views on YouTube. In his lawsuit, Dera says Bad Bunny's song was essentially built on top of his “Empty My Pocket” – that the usage is so “extensive” that the sampling itself is “beyond question.” They claim access to Dera's song was provided by a producer named Lakizo (Lekan Adesina), but that he had no authority to clear the use of the sample: “Lakizo … is not an author of ‘Empty My Pocket' … and does not have – and never had – the right to prepare or authorize others to prepare derivative works.” “Despite plaintiffs' cooperation, these defendants stonewalled plaintiffs after receiving the requested information, making clear that plaintiffs' only option for obtaining redress for the violation of their rights would be through the courts,” Dera's lawyers write.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The stage design somewhat resembled the diamond design of Lamar's Super Bowl halftime set, with a giant stage leading out toward three smaller bases. From my stage-right vantage point, I could see how the two used the stage's angles to project a panoramic view of certain visuals. For SZA, there were multiple serene landscapes aiding her dreamy catalog, while Lamar used videos of himself in March 1992 during “DNA,” and hammered home his attack on Drake's identity with a collage of Black iconography during “Not Like Us.” Lamar came out first, rising from a black Grand National car below the stage and tearing into “Wacced Out Murals” (the Grand National SZA rose from was naturally covered with ivy). The two alternated between sets all night with a slick interplay. Lamar turned the mood down with “Man at the Garden,” leading into SZA's “Scorsese Baby Daddy,” while she ended her solo set with “Kiss Me More,” leading into Lamar's final tracks; they also had moments when they did collaborations such as “30 for 30” and “Luther.” Their switches also gave the two time to switch attire multiple times. While Lamar alternated from a mostly camo fit, putting his jacket on and off, SZA was in full starlet mode, with four different outfits. SZA stuck to lights and fireworks, whereas Lamar had fireballs going off, especially during his Drake disses. It seems like Lamar's more recent output got the most recognition. He even noted the dynamic, jokingly telling fans to turn to their neighbors, church-style, and ask if they knew one of his earlier singles. I've seen Lamar play arenas and festival stages multiple times, and he carried the same craft into his stadium show, delving into his rapid-fire rhymes without missing a beat. He also introduced some flourishes for his live show, performing a new verse on “Family Ties” and remixing songs like “mA.A.d city” over Anita Baker. They popped for her pop hits, like “Kill Bill,” and for heartrending tracks, like “Nobody Gets Me,” which were all sung solidly with no backing vocals. Lamar performed his verse of “Poetic Justice,” while SZA recited her verse on “Rich Baby Daddy.” Curiously, Lamar refrained from saying “Oakland” when he rhymed “That __ show gonna be your last stop” on “Not Like Us.” But that's not to be confused with mercy. Lamar performed “Euphoria” and “Not Like Us,” with the former song inspiring his barest, most intentional usage of the giant screen behind him (placing “Lies About Me, Truth About You” in red font over a black background). And while the crowd went up for “A minor…,” and “we don't wanna hear you say nigga no more,” it wasn't a bash-Drake event. The audience seemed just as excited to sing the “Don't Kill My Vibe” chorus and “I do,” during SZA's rendition of “I Hate U.” Kendrick Lamar Leads BET Awards Nominations, Doechii, Drake, Future, GloRilla Tie Behind Him Drake's Label Wants His Revised ‘Not Like Us' Lawsuit Dismissed: Legal ‘Blather' A Year Later, No One Can Get Over the Kendrick and Drake Beef 2025 American Music Awards: Kendrick Lamar, Post Malone, Billie Eilish Lead Nominations List Both artists tore through their catalog standards, utilizing the full stage, as did dancers accompanying them in various fashions. When several women popped their asses out as Lamar rapped “Show me something natural” during “Humble,” they were a visual ad-lib. Some of them picked up SZA during one track, and bolstered her choreography on many others. MAGA Melts Down Over New Pope's Anti-Trump, Pro-Immigrant Social Media In another clip, they struggle to pronounce SZA's name, which may have something to do with her saging the room in another snippet. Their years of musical chemistry played out well onscreen and onstage. While the set lasted two and a half hours, it rarely lulled, with both doing a solid job of imbuing their set portions with energetic songs to keep the crowd into it. Lamar and SZA are seasoned veterans at this point in their respective careers, and that was reflected even during their first stadium tour.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Writer-director Jane Schoenbrun (I Saw the TV Glow) has set Hannah Einbinder (Hacks) and Gillian Anderson (Sex Education) to lead Teenage Sex and Death at Camp Miasma, their next film for Mubi, which will go into production in British Columbia this summer. Mubi Signs Global Deal With Mario Gianani & Lorenzo Mieli's Our Films Gillian Anderson Teases Conversation With Ryan Coogler About 'X-Files' Reboot: "If Anyone Were To Do It, I Think You Are The Perfect Person" Daniel Bekerman from Scythia Films is exec producing and will provide local production services. Mubi is financing the film and will distribute in select territories, including North America, Latin America, UK, Ireland, Germany, Austria, Benelux, Turkey, India, Australia, and New Zealand, with The Match Factory handling remaining worldwide sales. “I make movies I wish existed when I was a kid,” Schoenbrun said, “and Teenage Sex and Death at Camp Miasma is my best attempt at the ‘sleepover classic:' an insane yet cozy midnight odyssey that beckons to unsuspecting viewers from the horror section at the local video store. I couldn't be more excited to be heading to sleepaway camp this summer with the mad comic genius Hannah Einbinder, the legendary Gillian Anderson, and the daring folks at MUBI and Plan B, who by greenlighting this movie have summoned a plague-like flood of blood, guts, and various other fluids to rain down on us all.” Best known for starring on Max's hit comedy Hacks, Einbinder is an actor and comedian who released her debut stand-up special, Everything Must Go, on Max last year. She's repped by CAA, Cary Dobkin and David Krintzman at Yorn, Levine, Barnes. Recently starring in Netflix's Sex Education, as well as projects like Scoop, White Bird, and The Pale Blue Eye, Anderson is also in Disney's Tron: Ares, which releases October 10. Schoenbrun's most recent film, A24's I Saw the TV Glow, was nominated for six Independent Spirit Awards, including Best Picture, Screenplay and Director, as well as three Gotham Awards. Their earlier films include We're All Going to the World's Fair and A Self-Induced Hallucination. Their first novel, Public Access Afterworld, will be published by Hogarth in 2026. The filmmaker is repped by CAA, Entertainment 360, and Kimberly Jaime at Jackoway Austen. Recent and upcoming Mubi Productions include Kelly Reichardt's The Mastermind, which is premiering at Cannes, as well as Karim Aïnouz's Rosebush Pruning, and Jim Jarmusch's Father Mother Sister Brother.

It's one thing for the Virginia Tech Hokies to blast Metallica‘s “Enter Sandman” as the football team's game-day hype song when they take the field at Lane Stadium for home games. In fact, on Wednesday night (May 7) during Metallica's first-ever appearance at Lane Stadium on their M72 world tour, Hokie fans got so hyped that the Virginia Tech Seismological Observatory said the jumping up and down set off the Richter scale. The band got all into it as well, meeting up with VT football coach Brent Pry before the show, where he presented them with No. Virginia Tech fans set off the richter scale when @Metallica played "Enter Sandman" in Lane Stadium ⚡️(via @hokiesports) pic.twitter.com/fTo203oyLe A post shared by Virginia Tech Football (@hokiesfb) Metallica playing “Enter Sandman” at Virgina Tech last nightIncredible 🤘🏻 pic.twitter.com/03ZWv4wyfU A daily briefing on what matters in the music industry A daily briefing on what matters in the music industry Send us a tip using our anonymous form.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Leonardo DiCaprio made a discreet entrance at his first-ever Met Gala. DiCaprio, 50, quietly joined his 26-year-old girlfriend, Vittoria Ceretti, inside the  Metropolitan Museum of Art. For his Met Gala debut, DiCaprio wore a sleek tuxedo and bowtie to match this year's theme, “Superfine: Tailoring Black Style.” When it comes to fashion, Leonardo DiCaprio's on-screen looks are the stuff of legend. Fitting then that for the 2025 #MetGala—the actor's first ever!—DiCaprio didn't hold back. She matched the look with full-length gloves and a diamond necklace. DiCaprio's stealthy Met Gala debut quickly sparked buzz online. While some were happy to see the actor at the event, others were more critical of his sneaky moves. FINALLY,” while another commented in disbelief, “Wait…he was there..?” Others noted that the actor appeared to keep his distance from the model, with one asking, ‘Why is he always running away from her?' Meanwhile, Ceretti shared some rare insight into her relationship with DiCaprio. Ceretti is also aware of the scrutiny that comes with dating a superstar like DiCaprio. In the same interview, she finds it annoying that people label someone depending on who's more popular. DiCaprio and Ceretti first started dating rumors in August 2023.</p>
