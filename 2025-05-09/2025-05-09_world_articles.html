                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Officials float idea of compact of free association (Cofa), used by US to keep close ties with Pacific Island nations US officials are discussing a plan to pull Greenland into America's sphere of influence using a type of agreement that the United States has used to keep close ties with several Pacific Island nations, according to two US officials and another person familiar with the discussions. In exchange, the US military operates freely in Cofa countries and trade with the US is largely duty-free. Donald Trump, who during his first administration floated the idea of acquiring Greenland, has pressed even harder since taking office in January, refusing to rule out taking the island by force. The national economic council is also involved, one of those sources added. Cofa agreements have previously been inked with independent countries, and Greenland would probably need to separate from Denmark for such a plan to proceed. While polls show Greenlanders are interested in independence, surveys also show most do not want to be part of the US. A Cofa – which cedes significant autonomy to Washington – could be viewed with similar skepticism. The White House did not respond to a request for comment, nor did the Danish embassy or Greenland's representative office in Washington. The interior department, which plays a key role in administering Cofa agreements through its office of insular affairs, also did not respond. Still, such accords have hit snags in the past. Signing a Cofa also offers no guarantee that a nation will be immune from influence operations by US rivals. Danish leaders have not been approached about the idea and have not had any substantive discussions with the White House about Greenland's future status, one senior European official said. Administration officials argue the island is crucial to the US due to its deposits of minerals that have important hi-tech and military applications, but which remain untapped due to labor shortages, scarce infrastructure and various other challenges. An administration official told Reuters the US was helping Greenland diversify its economy and gain greater economic independence from Denmark. The official said a Cofa “could be an elegant way to address some of the concerns that we have when it comes to Greenland security” but did not otherwise comment on the possibility of such an accord.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The US deal on steel tariffs imposes conditions on the “nature of ownership” of British plants as part of its efforts to freeze out Chinese steel, it has emerged. Government sources say Washington is understood to be reassured that Scunthorpe is now in effect controlled by Jonathan Reynolds, the business secretary, and is likely not to come back under the direction of Jingye Group, its Chinese owners. However, before the UK government took steps to seize control of British Steel last month the US had been concerned that the Scunthorpe plant could have been used as a base for processing Chinese steel to take advantage of lower tariffs. The US-UK deal, agreed on Thursday, has come as a relief to the car and steel industries, which had been worried about job losses, although some of the terms are still unclear. “This deal has saved those jobs,” Mandelson said in an interview on CNN. Keir Starmer told ITV on Friday that the deal would be “measured in thousands and thousands of jobs that will be protected, saved and will thrive as a result” in steel, cars and in pharmaceuticals. It says: “Understanding the United Kingdom will meet these requirements, the United States will promptly construct a quota at most favored nation (MFN) rates for UK steel and aluminum and certain derivative steel and aluminum products.” Howard Lutnick, the US commerce secretary, boasted on Thursday: “The British government as part of this deal nationalised British Steel.” UK sources said the US had not pushed Britain towards nationalising British Steel but had been impressed with the action taken against its Chinese owners before Easter. Glystra said it was still not clear what the terms and conditions of the tariff exemption were or when it would kick in, underlining the admission by government sources that they settled on a quick deal to “bank progress” and save jobs in the car industry. “To fully assess the impact on our sector, we will need to fully understand the supply chain conditions that need to be met, how the quotas will be defined and when these will take effect,” Glystra added.</p>

The group beating was caught on video, provoking widespread outrage and calls for police reform. The three officers still face sentencing after they were convicted of separate federal charges, along with two other officers who pleaded guilty to the state charges and will not stand trial.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“Tabkha: Recipes From Under the Rubble” reimagines traditional Palestinian cuisine amid genocide. “Tabkha: Recipes From Under the Rubble” reimagines traditional Palestinian cuisine amid genocide. The book, which showcases 20 traditional Palestinian recipes and includes innovative alternatives born from extreme hardship, is a crucial documentation of Palestinian cultural tradition amid Israel's genocidal campaign of erasure. The streets are cluttered with trash and debris, but despite it all, we're grateful to be back in our homes and are determined to make a life here.” “It's freezing here because we have no windows to block the chilly air. Before the genocide began, Zahed ran a teaching center and her husband managed his own pharmacy while their kids attended school. We enjoyed everything around us and were on the verge of financial stability. I taught at the center from 8 am to 5 pm,” Zahed shared. I always tried to ensure that their education remained unaffected by my work or their father's, but when the war hit, everything changed.” Zahed says she'll never forget the Israeli assault's first day. Three days later, our neighborhood, known for its towers and buildings, became one of the first bombed, prompting us to evacuate as the danger drew alarmingly near to our home.” “Moreover, there was no gas, which made meal preparation incredibly time-consuming; we had to cook things in advance,” Zahed explains. Necessity demanded innovation in her recipes: “When yeast was unavailable, I experimented with fermenting dough. With no fresh fish around, I used canned tuna to create fesikh, sometimes frying it and other times baking it with vegetables. I transformed luncheon meat into various dishes, frying it or crafting it into shawarma, while canned beef became a savory grilled delight with parsley and onion. Even these meals, with their alterations borne out of need, could be logistically difficult to put together. We often spent our days eating just pieces of biscuits from aid packages, only two at a time per packet.” These extreme food shortages were not unintended by Israel, but were deliberate — “a tactic of genocide,” according to a UN report from July 2024: Tracking the geography of Israel's starvation tactics alongside Israeli officials' statements confirms its intent. Israel opened with a total siege that weakened all Palestinians in Gaza. Then, Israel used starvation to induce forcible transfer, harm and death against people in the north, pushing people into the south, only to starve, bombard and kill people in newly created refugee camps in the south. Israel has also repeatedly targeted Palestinian cooks and food aid providers, killing those who are striving to feed a starving population. Amid the longest and most encompassing blockade ever imposed on the besieged territory, international food organizations in Gaza have said their supplies are gone. Nearly 290,000 children may perish soon if food is not allowed in, Al Jazeera reported. Before conditions further plummeted, Zahed found ways to prioritize her children's nutrition. “Sometimes, I would take the leftover white rice from lunch, add spices and seasonings so that my children would accept it for dinner.” She made use of every available ingredient: “We used dry bread in lentil soup or in salads called ‘fattoush,'” showcasing her resourcefulness in ensuring her family's sustenance amid scarcity. Zahed explained to Truthout how the genocide has changed her. It has made me older and taught me many lessons, placing many responsibilities on my shoulders, yet we remained steadfast.” Those responsibilities came under the most harrowing of conditions. Even when I ask my children about their most terrifying memories of the war, they also mention this night.” “Another terrifying moment was when we fled from Deir al-Balah to Khan Younis, traversing streets filled with tanks and snipers. We truly believed that it could be our last moment. With no other choice, we pushed through, surviving by a miracle while witnessing people being injured and killed right before our eyes.” Zahed mourned the profound loss of Gaza's beauty due since October 7, 2023. “Just a day before the war erupted, I strolled along the beach, expressing to my brother how lovely Gaza was while yearning for job opportunities and development. Now, Gaza feels like a graveyard; returning home, I barely recognized the streets, filled with sorrow as if we had regressed a century. We hope for a day when it can be rebuilt.” The ongoing violence reduces us to mere figures, yet we are people deserving of a dignified life.” It is an attempt to save this heritage and traditional food even with the absence of some basic ingredients. Despite the horrors surrounding her, Zahed found she could engage with her children through food: “My children were confident in my cooking. When we stumbled upon ingredients for a meal we hadn't had in a long time, their joy was palpable as they exclaimed, ‘Mom, this is the Gazan food!' — a phrase they often repeated.” She believes that her passion for cooking reflects her people's resilience: “All recipes reflect the strength of the Palestinian woman. The war has shown us that we can find alternatives and create something from nothing. We cooked over an open fire, relying on basic staples like rice, spaghetti and soup, often only having bread once a day due to the high cost of vegetables.” During these hardships, her passion for cooking brought her joy: “Whenever I cook, I feel a sense of happiness. Even during the war, people would reach out for my recipes, and it fills me with pride to help others in this way. In the book, she included 15 traditional Palestinian recipes, covering both desserts and savory dishes. Her cookbook features a variety of dishes, including both desserts and savory meals, along with what she refers to as the “war alternatives” — all based on innovative recipes inspired by traditions passed down from her ancestors. Every culture has its guide, and when food recipes spread widely, people start getting attracted to it and start to ask who created it,” Zahed said. Maqlouba, Maftool, and Sumaqiyaa are all dishes that represent our people. Each time Palestinian food becomes a trend online and I see people from all over the world making it, I feel proud that the world knows Gaza and that we are not forgotten,” Zahed said. Zahed expressed a strong desire to restart her culinary explorations. “I want to work again on my cooking project, but gas is expensive, and other materials are hard to find.” Still, Zahed envisions a future where she has her own business — a shop to share her food, and a kitchen specifically for women. “My message to the world is that Palestinians in Gaza are humans who feel and have dreams,” Zahed said. At this moment, we are witnessing a terrifying array of anti-democratic tactics to silence political opposition, increase surveillance and expand authoritarian reach.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Pilot error was the root cause of a military helicopter crash near Pine Valley, California, last year that claimed the lives of five U.S. Marines, an investigation has found. The CH-53E Super Stallion, callsign “TIGER 43,” was conducting a routine flight from Imperial County Airfield to Marine Corps Air Station Miramar when it crashed into a mountain ridge on Feb. 6, 2024. The investigators confirmed there was no evidence of material or mechanical failure in the helicopter. The helicopter disappeared late on Feb. 6, 2024, during a storm, and its wreckage was found the next morning near Pine Valley. Recovery efforts were disturbed by rough terrain and severe weather, and Marines stayed with the fallen until their bodies could be recovered, in keeping with the Marine Corps' tradition of never leaving a Marine behind. “We have been confronted with a tragedy that is every service family's worst fear,” Lt. Col. Nicholas J. Harvey, commanding officer of the squadron, said at the time of the accident. “The Flying Tigers family stands strong and includes the friends and community who have supported our squadron during this challenging time. We will get through this together.” The May 7 statement said the investigation faced some limitations, including the inability to access certain onboard flight data and obtain exact real-time weather information. Investigators used available data and simulations to reconstruct the events leading to the crash. While the officer's actions were not found to be a direct cause of the crash, the commanding general determined that he had demonstrated poor judgment and should have exercised greater care in his duties, according to the investigation report.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre listens to questions from journalists as he arrives on Parliament Hill for a meeting of the Conservative caucus after the federal election, in Ottawa, on May 6.Justin Tang/The Canadian Press Going into the 1921 federal election, Arthur Meighen was feeling mildly confident. Nearly all the Unionist Liberals had returned to their own party, led by William Lyon Mackenzie King. More surprising was that the Progressive Party, a loose political association formed in 1919 by farmers who had lost patience with both traditional parties, combined with farmers' parties from Ontario and Alberta to win a total of 62 seats. Like Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre, who recently lost his Ottawa-area seat in Carleton, Meighen was defeated in Manitoba's Portage la Prairie by his Progressive opponent by 177 votes. He was “not very greatly surprised by the downfall of his regime,” writes Roger Graham, Meighen's biographer, but he was “sorely disappointed by the humiliating decisiveness of its rejection at the polls.” Still, there are always second chances in Canadian politics. Meighen did contemplate resigning, but decided against it: “A man is not much good, who after a period of unbroken success, cannot stand one reverse, however sharp and decisive,” Meighen wrote to a friend. In quick order, and before King was officially prime minister, a newly elected Conservative MP in the eastern Ontario riding of Grenville accepted a low-level civil-service job and resigned his seat. When the internally divided Progressives made clear that they had no desire to serve as the Official Opposition, Grenville's new MP was asked to serve as Opposition Leader. Meighen assumed he would form a minority government, but King, as was his right, refused to relinquish power because he knew that the Progressives, who won 24 seats, would rather have him in power. And King was proven right – much to Meighen's incredulity. But like Meighen in 1921, King lost his seat in the Southern Ontario riding of York North by 494 votes to Conservative Thomas Lennox. Winning there should not be a problem: Mr. Kurek got 46,000 more votes than the second-place Liberal candidate. And though the Prime Minister could take up to six months to call the by-election, Mark Carney has said he will do so “as soon as possible.” The other important factor, for leaders in this chastened purgatory, is to understand why you lost in the first place and alter your future strategy. Neither King nor Meighen did much soul-searching and carried on, however. Both blamed a myriad of factors for their respective electoral losses – except themselves. That approach mostly turned out better for King, though, because he innately understood that in Canadian politics, extreme and inflexible policies will never sustain long-term victory at the polls. King survived the debacle of 1925, a customs scandal and his famous constitutional fight with governor-general Byng, and went on to reign for many more years. He easily won a by-election two months later in the Ontario riding of Glengarry, though he found the experience disappointing and somewhat humiliating. He lost his seat again in the 1926 federal election, and after that resigned as Conservative leader. He returned as leader during the Second World War, but a 1942 by-election loss in the Toronto-area constituency of York South ended his political career. Given Mr. Poilievre's supreme confidence and brash style, and the fact that his Conservatives won 20 more seats than they did in 2019, he seems far more likely to be a Meighen than a King. That title might work as well for Mr. Poilievre's memoir, too, should he ever write it. Authors and topics you follow will be added to your personal news feed in Following.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In Windsor, the unemployment rate jumped by 1.4 percentage points, reaching 10.7 per cent.Bill Pugliano/Getty Images Canada lost more than 30,000 manufacturing jobs last month while Windsor, Ont., saw a jump in its unemployment rate as U.S. tariffs take aim at the automotive sector and feed into economic uncertainty. Statistics Canada's Labour Force Survey on Friday said employment increased by 7,400 nationally, though that figure was padded by an increase in election-related hiring. “It doesn't take an archeological dig to realize this is a weak report,” BMO chief economist Douglas Porter wrote in a client note. “This is the first major data reading for April, and it shows that tariffs are already taking a material bite out of the economy.” Stellantis STLA-N temporarily laid off 3,800 workers after closing its Windsor plant for a week beginning May 5. Since April 3, cars imported into the United States have faced a 25-per-cent tariff based on their non-U.S. content. Windsor finds itself on the wrong side of Trump's bitter tariff spat Michael Davenport, a senior economist at Oxford Economics, said fiscal stimulus from the federal government as well as lower countertariffs will lessen the impending slowdown. “But we still think a recession is under way that will lead to 120,000 job losses and drive the unemployment rate to 7.4 per cent by the end of this year,” Mr. Davenport wrote in a client note. Friday's job report found that employees working in trade-exposed industries dependent on U.S. demand were more likely to anticipate fewer employees at their workplace over the next six months. But most employees remained confident in their own job security, with just under three in four workers surveyed saying that they disagreed or strongly disagreed that they might lose their job in the next six months. Meanwhile, average hourly wage growth slowed down last month to 3.4 per cent on an annual basis. Authors and topics you follow will be added to your personal news feed in Following.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>About 1,000 troops who have been identified as having gender dysphoria are being discharged from the military, the Department of Defense said on May 8. “Approximately 1,000 Service members who have self-identified as being diagnosed with gender dysphoria will begin the voluntary separation process.” Gender dysphoria is when a person believes they're a gender that does not match their sex. At least some of the troops with gender dysphoria have begun or finished transgender treatments in an attempt to transition to a gender different from that of their sex, according to court filings. President Donald Trump's first administration banned transgender troops. Trump said in a January order that “expressing a false ‘gender identity' divergent from an individual's sex cannot satisfy the rigorous standards necessary for military service.” The military said that troops with gender dysphoria can choose to voluntarily separate, and that if they do so, they may be eligible for voluntary separation pay. Both windows were extended, the former for 30 days and the latter for 60 days, from before. Supreme Court justices in the majority, and the three who said they would not have granted the government's emergency request for a stay pending appeal, did not offer any rationale for their decision. Darin S. Selnick, a Department of Defense undersecretary, said troops who want waivers must show there is “a compelling government interest” in retaining them “that directly supports warfighting capabilities.” Those seeking exemptions must also demonstrate they have had “36 consecutive months of stability in the Service member's sex without clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning,” that they have never attempted a gender transition, and that they are “willing and able to adhere to all applicable standards, including the standards associated with the Service member's sex.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Peter Szijjarto's announcement came after Ukraine's Security Service (SBU) allegedly dismantled a Hungarian military intelligence network operating in Zakarpattia Oblast. Moscow and Washington discuss the potential resumption of Russian gas supplies to Europe, among other issues related to the peaceful settlement of Russia's war in Ukraine, Russian presidential aide Yuri Ushakov confirmed to the Russian state-run Interfax news agency. The approval marks a key step in international efforts to hold Moscow accountable for what is considered the gravest violation of international law committed against Ukraine. Under Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin's rule, millions of Ukrainians died during the Holodomor, a man-made famine in 1932–1933. According to the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU), this marks the first time Ukrainian authorities have exposed a Hungarian military intelligence network conducting activities harmful to Ukraine. Delegations from 35 countries and the Council of Europe gathered in Lviv as EU officials prepare to approve both new defense aid and steps toward establishing a tribunal for Russian leadership. The ruling marks a significant victory for RFE/RL amid growing concerns about U.S. funding cuts to independent media countering Russian disinformation. U.S. Cardinal Robert Prevost was elected the new pope and leader of the Roman Catholic Church on Thursday, taking the name Pope Leo XIV, a senior cardinal announced on May 8 to crowds gathered in St. Peter's Square, according to Vatican News. The Communist Party of Russia unveiled a monument to Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin in occupied Melitopol, Zaporizhzhia Oblast, on May 8 to commemorate Victory Day in World War II, the party announced. Under his rule, millions of Ukrainians died during the Holodomor, a man-made famine in 1932–1933. While some in Russia credit Stalin for leading the Soviet Union to victory in World War II, portraying him solely as a military hero ignores the brutal policies and immense human cost of his regime. The monument comes amid a broader revival of Stalin's cult in Russia. On April 29, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a decree renaming Volgograd's international airport to "Stalingrad."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Russian President Vladimir Putin has taken center stage at Russia's Victory Day parade on Friday, surrounding himself by friendly world leaders in a highly choreographed show designed to show the Western world that Russia is far from isolated. Watching as thousands of troops marched across Moscow's Red Square, Putin stood next to his guest of honor, the Chinese leader Xi Jinping. But since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Victory Day has become more of a propaganda exercise, with Putin framing the war against Russia's much smaller neighbor as a continuation of what Russians call the Great Patriotic War. And while celebrations were muted in the past three years, Russia has not held back this time. Many of them have also sent troops to march in the parade, alongside Russian servicemen. The Russian military symbol dates back to imperial times, but it has become hugely controversial in recent years, having been coopted as a sign of support for Moscow's aggression against Ukraine. It has been banned in a number of countries. Related article Xi and Putin agree to ‘deepen' China-Russia ties during Moscow talks Brazil's President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, the Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, Serbia's President Aleksandar Vucic, Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro and Mahmoud Abbas, the President of the Palestinian Authority were all in attendance, marking a significant upgrade to last year's guestlist which was limited to a handful of delegations from post-Soviet states, Cuba and a few other countries. Robert Fico, the Prime Minister of Slovakia, a European Union member state, was also in Moscow on Friday. His appearance side by side with Putin was particularly significant given the EU's tough stance against Russia over its aggression against Ukraine. The weaponry and number of troops on display were also upgraded compared to the last few years when Russia clearly struggled to put on an impressive military show. A selection of tanks, modern and historical, was on show this year and Russian state media reported that around 11,500 troops took part. Instead, Putin declared a three-day unilateral ceasefire around the anniversary – an announcement that was promptly rejected by Ukraine. US President Donald Trump also reiterated his call for the 30-day ceasefire on Thursday, threatening fresh sanctions if it's not respected. Trump's comments come after a phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, the second time in less than two weeks that the two leaders were known to have spoken to each other Related article Ukrainians on front line say Russians keep breaking Putin's ceasefire Kyiv said Friday that Russia had breached the ceasefire hundreds of times since it came into effect. Several civilians were killed and injured in guided bomb attacks against Ukrainian cities, Kyiv said. Kyiv was openly indifferent to the smooth running of Putin's parade. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said his country would not be “playing games to create a pleasant atmosphere to allow for Putin's exit from isolation on May 9.” Yet Ukraine did succeed in disrupting the run-up to the parade earlier this week by launching several drone attacks against Moscow. The drones forced Russian authorities to temporarily shut down all four Moscow airports on Wednesday. Ukraine's European allies were keen to show their support for Kyiv as Russia paraded its troops on Friday. “In Latvian society, there is a clear and principled understanding that Russian propaganda and glorification of war crimes cannot be supported or encouraged … given this context, Latvia cannot grant diplomatic overflight permits for flights facilitating participation in the 9 May event,” the Latvian Foreign Ministry said in a statement on Thursday. According to Serbian media, he ended up flying via Baku in Azerbaijan. CNN's Svitlana Vlasova, Clare Sebastian and Tim Lister contributed reporting.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Editor's Note: Call to Earth is a CNN editorial series committed to reporting on the environmental challenges facing our planet, together with the solutions. Rolex's Perpetual Planet Initiative has partnered with CNN to drive awareness and education around key sustainability issues and to inspire positive action. Access to nature is no longer guaranteed. London-based environmental activist Ellen Miles, 31, is trying to change that. In 2020, Miles founded Nature Is a Human Right, a campaign advocating for daily access to green spaces to be recognized in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Frustrated by the slow pace of institutional change, Miles says she “lost faith in the top-down process.” So she took matters into her own hands. Not protest banners or petitions, but seeds and shovels. “Think of it like graffiti, but with wildflowers instead of spray paint.” This form of urban activism involves transforming neglected or overlooked spaces — cracks in pavements, roadside verges, abandoned lots — into mini-oases for people, pollinators and biodiversity. What began during the Covid pandemic — when parks were shut and access to green space became scarce — grew into a weekly ritual. Miles and her neighbors would meet on Sunday mornings, armed with bulbs and trowels, planting in overlooked corners of the London Borough of Hackney. In the UK, guerrilla gardening occupies a legal gray area: while planting on public land without permission is not technically lawful, authorities often turn a blind eye — so long as it doesn't cause damage, obstruction or a public nuisance. According to the Royal Horticultural Society, guerrilla gardeners should ensure their planting doesn't inconvenience others and be careful to not restrict public access or create trip hazards. It's also important that anything planted is removable, and that the roots won't cause structural damage to sidewalks and buildings. The movement has since spread worldwide, from Ron Finley, the “Gangsta Gardener” in Los Angeles, to Ta Mère Nature in France, and the Ujamaa Guerrilla Gardening Collective in South Africa. Her upbeat videos demystify the process, showing everything from creating seed bombs to planting moss graffiti — a form of street art where living moss is used to create patterns or words on walls. “But I just wanted the streets to be greener.” As Miles' seeds grew, so did her online following. “Young people today are very awake to issues like climate change, inequality, and mental health,” Miles says. It's something you can do with your own two hands and see the impact immediately.” “A lot of activism can feel intangible,” she adds. And it's more than just symbolic: “It's been shown that having access to green spaces is as vital to your mental and physical health as regular exercise and a healthy diet,” says Miles. A study of 20,000 participants by the UK's University of Exeter found that people who spent at least 120 minutes a week in green spaces reported significantly better physical health and psychological well-being than those who didn't. Communities can benefit too: a US study showed that greening vacant lots can lead to lower crime rates. Miles' message is simple: anyone can get involved. “Find native wildflowers, scatter them when it's raining then you won't even have to water them.” For those who want to go further, Miles has written a book on the subject and teaches a free four-week online course through the nonprofit Earthed, which has attracted over 300 participants. She advises gardening as a group — community is key. Her vision is bold but refreshingly practical: “Why aren't all our sidewalks lined with hedges?” says Miles. Our rooftops and bus stops could be buzzing with flowers.</p>

MOSCOW, May 9 (Reuters) – Russia marks the 80th anniversary of the Soviet Union's victory over Nazi Germany in World War Two on Friday with a military parade attended by China's Xi Jinping that Moscow fears Ukraine will try to disrupt after three years of devastating war. President Vladimir Putin, the longest-serving Kremlin chief since Josef Stalin, will speak at a 0700 GMT parade where thousands of Russian soldiers usually march by and drive military hardware such as intercontinental ballistic missiles and tanks past Lenin's Mausoleum on Red Square. Ukraine attacked Moscow with drones for several days this week, and Moscow and Kyiv accused each other of breaking a 72-hour ceasefire declared by Putin. The Kremlin says the attendance of Russian allies such as Xi, Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva and several dozen leaders from the former Soviet Union, Africa, Asia and Latin America shows Russia is not isolated even if Moscow's former WW2 Western allies want to stay away. From Europe, the leaders of Serbia and Slovakia will attend. “The countless sacrifices made by both our peoples should never be forgotten.” The Soviet Union lost 27 million people in World War Two, including many millions in Ukraine, but pushed Nazi forces back to Berlin, where Adolf Hitler committed suicide and the red Soviet Victory Banner was raised over the Reichstag in 1945. Chinese Communist Party historians say China's casualties in the 1937-1945 Second Sino-Japanese War were 35 million. Moscow and Kyiv do not publish accurate casualty numbers for the war in Ukraine, though U.S. President Donald Trump, who says he wants peace, says hundreds of thousands of soldiers on both sides have been killed and injured. Putin has sought to insulate Moscow from the grinding artillery and drone war being fought 600 km (370 miles) away in Ukraine, though Ukrainian drone attacks have in recent days disrupted air travel to the Russian capital. There were some drone attack warnings announced overnight in some western Russian regions but no reports of attacks on Moscow, which along with the surrounding region has a population of at least 21 million. The Kremlin said military units from 13 countries, including China, will take part in the parade along with Russian troops, though it was unclear how North Korea – which has helped Russia fight in Ukraine – would be represented. In Kyiv, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy called on allies to help it resist Russia, which now controls about a fifth of Ukraine. It must be fought,” Zelenskiy said, according to the Kyiv Post. There is just no other way to describe it.

NEW YORK, May 9. /TASS/. The situation on the battlefield in Ukraine is not in Kiev's favor, US Vice President JD Vance told Fox News television news channel commenting on the ongoing negotiations with Russia to resolve the Ukrainian conflict.

"We knew that Russia would ask for too much, because the Russian perception of the war is - ‘on the ground' they are winning," Vance stated in an exclusive interview with the US-based broadcaster.

"Of course, the Ukrainians would like to do a ceasefire and in part that things have not been going so well for the Ukrainians the last few months," he added.

Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on May 8 that Russia wants its national interests to be taken into account in the framework of peace talks as he commented on a previous remark from Vance that Moscow "is asking for too much" in the negotiation process.

"We want our national interests to be taken into account. So that the root causes of the conflict are eliminated. This is very important, because it is directly related to our national interests, to guarantees of our security," Peskov stated.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Peter Szijjarto's announcement came after Ukraine's Security Service (SBU) allegedly dismantled a Hungarian military intelligence network operating in Zakarpattia Oblast. Moscow and Washington discuss the potential resumption of Russian gas supplies to Europe, among other issues related to the peaceful settlement of Russia's war in Ukraine, Russian presidential aide Yuri Ushakov confirmed to the Russian state-run Interfax news agency. The approval marks a key step in international efforts to hold Moscow accountable for what is considered the gravest violation of international law committed against Ukraine. Under Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin's rule, millions of Ukrainians died during the Holodomor, a man-made famine in 1932–1933. According to the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU), this marks the first time Ukrainian authorities have exposed a Hungarian military intelligence network conducting activities harmful to Ukraine. Delegations from 35 countries and the Council of Europe gathered in Lviv as EU officials prepare to approve both new defense aid and steps toward establishing a tribunal for Russian leadership. The ruling marks a significant victory for RFE/RL amid growing concerns about U.S. funding cuts to independent media countering Russian disinformation. U.S. Cardinal Robert Prevost was elected the new pope and leader of the Roman Catholic Church on Thursday, taking the name Pope Leo XIV, a senior cardinal announced on May 8 to crowds gathered in St. Peter's Square, according to Vatican News. Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico arrived in Moscow on May 9 to celebrate Victory Day, commemorating the 80th anniversary of the defeat of Nazi Germany in World War II. Slovak and Russian press agencies reported that Fico was accompanied by other politicians from his party, including Erik Kaliniak, Lubos Blaga, Richard Gluck. Fico, who anticipated arriving in Moscow on May 8, was delayed in his arrival, following the Baltic states' decision to bar Slovakia's government plane from flying over their respective country's airspace en route to Moscow. Fico is known for inflammatory statements on Ukraine and the war that often echo Moscow's talking points. Fico's planned visit comes as another jab at the Western efforts to internationally isolate Putin over Russia's full-scale war in Ukraine. Slovakia is a member state of both NATO and the EU.</p>
