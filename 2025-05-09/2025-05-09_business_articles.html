                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Newark Mayor Ras Baraka was arrested Friday for allegedly trespassing inside a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention center in his city, New Jersey's interim top prosecutor said. Baraka "committed trespass and ignored multiple warnings" from Department of Homeland Security officials who told him to leave the facility, alleged Alina Habba, the interim U.S. attorney for the District of New Jersey. "He has willingly chosen to disregard the law. That will not stand in this state. He has been taken into custody," Habba, a former defense attorney for President Donald Trump, wrote on X. "NO ONE IS ABOVE THE LAW," she added. Baraka, 55, is a Democrat running for governor of New Jersey. Kabir Moss, a spokesman for Baraka's gubernatorial campaign, confirmed the arrest at the facility known as Delaney Hall, NBC News reported. At least three U.S. House Democrats from New Jersey were also at the detention center on Friday, according to an X post from Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman. Baraka's office and campaign did not immediately respond to CNBC's requests for comment. Videos posted on X by News12NJ reporter Amanda Lee show a physical altercation between law enforcement officers and apparent protesters by a security gate at the facility. Another video posted by Lee appears to show Baraka being led away with his hands cuffed behind his back. The members of Congress said they were there to conduct oversight on the facility in light of reporting about other ICE centers, which have become political flashpoints amid Trump's aggressive deportation efforts. But Homeland Security spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin in a statement to NBC called the incident "a bizarre political stunt" by a group of protesters that included the elected officials. "Had these members requested a tour, we would have facilitated a tour of the facility. This is an evolving situation," she added. Baraka's administration filed a lawsuit in late March to block the opening of the Newark immigrant detention facility, arguing that its operators failed to obtain the proper permits and violated city code.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>White House deputy chief of staff for policy Stephen Miller said Friday that the Trump administration is "actively looking at" suspending the writ of habeas corpus, which is the right to challenge the legality of a person's detention by the government. Miller's comment came in response to a White House reporter who asked about President Donald Trump entertaining the idea of suspending the writ of habeas corpus to deal with the problem of illegal immigration into the United States. Asked when that might happen, Miller responded: "The Constitution is clear, and that, of course, is the supreme law of the land, that the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus can be suspended in time of invasion." "So, I would say that's an option we're actively looking at," he said. Miller said that Trump's decision on whether to suspend the writ of habeas corpus "depends on whether the courts do the right thing or not." Miller implied that "the right thing" is for judges to stop blocking the administration's deportation of undocumented immigrants in cases where those people are exercising habeas writs. The idea of habeas corpus was codified in the Magna Carta, signed by King John of England, in the early 13th Century. The administration likewise has claimed that there is a national emergency from the influx of the deadly opioid fentanyl into the U.S. that justifies the imposition of high tariffs on China, Canada and Mexico without prior authorization by Congress. A number of pending civil cases challenging the Trump administration's deportation of undocumented immigrants in the United States are based on habeas claims. In one such case, a Georgetown University scholar, Dr. Badar Khan, is challenging the constitutionality of his arrest and detention. The Trump administration has chafed at orders by judges blocking efforts to summarily deport immigrants, including alleged gang members. Miller said that Congress had stripped federal courts of jurisdiction over immigration cases with the Immigration and Nationality Act. "The courts aren't just at war with the executive branch, the courts are at war, these radical rogue judges, with the legislative branch as well," Miller said. We want to hear from you.

A Whoop wristband in 2017. 

Whoop Inc., the maker of popular screen-less fitness bands, is facing a backlash from subscribers upset that it's charging an upgrade fee for the new models after previously pledging not to do so.

The company on Thursday unveiled two new fitness bands, the Whoop 5.0 and MG, which add improved sleep tracking and new features like blood pressure monitoring in the higher-end model. The company's business model charges users an annual subscription — ranging from $199 to $359 a year — versus an upfront payment for the hardware.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Postal Service Board of Governors said Friday that it had selected former Waste Management CEO David Steiner as postmaster general. Steiner, who is a board member of shipping giant FedEx, will succeed former Postmaster General Louis DeJoy, who resigned in March, and current acting Postmaster General Doug Tulino. Steiner, who is expected to formally join the USPS in July, will leave the board of FedEx, where he has served some 2009. In a statement, Steiner said, "It is an incredible honor to be asked to lead the world's greatest postal organization, with a history that stretches back before the founding of the United States." "I deeply admire the public service and business mission of this amazing institution, and I believe strongly in maintaining its role as an independent establishment of the executive branch. Steiner served as CEO of Waste Management from 2004 through late 2016. USPS said that when he led Waste Management, Steiner was "credited with leading tremendous change in the organization, transforming operations and culture, and delivering strong financial results." USPS Board of Governors Chair Amber McReynolds, in a statement, said, "Dave is the right person to lead the Postal Service at this time to ensure this magnificent and historic organization thrives into the future," said FexEx founder and executive chairman Frederick Smith praised Steiner, and said in a statement that his "sharp business acumen will be key to addressing the significant challenges facing the United States Postal Service which has lost more than $108 billion since 2007 despite receiving billions in taxpayer relief."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The problems keep piling up at Newark Liberty International Airport. The Federal Aviation Administration said that an air traffic control equipment outage at the Philadelphia approach control facility, which guides aircraft in and out of Newark, occurred around 3:55 a.m. on Friday morning. The agency said it affected communications and radar displays for "approximately 90 seconds." It's the facility's second outage since April 28, when screens went dark for 60 to 90 seconds and prevented controllers from talking to aircraft. Operational issues, coupled with bad weather and runway construction, have caused hundreds of delays and cancellations at the airport over nearly two weeks. United CEO Scott Kirby has called on the government to designate Newark as a "level 3" airport, meaning it would run on a slot system that limits the number of planes that could take off and land at certain times to manage capacity. Kirby said in a letter to customers in May that the Philadelphia center has been "chronically understaffed for years" and that Newark "cannot handle the number of planes that are scheduled to operate there in the weeks and months ahead." The airport is also grappling with the closure of its main runway, which won't be operational until at least mid-June. ET on Friday, Newark is facing arrival and departure delays of up to four hours because of overcapacity, runway construction, and bad weather. United does not fly out of New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport, which has not been affected by the Philadelphia control problems, meaning rivals Delta and American have not experienced the same disruptions to flights and customers. Recent air traffic control issues have highlighted the US's ongoing battle to update aging equipment and hire more controllers at facilities around the country. The Trump administration announced a "supercharge" program in February to accelerate hiring. In March, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy announced a plan to upgrade the national airspace system with modernized technology and infrastructure.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Sign up today for the new CNBC Sport Newsletter At long last, ESPN has chosen a name for its upcoming all-access streaming service. Disney's sports media division will announce the new — and also sort of old — name for the all-access streaming application at a media event next week, according to people familiar with the matter who declined to be named speaking about not-yet-public details. A Disney spokesperson declined to comment. Disney executives have referred to the streaming product, which is expected to cost $25 or $30 a month, as "flagship" internally for the past two years as they have developed the service. It will consist of everything ESPN has to offer, including all games; programming on other ESPN cable networks such as ESPN2 and the SEC Network; ESPN on ABC; fantasy products; new betting tie-ins; studio programming; documentaries and more. This will differ from ESPN's current streaming product ESPN+, which does not include the most-watched live games, such as Monday Night Football, that currently only air exclusively on traditional pay-TV. ESPN+ costs $11.99 per month and can be bundled with Disney+ and Hulu for $16.99 per month with commercials. ESPN+ will remain a less expensive offering for consumers, according to people familiar with the matter. ESPN Chairman Jimmy Pitaro decided to name the application ESPN to simplify what has become a cluttered streaming world, filled with different media products that can be bundled with other services at different price points, according to those people. The CNBC Sport newsletter first reported in February that ESPN executives were considering naming the application ESPN among other options. The CNBC Sport newsletter with Alex Sherman brings you the biggest news and exclusive interviews from the worlds of sports business and media, delivered weekly to your inbox. Subscribe here to get access today. Rather, the launch is about introducing consumers to a different way customers can access ESPN's programming. Pay-TV subscribers who already get ESPN will automatically be able to authenticate into the new app to get the digital bells and whistles that are not available through cable TV. That overlap also played into executives' decision to maintain uniformity with the name ESPN, rather than a different name that may increase confusion, the people said. ESPN will next week announce the pricing of the application, as well as associated bundled discounts, Disney CEO Bob Iger said Wednesday during Disney's quarterly earnings conference call.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Air traffic controllers who guide planes in and out of Newark Liberty International Airport lost radar and communication with aircraft before dawn on Friday in another 90-second outage, the Federal Aviation Administration said, hours after the Trump administration unveiled a plan to overhaul the aging technology that keeps U.S. airspace space safe. There are far fewer aircraft flying overnight, so disruptions were minimal compared with a similar outage on the afternoon of April 28, which snarled air travel for days. Several controllers took leave because of the stress of that April incident, the FAA said. That exacerbated low staffing levels at the Philadelphia facility, where controllers oversee planes at Newark, New Jersey, airport, forcing the FAA to slow the airport's traffic. Like in the April incident, Friday's outage left controllers unable to communicate with aircraft and their radar screens dark. On Thursday, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy unveiled plans to overhaul several aging facilities and modernize technology used by controllers, who oversee about 45,000 flights a day in the U.S. Aviation-industry groups and labor unions applauded the proposal and said Thursday that Congress should approve at least $31 billion over the next three years for improvements. That includes $12.5 billion outlined in a House spending proposal last month, for air traffic control modernization and more hiring of controllers. We want to hear from you.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Sam Altman's friendship goals for his infant son do not include AI. The OpenAI CEO was asked Thursday while giving Senate testimony whether he'd want his child to form a best-friend bond with an AI bot. The question, from Sen. Bernie Moreno, came during a broader discussion about how to shield children from harm in the AI era as people trust chatbots with more personal information. "These AI systems will get to know you over the course of your life so well — that presents a new challenge and level of importance for how we think about privacy in the world of AI," said Altman, who became a father in February. Altman said that people were already forming deeply personal relationships with artificial intelligence and essentially relying on it for emotional support. Altman said there should be greater flexibility for adults using AI tools, while children should have "a much higher level of protection." But, as with other online services, it can be difficult to know a user's age. He has previously spoken about what it means to raise a child in the AI era. "My kid is never going to grow up being smarter than AI," he said during a January episode of the "Re:Thinking" podcast with Adam Grant. On Thursday, Altman said his son was "doing well," adding that it's "the most amazing thing ever."</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — U.S. President Donald Trump will touch down in the Persian Gulf region – or as he may soon be calling it, the Arabian Gulf – on May 13, for an official trip with stops in Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates. And I think in a broad spectrum of areas as well," Monica Malik, chief economist at Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank, told CNBC's Dan Murphy on Friday. Trump has long enjoyed a warm relationship with Gulf Arab states, in particular the UAE and Saudi Arabia, where his children have several business ventures and planned real estate projects. Those relationships could strengthen the countries' hands when it comes to negotiating new trade deals – while also raising concerns among critics over potential conflicts of interest, accusations the Trump family rejects. A Saudi-U.S. investment forum announced just this week and set to take place on May 13 in Riyadh will feature guests including BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, Palantir CEO Alex Karp, and CEOs of major firms like Citigroup, IBM, Qualcomm, Alphabet, and Franklin Templeton, among others. White House AI and crypto czar David Sacks will also be in attendance. "We also expect to see a lot of investment deals being announced," Malik said. "And both ways, we've already seen the UAE announce a number of investments in the U.S. in areas such as AI, energy, aluminum, but we also think that there will be opportunities for U.S. companies to increase investment." The Trump administration on Wednesday announced its plan to rescind a Biden era "AI diffusion rule," which imposed strict export controls on advanced AI chips, even to U.S.-friendly nations. The rule will be replaced with "a much simpler rule that unleashes American innovation and ensures American AI dominance," a U.S. Commerce Department spokesperson said Wednesday, though the details of the new rule have not yet been shared. UAE-based AI firm G42 has made efforts to align with U.S. regulations, including divesting from Chinese companies and partnering with Microsoft, which last year invested $1.5 billion in G42. The Trump administration has been actively engaged in talks with Iran over its nuclear program – talks that the UAE and Saudi Arabia have expressed support for. That enthusiasm marks a stark contrast to those countries' attitudes toward any U.S. deals with Tehran during the Obama years. At the same time, Saudi Arabia wants its own civilian nuclear program and has asked the U.S. for approvals and assistance in this direction. Any U.S. support for a Saudi nuclear program was previously contingent on Saudi Arabia normalizing diplomatic relations with U.S. ally Israel – but that could change during this visit, according to media reports citing sources with knowledge of the matter. U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright, during a visit to the kingdom in April, said that Saudi Arabia and the U.S. were on a "pathway" to a civil nuclear agreement – but that any further announcements would come from Trump himself. Trump has vowed to bring about an end to the war, while also controversially suggesting that the U.S. could take control of the war-ravaged Strip which he described as "important real estate," comments that drew strong rebukes from Arab leaders. The U.S. has continued to push for ceasefire deals, most recently floating a 21-day cessation of hostilities and release of some hostages, while Israel this week approved expanding fighting and territorial control in Gaza. "We have yet to hear a comprehensive plan from the Arab world," Greg Branch, founder of UAE-based Branch Global Capital Advisors, told CNBC on Friday while discussing Trump's upcoming visit. Branch suggested that lifting U.S. sanctions on Syria under its new government could also potentially be discussed. Meanwhile, reports that the Trump administration will announce a U.S. renaming of the Persian Gulf to the Arabian Gulf would be enthusiastically welcomed by Arab states, but could draw severe anger from Iran at a time of delicate nuclear negotiations with Tehran. Oil prices will also be in focus; Trump has long pushed OPEC states, led by Saudi Arabia, to pump more oil to lower prices for American consumers. For a combination of reasons, Saudi Arabia is doing precisely that – but it may have to change course in the coming months if prices stay subdued, hurting the kingdom's revenues. In that vein, financing will be an important agenda item for the kingdom during Trump's visit, according to ADCB's Malik. Saudi Arabia in November pledged to invest $600 billion in the U.S. over the course of Trump's term — but it also has sky-high costs for its own Vision 2030 investment ambitions. Lower global oil prices and big-ticket public spending projects have brought about widening budget deficits for Riyadh. "With oil prices where they are, Saudi will look at more financing support from America as well as they look to progress with their investment program," Malik said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Mark Zuckerberg is the king of the quiet glow up — but his luxury watch collection reminds us that in fact, he's worth billions. The 40-year-old Meta founder, who is estimated to be worth over $207 billion, has taken to flaunting his wealth via wrist candy in recent years. While attending Ambani's pre-wedding party in March 2024, Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla Chan, were seen admiring a Richard Mille watch worn by the Reliance Industries heir. "You know, I never really wanted to get a watch, but after seeing that, I was like, watches are cool," Zuckerberg is heard saying in a video of the interaction. On September 1, 2024, Zuckerberg shared an Instagram photo of himself embracing his wife. The timepiece is crafted with a platinum case and an alligator-leather band. In terms of functionality, it displays the current day, date, and month. It retails for $141,400, according to the brand's website. Zuckerberg appeared at an "Acquired" podcast event on September 10, 2024. He seemed to be wearing its rose-gold model, which can cost over $80,000 from independent watch sellers. As watch specialist Bryan Li previously told Business Insider, only 20 of the watches are made annually. This De Bethune piece — and Zuckerberg's Patek Philippe watch — showed a significant shift in the Facebook founder's style, taking his outfits from basic to luxe almost overnight. He was photographed wearing a chunky silver watch onstage at the 2024 Meta Connect conference. The specific one Zuckerberg wore featured a thick band and large black buttons on its side. Sotheby's listed what appears to be the same watch for auction in March, and said it was made entirely from aluminum. The same watch in a darker gray colorway is now available to purchase online for $135,000. In the clip, he's seen wearing a Greubel Forsey watch that retails for over $900,000. According to the brand's website, the watch is assembled entirely by hand, and only two or three are crafted each year. Zuckerberg posted a handful of photos and videos from the mixed martial arts event, which showed a thick gold watch on his wrist. BI spoke with four watch experts at the time, who all said the timepiece was likely a yellow-gold Rolex Daytona Le Mans. Though Rolex has never confirmed how many exist, collectors and sellers say the watch style is rare. That's partially why it had a resale value of up to $300,000, as Ng Yong Shen, a vice president at the Dubai-based secondhand retailer Re-Loved Luxury, told BI. Watch fanatics quickly pointed it out as the GA2100WS-7A from Casio's G-Shock line. Made from resin and mineral glass, the watch retails for $120. So far, it's the least expensive watch Zuckerberg has worn in public.</p>
