            Russian President Vladimir Putin has taken center stage at Russia's Victory Day parade on Friday, surrounding himself by friendly world leaders in a highly choreographed show designed to show the Western world that Russia is far from isolated.
    


            Watching as thousands of troops marched across Moscow's Red Square, Putin stood next to his guest of honor, the Chinese leader Xi Jinping.
    


            The annual May 9 commemoration of the Soviet Union's victory over Nazi Germany in World War II is one of the most important days in Putin's calendar, and this year marks its 80th anniversary.
    


            Traditionally, the day has been dedicated to the estimated 25 million to 27 million Soviet soldiers and civilians who died during the conflict. But since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Victory Day has become more of a propaganda exercise, with Putin framing the war against Russia's much smaller neighbor as a continuation of what Russians call the Great Patriotic War.
    


            And while celebrations were muted in the past three years, Russia has not held back this time.
    


            Putin and Xi were joined by scores of other world leaders, most of whom had the black and orange ribbon of Saint George pinned to their lapels. Many of them have also sent troops to march in the parade, alongside Russian servicemen.
    


            The Russian military symbol dates back to imperial times, but it has become hugely controversial in recent years, having been coopted as a sign of support for Moscow's aggression against Ukraine. It has been banned in a number of countries.

            Brazil's President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, the Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, Serbia's President Aleksandar Vucic, Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro and Mahmoud Abbas, the President of the Palestinian Authority were all in attendance, marking a significant upgrade to last year's guestlist which was limited to a handful of delegations from post-Soviet states, Cuba and a few other countries.
    


            Robert Fico, the Prime Minister of Slovakia, a European Union member state, was also in Moscow on Friday. His appearance side by side with Putin was particularly significant given the EU's tough stance against Russia over its aggression against Ukraine.
    


            The weaponry and number of troops on display were also upgraded compared to the last few years when Russia clearly struggled to put on an impressive military show. The parade featured just one tank in the past two years and the usual fly-by of military aircraft over Red Square was canceled in 2022 and 2023.
    


            A selection of tanks, modern and historical, was on show this year and Russian state media reported that around 11,500 troops took part. For the first time, Russia's drones were also on display, including the Russian version of the Iranian-designed Shahed droned, known as Geranium-2.
    


            The parade comes as the US-led talks to end the war in Ukraine appear to have stalled, despite a flurry of diplomatic activity in recent weeks. Russia has so far refused to sign up to a US proposal for a 30-day ceasefire that Ukraine has already agreed to.
    


            Instead, Putin declared a three-day unilateral ceasefire around the anniversary – an announcement that was promptly rejected by Ukraine.
    


            “The Kremlin's proposal for a three-day truce is not about peace, but about ensuring the safe conduct of the parade in Moscow. This is political manipulation,” Andriy Yermak, the head of the Ukrainian Presidential Office, said in a statement on Thursday.
    


            Kyiv said that if Russia wanted a truce, it should sign up to the proposal already on the table.
    


            US President Donald Trump also reiterated his call for the 30-day ceasefire on Thursday, threatening fresh sanctions if it's not respected.
    


            Trump's comments come after a phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, the second time in less than two weeks that the two leaders were known to have spoken to each other

            Kyiv said Friday that Russia had breached the ceasefire hundreds of times since it came into effect. Several civilians were killed and injured in guided bomb attacks against Ukrainian cities, Kyiv said.
    


            Kyiv was openly indifferent to the smooth running of Putin's parade. It said that it “cannot be responsible for what happens on the territory of the Russian Federation” because of the war.
    


            Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said his country would not be “playing games to create a pleasant atmosphere to allow for Putin's exit from isolation on May 9.”
    


            Moscow said it would protect the safety of the parade and its guests. Yet Ukraine did succeed in disrupting the run-up to the parade earlier this week by launching several drone attacks against Moscow. The drones forced Russian authorities to temporarily shut down all four Moscow airports on Wednesday.
    


            This made the attendance of the dozens of foreign delegations in Moscow particularly significant as they came to show their support for Putin and Russia despite the risks.
    


            Ukraine's European allies were keen to show their support for Kyiv as Russia paraded its troops on Friday.
    


            Dozens of foreign delegations were in the western Ukrainian city of Lviv on Friday to endorse the establishment of a special tribunal to investigate crimes of aggression against Ukraine. The EU's foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas, UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy, Germany's new Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul, the French Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot and dozens of top diplomats from other European countries met in Lviv.
    


            In another gesture of sympathy, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania also threw in some logistical complications for international parade-goers, shutting their airspaces to diplomatic planes traveling to Moscow and forcing several of the pro-Kremlin leaders to reroute their journeys to Moscow.
    


            “In Latvian society, there is a clear and principled understanding that Russian propaganda and glorification of war crimes cannot be supported or encouraged … given this context, Latvia cannot grant diplomatic overflight permits for flights facilitating participation in the 9 May event,” the Latvian Foreign Ministry said in a statement on Thursday.
    


            Fico, one of the leaders affected by the closures, criticized the move, saying on Wednesday that it was “extremely disruptive.”
    


            Vucic was also forced to re-route after the Baltic states said he wouldn't be allowed to enter their airspace. According to Serbian media, he ended up flying via Baku in Azerbaijan.

Washington will not interfere in the conflict between New Delhi and Islamabad, US Vice President J.D. Vance said on Thursday, urging the South Asian nations to reduce tensions. 

“We're not going to get involved in the middle of a war that's fundamentally none of our business,” Vance told Fox News. “Look, we're concerned any time nuclear powers collide and have a major conflict,” he added. 

Vance said that the US hoped the situation would not spiral into a broader regional war or a nuclear conflict. “Fundamentally, India has its gripes with Pakistan. Pakistan has responded to India, he added. “What we can do is try to encourage these folks to de-escalate a little bit.”

The US vice president's comments came a day after India launched “Operation Sindoor,” a series of strikes on suspected terrorist facilities in Pakistan and Pakistan-Administered Kashmir. The strikes were in retaliation to a terrorist attack in April in the India Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir that claimed the lives of 26 civilians.

Vance's comments come close on the heels of US President Donald Trump requesting India and Pakistan to halt what he described as “tit-for-tat” actions. Trump had added that he would be willing to help the South Asian countries, if needed.

Islamabad has condemned New Delhi's strikes as a “heinous provocation” and vowed retaliation.

Since the Indian strikes, Pakistan has responded with shelling across the Line of Control, the de facto border between the countries in Kashmir. The cross-border fire has resulted in 16 civilian deaths, according to the Indian government. 

On Thursday, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio spoke with Indian External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar, stressing “the urgency for immediate de-escalation.” Rubio also “reaffirmed US support for direct dialogue between India and Pakistan and encouraged ongoing efforts to enhance communication.”

On the same day Rubio spoke to Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif who once again condemned India's strikes. Sharif asserted that Pakistan would “defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity at all costs” as quoted by PTV News.

Rubio has noted that the US was “closely following the situation in South Asia” while being “committed to promoting peace and stability in the region,” urging both India and Pakistan to de-escalate.

WASHINGTON, May 9. /TASS/. A possible meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in mid-May in Saudi Arabia is not on the schedule, US President Donald Trump told journalists.

Asked at a news conference in the White House whether a meeting with Putin was possible later in the month in Saudi Arabia, Trump replied: ""I don't think so, but we're having very good conversations. Very, very good.""

Earlier this week, Russian Presidential Spokesman Dmitry Peskov stated that President Putin had no scheduled visits to the Middle East for mid-May.

Trump announced earlier that he might meet with Putin shortly after his visit to the Middle East in May.

In March, Russian Presidential Spokesman Peskov told TASS that Trump and Putin could meet in Saudi Arabia at some point, but as of today, no concrete plans have materialized.

US special envoy Steve Witkoff in an interview with Bloomberg also suggested earlier that the Russian-US summit could be held in Saudi Arabia. He noted that he could not speak for Putin and Trump, but his ""best bet"" was that it would happen.

On April 25, Putin and US presidential special envoy Steve Witkoff met for the fourth time this year. Kremlin aide Yury Ushakov said that the conversation lasted three hours and was ""constructive and very useful."".","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

MOSCOW, May 9. /TASS/. A military parade to commemorate the 80th anniversary of the Soviet Union's Victory over Nazi Germany in the 1941-1945 Great Patriotic War took place on Moscow's Red Square.

The parade began with a march of the banner group of the Preobrazhensky Regiment Honor Guard's unit carrying the Russian national flag and the legendary Victory Banner across Red Square. The Victory Banner was hoisted over the Reichstag by soldiers of the 150th Idritskaya Rifle Division in May 1945.

Russian President Vladimir Putin, war veterans, guests and foreign leaders watched the parade from the central reviewing stand on Red Square. Defense Minister Andrey Belousov reviewed the parade, which was commanded by Ground Forces Commander-in-Chief General of the Army Oleg Salyukov.

The Victory Day Parade on Moscow's Red Square was attended by leaders of 27 foreign states, among them China's President Xi Jinping, Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic, Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico, President of Republika Srpska Milorad Dodik, President of Belarus Alexander Lukashenko, Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel, General Secretary of the Communist Party of Vietnam To Lam, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, Ethiopian President Taye Atske Selassie, President of Guinea-Bissau Umaro Sissoco Embalo and other foreign dignitaries.

Last year, Russia's Victory Day Parade on Moscow's Red Square involved over 9,000 troops, 61 weapons systems and 15 combat aircraft. This year, parade units from 13 countries took part in the military parade on Moscow's Red Square. The military contingents from CIS states included parade units from Azerbaijan, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. Troops from friendly states comprised parade units from Vietnam, Egypt, China, Laos, Mongolia and Myanmar.

This year, the military parade on Moscow's Red Square involved over 11,000 troops, including 1,500 combatants of the special military operation and 183 WWII and advanced weapons systems.

The foot columns of Russian troops at the military parade on Moscow's Red Square comprised regiments and battalions of the armed services and military branches, parade units from Suvorov infantry and Nakhimov naval, cadet and military musical schools, members of the Young Army youth movement, female service members, Cossacks, combatants of the special military operation and a consolidated military band.

Legendary WWII T-34 tanks, a major symbol of the Victory, traditionally led the mechanized column during the military parade on Moscow's Red Square. They were followed by a group of light wheeled equipment that included Tigr-M and VPK-Ural multirole armored vehicles and Linza medevac vehicles. After that, BMP-2 and BMP-3 infantry fighting vehicles with special combat modules, T-72B3M, T-80BVM and T-90M Proryv main battle tanks rolled through Red Square.

Advanced artillery weapons at the Victory Day Parade on Moscow's Red Square included Msta-S howitzers, Giatsint-K and Malva artillery guns. They were followed by Tornado-S multiple launch rocket systems and TOS-2 Tosochka heavy flamethrowers.

For the first time, a column of unmanned systems troops took part in the military parade on Moscow's Red Square. The column comprised mounted Orlan-10 reconnaissance and Orlan-30 surveillance/guidance UAVs, ZALA, Lancet, Garpiya and Geran combat drones.

Russia's Missile Troops and Strategic Missile Force were represented at the military parade on Moscow's Red Square by Iskander-M tactical missile systems, S-400 Triumf surface-to-air missile launchers and Yars road-mobile intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) systems. The final column of military hardware included Bumerang wheeled armored personnel carriers.

The military parade ended with a fly-past of combat aircraft over Moscow's Red Square. The aerobatic groups Russkiye Vityazi (Russian Knights) flying Su-30SM fighter jets and Strizhi (Swifts) on MiG-29 jets performed the Kubinka Diamond stunt over the center of Moscow. They were followed by six Su-25 attack aircraft that released fumes in the colors of the Russian national flag.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

Explosions heard in Indian Kashmir as witnesses say attacks are heavier than those reported on Thursday

Pakistan has been accused of launching a fresh wave of drone strikes against India on Friday night, with projectiles reported over the states of Indian-administered Kashmir and Punjab.

Explosions were heard in areas of Indian Kashmir and the bright flash of intercepted drones were seen over the Punjab city of Amritsar. Witnesses said the drone strikes were heavier than those that took place on Thursday night.

Earlier in the day, India accused Pakistan of launching an attack using up to 400 drones to target cities, military bases and places of worship across the north of the country on Thursday night, as the Pakistani military said it would “not de-escalate with India”.

India claimed to have intercepted hundreds of Pakistani drones, which it said came across the border into Indian-administered Kashmir, as well as Rajasthan, Punjab and Gujarat. It said a first wave of drones came on Thursday evening and another wave hit close to dawn on Friday.

India said it had launched four drone strikes at Pakistan, directly targeting military defence infrastructure.

In a press conference on Friday, the Indian military alleged that Pakistan's drone attacks on Thursday had targeted a gurdwara, a Sikh place of worship, injuring a civilian, and that the drones had also targeted Christian churches.

“The targeting of temples, gurdwaras, convents is a new low by Pakistan,” said India's foreign secretary, Vikram Misri.

Pakistan's information minister, Attaullah Tarar, denied the drone attacks, calling the Indian army statement “baseless and misleading”, and said Pakistan had not undertaken any “offensive actions” within Indian Kashmir or beyond Pakistan's border.

However, a Pakistan security official said that Thursday night's drone strikes were just to “heat things up” before Pakistan launched a fully fledged retaliatory attack. “When we hit back, everyone will know,” they said.

Misri called Pakistan's denial of the drone attacks “farcical” and “another example of its duplicity”.

The tit-for tat allegations were yet another alarming confrontation between India and Pakistan, two nuclear-armed countries, since India's missile strikes on nine sites in Pakistan on Wednesday killed 31 people. Those strikes in turn were India's response to an attack in Indian-administered Kashmir late last month, in which militants killed 25 Hindu tourists and a guide.

Pakistan said it considered the attack an “act of war” and vowed to retaliate.

“We will not de-escalate – with the damages India did on our side, they should take a hit,” Pakistan's military spokesperson, Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry, said at a media briefing. “So far we have been protecting ourselves but they will get an answer in our own timing.”

The Pakistani army gave new details of Wednesday's strike in which it claimed Pakistan had deployed more than 100 planes to ward off the strikes by Indian planes that carried out the attacks from Indian airspace. It said the two sides had engaged in an hour-long aerial dogfight.

Pakistan claimed it used Chinese-made weapons and ground air defences to help bring down five Indian fighter jets. India has yet to respond to allegations that Pakistan shot down its planes, but debris from at least three fighter jets, including that of at least one elite French Rafale jet, was seen in Indian-administered Kashmir and Punjab.

The worst-affected area from Thursday's drone attacks was the city of Jammu, in India-administered Kashmir, which is close to the line of control (LoC), the heavily militarised border dividing the disputed region of Kashmir between India and Pakistan.

Despite decades of conflict in the region, people in the city said they had never witnessed such an aerial onslaught. They described a barrage of fiery projectiles streaking across the sky as air-raid sirens wailed and the city was plunged into an enforced blackout overnight.

Videos shared with the Guardian showed glowing orange dots piercing Jammu's night sky before flashing and fading – probably drones intercepted by Indian air defence systems. Local officials confirmed debris from the projectiles had been recovered from several areas, including densely populated neighbourhoods in and around Jammu, but no casualties were reported.

Ajay Lakhotra, a 24-year-old student in Kanachak, a suburban area close to the Pakistan border, said: “Skirmishes and exchanges of gunfire are nothing new to us, but what happened on Thursday night was extraordinary. We saw fiery objects launching from the Pakistani side; the barrage was so intense it looked like fireworks lighting up the sky. Flames streaked everywhere. It was terrifying to witness.”

He said it had quietened down after midnight but restarted at 4am. “Most of us couldn't sleep all night.”

Lethal aggression continued along the LoC as soldiers from both sides continued to fire across the border, killing and injuring civilians. With Pakistan's threats to retaliate still looming, Indian-administered Kashmir and states across northern India remained on high alert.

The mounting aggressions and allegations have resulted in a growing information – and disinformation – war on both sides of the border.

India accused Pakistan of a flood of dangerous disinformation and “grossly exaggerated claims” across its media, including reports that dozens of Indian drones had been shot down over Pakistan, calling it a “gross misrepresentation of facts”.

“What should have been a moment of international reckoning against terror has instead been manipulated into a disinformation war, where truth is the first casualty,” India's ministry of information and broadcasting said in a statement.

However, mainstream Indian media has also been flooded with misinformation and fake or unsubstantiated reports, including false claims of an attack on Karachi port, reports of a military coup and the arrest of Pakistan's army chief. Images of Turkish military personnel were broadcast as “captured Pakistani pilots”. Images of powerful bomb strikes on Gaza have been widely shared as showing India's attack on Pakistan.

As part of its alleged crackdown on misinformation, India ordered the social media platform X to block more than 8,000 accounts, including those of Pakistani politicians, celebrities and media organisations, as well as Indian independent news organisations and Indian-Kashmiri journalists.

The move was confirmed by X in a statement, which said in many cases the Indian government had not provided legal justification for the blocks.

However, X said it had no choice but to comply and remove the 8,000 accounts or it would face “penalties including significant fines and imprisonment of the company's local employees”.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Exclusive: University College London acquires Gollancz archive that was in danger of being dispersed forever

George Orwell's correspondence, contracts and readers' reports relating to his earliest novels are among historic papers that have been saved for the nation after an outcry over their initial dispersal.

University College London (UCL) said it had acquired the archive of the Nineteen Eighty-Four author's publisher as “a valuable piece of Britain's cultural heritage”.

About 160 items, dating from 1934 to 1937, are to be added to the Orwell Archive in UCL Special Collections, the world's most comprehensive holdings of research material relating to him.

The papers offer extraordinary insights into one of the most influential British writers of the 20th century.

They relate to four of his earliest published works – A Clergyman's Daughter, Keep the Aspidistra Flying, The Road to Wigan Pier and Inside the Whale – and include his observations on the politics of 1930s Europe, which helped shape his thoughts and ideas.

The collection had belonged to his publisher, Victor Gollancz, who founded one of the 20th century's foremost publishing houses.

The company was acquired by the Orion Group, which became part of Hachette, owned by the French multinational Lagardère, whose decision to sell the archive because its warehouse was closing was condemned last year as an act of cultural vandalism.

Disbelief that such important papers had been languishing in dozens of rusty, dusty filing cabinets turned to anger with the realisation that they had been sold off.

Rick Gekoski, a leading antiquarian bookseller, was asked to dispose of the Gollancz archive, which included correspondence with Kingsley Amis and Daphne du Maurier, among the publisher's other authors. He recalled that the decision was sanctioned by Malcolm Edwards, the then publishing director of Orion, and the board. In his 2021 book, Guarded by Dragons, he wrote: “No one on the Orion board cared where they went, or to whom.”

He had tried in vain to sell the entire archive to various institutions, before dividing it up between dozens of dealers, private collectors and libraries.

He said among those approached was UCL, who, he recalled, declined partly due to funding – although it would have cost “considerably less” than the £154,000 that it has now paid.

On being told that UCL denies it had been approached previously, he said: “Why wouldn't we [approach them]? It's the Orwell Archive.”

Liz Thomson, who has reported on the book trade for 35 years, had warned of the loss of a “priceless” archive when she heard of its dispersal. She was dismayed to learn that one dealer had sold Gollancz's Animal Farm correspondence, with an asking price of £100,000. It included Orwell's 1944 letter describing it as “a little fairy story … with a political meaning”.

The publisher's sale was contrasted with the extraordinary generosity of Richard Blair, the son of Orwell, whose real name was Eric Blair. In 2021, Richard purchased 50 letters to donate them to UCL's Orwell Archive, fearing that they would otherwise have gone on to the market. “Then they're never seen again,” he said.

He said: “I'm very pleased and relieved that the Orwell Archive has taken [the Gollancz papers] and that they've not been dispersed into the ether, gobbled by various collectors, never to be seen again.”

The new acquisition boasts manuscript notebooks, personal papers and the first handwritten notes of some of Orwell's most famous words and phrases, such as “Two Minutes Hate”, “Newspeak”, and “War is Peace. Ignorance is strength. Freedom is slavery”.

UCL's purchase from Jonkers Rare Books and Peter Harrington Rare Books was made with support from the National Heritage Memorial Fund and the Friends of the Nations' Libraries.

Sarah Aitchison, the director of UCL Special Collections, said the collection revealed the editing process behind Orwell's published works and the legal anxieties that spurred amendments.

She noted that Gollancz's libel concerns run throughout the letters, with the publisher often requesting that Orwell change names and details to reduce similarities with real people, places and companies.

The papers relating to Keep the Aspidistra Flying, for example, show his frustration over requested changes. He reluctantly conceded: “These alterations spoil the book altogether.”

The Orwell biographer DJ Taylor said: “This is an absolutely fantastic treasure trove from the point of view of Orwell and publishing history … Literary manuscripts have a terrible habit of disappearing into the vaults of private collectors, never to be seen again, so it is wonderful that these can now be made available to everyone.”

Last year, Prof Jean Seaton, the director of the Orwell Foundation, expressed astonishment that the publisher had failed to understand the archive's value.

She argued that such literary archives should not be dispersed to collectors who want “trophies”. 
 “There are lots of people with lots of money who'd like a trophy. But you then lose track of them and they disappear, until they pop up on the market again.”

Bill Hamilton, the literary agent and executor of Orwell's estate, said of the acquisition: “We're thrilled. Bit by bit, all this really important Orwell material is finding its way to UCL, where it should really be.”

The Polish prime minister criticised anyone seen ‘applauding President Putin' at today's Moscow parade

Polish prime minister Donald Tusk said that anyone attending the military parade in Moscow to mark the end of the second world war had brought shame on themselves, after Slovak prime minister Robert Fico became the only European Union leader to attend.

“I try not to comment on the decisions and behaviour of leaders of states, especially from our community,” Tusk told a news conference.

“But there is no doubt in my mind that being at the victory parade in Moscow and applauding President Putin … brings shame to everyone who is there.”

Polish prime minister Donald Tusk said that anyone attending the military parade in Moscow to mark the end of the second world war had brought shame on themselves, after Slovak prime minister Robert Fico became the only European Union leader to attend.

The United States and its European allies are finalising a proposal for a 30-day ceasefire in Ukraine that if refused would see them jointly impose new sanctions on Russia, a French diplomatic source said on Friday. The source said the proposal had still not been given a green light and would be worked on over the weekend at a summit being held in Ukraine.

Support for Ukraine is the “absolute focus” of Britain and its northern European allies, Keir Starmer said as he attended a military summit in Norway that coincided with Russia's Victory Day celebrations. The prime minister met counterparts at a Joint Expeditionary Forces (JEF) leaders' gathering in Oslo on Friday, during which Volodymyr Zelenskyy also spoke virtually.

France and Poland signed a treaty on Friday to increase cooperation on defence, nuclear energy and other measures, in a sign of growing alliances between European nations amid concerns about US commitment to Europe's security. The signing came a day before Ukraine hosts leaders of the so-called “coalition of the willing” – countries led by France and Britain that want to step up support for Ukraine in the face of a more sceptical Trump administration.

Ukrainian authorities claim to have busted a Hungarian spy ring operating on its territory, alleging that Budapest was collecting sensitive military data with one eye on a possible future incursion into the west of the country. Hungary's foreign minister dismissed the accusations as “propaganda” and announced the expulsion of two Ukrainians described as “spies working under diplomatic cover” at the Ukrainian embassy in Budapest.

Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that European leaders from the “coalition of the willing” will meet in Ukraine on Saturday. “In Ukraine, we are also preparing to meet with the leaders of the coalition of the willing … Tomorrow we have meetings,” Zelensky told a military summit in Oslo via video link, AFP reported, without saying who would attend.

Russian president Vladimir Putin greeted North Korean military personnel on Red Square after a military parade marking the defeat of Nazi Germany, several weeks after Pyongyang's troops helped Moscow oust Ukrainian forces from its Kursk region.

That's all from the Europe live blog for today. Thanks for following along.

Despite warnings from European Union officials, Slovakia's Moscow-friendly prime minister, Robert Fico, shook hands with Vladimir Putin at the Kremlin before becoming the only EU leader to attend Russia's 9 May parade of military forces waging war on Ukraine.

The Serbian president, Aleksandar Vučić, whose country aspires to join the 27-nation bloc, also accepted the Russian president's invitation to attend the annual Victory Day celebrations marking the defeat of Nazi Germany in the second world war.

The pair were the only European leaders to travel to Moscow after strong injunctions from EU officials not to do so. On Thursday, the bloc's chief diplomat, Kaja Kallas, said: “All those who truly support peace cannot stand side-by-side with Putin. Those who truly support peace should be in Ukraine tomorrow, not Moscow.”

Kallas added this week that the Russian president was “waging a war right now, not a war from history. That remains on the conscience of those attending”.

Donald Tusk, who later on Friday was due to sign a cooperation and friendship treaty with France including joint security and defence commitments, sharply criticised both leaders, although did so without naming them.

The Polish prime minister said: “For me it is unthinkable that one can be from this part of the world and – during Russia's aggression against Ukraine – be in Red Square and celebrate Victory Day with those who are murdering children, civilians and attacking other countries.”

The United States and its European allies are finalising a proposal for a 30-day ceasefire in Ukraine that if refused would see them jointly impose new sanctions on Russia, a French diplomatic source said on Friday.

The source said the proposal had still not been given a green light and would be worked on over the weekend at a summit being held in Ukraine.

Polish prime minister Donald Tusk said that anyone attending the military parade in Moscow to mark the end of the second world war had brought shame on themselves, after Slovak prime minister Robert Fico became the only European Union leader to attend.

“I try not to comment on the decisions and behaviour of leaders of states, especially from our community,” Tusk told a news conference.

“But there is no doubt in my mind that being at the victory parade in Moscow and applauding President Putin … brings shame to everyone who is there.”

Support for Ukraine is the “absolute focus” of Britain and its northern European allies, Keir Starmer said as he attended a military summit in Norway that coincided with Russia's Victory Day celebrations.

The prime minister met counterparts at a Joint Expeditionary Forces (JEF) leaders' gathering in Oslo on Friday, during which Volodymyr Zelenskyy also spoke virtually.

After the summit, Starmer said the UK-led group's utmost priority was defending the values “hard-won” during the second world war and continuing to stand behind Kyiv.

Speaking to broadcasters, the prime minister was asked what his message would be to Russia and Beijing as Chinese president Xi Jinping attended events in Moscow marking the 80th anniversary of the defeat of Nazi Germany.

Starmer said: “The message of leaders here is very, very clear, and that is that we're focused on Ukraine.

“[President] Zelenskyy came in virtually to part of that meeting.

“And so that's where our absolute focus is – with Ukraine, defending the values that yesterday at VE Day we were remembering and commemorating, that were hard-won in the second world war.”

And that's all from me, Jakub Krupa, but I leave with you Tom Ambrose to guide you through the afternoon.

We don't yet have the full text of the agreement, so it's hard to know exactly what it contains – especially regarding the strength of the language on critical security obligations.

Still, it send a clear signal of political intent from both leaders – for both countries, and, as Tusk suggested (16:52), also towards the United States – that Europe is taking its defence responsibilities more seriously.

Finally, a cynic in me says that it's also worth noting the timing, with Poland's presidential election just over a week away.

While the deal seeks to transcend short-term politics, the visual message — a show of unity and close cooperation with a major European power— will do no harm to the ruling party's candidate, centre-right Warsaw mayor Rafał Trzaskowski, who also recently met with Macron.

Asked about Zelenskyy's comments on tomorrow's meeting of “the coalition of the willing,” Macron confirms it will take place in a hybrid format with some leaders joining in person and others online due to security concerns and that he will take part in it.

On Russia's show of force at the Moscow victory parade and more broadly on the continuing aggression on Ukraine, he says:

“President Putin is on the side of war, not on the side of peace.”

He says the reality of Putin's actions show that any belief that Russia is interested in peace is “wrong at this stage,” and repeats that European partners, together with the US, will keep pushing for a ceasefire.

He is also asked about Slovak prime minister Robert Fico's presence in Moscow, and he diplomatically says he is not sure that's the best reading of European history.

Poland's Tusk isn't quite as diplomatic: repeating his earlier criticism (10:28), he says “being present at the victory parade in Moscow brings shame on whoever is there.”

And that concludes the press conference.

In response to another question, Tusk also dismisses the suggestion that a closer Franco-Polish cooperation is “an alternative, or something that is [done outside] Nato, or, God forbid, anti-American.”

“It's the exact opposite. We've all heard these comments, repeated multiple times, from our American allies, and we in Poland treat these words seriously. … And they were clear: you need to arm, you need to be increasingly self-sufficient, and then you can count on US help, if you pull your weight when it comes to defence,” he says.

He adds that closer relationship with France is a part of that push.

“Yes, Europe needs to be able to defend itself. Yes, every aggressor needs to fear Europe, whether Russia or anyone else,” he says.

Macron responds by saying what's changed is the creation of Nato, which also includes a serious security guarantee in Article 5.

He then goes on to repeat his main argument that European defence and security position needs to be strengthened further.

He says it is needed also because of the growing pressure from the US for Europe to take more responsibility for its safety and become more independent.

He then says that the commemorations this week send a clear reminder that “we cannot succeed alone” and “narrow nationalism” is not the answer.

Tusk comes on the political part of the question to argue that both Macron and himself proved to be able to fight against populist and insurgent right.

He then says that the mutual assistance clause is underpinned by the conviction that all countries learned their lessons from the second world war.

He also stresses that Poland is in the process of building the largest army in Europe to be able to defend itself and offer support to partners, too.

Opening the Q&A, a Polish journalist tells Macron that Poland also had a treaty with France in 1939, and that didn't help it too much when it was invaded, so what's different this time?

And will this treaty last if Marine Le Pen or another far-right figure comes to power?

China is attempting to skew global perceptions of World War II and the government must continue to urge the international community to jointly face the challenge posed by authoritarian states, a source familiar with foreign affairs said on Thursday on condition of anonymity.

President William Lai's (賴清德) speech on Thursday commemorating the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II emphasized that “the invaders always lose, and victory is assured by standing together,” the source said.

The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) hindered the Chinese Nationalist Party's (KMT) attempts at resisting Japan's advances during World War II, but is now hosting a series of events telling the international community a different version of history, the source said.

China is framing the anniversary as a commemoration of resisting Japan and fighting fascism, with Chinese President Xi Jinping (習近平) celebrating with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow.

Starting last year, China has been stepping up its efforts to spread the revisionist message that it was one of the victorious nations in World War II and that it should also shoulder the responsibility of maintaining the post-war world order, the source said.

Their rhetoric suggests that challenging China would upset the world order, and that its actions within the region, as well as Russia's invasion of Ukraine, are legitimate, they said.

China is also attempting to legitimize its claim over Taiwan by saying that it was returned to China when World War II ended, they added.

This phase of Chinese propaganda is expected to last until the conclusion of the military parade in Beijing on Sept. 3, which marks the commemoration of the country's victory over Japan, the source said.

The CCP would continue its efforts to get Taiwanese politicians and groups to participate in its anniversary celebrations in an attempt to skew the interpretation of the war's history in China's favor, they said. 

The central theme of Lai's speech is that the international community must learn from history and act pre-emptively, the source said.

It is not difficult to imagine that state players are using force to destroy undersea cables, infrastructure or launch cyberattacks to further its geopolitical agenda, nor is it inconceivable that foreign forces would attempt to use information warfare to intervene in the elections of democratic countries, the source said, citing the president's speech.



                                                                                The brilliant blue waters, thick foliage and bucolic atmosphere on this seemingly idyllic archipelago deep in the Pacific Ocean belie the key role it now plays in a titanic geopolitical struggle.
Palau is again on the front line as China, and the US and its allies prepare their forces in an intensifying contest for control over the Asia-Pacific region.
The democratic nation of just 17,000 people hosts US-controlled airstrips and soon-to-be-completed radar installations that the US military describes as “critical” to monitoring vast swathes of water and airspace.

Prior to the magnitude 5.9 quake shaking most of Taiwan at 6:53pm yesterday, six other earthquakes stronger than a magnitude of 4, starting with a magnitude 5.5 quake at 6:09pm, occurred in the area. 
CWA Seismological Center Director Wu Chien-fu (吳健富) confirmed that the quakes were all part of the same series and that the magnitude 5.5 temblor was

Kaohsiung's Neimen District (內門) and Pingtung County's Neipu Township (內埔) are under an orange heat alert, which warns of temperatures as high as 36°C for three consecutive days, the CWA said, citing southwest winds.
The heat would also extend to Tainan's Nansi (楠西) and Yujing (玉井) districts, as well as Pingtung's Gaoshu (高樹), Yanpu (鹽埔) and Majia (瑪家) townships, it said, forecasting highs of up to 36°C in those areas

Former Malaysian prime minister Mahathir Mohamad is giving US President Donald Trump three months before his fellow Americans force him to rethink his stringent global tariff strategy, accusing the US leader of “living in an old world.”

In an interview two months ahead of his 100th birthday, the plain-speaking Mahathir said: “Trump will find that his tariffs are hurting America, and the people in America will end up against him.”

The US president's stop-start tariff rollout would impact Asian nations hard, including Malaysia, which faces a 24 percent levy in July unless the two countries can strike a deal.

“It's going to cause America a lot of problems, so I give Trump three months,” said Mahathir, who ruled Malaysia in two stints lasting nearly a quarter of a century. Still working a five-day week from his office in the administrative capital, Putrajaya, the sprightly nonagenarian remains as outspoken as ever.

“Donald Trump is irrational. I don't think he thinks carefully about what he's doing,” Mahathir said.

“His policies on migration — and also trying to reduce the cost of government, sacking thousands of people — all these things are not good,” he said. 

“It will not make America great,” he said, taking a jab at Trump's “make America great again” election slogan.

Asked what he thought of some of Trump's foreign policies — proposing to take over Greenland and seize control of the Panama Canal — Mahathir said the US leader was “living in an old world.”

Throughout his long career, Mahathir was a proponent of a “Look East” policy — pushing Malaysians to find solutions in Asia rather than depending on Western nations.

As US tariffs loom, Mahathir has not changed his mind.

China has taken the brunt of the US president's combative trade policies with 145 percent tariffs on many goods.

Chinese President Xi Jinping (習近平) recently visited Malaysia, part of a three-stop tour to Southeast Asia, where the Chinese leader called for closer cooperation between the two nations. 

“You cannot just stop China because its ability, its capacity, is the same as those of Western countries,” Mahathir said.

“We find that the US, which for some time has been lauding itself as the world's first power, does not want to accept China's development,” he said. 

Malaysia aimed to remain friendly toward both Washington and Beijing, the veteran politician said.

“We don't want to quarrel with China, but we don't want to quarrel with America either,” he added.

“Malaysia's policy is to be friendly with all countries,” he said. 

Mahathir — one of the 20th century's last post-colonial stalwarts — would celebrate his birthday on July 10.

The former leader has been battling health problems, most recently when he was hospitalized after contracting a respiratory infection.

He spent nearly three months in hospital during another stay last year.

Although no longer in power — his fragile coalition, which included long-time political foe and current Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, collapsed in 2020 — Mahathir's views still carry much weight at home and across the region.

However, asked what he thought was his most important legacy, Mahathir said it was “for others” to judge.



                                                                                A new online voting system aimed at boosting turnout among the Philippines' millions of overseas workers ahead of Monday's mid-term elections has been marked by confusion and fears of disenfranchisement.
Thousands of overseas Filipino workers have already cast their ballots in the race dominated by a bitter feud between President Ferdinand Marcos Jr and his impeached vice president, Sara Duterte.
While official turnout figures are not yet publicly available, data from the Philippine Commission on Elections (COMELEC) showed that at least 134,000 of the 1.22 million registered overseas voters have signed up for the new online system, which opened on April 13.

“Tonight, we're making history... Thank you for making history with me,” Lady Gaga told a screaming crowd. 
The Mother Monster, as she is known, started the show at about 10:10pm local time with her 2011 song Bloody Mary. Cries of joy rose from the tightly packed fans who sang and danced shoulder-to-shoulder on the vast stretch of sand. 
Concert organizers said 2.1 million people attended the show.

China and Russia pledged to further deepen their already “no limits” partnership in a joint statement published ahead of Russia's military parade yesterday, as the two sides stressed the importance of maintaining the “correct view” of World War II history.

In a lengthy statement published during Chinese President Xi Jinping's (習近平) visit to Moscow for the commemoration of the 80th anniversary of the end of the World War II, which Russia celebrates on 9 May as Victory Day, Xi and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin said “certain countries ... are attempting to tamper with the results of the victory of World War II.”

Xi is on his 11th visit to Russia since becoming president in 2013. On Thursday, Xi and Putin held nearly four hours of talks in which both leaders described the other as a close friend. Putin announced plans to visit China in the autumn for the commemoration of Japan's defeat in World War II.

The Xi-Putin statement went further than previous ones in directly condemning the US.

“The United States and its allies are trying to promote NATO's eastward expansion into the Asia-Pacific region, build ‘small circles' in the Asia-Pacific region and win over countries in the region to promote their ‘Indo-Pacific strategy,' undermining regional peace, stability and prosperity,” the statement said. 

The statement also said that “unilateral coercive measures, including economic sanctions, that bypass the UN Security Council violate the UN Charter and other international laws and undermine international security interests.”

This week's meeting of the Chinese and Russian leaders underscores the close relationship between the two men who see themselves as a bulwark against US hegemony

Earlier this week, Xi claimed that World War II also represented the “liberation” of Taiwan and marked “Taiwan's return to China.”

The joint Xi-Putin statement stated that Russia “firmly supports the measures taken by the Chinese government to safeguard national sovereignty and territorial integrity and achieve national reunification.”

Although China and Russia do not have a normal military alliance, there are growing concerns in the West about the close security cooperation between the two countries. China and Russia conducted 14 joint military exercises last year, according to data compiled by the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies' ChinaPower project, which tracks military and economic developments.

A Chinese honor guard participated in yesterday's military parade in Moscow for the first time since 2015.

16:18 JST, May 9, 2025

MOSCOW, May 9 (Reuters) – Russia marks the 80th anniversary of the Soviet Union's victory over Nazi Germany in World War Two on Friday with a military parade attended by China's Xi Jinping that Moscow fears Ukraine will try to disrupt after three years of devastating war.

President Vladimir Putin, the longest-serving Kremlin chief since Josef Stalin, will speak at a 0700 GMT parade where thousands of Russian soldiers usually march by and drive military hardware such as intercontinental ballistic missiles and tanks past Lenin's Mausoleum on Red Square.

But the Ukraine war, Europe's deadliest since World War Two, haunts this celebration. Ukraine attacked Moscow with drones for several days this week, and Moscow and Kyiv accused each other of breaking a 72-hour ceasefire declared by Putin.

The Kremlin says the attendance of Russian allies such as Xi, Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva and several dozen leaders from the former Soviet Union, Africa, Asia and Latin America shows Russia is not isolated even if Moscow's former WW2 Western allies want to stay away. From Europe, the leaders of Serbia and Slovakia will attend.

“The victory over fascism, achieved at the cost of enormous sacrifices, has an everlasting significance,” Putin told Xi in the Kremlin. “The countless sacrifices made by both our peoples should never be forgotten.”

The Soviet Union lost 27 million people in World War Two, including many millions in Ukraine, but pushed Nazi forces back to Berlin, where Adolf Hitler committed suicide and the red Soviet Victory Banner was raised over the Reichstag in 1945.

For Russians – and for many of the peoples of the former Soviet Union – May 9 is the most sacred date in the calendar, and Putin, angry at what he says are attempts by the West to belittle the Soviet victory, has sought to use memories of WW2 to unite Russian society.

Chinese Communist Party historians say China's casualties in the 1937-1945 Second Sino-Japanese War were 35 million. The Japanese occupation caused the displacement of as many as 100 million Chinese people and significant economic hardship, as well as the horrific 1937 Nanjing Massacre, during which an estimated 100,000 to 300,000 victims were killed.

Moscow and Kyiv do not publish accurate casualty numbers for the war in Ukraine, though U.S. President Donald Trump, who says he wants peace, says hundreds of thousands of soldiers on both sides have been killed and injured.

Putin has sought to insulate Moscow from the grinding artillery and drone war being fought 600 km (370 miles) away in Ukraine, though Ukrainian drone attacks have in recent days disrupted air travel to the Russian capital.

The Kremlin said the military is doing everything it can to ensure security for the parade next to the Kremlin which Russia said was targeted in 2023 by Ukrainian drones.

There were some drone attack warnings announced overnight in some western Russian regions but no reports of attacks on Moscow, which along with the surrounding region has a population of at least 21 million.

Security is very tight in Moscow. Putin proposed a 72-hour ceasefire would run on May 8, May 9 and May 10, though Ukraine said Russia had broken the ceasefire, a claim dismissed as absurd by Moscow.

The Kremlin said military units from 13 countries, including China, will take part in the parade along with Russian troops, though it was unclear how North Korea – which has helped Russia fight in Ukraine – would be represented.

In Kyiv, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy called on allies to help it resist Russia, which now controls about a fifth of Ukraine.

“Evil cannot be appeased. It must be fought,” Zelenskiy said, according to the Kyiv Post. He criticised Moscow's Victory Day parade. “It will be a parade of cynicism. There is just no other way to describe it. A parade of bile and lies.”

Peter Szijjarto's announcement came after Ukraine's Security Service (SBU) allegedly dismantled a Hungarian military intelligence network operating in Zakarpattia Oblast.

Moscow and Washington discuss the potential resumption of Russian gas supplies to Europe, among other issues related to the peaceful settlement of Russia's war in Ukraine, Russian presidential aide Yuri Ushakov confirmed to the Russian state-run Interfax news agency.



""This is a historic decision, as weapons for Ukraine will be purchased at the expense of the proceeds from frozen Russian assets through the European Peace Fund,"" Denys Shmyhal said.

Kurt Volker said that now ""there is more alignment"" between Ukraine and the U.S. under the Trump Administration than at the beginning of 2025.



The approval marks a key step in international efforts to hold Moscow accountable for what is considered the gravest violation of international law committed against Ukraine.

Although Moscow declared on April 28 that it would halt all military actions from May 8 to midnight on May 11 to mark Victory Day, strikes on civilian areas have continued. 

Under Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin's rule, millions of Ukrainians died during the Holodomor, a man-made famine in 1932–1933. The dictator also oversaw mass deportations, purges of Ukrainian intellectuals and leaders, and the suppression of the Ukrainian language and culture.

According to the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU), this marks the first time Ukrainian authorities have exposed a Hungarian military intelligence network conducting activities harmful to Ukraine. 

Delegations from 35 countries and the Council of Europe gathered in Lviv as EU officials prepare to approve both new defense aid and steps toward establishing a tribunal for Russian leadership.

The ruling marks a significant victory for RFE/RL amid growing concerns about U.S. funding cuts to independent media countering Russian disinformation.

U.S. Cardinal Robert Prevost was elected the new pope and leader of the Roman Catholic Church on Thursday, taking the name Pope Leo XIV, a senior cardinal announced on May 8 to crowds gathered in St. Peter's Square, according to Vatican News.



Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico arrived in Moscow on May 9 to celebrate Victory Day, commemorating the 80th anniversary of the defeat of Nazi Germany in World War II. 

Slovak and Russian press agencies reported that Fico was accompanied by other politicians from his party, including Erik Kaliniak, Lubos Blaga, Richard Gluck. A deputy from the far-right Slovak National Party, Miroslav Radachovsky, was also a part of the group.

During his visit, Fico is expected to hold bilateral talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin, Chinese President Xi Jinping, Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, and a government representative of Vietnam.

Fico, who anticipated arriving in Moscow on May 8, was delayed in his arrival, following the Baltic states' decision to bar Slovakia's government plane from flying over their respective country's airspace en route to Moscow.

""Estonia informed us a couple of minutes ago that it will not allow us to fly over its territory,"" Fico wrote on Facebook. ""Of course, we are talking about a deliberate attempt to disrupt my visit to Moscow on the occasion of the official celebration of the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II.""

The Kremlin uses the annual victory celebrations for propaganda purposes and to showcase its military might, while Russian propaganda leans heavily on the Soviet victory in World War II.

Fico is known for inflammatory statements on Ukraine and the war that often echo Moscow's talking points. He has repeatedly criticized military aid for Ukraine and called for restoring relations with Russia after the war.

Fico's planned visit comes as another jab at the Western efforts to internationally isolate Putin over Russia's full-scale war in Ukraine. Slovakia is a member state of both NATO and the EU.

The Communist Party of Russia unveiled a monument to Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin in occupied Melitopol, Zaporizhzhia Oblast, on May 8 to commemorate Victory Day in World War II, the party announced.

The statue carries a plaque that reads: ""To the organizer and inspirer of the victory of the Soviet people over the Nazi invaders, Generalissimo of the Soviet Union Joseph Stalin, from grateful descendants.""

The ceremony was attended by Russian-installed officials and local school students who laid flowers at the site.

Melitopol has been under Russian occupation since March 2022.

Stalin's legacy in Ukraine is marked by profound suffering. Under his rule, millions of Ukrainians died during the Holodomor, a man-made famine in 1932–1933. 

The dictator also oversaw mass deportations, purges of Ukrainian intellectuals and leaders, and the suppression of the Ukrainian language and culture.

While some in Russia credit Stalin for leading the Soviet Union to victory in World War II, portraying him solely as a military hero ignores the brutal policies and immense human cost of his regime.

The monument comes amid a broader revival of Stalin's cult in Russia. 

On April 29, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a decree renaming Volgograd's international airport to ""Stalingrad."" Days earlier, Russian media reported that Putin had endorsed the renaming of Volgograd's Gumrak airport to honor the dictator.

Now we wait.

There is a sweat-it-out period on Canada-U.S. trade now. There aren't real negotiations going on, not in the nitty-gritty sense, not yet. There's a kind of pause to regroup. 

On Tuesday, President Donald Trump sat next to Prime Minister Mark Carney in the Oval Office and said there's nothing the United States wants from Canada. He told reporters there's nothing Mr. Carney can say or do to get him to lift tariffs on Canadian goods. 

“It's the way it is,” he said. And we can take Mr. Trump at his word. For now.

He made tariffs a big part of his first 100 days. His political play now is to tell Americans that countries around the world are lining up to beg him for a deal. Why would he drop his tariffs wholesale now? 

But in a few months, things might change. The U.S. economy contracted a little in the first quarter of 2025. U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said Wednesday that there's greater uncertainty, and a greater risk of higher inflation and unemployment. Mr. Trump's approval ratings are down.

At some point, he might want to beat some form of partial retreat on his tariff threats. If he wants to fight on fewer fronts, he would pay no political price by making a deal with Canada.

Foreign Affairs Minister Mélanie Joly made that point repeatedly on Wednesday as she made the round of TV news networks: Polls show Mr. Trump's popularity is declining. He faces political and economic pressure. We'll see.

The wait won't be easy. Business leaders are already warning the Prime Minister that time is not on Canada's side. Uncertainty is scaring off investors. The Canadian auto sector is scrambling to mitigate its big losses, but rolling shutdowns at assembly plants could become permanent.

But now we'll start to see agreements that first-movers are making with Mr. Trump. And the handshake deal that Britain signed isn't a good advertisement for a quick agreement.

The Brits made concessions to get the U.S. to lift steel tariffs, but they still face 10-per-cent tariffs on most goods. Prime Minister Keir Starmer sued for trade peace and paid a steep price to settle quickly. 

Maybe time will help. That's bad for Canadian autoworkers in Canada and for U.S. automakers, too. Mr. Trump will hear more grumbling.

Canada's ambassador to the U.S., Kirsten Hillman, told The Globe and Mail on Thursday that the immediate focus is getting tariffs lifted, but a good deal cannot be sacrificed just to do it quickly.

There are things happening: “We're discussing next steps, that will include exactly who talks to who,” Ms. Hillman said.

Yet real horse-trading hasn't begun. Issues such as military spending and critical minerals haven't been linked to tariffs or other trade issues yet. Mr. Trump, in his meetings with Mr. Carney, didn't suggest anything he might want from Canada in return for lowering tariffs.

Ms. Hillman said pressure on Mr. Trump matters and might help convince him to ease tariffs. She noted there's increasing attention to rising prices of everyday items in the U.S – but that closing a deal isn't as simple as waiting for time to soften the other side. 

“What will actually be definitive, in terms of getting us over the line for a deal, is unknowable at this point,” she said.

“It will be a combination of political pressure, economic pressure, consumer and voter pressure on both sides of the border. In the abstract, I don't think we can define it. Americans wanting resolution to some of these trade challenges and prices rising is very important for us.”

In the short term, Mr. Carney has political room to pivot to domestic economic issues.

His election campaign was premised not just on dealing with Mr. Trump, but on a promise that if the President doesn't budge, he'd mitigate the effects by building the domestic economy. Mr. Carney promised to bring down internal trade barriers, and more importantly, to expedite and streamline approvals for resource projects. 

“If that happens, capital will be deployed, and we can build things,” said Goldy Hyder, the president of the Business Council of Canada.

But business leaders still want stability soon. Mr. Carney was elected to wrestle with Mr. Trump. It won't be an easy wait.

Gen X moms are living it up in middle age, and couldn't care less about the expectations society has for them

The last time Krista Johnston played water polo she was 10 years old in swimming lessons. Forty years later, looking for a workout that wasn't aquafit, she signed up for a Friday morning water polo drop-in at her local Kelowna, B.C., pool, expecting, at that hour, to swim with other people roughly her own age. Instead, she stood poolside on the first day in her teal one-piece with tummy control, the only one with a float belt, watching super-fit, much younger swimmers expertly slinging the ball around. To flee or not to flee? 

The dialogue in her head went something like this: Why am I embarrassed? Because I'm 50? Good for me. Because I have a little more around the middle? Well, I've had two kids. And then more loudly, insistently, this thought: I deserve to be here.

The women of Gen X (my friends and I included) share her defiance, as they arrive at middle age, their careers established, their families launched, or nearly so.

Our generation, now age 45 to 60, has officially hit the years of colonoscopies and mammograms. And we all know how it's supposed to go. At the half-century mark, men get a power upgrade and become silver foxes. Women get turkey necks and bingo wings and become irrelevant, invisible and no longer you-know-what-able.

Gen X is having none of it. The mothers I spoke with for this story are starting businesses, taking up skateboarding, travelling with their adult children, dreaming up their next steps. 

They are focused on personal agency and joy. They dropped more F-bombs than any batch of interviews I've done for a story. They've probably danced past midnight more recently than many twentysomethings.

The last thing they are is invisible or irrelevant. “Society wants to put us out to pasture,” says Ms. Johnston. “We're not accepting that.” 

Middle-aged motherhood has been long overdue for a female-friendly reboot, ideally a fearsome, liberated remake that stomps the crap out of what Ms. Johnston calls that “age-shaming baloney.”

This power move is already happening in Hollywood. Gen X directors and actors such as Nicole Kidman and Cate Blanchett are producing on-screen storylines where middle-aged moms have hot sex with besotted younger men, or team up to mastermind heists and criminal cover ups. 

Add to the movement Michelle Obama, who, at 61, gets honourary Gen X status. When her absence from public events prompted rumours of a marriage breakup, the former first lady explained on a podcast in April, “I chose to do what was best for me, not what I had to do, not what I thought other people wanted me to do.” 

Even Stacy London, who, for years, dictated fashion advice on her make-over TV show, What Not to Wear, has now hit middle age and menopause with second thoughts about her previously critical assessments of women as frumpy and too-flashy. She's just launched a cleverly marketed mea culpa: a new TV show called Wear Whatever the F You Want.

Points for the pithy title, although this doesn't make up for “No miniskirts after 35.” Also, quick question: If we're wearing whatever we want, do we still need instructions?

Because telling Gen X what to do is not going to fly. Based on the conversations I had for this story, the Big Change fueling all this ferocity is not hormones and empty nests and culture wars and grey hair. It's the unsung superpower of middle-aged womanhood: You stop giving a damn. 

  – Darla Halyk  

In Langley, B.C., Darla Halyk, 52, has zero damns left to give. (The actual expression she used was much more on brand.) “I'm not the girl walking down the street concerned about what anybody thinks anymore.” she says. “I speak my mind clearly if someone says something I disagree with and I don't fear the repercussions of making them uncomfortable.” 

And so, you won't be surprised to hear that at the pool that day, Ms. Johnston decided no one would put her in a corner. She climbed down the ladder, while everyone else dove in, and chased the ball until she thought her lungs felt like they would explode. “I didn't want to strut out there, you know, like, ‘I'm ready,'” she says, “but I had to.” 

Had to, Ms. Johnston says, because she remembers the way her mom spoke wistfully about missed adventures, and then died, at 65, before she felt free enough to do them. Because Ms. Johnston wants to set a more empowered example for her own kids, and for the younger mothers trying to break the rules behind her. 

Because why did we all work so freakin' hard just to slink away from life now?

This expletive-laced remaking of middle age was probably inevitable. What else would you expect from a generation that leans hard on sarcasm and surliness, chafes at dumb rules and knows the world is, sigh, unjust. 

And who better to lead this modern new middle-aged motherhood franchise than Generation X, my small yet feisty cohort that‘s always punched above its weight?

We were the first large group of grade-schoolers who went home to empty houses, and the last teenagers to get up to no good without social media surveillance. The first female generation to surpass our male peers in educational attainment. (Although we still earned less than them.) The first mothers to get one-year maternity leave, and the second sandwich generation, caring simultaneously for still-growing children and fast-aging parents.

We saw the Tiananmen Square student massacre and the fall of the Berlin Wall happen six months apart, and watched 22-year-old Monica Lewinsky get the blame for the blue dress, so we learned early that borders change and tyrants rise, and that Pity Him would come after #MeToo.

But we also raised our sons to hopefully understand consent in a way our own dates sometimes didn't. We warned our daughters not to take abortion rights for granted. And we took them both to the therapy we never got. 

'The fact that like we're not looking like the Golden Girls any more is good, but it's also bad. Because now we have Jennifer Aniston at 50,' Ms. Halyk says.FELICIA CHANG/The Globe and Mail

We perfected motherhood hacks well before TikTok glamourized them. One mom I know simmered Bulls-Eye Barbecue Sauce on the stove for years to home-cooking acclaim. (In case you're interested, she also cleverly stocks her car with the gum flavour nobody in her family likes so she's never disappointed by an empty pack. )

Doing it all still broke many of us early. But there was a silver lining. At daycare, the kids with mismatched socks and single mittens were friendship beacons for frazzled moms barely holding it together and the resulting wine-soaked girls' nights were training for seizing our own identities in mid-life. 

But this isn't a fairy tale: Getting old also sucks. You ache in new places. Your girlfriends get cancer. Marriages unravel. Parents die. The kids leave. Illness derails your plans. 

And more than you like to admit, you grieve for your prettier self. 

“I didn't think I would feel so sad about getting old,” says Ms. Halyk. “I didn't think I was that vain. I have never been a high fashion, wear a lot of makeup lady.” She hates that “a little bit of grey hair” makes her feel insecure. Some days, she catches her eyes in the mirror, unprepared for the reflection. “Like two days ago, I looked 10 years younger.”

Having hit middle age with independence and financial means, and still just enough insecurity, Gen X women have become a lucrative demographic. Menopause has gone mainstream, selling books and lux lubricants. From a new company started by Gen X actor Naomi Watts, there's the Vag of Honor intimate moisture gel and the Oh My Glide play oil, a top seller, according to the website. Unfortunately, much like easy access to consistent medical care for a health issue guaranteed to affect half the population, neither are available in Canada.

Meanwhile, according to social media, a middle-aged woman's wish list is reduced to miracle winkle cream, wall Pilates, incontinence underwear and pelvic floor therapy. That last one would feel like progress, if it wasn't immediately followed by an ad of a plastic surgeon drawing on a woman's face to mark the parts he would fix. (Only the neck, chin, cheeks, eyes, nose and forehead.)

“Pretending that it doesn't ever bother us that our necks are getting saggy isn't helpful,” says Krista O‘Reilly-Davi-Digui, a 53-year-old mom and wellness coach in Edson, Alta., who leads an online mentoring community for middle-aged women. At the same time, “If you stop spending 80 per cent of your waking hours hating your body, trying to change our body, trying to find clothes to make your body look a different way, you've got a lot of space now to do your creative work.”

Life also has a way of minimizing the smaller problems – and clarifying our priorities -by burdening us with larger loss.

Ms. Halyk, for example, abandoned her writing career after receiving death threats for telling a story about a sexual assault she experiences as a young woman. “You know, we all go through stuff,” she says. “You go though it, and you heal.” 

Ms. O‘Reilly-Davi-Digui, lost her 23-year-old son to suicide in 2019. In therapy, she worked hard on self-compassion, and how to carry a terrible grief that will be with her forever. “It was not a pretty journey,” she says. Feeling joy again was difficult and emotional work. She moved through it with the help of professional mental health care and women who gave her space to be honest – the kind of collective embrace, she says, we need to foster more in society.

Oorbee Roy, a Toronto mom who took up skateboarding in her 40s and is now known around the internet as Aunty Skates, has an inherited condition that means she could have a heart attack at any time. “I'm hyper aware of the fact that these are good years,“ and she refuses to waste them. 

  – Oorbee Roy  

Early this year, Ms. Roy, 50, announced to her husband she would not be folding the laundry anymore. “And he's like, ‘but that‘s adulting,'” she recalls. She stood her ground: The clothes come out of the dryer, get dumped in a basket and she doesn't care. “I don't want to do all this mundane stuff anymore.” Two weeks ago, however, she came home from visiting her mother, and her folded clothes had also been put away. “That,” she says, “was like foreplay.” 

A laundry strike may not be world changing. But Ms. O‘Reilly-Davi-Digui sees this middle-aged tension as our true selves saying, “Stop. No more devaluing myself, no more putting myself last, no more performing.“

This “reimagining of how we move through the world” can be messy, she says. Sometimes “you need to scream and get that rage out of your body.” (Insert F-bomb where appropriate.) 

When I asked Gen X women for their best sources of perspective and meaning, they looked in two directions – their parents aging ahead of them, and their kids coming up behind. “I think we're very lucky to be Gen X,” Ms. Halyk told me. “We've gotten to see history and the future, and really live in the line between them.”

From that vantage point, you see what it‘s like to get older, for better and worse. Maybe you start lifting weights, not so much to lose weight, but to dodge your mom‘s knee surgery at 70. Or you invest in friends who will remind you of past adventures when your memory fades like your father‘s. 

With your kids, there's common music and culture – a shortcut to closeness. You've likely been getting IT support from them for years already – why stop listening now? 

Gen X moms are quick to say yes – to concerts with their kids, or pub nights with their millennial co-workers. When Ms. Halyk‘s daughter wanted to go with her to Disneyland for her 21st birthday, she made it happen, and even went on her most terrifying ride, the Ferris Wheel. At work, younger colleagues have taught Ms. Johnston about bubble tea and the shows they liked, and energized her natural curiosity. “Sometimes, I would forget that I was more than twice their age.” And at water polo, the players were generous and welcoming; she was soon joining them for post-scrimmage conversation in the hot tub. 

Ms. O‘Reilly-Davi-Digui says her daughters, both in their 20s, are a primary motivator for how she chooses to live.  “I want something better for them, or at least, I want to model a brave way of being in the world.” 

  – Krista Johnston   

For Ms. Johnston, a more empathetic understanding of her mother also looms large in her decisions today. She sees now that her mom was forced to be the serious parent because of her fun-loving father, yet always pushed her daughters to be independent and adventurous. At 58, her mom went back to school, to upgrade her skills, an act of bravery her then 28-year-old daughter didn't fully appreciate. And Ms. Johnston now clearly recognizes a yearning for what might have been, when her mom listened to accounts of her children's travels.

She thinks of this when she sticks with water polo, when she proposes renting out the house and working on a sheep farm in Scotland, and realizes she would go, in a heartbeat, except her husband isn't keen, and she still feels selfish spending money to chase her own desires. 

“I'm not as brave as I think I am, or want to be,” Ms. Johnston says. And yet, this is now or never time. “Do I take a chance? Do you go out on a limb? Do I want to just be accepting things that I'm not okay with until I die?” 

Her fear is that she'll get to her mom‘s age, with the same regrets. “That definitely lights a huge fire under me.” Her mother‘s story also reminds her how abruptly that fire can go out. “I've survived. I've seen. I've done,” she says. “I'm lucky I'm here.” 

'I think Gen Xers we're a little bit reckless. We kind of fly under the radar anyway. So why not do whatever we wanna do?' Ms. Roy says.Jess Deeks/The Globe and Mail

Every Halloween, Ms. Roy and husband, host a rager in their home. They hire two bartenders, and glow-in the dark Jello syringes are the custom cocktail. They invite all the neighbours so no one calls the police. There's dancing and karaoke, until the guests are sent home at 2 a.m. A couple of years ago, a younger mom in attendance found Ms. Roy, then dressed as the creepy, crooked-necked ghost from The Haunting of Hill House, and thanked her proving it‘s possible to still have fun as an adult. 

And yet, for years Ms. Roy sat on the sidelines, while her husband and children whizzed around the skateboard park, talking herself out of having fun by joining them. She told herself: “I won't be very good. It‘s too late for me. I'm going to hurt myself. People will laugh at me.” 

And then, at 43, she decided she wanted to be a participant in, not a witness to, her family's life. The joy she felt from that first clumsy ride was unexpected. She thought, “I want more of this in my life,” And life, she realized, was a lot like skateboarding – you fall a lot, you think about what you did wrong, you go again. If you're lucky, you eventually land the trick. “But it‘s really about the journey.” 

Ms. Halyk, who handles accounts for a tax services company, is currently launching her own business, Pawsh Trail Co., a pet product line designed to help woman walk and care more easily for their large dogs

“I just see myself in my power, more than ever,” Ms. Halyk says. “You're not strapped to the toddler or even the soccer practices. You have more you.” 

More room, for “what next?” as Ms.O‘Reilly-Davi-Digui likes to say. 

On that front, Ms. Roy is starting an Aunty Skates podcast. Ms. Halyk dreams of buying an acreage with her kids, and raising chickens and canning her own tomatoes. Ms. Johnston injured her rotator cup during water polo drills; she plans to return in September, but has joined a competitive dragon boat team in the meantime. 

All this example-setting and boundary-moving, personal and public, is important: Middle age can be a grim and lonely place, the time of life with the highest suicide rates for women. 

That‘s why women need to come together and share, says Ms. O‘Reilly-Davi-Digui, for their own benefit, but also so that their example trickles down. She notes that her 25-year-old daughter is following hormone specialists and pelvic floor therapists on Instagram. Her middle age has already shifted, just like Gen X evolved from the activism of their mothers' generation. 

“The more that we all practise a new way of being, we're just sort of pinging off each other,” says Ms. O‘Reilly-Davi-Digui. “We're creating a new cultural narrative.

We might wonder why we waited so long. Considering her own reasons, Michelle Obama suggested that women too often worry about disappointing people. “I could have made a lot of these decisions years ago, but I didn't give myself that freedom.” 

Giving yourself the freedom to choose is but one lesson of Gen X aging that‘s also a lifelong happiness practice. Among the others: Mind the hour, and be grateful for the day; learn from the people you value, young and old; be bold and brave and silly as often as you can.

And then there's this one, from which all of those others flow: 

On a recent evening, I stood in a kitchen with a group of Gen X women. One mom, an accountant, described once begging the local baker to make three lasagnas in her own casserole dishes so she could pass them off as home made at the school bake sale – prompting laughter, à la “we've all been there.”

But in the pause that followed, a second mom, who had stayed home with her kids and whose talents I have long admired, quietly spoke up: She'd also felt judged, by the working-outside-the home moms, for bringing in the lasagna she supposedly “had so much free time” to cook herself. The moment landed hard: Mothers, of every age, get enough blame for being too warm, too cold, too absent, too present. Why do we add to it? 

“We are all feeling the same way, and have come through so much,” says Ms. Halyk. “We need to be gracious with each other and ourselves.” If Gen X, while rebranding middle-aged motherhood, passes down any lesson, may it be this one.

Canada lost more than 30,000 manufacturing jobs last month while Windsor, Ont., saw a jump in its unemployment rate as U.S. tariffs take aim at the automotive sector and feed into economic uncertainty. 

Statistics Canada's Labour Force Survey on Friday said employment increased by 7,400 nationally, though that figure was padded by an increase in election-related hiring. The overall unemployment rate rose to 6.9 per cent, up from 6.7 per cent in April. 

The latest jobs figures illustrate how tariffs are beginning to squeeze the Canadian economy, affecting regions and industries most exposed to trade with the United States. 

“It doesn't take an archeological dig to realize this is a weak report,” BMO chief economist Douglas Porter wrote in a client note. 

“This is the first major data reading for April, and it shows that tariffs are already taking a material bite out of the economy.” 

Ontario saw the largest decline in employment, falling by 35,000, with most of those jobs in the manufacturing sector. In Windsor, a major hub for the automotive industry, the unemployment rate jumped by 1.4 percentage points, reaching 10.7 per cent. 

Stellantis STLA-N temporarily laid off 3,800 workers after closing its Windsor plant for a week beginning May 5. This followed a two- week closure in April, a move the company said it made to assess the impact of the U.S. tariffs on imported vehicles. 

Since April 3, cars imported into the United States have faced a 25-per-cent tariff based on their non-U.S. content. 

Windsor finds itself on the wrong side of Trump's bitter tariff spat

Economists expect global trade tensions, as well as tariffs imposed on Canada specifically, to further weigh on the economy in the coming months and drive up the unemployment rate above 7 per cent. 

Michael Davenport, a senior economist at Oxford Economics, said fiscal stimulus from the federal government as well as lower countertariffs will lessen the impending slowdown. 

“But we still think a recession is under way that will lead to 120,000 job losses and drive the unemployment rate to 7.4 per cent by the end of this year,” Mr. Davenport wrote in a client note. 

Economists expect the April job report increases the odds of a quarter percentage point rate cut from the Bank of Canada in June. 

The Bank of Canada held its interest rate steady in April amid uncertainty in the trade outlook, but Governor Tiff Macklem signalled the central will be ready to act if needed. 

The U.S. trade war has weighed on business and consumer confidence as the economic outlook deteriorates. Friday's job report found that employees working in trade-exposed industries dependent on U.S. demand were more likely to anticipate fewer employees at their workplace over the next six months. 

But most employees remained confident in their own job security, with just under three in four workers surveyed saying that they disagreed or strongly disagreed that they might lose their job in the next six months. 

Meanwhile, average hourly wage growth slowed down last month to 3.4 per cent on an annual basis. Average hourly wages stood at $36.13.

Trump has celebrated a ""very conclusive"" deal with the UK that comes amid the threat of 10% tariffs. However, those tariffs are set to remain in place, with only modest changes put on the table.

US President Donald Trump announced what he called a ""breakthrough"" trade deal with the United Kingdom on Thursday.

Trump said the ""final details"" of the agreement were still being ""written up.""

The modest deal leaves the 10% tariffs on UK imports, but slightly increases access to agricultural goods for both countries and lowers duties on UK car parts.

For its part, the UK reduced tariffs on US goods from an average of 5.1% to 1.8%.

A UK official told reporters that was ""not a finished, classic 'bells and whistles' free trade agreement,"" cited by Reuters. He added that there was more serious work to do.

""The actual deal is a very conclusive one we think, just about everything has been approved,"" he said in the Oval Office.

Earlier Thursday, Trump posted to social media that the agreement would ""cement the relationship between the United States and the United Kingdom for many years to come.""

""It opens up a tremendous market for us,"" the US president said, acknowledging that he had not fully been aware of the restrictions American firms face to do business in the UK.

Trump said the deal affirms that ""reciprocity and fairness is a vital principle of international trade,"" adding that it will increase access for US agricultural products.

The US president promised they would be finalized ""in the coming weeks.""

UK Prime Minister Kier Starmer on Thursday said, ""This is a really fantastic, historic day,"" as he appeared in a joint video link with Trump during simultaneous news conferences in London and Washington.

Starmer said the deal ""delivers on the promise to protect"" UK carmakers and steel manufacturers.  

He had hinted at a forthcoming announcement earlier on Thursday.

""Talks with the US have been ongoing and you'll hear more from me about that later today,"" Starmer told a press conference in London. ""But make no mistake, I will always act in our national interest, for workers, businesses and families, to deliver security and renewal for our country.""

A British official suggested that the UK was considering lowering its own tariffs on US cars as well as cutting digital sales tax affecting US tech companies, Reuters reported.

Since taking office early this year, the Trump administration has been actively expanding the US tariff policies.

In April, Trump announced broad tariffs on US trading partners, however, most of the tariffs announced were later reversed or paused to allow for trade negotiations. However, the 145% levy on Chinese imports still stands.

The US president has repeatedly said that multiple countries are eager to finalize deals with the US.

Investors will be watching to see if Trump can deescalate the trade war he triggered, sparking chaos in stock markets around the world.

Officials from the US and China are meeting in Switzerland on Saturday to find a resolution to the trade war between the world's two largest economies.

The UK has sought to expand global trade ties ever since it left the European Union. But Brexit also brought some light relief when it came to dealing with Trump's tariffs — with the UK only suffering a 10% hit, half of the 20% announced against the EU.

Nevertheless, a trade deal with the US is seen as key by Starmer's government.

""The United States is an indispensable ally for both our economic and national security,"" a Downing Street spokesperson said. ""Talks on a deal between our countries have been continuing at pace and the Prime Minister will update later today.""

Britain earlier this week struck a free trade agreement with India — the biggest trade deal since Brexit.

On Tuesday, a UK official announced good progress amid talks with Washington on lowering tariffs on steel and autos. Discussions are also ongoing regarding Trump's recent announcement of 100% tariff on all movies produced outside the US.

The brutal beating of the 29-year-old during a traffic stop was caught on video, provoking widespread outrage.

We go to Memphis for an update after jurors acquitted three former Memphis police officers of the murder of Tyre Nichols, a 29-year-old Black father who died after the officers brutally beat him during a traffic stop in January 2023. The group beating was caught on video, provoking widespread outrage and calls for police reform. The three officers still face sentencing after they were convicted of separate federal charges, along with two other officers who pleaded guilty to the state charges and will not stand trial. “A lot of us were shocked,” says Amber Sherman, of the Memphis community's response. Sherman, a community organizer and member of Black Lives Matter Memphis, joined the family Thursday at a community vigil and protest. She warns this latest acquittal will “embolden” Memphis police as they continue to “do whatever they want.”

“Tabkha: Recipes From Under the Rubble” reimagines traditional Palestinian cuisine amid genocide.

“Tabkha: Recipes From Under the Rubble” reimagines traditional Palestinian cuisine amid genocide.

In the heart of Gaza, during the darkest days of Israel's 18-month genocide, Chef Mona Zahed continued to cook. At the age of 38, with four children depending on her, Zahed became a beacon of hope for her family as she navigated despair and a lack of food while continuing her culinary practice. Her passion for cooking not only fueled her survival but also culminated in the release of her cookbook, Tabkha: Recipes From Under the Rubble. The book, which showcases 20 traditional Palestinian recipes and includes innovative alternatives born from extreme hardship, is a crucial documentation of Palestinian cultural tradition amid Israel's genocidal campaign of erasure. Published by Slingshot Books, Tabkha also features illustrations made by 21 artists.

“I'm a science graduate and a proud mother of four: Mohammad, 16, Hayat, 15, Sarah, 14, and Zahed, 10,” Zahed told Truthout. “We live in a home that's partially fallen apart, in an area of Gaza that's seen a lot of destruction. Many buildings are just piles of rubble, and we struggle to find basic needs like water for washing and drinking. The streets are cluttered with trash and debris, but despite it all, we're grateful to be back in our homes and are determined to make a life here.”

The biting cold and absence of basic utilities highlight the challenges she endures. “It's freezing here because we have no windows to block the chilly air. We cover the gaps with nylon, which doesn't really keep us warm for our children, but at least it's a step up from the tent we lived in while we were displaced.”

Before the genocide began, Zahed ran a teaching center and her husband managed his own pharmacy while their kids attended school. Their home shared a neighborhood with several international organizations.

“Our life before the war was beautiful, Alhamdulillah. We enjoyed everything around us and were on the verge of financial stability. I taught at the center from 8 am to 5 pm,” Zahed shared. Her commitment to her children's education was clear: “I would take a break from 10-11 am to cook and care for them before heading back to teach.” She even brought her young child, Zahed, along with her, proudly noting, “My children are the top in their classes, Alhamdulillah. I always tried to ensure that their education remained unaffected by my work or their father's, but when the war hit, everything changed.”

Zahed says she'll never forget the Israeli assault's first day. “I was getting my children ready for school for their exams, and at first, we didn't understand what was happening; we thought it was just rain or thunder. Confusion and worry set in as I kept them indoors while we followed the news, struggling to process the shock of the unfolding chaos. Three days later, our neighborhood, known for its towers and buildings, became one of the first bombed, prompting us to evacuate as the danger drew alarmingly near to our home.”

Amid the attacks, Zahed found creative ways to deal with the scarcity in her cooking. “During the genocide, I crafted recipes from the limited resources we had due to starvation and food shortages.” Despite the dire circumstances, she worked hard to uplift her children's spirits. “They were satisfied with what I made, even eating meals they had previously disliked because they simply had no other choice.”

“Moreover, there was no gas, which made meal preparation incredibly time-consuming; we had to cook things in advance,” Zahed explains.

“Sometimes, when we found a single apple, we felt a wave of happiness, slicing it thinly to share among four of us once a week,” Zahed said. Necessity demanded innovation in her recipes: “When yeast was unavailable, I experimented with fermenting dough. With no fresh fish around, I used canned tuna to create fesikh, sometimes frying it and other times baking it with vegetables. I transformed luncheon meat into various dishes, frying it or crafting it into shawarma, while canned beef became a savory grilled delight with parsley and onion. I even added vermicelli to our lentil soup, constantly adapting to make the most of what little we had.”

Now two months into a total blockade on all aid into Gaza, tens of thousands of Palestinian children are in urgent need of medical care due to malnutrition.

Even these meals, with their alterations borne out of need, could be logistically difficult to put together. “Most of our food consisted of canned items, which were hard to find and often too expensive,” said Zahed. “As a woman and a mother, I bore a heavy responsibility during those [first] 15 months, looking after many people. Those were tough days, especially when we ran out of flour; it broke my heart to see my children without bread. We often spent our days eating just pieces of biscuits from aid packages, only two at a time per packet.”

These extreme food shortages were not unintended by Israel, but were deliberate — “a tactic of genocide,” according to a UN report from July 2024:

Israel made its intentions to starve everyone in Gaza explicit, implemented its plans and predictably created a famine throughout Gaza. Tracking the geography of Israel's starvation tactics alongside Israeli officials' statements confirms its intent. Israel opened with a total siege that weakened all Palestinians in Gaza. Then, Israel used starvation to induce forcible transfer, harm and death against people in the north, pushing people into the south, only to starve, bombard and kill people in newly created refugee camps in the south.

The consequences have been devastating. “Never in post-war history had a population been made to go hungry so quickly and so completely as was the case for the 2.3 million Palestinians living in Gaza,” the report stated.

Israel has also repeatedly targeted Palestinian cooks and food aid providers, killing those who are striving to feed a starving population.

Now two months into a total blockade on all aid into Gaza, tens of thousands of Palestinian children are in urgent need of medical care due to malnutrition. Dozens of Palestinians have died have died due to Israel's starvation policy. Amid the longest and most encompassing blockade ever imposed on the besieged territory, international food organizations in Gaza have said their supplies are gone. Nearly 290,000 children may perish soon if food is not allowed in, Al Jazeera reported.

Before conditions further plummeted, Zahed found ways to prioritize her children's nutrition. “Sometimes, I would take the leftover white rice from lunch, add spices and seasonings so that my children would accept it for dinner.” She made use of every available ingredient: “We used dry bread in lentil soup or in salads called ‘fattoush,'” showcasing her resourcefulness in ensuring her family's sustenance amid scarcity.

Zahed explained to Truthout how the genocide has changed her. “The war affected me a lot, but it proved to me that I'm strong. It has made me older and taught me many lessons, placing many responsibilities on my shoulders, yet we remained steadfast.” Those responsibilities came under the most harrowing of conditions. “One of the most horrifying days was the night we were forced to flee our home when they planned to bomb the tower nearby. Even when I ask my children about their most terrifying memories of the war, they also mention this night.”

“Another terrifying moment was when we fled from Deir al-Balah to Khan Younis, traversing streets filled with tanks and snipers. We truly believed that it could be our last moment. With no other choice, we pushed through, surviving by a miracle while witnessing people being injured and killed right before our eyes.”

Zahed mourned the profound loss of Gaza's beauty due since October 7, 2023. “Just a day before the war erupted, I strolled along the beach, expressing to my brother how lovely Gaza was while yearning for job opportunities and development. Now, Gaza feels like a graveyard; returning home, I barely recognized the streets, filled with sorrow as if we had regressed a century. We hope for a day when it can be rebuilt.”

“While the world sympathizes with us, many see us merely as numbers. Our suffering, perceived as normal to some, overshadows our identities; we are not just statistics but individuals with families and friends. The ongoing violence reduces us to mere figures, yet we are people deserving of a dignified life.”

Zahed's book highlights Palestinian cultural tradition during a time when Israeli forces are trying to erase everything about Palestinian life. It is an attempt to save this heritage and traditional food even with the absence of some basic ingredients.

Despite the horrors surrounding her, Zahed found she could engage with her children through food: “My children were confident in my cooking. When we stumbled upon ingredients for a meal we hadn't had in a long time, their joy was palpable as they exclaimed, ‘Mom, this is the Gazan food!' — a phrase they often repeated.” She believes that her passion for cooking reflects her people's resilience: “All recipes reflect the strength of the Palestinian woman. The war has shown us that we can find alternatives and create something from nothing. Throughout the hardship and starvation, it became clear that Palestinians possess an incredible ability to adapt and innovate in dire circumstances.”

Amid the struggles of displacement in Nuseirat camp, Zahed recounts the daily challenges her family faced while living in temporary shelter. “Living in a sixth-floor apartment, my son Mohammed would carry 20-liter gallons of water up the stairs as we needed about 4-5 gallons daily. We cooked over an open fire, relying on basic staples like rice, spaghetti and soup, often only having bread once a day due to the high cost of vegetables.” During these hardships, her passion for cooking brought her joy: “Whenever I cook, I feel a sense of happiness. Even during the war, people would reach out for my recipes, and it fills me with pride to help others in this way. I love crafting delicious meals, often picturing the ingredients before I start cooking.”

The cookbook wasn't just about recipes — it's about preserving culture in the face of devastation.

Tabkha was inspired by a Japanese friend, who encouraged her to compile a diary of recipes for sale. In the book, she included 15 traditional Palestinian recipes, covering both desserts and savory dishes. In the midst of war, she took the initiative to document her culinary legacy, creating videos that showcased her improvisation with the ingredients around her. Her cookbook features a variety of dishes, including both desserts and savory meals, along with what she refers to as the “war alternatives” — all based on innovative recipes inspired by traditions passed down from her ancestors. It also showcases the work of 21 artists who illustrated the recipes, each in their unique styles.

“I loved to put that in a book because we want to reach our voice to the world. Every culture has its guide, and when food recipes spread widely, people start getting attracted to it and start to ask who created it,” Zahed said. Everything about putting the book together — from the improvisation to the ancestral knowledge to the spread of Palestinian culinary tradition — serves as an act of resistance during genocide, as the Israeli state attempts to erase Palestinian existence.

The cookbook wasn't just about recipes — it's about preserving culture in the face of devastation. “Our recipes tell the world stories of our history, cause and that we exist. Maqlouba, Maftool, and Sumaqiyaa are all dishes that represent our people. Each time Palestinian food becomes a trend online and I see people from all over the world making it, I feel proud that the world knows Gaza and that we are not forgotten,” Zahed said.

Through creative improvisation, inherited knowledge, and the richness of Palestinian food, the book documents life, love and identity as Israel attempts to destroy and starve Gaza.

Zahed expressed a strong desire to restart her culinary explorations. “I want to work again on my cooking project, but gas is expensive, and other materials are hard to find.” Still, Zahed envisions a future where she has her own business — a shop to share her food, and a kitchen specifically for women.

“My message to the world is that Palestinians in Gaza are humans who feel and have dreams,” Zahed said. “We deserve to live peacefully. We will start again. We are strong people who don't lose faith. We have hope.”

At this moment, we are witnessing a terrifying array of anti-democratic tactics to silence political opposition, increase surveillance and expand authoritarian reach.

President Donald Trump fired Librarian of Congress Carla Hayden on Thursday, according to a spokesperson from the Library of Congress.

It is not clear why Hayden was being removed from the position.

Hayden served as the 14th Librarian of Congress after being appointed to a 10-year term by President Barack Obama in February 2016 and confirmed by the Senate in July 2016.

She was was the first woman and the first African American to hold the position.

With the support of a $15 million grant from the Mellon Foundation, she also launched the “Of the People” initiative in 2021 to help make the Library more accessible to communities of color who are “underrepresented in the Library's collections.”

The Epoch Times has asked the White House and the Library of Congress for comment.

Several Democratic lawmakers have criticized the move, accusing the president of trying to ban books.

“Enough is enough. Just as we've moved to bring accountability to the Architect of the Capitol, we must assert our congressional prerogative by making the position of Librarian of Congress appointed by a Congressional commission,” the lawmaker said.","{'href': 'https://www.theepochtimes.com', 'title': 'theepochtimes.com'}","world"

Pilot error was the root cause of a military helicopter crash near Pine Valley, California, last year that claimed the lives of five U.S. Marines, an investigation has found.

The CH-53E Super Stallion, callsign “TIGER 43,” was conducting a routine flight from Imperial County Airfield to Marine Corps Air Station Miramar when it crashed into a mountain ridge on Feb. 6, 2024.

The investigators confirmed there was no evidence of material or mechanical failure in the helicopter.

The five Marines lost in the crash were Lance Cpl. Donovan Davis, Sgt. Alec Langen, Capt. Benjamin Moulton, Capt. Jack Casey, and Capt. Miguel Nava, all members of Marine Heavy Helicopter Squadron 361, Marine Aircraft Group 16, 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing, based at Marine Corps Air Station Miramar.

The helicopter disappeared late on Feb. 6, 2024, during a storm, and its wreckage was found the next morning near Pine Valley. Recovery efforts were disturbed by rough terrain and severe weather, and Marines stayed with the fallen until their bodies could be recovered, in keeping with the Marine Corps' tradition of never leaving a Marine behind.

“We have been confronted with a tragedy that is every service family's worst fear,” Lt. Col. Nicholas J. Harvey, commanding officer of the squadron, said at the time of the accident. “The Flying Tigers family stands strong and includes the friends and community who have supported our squadron during this challenging time. We will get through this together.”

The May 7 statement said the investigation faced some limitations, including the inability to access certain onboard flight data and obtain exact real-time weather information. Investigators used available data and simulations to reconstruct the events leading to the crash.

Following a review of the investigation, the commanding general of the 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing relieved the HMH-361 commanding officer of command on Nov. 18, 2024, citing a loss of trust and confidence.

While the officer's actions were not found to be a direct cause of the crash, the commanding general determined that he had demonstrated poor judgment and should have exercised greater care in his duties, according to the investigation report.

In response to the findings, the Marine Corps has implemented multiple changes to policy and training across the 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing. The Corps also extended gratitude to the first responders and investigative teams involved in the aftermath and investigation of the crash.","{'href': 'https://www.theepochtimes.com', 'title': 'theepochtimes.com'}","world"

For years, Russian President Vladimir Putin has used the annual Victory Day celebration on May 9, commemorating the Soviet victory over Hitler in World War II, to mark his own greatness. The Soviet triumph in 1945, has always been and remains one of very few historical events that truly unites the Russian people, and of course Putin, as his regime matured, could not help but take advantage of that. More than that, he personalized the event, appropriating its national meaning and even its public rituals. For example, the Immortal Regiment, the civil society organization that draws hundreds of thousands of ordinary Russians to march with portraits of ancestors of theirs who fought in the war, has been put completely under Kremlin control. In 2015, on the 70th anniversary of Victory Day, Putin personally led one of its columns through the center of Moscow.

Since Russia began its “special operation” in Ukraine in 2022, however, the annual holiday has taken on more contemporary meaning. Over the past three years, the Kremlin has aggressively promoted the idea that the conflict next door is a continuation of the Great Patriotic War against the West—an enemy that in past centuries was embodied by Napoleon and Hitler and now is represented by Ukraine and Europe (the United States having been, since the return to office of President Donald Trump, excluded from the list). This has become a central part of Russian state propaganda, and the Victory Day parade and related rituals are now designed to cement this thesis in people's heads.

For all these reasons, Putin has been determined to celebrate the 80th anniversary of the Soviet victory with special fanfare. He also needs to show that he is not isolated from the world, that the best part of it—those countries and peoples who fought and are still fighting what the Kremlin calls “Western hegemony” and “colonialism”—support Russia, notwithstanding the pure imperial colonialism of the Ukrainian operation. For that reason, representatives of the “world majority”—the term the Kremlin uses to refer to countries from the so-called global South, of which Putin imagines himself to be the informal leader—were invited to march in this year's Victory Day. The parade's participants thus include soldiers from Myanmar, as well as various VIP guests from Equatorial Guinea, Burkina Faso, and other countries. Needless to say, these countries had nothing to do with the 1945 victory. Granted, one historic ally will be present: China, which will be represented by its formidable leader, Xi Jinping, who met with Putin at the Kremlin on Thursday. The show of unity and alliance between Moscow and Beijing carries important symbolic value, although Xi needs Putin much less than Putin needs him. It is hard not to notice, however, that the Soviet Union's principal World War II allies—the co-authors of that historic victory—have been left out of Putin's celebration. What is this, if not isolation from the world?

Still, lurking behind this year's special anniversary is a more momentous change: the shifting relationship between Russia and the United States since Trump's return to office. By now, the Russian euphoria that greeted improved relations with Washington this spring has diminished, but many Russian elites and ordinary citizens continue to pin their hopes on the Trump administration for successful mediation to end the war—and in getting U.S. support for Russia's conditions and demands. For Putin, the new U.S. administration offers an opportunity not only for a favorable economic deal, at a moment of growing peril for Russia, but also to get out of the mess in Ukraine without losing face. Although neither Trump nor anyone else from his administration is attending the Victory Day celebrations, in official Kremlin rhetoric and propaganda the United States has been elevated to a partner, and a historic one at that, in direct contrast to Europe, which is now the main enemy. Not so long ago, it was the other way around.

At least since the beginning of the Cold War, the United States has played a central role in the Russian collective consciousness. For decades, Russians have regarded their superpower rival with a mixture of admiration and hatred, condescension and envy. Often, they have seen themselves as spiritually superior but materially inferior to their Yankee counterparts. Of course, the conspiracy-minded have long asserted that the United States is behind every significant event in the world, including Russia's own problems, which are, according to this type of thinking, the result of covert U.S. policies. In Russian propaganda in recent years, it has been standard to hear references to “Anglo-American imperialism” or “Anglo-Saxons”—a derogatory Russian expression for the threatening dominance of the United States and the United Kingdom. Europe, in this design of hatred, was simply included under the general “West.” As a result, even in Putin's time, Europe was treated in much the same way as the United States: if attitudes toward the United States worsened, Russians became more suspicious of the European Union.

Yet Trump's victory and peacemaking efforts have upended the conventional thinking: now, Europe, including the United Kingdom, has become the principal source of evil, while the United States is good. Already in late February, during a visit to the Federal Security Service—the successor to his own alma mater, the KGB—Putin noted that contacts with the new administration in Washington “inspire certain hopes,” adding that “not everyone is happy to see Russian-U.S. contacts resume” and that the security services would need to be vigilant not to have the new “dialogue” be derailed. Continuing this line a few days later, Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov commented that, contrary to long-standing Soviet and Russian doctrines, the United States has never been a warmonger toward Russia; Europe has always been the primary threat. “Over the past 500 years, all tragedies in the world originated in Europe or occurred owing to European policies,” he said.

Stirred up by such statements, many ordinary citizens and even elites have begun to entertain visions of peace. It had already become evident by the second half of 2024 that a majority of Russians desired peace talks, but this trend has notably intensified with the arrival of Trump. Many Russians now view the United States as a pragmatic partner and expect that the war will be settled through direct negotiations between Moscow and Washington. In a January survey by the independent Levada Center, respondents agreed that, in principle peace is only possible with a mediator, and of course, among others, that could be the United States. By February, however, the belief in U.S.-led mediation had notably taken root. In another Levada survey that month, a large majority of respondents—70 percent —said that the United States should be at the table with Russia, and an even greater majority—85 percent—approved of the bilateral meetings between Russia and the United States in Saudi Arabia that began that month. As the Russian public sees it, although there will have to be agreements with Ukraine, the most important goal is to find common ground with Trump. By getting the president to back Putin's key demands, Russia will be guaranteed a sustainable peace agreement now and beneficial economic ties in the future. Fueled by these expectations, Russians have notably softened their anti-American sentiment: whereas in September 2024 just 16 percent of respondents had a positive attitude toward the United States, by February 2025 the proportion had nearly doubled, to 30 percent.



The Kremlin's rhetorical pivot toward the United States has also bolstered its own popularity. Perhaps on the expectation of peace, the approval rating of Lavrov, the foreign minister, which had previously been stagnating, has risen in Levada's surveys, briefly making him the second most trustworthy politician after Putin. (Although in April, as negotiations began to stall, Lavrov slipped back to third place again, behind Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin, the usual second-place holder.) The Russian business community has also been encouraged by the apparent willingness of Washington to make deals with Moscow, with some even claiming that the United States could be a source of revenue for the national budget. This could be important, given that oil revenues, which have for much of the war helped replenish Russian coffers, are significantly down in 2025 thanks to falling global prices. Russian political and business elites understand that Trump's economic policies could further erode oil prices and complicate Russian energy exports.

As many Russians see it, Putin, with his psychological complexes (his sense of personal greatness) and geopolitical designs (his dream of Greater Russia), finally has a counterpart with whom he could agree on the redivision of the world. With Trump, the thinking goes, Putin can turn a hot war into a cold one and be satisfied with that—after all, Russian military and financial resources are not unlimited. These assumptions are fueled by the Russian understanding of Trump himself. A substantial portion of the population see Trump as a true peacemaker, a “sober and intelligent” politician, as some survey respondents put it. To many ordinary Russians, he is a businessman who understands the language of pragmatic deals—including the peace that Russians hope is coming their way. Moreover, in contrast with former U.S. President Joe Biden, most do not consider Trump to be anti-Russian. Despite the lack of progress, hopes for a U.S.-led mediation remain, and disappointment in Trump has not set in—at least not yet.

It is important to note that Russians' newly positive attitudes toward the United States are only partly a consequence of high expectations that peace negotiations will succeed. Among Russia's small liberal stratum, people separate Trump from the United States: they generally regard the MAGA president negatively, if not with horror, but tend to view the United States as a bastion of the Western world and democracy. This liberal segment hopes that the country's democratic institutions will keep it from sinking into autocracy. Sociologically, these people include the more educated youth; people who disapprove of Putin's policies, including his war; and those who are specifically liberal in orientation. These also tend to be consumers of independent news, often via YouTube (watched via VPN), which for many Russians is now a main platform for getting information and opinions outside official channels. One way or another, how Russians view the United States remains a primary factor in how they see Russia's own position in the world.

In the immediate background to Russians' new hopes for peace are the mounting psychological effects of the war. The extraordinary human cost, the overall ferocity, and the seemingly endless fighting have exacted a quiet toll on the population. The continued hostilities have disturbed the comfort of those who are not in the trenches. Even so, a majority of Russians have maintained what might be called a consensus of silence about the traumas of the war. In its April survey, Levada found that 40 percent of Russians now think that Putin's expansionism has brought harm to the country, against 33 percent who believe it has benefited Russia. (Another 28 percent were unsure.) According to the survey, those who believe that the “special operation” has brought more harm than benefit talk about the great loss of life, whereas those who see more benefit than harm tend to mention, above all, the “return of historic Russian lands.”

For many Russians, it appears to be much easier to maintain a normal life by avoiding the true reality of the war or having to think about it. Apart from the regions of the country bordering the war, the “special operation” itself continues to remain elsewhere for most Russians: Ukraine's invasion of the Kursk region and its drone strikes inside Russia, which tend to be mostly repelled, have not shaken this habit of psychological distancing. Nevertheless, a clear majority of the public wish the war would go away.

Of course, there are those who have always been against the war, but they constitute no more than 20 percent of the population—about the same size as the group of fervent Putin supporters known as “turbopatriots,” who want the war to continue, arguing that it is necessary for Russia to finish the job. Most ordinary people who are in favor of peace talks still set two fundamental conditions: Ukraine cannot join NATO and the conquered territories must remain part of Russia. But there is also another problem: many people have financially benefited from the military economy and the various bonuses and salary increases that have come with it. Some thus view the prospect of impending peace as a threat to their possible earnings, something that the state, always strapped for manpower, has been quick to take advantage of: in recent months, posters have begun appearing calling on Russians to hurry to sign a lucrative military contract before the war ends.

Yet for anyone paying attention, peace remains elusive. And since Trump and Putin have talked up the idea, the Russian leader will have to begin portraying what has been accomplished so far as a victory. Because the Kremlin has avoided defining what “victory” means, the majority of the population will likely perceive a peace deal as meeting Putin's minimal demands and therefore fit the bill. In other words, Russian troops do not necessarily have to move much farther West for Moscow to claim a win. Moreover, by continuing the war and incurring further Russian costs, Putin could make it harder to achieve an end that the public can call victory: there has been no economic catastrophe in Russia yet, but stagflation—the combination of slow economic growth with high inflation—has clearly taken root.



A larger challenge for Putin is how to maintain stability when the fighting stops. Hundreds of thousands of veterans will return from the front. They are all war heroes and will demand to be treated as such. But not enough coveted job placements and other rewards will available. This is where the problems may start: the same mainstream society, conditioned for so long to be indifferent to the war, may start to perceive veterans as unwelcome competitors for jobs. Moreover, the structural changes to the economy the Kremlin has made since 2022—including higher wages and preferential treatment for businesses and workers in the military-industrial complex—will have to be reversed. This, too, could have destabilizing effects. Yet if the war continues and the government fails to address the needs of veterans, or to deal with the growing distortions in the domestic economy, it will face even greater trouble.

So Putin faces a crisis of inflated expectations. By dragging out negotiations with Trump, he is hedging: on the one hand, ending the hot phase of the conflict will create destabilizing shifts in the economy and society; on the other hand, the growing public assumption that peace is coming must be satisfied sooner or later. For now, he has no solution and is stalling. He may recognize that most Russians are willing to tolerate, at least for a little longer, his procrastination about ending the war.

But there is another factor at play: Trump's limited patience. The Russian autocrat would not want to miss an unparalleled chance to turn a U.S. president into an ally, for both political and economic reasons: a peace treaty could turn out to be an economically favorable deal, the proceeds of which would prolong the life of Putin's regime. No one can predict when Trump might in fact “walk away” from his peace efforts, as his administration has threatened, or how Putin might react to the disappearance of a potential deal. But refusing to negotiate would make the overall situation even more complex and dangerous. Such is Putin's dilemma.

Amid this uncertainty, Russia's elites remain a black box. It is difficult to measure their desire for peace or their attitudes toward the regime they serve: the dissatisfied are silent, while the more adaptive rush to make careers in which they can combine political hyperloyalty with technocratic efficiency. But even many of the elites expect the war will end, albeit not soon. In one of his recent interviews, for example, Lavrov seemed to be taking aim at Russian liberal officials who were gaming out a different postwar future. If sanctions are lifted, he warned, some “liberals” will try to “roll back the achievements of import substitution, of the sovereignization of our economy.” It is unclear whom he had in mind, not to mention the fact that these wartime policies have little to show for them: “sovereignization” and uncontrolled levels of military spending have already created colossal long-term problems in the economy.

In any case, the mounting expectations of peace and victory should not be confused with hopes that the Kremlin is going to reliberalize: the Putin regime is rigid, highly repressive, and designed for repression. According to the OVD-info portal, an independent monitor of human rights in Russia, as of early May, the state has pending charges against 3,284 people for political offenses, of whom 1,590 are now in jail. The Ministry of Justice has now designated more than 900 Russian entities as “foreign agents,” with more added almost weekly, and more than 500 of these are individual citizens, who face a colossal restriction of their rights. The state also maintains a separate list of undesirable organizations, whether Russian or foreign, for which anyone who cooperates with them could face criminal prosecution. All independent online media are blocked and can only operate illegally and can only be read and watched using VPN.

The garrison state will not simply disappear when the guns go silent. The ever-growing demands to show patriotic behavior—from the introduction of loyalty rituals in schools to verbal displays of loyalty to Putinism by the heads of businesses, universities, libraries, and other institutions—will not go away. Nor will the regime stop its war against civil society. Indeed, it is possible that the Kremlin, without the distraction of war, will double down on repression and the indoctrination of Russia's youth.



If the West were reopened to Russians and consumerism were able to flourish again, it might be enough to keep the depoliticized center compliant, even under a still harsher regime. There is already a good deal of speculation about the imminent return of Western brands to Russia. In March, about half of those polled by the Levada Center said that every Western company should be scrutinized and only those that are deemed loyal to Russia should be allowed back into the Russian market. Almost 20 percent said that all companies that have left should be allowed back in, without restrictions, whereas a quarter of respondents said that such companies should not be allowed in at all. In other words, many Russians seem to assume that Western companies will flood into Russia the moment the war is over. Here, too, they are prone to inflated expectations.

To satisfy any of these cravings, Putin will have to reach a peace agreement, preferably supplemented by an economic deal, or series of deals, with Trump. Only then will it be possible to prolong the Kremlin's implied social contract with Russian society: in exchange for the state delivering peace and victory, citizens will be expected to show total loyalty to the regime (and those who do not will face reprisals). As a bonus, the market economy and normal levels of consumption will be preserved.

Of course, Putin has already made huge numbers of Russians into his accomplices, and to a certain extent, that guarantees their loyalty. But there is a downside to keeping an entire population as political hostages. If you remove this system's main element—Putin—it will start to collapse. In such a scenario, as Russians adjust to new external circumstances, new inflated expectations may arise. But by that point, they will be directed at a new leader.

 April Longley Alley

After seven and a half weeks of heavy airstrikes on more than 1,000 separate targets, the Trump administration's bombing campaign against the Houthis in Yemen ended as abruptly as it began. On May 6, in an Oval Office meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, President Donald Trump simply announced that the Iranian-backed Houthis “don't want to fight any more” and that the United States would “accept their word” and “stop the bombings.” Omani Foreign Minister Badr bin Hamad al Busaidi confirmed on X that his country had brokered a cease-fire agreement between Washington and the Houthis, in which the two sides agreed not to target each other. Despite the Houthis' highly effective attacks on international shipping in the Red Sea and continuing attacks against Israel, the agreement does not explicitly restrict Houthi actions against any country other than the United States; the absence from the agreement of Israel and of “Israeli-linked” ships—a term the Houthis have interpreted broadly in the past—is notable.

What is puzzling about the White House announcement is that the Houthis' position remains essentially unchanged from when the Trump administration began its escalated air campaign on March 15. Ostensibly, Operation Rough Rider—as the U.S. campaign was called—was launched to restore freedom of navigation in the Red Sea and to reestablish deterrence against Iran and its proxies. When the operation began, the Houthis were explicitly targeting Israel as well as Israeli-linked ships—though not U.S. ships—and saying they would continue to do so until Israel ends its war in Gaza. Since the outset of the U.S. campaign, Houthi leaders have made clear that if Washington stopped the bombing, they would stop attacking U.S. ships, but their attacks on Israel would continue. After Trump announced the May 6 agreement, the Houthi spokesperson Mohammed Abdulsalam reiterated this position. In other words, after a U.S. military operation that cost more than $2 billion and supposedly had a far-reaching impact on Houthi military capabilities, the U.S.-Houthi cease-fire does little but codify the Houthis' original stance. Although Trump claimed that the Houthis “capitulated,” the group retains its hold on power and has called the deal a “victory for Yemen.”

For the Trump administration, the cease-fire offered a quick end to what was an increasingly untenable campaign. Not only was the bombing enormously expensive; it was also raising concerns among policymakers in Washington that the United States could slide into another forever war in the Middle East. This scenario was no doubt pushed by Vice President JD Vance and the more neo-isolationist members of the administration, who have been skeptical of U.S. military adventurism from the start.

It remains unclear if this denouement will create a meaningful enough pause for the Trump administration to wash its hands of the Houthi problem. But if Trump ignores continued Houthi attacks on Israel, there is reason to believe that the Houthis will, for now, avoid attacking U.S. assets. The Houthis would almost certainly have survived, even if the U.S. bombing campaign had continued, but its termination nevertheless has many upsides for them. The group's leaders can now claim to have gone head-to-head with a superpower and won and be relieved of the pressure the U.S. bombing was putting on them. They can also focus on Israel, which is engaged in its own punishing air campaign in retaliation for Houthi strikes, including a ballistic missile strike near Tel Aviv's Ben Gurion airport in early May. Importantly, the deal with the United States makes it very unlikely that Washington will support a ground offensive against the Houthis by the internationally recognized government of Yemen, an internally divided coalition of anti-Houthi factions which controls the southern and eastern parts of the country. Combined with airpower, such an offensive would arguably be the most effective way to truly pressure the group and loosen its hold on power—although it would carry significant risks.

The Trump administration was right to try to find an off-ramp to an increasingly costly and open-ended air campaign, but the one it chose may cause more harm than good. Unless Washington quickly coordinates with allies in the region, particularly Saudi Arabia, in a broader effort to maintain military, economic, and political pressure on the Houthis, the group will continue to wreak havoc both in Yemen and across the region. There is a better alternative: by supporting the UN and other mediators such as Oman, the United States and its allies in the region and beyond can push for a larger political settlement in Yemen, one that can constrain the Houthis' military capabilities and ambitions. This may seem like a heavy lift, but it would be far more cost-effective than the alternative. In the absence of such efforts, the Houthis will recover and regroup, and may soon present much the same security threat that provoked the Trump administration's campaign in the first place.

The United States first began striking the Houthis under President Joe Biden, who launched a limited campaign of airstrikes in January 2024 to respond to the group's attacks on shipping in the Red Sea and specifically to its attack on a U.S. warship. The Biden administration sought a calibrated strategy: the aim was to retaliate for the Houthi attacks without intensifying the conflict, causing civilian casualties, or triggering greater regional escalation with Iran. By contrast, Trump was far more aggressive, lambasting Biden for a “pathetically weak” response to the Houthi threat. His administration was also likely emboldened by a much-weakened Iran, whose aligned forces in Gaza, Lebanon, and Syria have been dramatically degraded over the past year by Israel's war with Hamas and Hezbollah and by the fall of the Assad regime.

Even so, the scale of the campaign was unexpected. Operation Rough Rider has been the Trump administration's biggest and most costly military intervention to date. It involved more than 1,000 strikes against a broad array of Houthi targets, including weapons depots, command-and-control facilities, air defense systems, critical infrastructure, and Houthi leaders. To carry out this ambitious operation, the administration deployed two aircraft carrier strike groups, MQ-9 Reaper drones, and B-2 Stealth bombers, as well as Patriot and THAAD air defenses.



Beyond dramatically stepped-up airstrikes, the administration also ramped up economic and political pressure. In March, it redesignated the Houthis as a foreign terrorist organization, which carries heavy economic and diplomatic penalties. The FTO designation has choked the banking system in Houthi-controlled areas, restricted its ability to import fuel, and also rendered elements of a proposed UN-backed agreement to end the war, which was being negotiated before the Houthi's Red Sea attacks began, impossible to implement. The implementation of this deal, which is supported by U.S. allies in the Gulf, would have resulted in a cease-fire and the beginning of a political process to determine power-sharing arrangements in Yemen. It also promised significant economic benefits, including a formula to pay all public salaries in Houthi-controlled areas. Given Yemen's limited resources, this would have required significant external financial support, but an FTO designation by Washington criminalized financial transfers to the Houthis, making this element unworkable.

Washington's actions put real pressure on the Houthis. Over the course of the campaign, Houthi ballistic missile launches against Israeli and U.S. targets declined by 87 percent, and drone attacks declined by 65 percent, according to the Pentagon. In addition, U.S. strikes forced most of the group's leadership into hiding and slowed internal communications. The Houthis' internal security services also stepped up arrests of Yemenis believed to be revealing targeting information to those who may share it with the U.S. or its allies.

The U.S. strikes also temporarily shifted the group's military calculus. After the FTO designation, for example, the Houthis initially sought to take over oil and gas fields in the Marib governorate, east of the capital, Sanaa—a strategic resource that would have blunted some of the impact of the terrorist designation. But the U.S. air campaign temporarily delayed that ambition, which, if realized, would have bolstered the Houthis' resources and paved the way for further offensives on other oil-producing governorates in the south and east now under Yemeni government control.

Before the May 6 cease-fire, the strikes also raised expectations among Yemen's internationally recognized government that it could secure U.S. and regional backing for a new ground offensive to recapture Houthi-controlled territories. Yemeni government officials lobbied Washington hard for support, understanding the fleeting nature of the opportunity and knowing that if they did not take advantage, the Houthis would be able to use the “victory” of having withstood an American military campaign to strengthen their position further. The threat of a ground operation was deeply concerning to Houthi leaders who label any domestic opponents as agents of Israeli-American aggression.

But Trump's pressure campaign had limits and within a few weeks they began to show. U.S. forces hit Houthi targets almost daily, with enormous quantities of munitions, and the Pentagon claimed to have killed top Houthi leaders. There is little evidence, however, that members of the group's top command structure have been eliminated; its inner circle is very much intact. Also important, the group's ability to strike U.S. and Israeli targets does not appear to have been significantly diminished. The Houthis, for their part, claim to have shot down at least seven U.S. Reaper drones, each of which costs about $30 million, since March. On April 28, a $60 million U.S. fighter jet was lost at sea when its carrier made a hard turn to avoid Houthi fire. In early May, the Houthis also managed to get a missile through Israeli air defenses, with its strike near Tel Aviv airport, prompting a blistering response from Israel.

In short, U.S. tactical gains were coming at an increasingly high cost and with grave risks. Continued operations raised the chances that U.S. service members might be killed—a scenario that would almost certainly draw Washington further into the conflict. The United States was also burning through munitions at an alarming rate. The Defense Department was already struggling to keep up with weapons demand, having been stretched by earlier U.S. commitments to Israel and Ukraine, as well as by the Biden administration's strikes against the Houthis and by the U.S. effort to defend Israel against direct Iranian attacks. Some U.S. officials were concerned that the sheer number of long-range weapons being used against the Houthis, as well as the movement of a Patriot air defense battalion from U.S. Indo-Pacific Command to the Middle East, could weaken the United States' readiness to address threats from China.



What's more, U.S. airstrikes were increasingly harming civilians and civilian infrastructure in Yemen, a fact the Houthi media was quick to turn to the group's advantage. A U.S. attack in mid-April on the fuel port and export terminal of Ras Issa in Hodeida, for example, killed more than 70 Yemenis, and a strike in early May on a Houthi-run detention center holding African migrants killed dozens, including civilians. The course of the earlier civil war demonstrates that such incidents do little to weaken domestic support for the Houthis: during a Saudi-led air campaign in Yemen in 2015, punishing strikes that resulted in high civilian casualties worked to the Houthis' advantage, allowing them to deflect criticism and rally support against an external enemy.

From the beginning of the Trump campaign, the Houthis said that they could outlast the pressure and even emerge stronger from it, as they did after the Saudi-led intervention in 2015. After all, the Houthi movement's greatest strength has always been armed struggle. As a radical offshoot of the Zaydi branch of Islam that is deeply anti-Israeli and anti-Western, the group was forged in war against the Yemeni government beginning in the first decade of this century. Ensconced in the country's rugged mountainous highlands, the Houthis have years of practice hiding their leadership and weapons. They also have a tremendous tolerance for being under attack and losing fighters and weapons. Moreover, although their principal backer, Iran, has been greatly weakened, the Houthis have been able to diversify their supply lines. By developing new weapons smuggling networks, which now extend beyond Iran and into the Horn of Africa, and by building opportunistic ties with China and Russia, the group has become even more resilient.

In short, although the U.S. campaign put the Houthis under tremendous pressure, they were far from deterred, much less defeated, at the time of the cease-fire. By early May, the United States was making tactical gains in destroying weapons and capabilities, pushing the leadership underground, and stirring up Houthi fears that a new ground campaign against them might soon be launched. But the United States was unable to turn these pressure points into strategic advantage.

It is possible for the United States to both limit its military engagement and support a path to settlement—or at least to containing the Houthi threat—by working with its allies to put military, economic, and political pressure on the group. To do this, the U.S. policymakers must first disabuse themselves of the notion that there can be a neat line drawn between what happens within Yemen and what happens in the Red Sea or the broader region, particularly in the Gulf. Both Vance and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth have conveyed disinterest in what happens in Yemen. In Vance's words, if the Houthis stop shooting in the Red Sea, they can “go back to doing whatever it was they were doing before attacking civilian vessels.” The problems Washington and its allies face in the Red Sea, however, are precisely a product of Yemen's internal power dynamic. As an increasingly well-armed and unchecked power, the Houthis have the ability to project power and threats beyond Yemen's borders, and they will continue to do so until they face real domestic constraints. The United States cannot micromanage Yemen's complex politics, and it does not need to lead on Yemen policy—but at a minimum, it must have one.

To ensure that Yemen maintains some balance on the ground, the United States should give the Yemeni government's Gulf backers, including Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, the security guarantees they need to continue to support the government politically and militarily. The two countries are the key suppliers of arms and money to Yemeni government forces, but they have both said publicly that they are not interested in reigniting the war. They also know that if Yemeni forces were to advance against the Houthis on the ground, the group would likely target them, too—possibly even if they had only assisted their Yemeni allies in defending current frontlines. Although Riyadh and Abu Dhabi are concerned about the long-term security threats posed by the Houthis, they are eager to shift their focuses to domestic economic priorities.



By offering Riyadh and Abu Dhabi security guarantees, Washington would in effect be pledging to protect its allies, allowing them to reinforce the forces that are opposing the Houthis domestically, and thus increasing the chances that a balanced power-sharing deal be reached. In addition, the United States could encourage Saudi Arabia and the UAE to better coordinate their military and political support for Yemeni government forces, divisions within which are often amplified by the two backers—for example, by Abu Dhabi's long-standing aversion to working with fighters connected to the Muslim Brotherhood. This coordination is more important than ever, as disappointment among Yemeni government forces by the U.S. withdrawal, coupled with mounting economic distress and internal political infighting, threatens the government's collapse—and with it, the very real possibility of Houthi expansion or an al-Qaeda resurgence in government areas.

Pressure on the Houthis must have a realistic goal. A military air campaign alone was never a practical option. With the U.S.-Houthi cease-fire, ground-level military pushback also looks increasingly unlikely. Reaching a deal with Iran that includes Tehran's commitment to stop supplying the Houthis with high-tech weapons would be helpful, but it would not be a silver bullet to contain Houthi ambitions. A cease-fire in Gaza would also provide an opportunity to test the Houthi commitment to stop its attacks in the Red Sea and to pressure the group through coordinated multilateral diplomacy. But there is no easy solution to Yemen and no substitute for a more comprehensive, coordinated regional approach.

The United States and its partners should thus focus on an achievable, if difficult, goal: advancing a UN-backed agreement that provides stronger guarantees for Red Sea security, limits on Houthi weapons, and assurances of domestic power sharing. This could start with the parties' reevaluation of the proposed UN agreement previously under negotiation—strengthening its cease-fire provisions, amending its financial distribution scheme to accommodate the FTO designation, and instituting stronger guarantees to back a power-sharing agreement between the Houthis and government forces. Achieving any of this, however, would be completely contingent on the Trump administration working with Gulf allies and Yemenis to hold the frontlines in Yemen and to continue exerting economic, political, and military pressure on the Houthis. If it fails to support the development of a balanced domestic power-sharing formula, Yemen's problems will not stay within Yemen.

In pulling the plug on its Yemen campaign, the Trump administration faced a hard reality: continuing to strike the Houthis at this rate could soon become both unsustainable and aimless, even as it was harming U.S. military needs elsewhere. Moreover, an air campaign and a terrorist designation, in themselves, were highly unlikely to resolve the Houthi threats to Red Sea security and to Israel. At the same time, U.S. support for Yemeni government forces would be risky, given the forces' deep internal divisions, and it would be antithetical to Trump's stated aversion to forever wars in the Middle East. Perhaps recognizing the need for a quick exit, Trump made the surprise announcement on May 6 to stop operations.

The abrupt halt, however, only emboldens the Houthis, likely aggravating the very security threats the United States had set out to address in the first place. The Houthis are now turning their attention to Israel and have reserved the right to hit “Israeli-linked” ships—the scope of which is completely unclear. More important, even if there is a cease-fire in Gaza, the Houthis, having experienced the leverage of holding Red Sea shipping hostage, might be tempted in the future to again use this tool for political gain. They may also try to continue to charge ships for safe passage through the Bab al Mandeb Strait, as they have done with commercial shippers in their Red Sea operations.

The Houthis bet from the beginning of the strikes that they could outlast the United States—and they did. Equally important, the cease-fire has dashed Yemeni hopes of U.S. support for a ground campaign, and there is a real chance that the already divided Yemeni government could buckle under the weight of financial pressure, which has been building since the Houthis blocked its oil exports in late 2022, as well as from the Houthis' perceived victory. A potential collapse of the government would almost certainly lead to Houthi territorial expansion and/or allow al-Qaeda to make gains in the country's south. Saudi Arabia, already wary of Washington's reliability as a security partner, will now need to deal with a battered but emboldened Houthi movement on its southern border.

            Getting the shingles vaccine could do more than just prevent a painful red rash — it may also lower the risk of heart disease and stroke, according to a new South Korean study of more than one million people published in the European Heart Journal.



            The highly common herpes strain, also called varicella-zoster virus (VZV), can cause chickenpox in childhood and later develop into shingles in older or immuno-compromised adults. The shingles vaccine is already considered a top-line defense against the virus, but recent studies have pointed to other unexpected health benefits.
    


            An analysis of health outcomes for 1,271,922 people age 50 and older found a 23% lower risk of cardiovascular disease among those who were vaccinated for shingles. The reduced risk was most noticeable up to eight years after vaccination among males, people under 60, and even those with “unhealthy lifestyles,” such as chronic smoking or drinking, according to the May 6 study.

            “Since shingles can cause inflammation in blood vessels and lead to blood clots, which in turn raise the risk of heart disease, preventing shingles through vaccination might also help reduce these cardiovascular risks,” explained Hayeon Lee, a coauthor and researcher from the Lee Kyung Hee University College of Medicine in an email. It's also possible that the nerve damage caused by shingles could disturb the heart's rhythm, leading to irregular palpitations and even cardiac arrest, per the study.
    


            The vaccine may be better at preventing shingles in younger patients and males because of their more robust immune systems, Lee said.
    


            “If a vaccine helps lower the risk of both infection and serious chronic conditions, it becomes an even more valuable public health tool,” Lee said. “This study supports a broader understanding of vaccination — not just as a shield against infectious diseases, but as part of a more comprehensive approach to maintaining long-term health.”
    


            More research is needed to determine a direct causal link between vaccination and reduced cardiovascular event risk, but this analysis is the largest and most comprehensive so far, presenting a compelling case for those on the fence about vaccination, said Dr. Sharon Curhan, a physician and epidemiologist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, who was not involved in the study.
    


            Since this herpes strain can lie dormant in the body for years after exposure before it reactivates into shingles, you don't need a history of chickenpox to get the vaccine, Curhan said.
    


            In fact, more than 99% of adults age 50 years and older worldwide have been exposed to VZV, and many may not have had, or known they had chickenpox at all, according to estimates from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
    


            Patients from the study used an older variation of the shingles vaccine that is being phased out of most countries.
    


            The live zoster vaccine, no longer available in the US as of 2020, contains a living but weakened form of the virus used to generate an immune response. It's since been swapped for Shingrix, a two-shot recombinant zoster vaccine containing only part of the virus — which has shown to be more effective.
    


            More research is needed to compare the various health benefits of these different vaccine variations, said Dr. Pascal Geldsetzer, an assistant professor of medicine at Stanford University who was not involved in the study.

            “The biggest limitation of this type of research is that you're essentially comparing people who get vaccinated to those who don't get vaccinated,” Geldsetzer said. “We know that those people who decide to get vaccinated are often very different from those who don't in their health motivations and behaviors.”
    


            Researchers were able to sort for several demographic variables such as age, sex, income level and pre-existing conditions like high blood pressure, diabetes and high cholesterol. They also considered the frequency of medical visits and use of specific medications based on national insurance records, Lee said.
    


            Still, some variables, like diet, other vaccinations, and proper adherence to treatments, can always slip through the cracks in non-clinical trials which use large data sets like the one used in this study, Geldsetzer said. For this reason, he hopes future studies can be randomized and use data from a clinical setting.
    


            Additionally, Lee said future research should observe more racially and ethnically diverse populations, as immune responses can vary across different populations.
    


            These findings follow several other studies identifying the possible health benefits of shingles vaccination.
    


            In April, Geldsetzer and a team of researchers from Stanford published a study that found people who received the vaccine had a 20% reduced risk of dementia compared with those who didn't get it.

            This study took advantage of a “natural experiment” after Wales rolled out its shingles vaccination program in 2013. Due to limited vaccine supply, government officials decided that only Welsh adults born on or after a very specific date would be eligible, so researchers could directly compare the health outcomes of two groups of individuals over time while limiting covariables.
    


            This is likely because shingles doesn't just cause inflammation in the blood vessels, said Geldsetzer. It also inflames nerves throughout the body, which can lead to long-lasting pain disorders and, in the case of dementia, brain tissue damage.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+national+news+site:cnn.com","In a city burdened by health hazards of lead, they're trying to repair school buildings and public trust","https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/09/health/milwaukee-lead-crisis-schools","Fri, 09 May 2025 10:00:00 GMT","


            As workers set up stations at North Division High School's cafeteria to test children's blood for lead, a group of frustrated parents and community activists gathered just outside the main entrance. They carried handmade signs: “Milwaukee–Beer, Cheese, and Lead Poisoning” and “Test All Schools for Lead Now.”
    


            After a child was found to have lead poisoning from peeling lead paint in a local elementary school early this year, the district began closing buildings and temporarily relocating students. It launched a plan to inspect, clean and repaint more than 100 schools by the end of the year, much of it during the summer.
    


            For the crowd gathered outside, it's not enough.
    


            “This lead crisis is not a new crisis,” said Melody McCurtis, deputy director of a local organization called Metcalfe Park Community Bridges, a grassroots effort to revitalize one of the city's Northside neighborhoods.
    


            “Milwaukee is full of lead, whether it's in your homes, whether it's in your schools, whether it's in your drinking water,” she said at the news conference.
    


            This year was the first time the city has confirmed that a child was poisoned by lead from a school, but the people of Milwaukee know it's not the city's first problem with the potent neurotoxin. The city has fumbled its response before, leaving residents wary of new promises.
    


            Even as the city's health department and school district work to clean and repaint aging schools, they're having to rebuild public trust.
    


            And as of last month, they're doing it without federal help: Lead experts from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention who had been working with the city were cut during a massive wave of layoffs by the Trump administration. US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy suggested that they would be reinstated, but so far, they have not been.
    


            The unprecedented loss of federal support brought a national spotlight to the crisis in schools. But many families say the latest efforts to clean and repaint old buildings, though well-intentioned, are only a Band-aid. They're covering up the lead, not getting it out of schools completely.
    


            “We have had crisis after crisis every few years, and we have heard similar kind of things from city leadership throughout that time,” said Derek Beyer, a former teacher with Milwaukee Public Schools, who spoke for the Get the Lead Out Coalition. “It's been kind of, in my opinion, a game of pass the buck rather than just remove the lead.”
    


            People like him believe that the city's old infrastructure will continue to cause harm for generations to come.
    


            Like other major cities in America's Rust Belt, Milwaukee has long been burdened by lead. Because it's cheap and easy to bend, it was used to make pipes that carried municipal drinking water. It was added to paint to make it dry faster and last longer and mixed into gasoline to reduce engine knock in cars.
    


            These uses for lead have long been banned, but the threat of its toxicity remains. It can still leach out of pipes, flake off walls and surface in soil. Even small amounts can damage a child's brain function, affecting their behavior, IQ and self-control.
    


            Each year, about 1,000 children in Milwaukee test positive for lead poisoning, which the CDC defines as at or above 3.5 micrograms per deciliter of lead in the blood. Roughly 15 have to be hospitalized for acute symptoms such as abdominal pain, vomiting, constipation and seizures. About 200 have blood lead levels over 15, which triggers a health department investigation to determine the source.
    


            Most often, they're poisoned by lead paint in deteriorating homes. In January, for the first time, the health department determined that a child had been poisoned not at home but by peeling paint in the basement of one of the city's elementary schools.
    


            Many of Milwaukee's schools had gone without regular painting and maintenance for years: A report submitted to the Wisconsin legislature last year showed that the schools needed more than $250 million in deferred maintenance. Meanwhile, the old lead paint created a fresh hazard as it chalked and flaked off the walls.
    


            Kat Cisar, who has twins in the first grade at the Trowbridge Street School of Great Lakes Studies, found out that the school was abruptly closing and that students would be relocated in an email that came at 7:36 p.m. on a Thursday in March, giving parents and school officials only days to adjust.
    


            As parents dropped off their students at a building 5 miles away from their old school on the next Monday,  they had no idea how long they would be displaced or whether a student at their school had been poisoned.
    


            “What happened behind the scenes was a lot of confusion and a lot of uncertainty,” Cisar said the community event on Wednesday. Principals and teachers didn't have any more information than parents did, she said.
    


            Cisar said parents would like to see better communication from the district, including text alerts if a child at a certain school tests positive for an elevated lead level. They also want school principals to be kept in the loop so they can share timely updates with parents.
    


            Trowbridge was closed for almost two weeks. Other school buildings have been closed for months. Parents say they have no idea how long the hazards existed before action was taken.
    


            Milwaukee Public Schools Superintendent Dr. Brenda Cassellius, who assumed her post in mid-March as the crisis was already unfolding, says schools in the district have been underfunded and individual principals were forced to make impossible choices.
    


            “You've had to make a hard choice between adding a teacher or a paraprofessional or additional special education teachers for students with disabilities, or painting a wall,” she told CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta this week.
    


            Going forward, Cassellius said, the district will assume the cost of school repairs so they aren't shouldered by individual schools. So far, the district has spent nearly $2 million to clean and repaint seven schools, and remediation will start on two more this month.
    


            Cassellius estimates that it could cost as much as $20 million from the district's reserve funds.
    


            That may stave off the crisis, but it won't be the last of the city's lead problems.
    


            Tracy Hampton, a 34-year-old mother of three who was born and raised in Milwaukee, has been trying to keep her kids away from lead for nearly a decade.
    


            When her oldest son, Prince, was a toddler, a test showed that he had a lead level of 27, which prompted his doctor to prescribe iron drops to help reduce the body's absorption of lead. Hampton was told to wipe down toys and surfaces in their home and make sure he was eating plenty of fruits, vegetables and other healthy foods to counteract the damaging effects of the heavy metal.
    


            But a few months later, a routine blood test showed that he had a blood lead level of 45, more than 11 times higher than the CDC's threshold for lead poisoning.
    


            “The doctor told me to take him to the hospital immediately, and that's what I did,” Hampton said, recalling the 2016 ordeal. Dr. Kristine Davison, a pediatrician at Children's Hospital of Wisconsin who has been the family's doctor for years, confirmed the details of the family's blood lead levels for this story.
    


            An X-ray at the hospital revealed bright flecks of white in his stomach, a sign that he'd eaten chips of lead-based paint. He ran a high fever, vomited and had a seizure, and doctors worked to flush as much lead as they could from his body.
    


            Around the same time, the city's health department dropped the ball on lead investigations. An audit of the department's records in 2018 failed to find any evidence that it had notified some 6,000 families that their children had elevated levels of lead in their blood.
    


Further investigation showed that the department bungled follow-up care too, failing to investigate the sources of lead exposure for some children. Other instances found that some children's cases were closed early, before there was evidence that their lead levels had returned to normal.
    


            The failures affected cases going to back to 2015.
    


            The health commissioner at the time was forced to resign. The state and federal governments launched investigations into the health department's handling of lead poisonings.
    


            It's not clear whether Hampton's family was among those that fell through the cracks. She had been spending nights at her mother's house for help with her active toddler, and she says the Milwaukee Department of Health tested the rental home and found that the windows and floors were loaded with lead.
    


            “It was really old,” Hampton said.
    


            Her mother's rental home sits on the city's north side. Between 2018 and 2021, nearly 1 in 5 children who lived in that neighborhood had elevated levels of lead in their blood, according to data from the Wisconsin Department of Health Services.
    


            After Hampton limited the amount of time she spent at her mother's place and stopped spending the night, Prince's lead levels began to come down.
    


            In 2022, Hampton moved her family into a different rental home. Prince's lead levels continued to be elevated, hovering around 6.5. His baby sister, Idanna, also tested over the CDC's threshold for lead poisoning for the first time.
    


            That house, too, was tested and found to be full of lead paint.
    


            In Milwaukee, 88% of homes were built before 1978, when it was still legal to use lead-based paint. Dr. Mike Totoraitis, the city's health commissioner, estimates that about 200,000 housing units in the city may still be affected by it, based on their age.
    


            “Unfortunately, the majority of the poisonings that we have in our city are in the poorest housing stock of our city,” he said.
    


            Since their industrial heydays, many Midwest cities have seen their urban populations shrink. Practices like redlining contributed by concentrating Black populations in some of the poorest neighborhoods, which were then spurned by investors. As a result, homes and municipal buildings have aged and deteriorated but were not torn down and replaced.
    


            If there was a silver lining to the scrutiny of Milwaukee's lax lead response in 2018, it was that the health department's lead program was completely rebuilt and strengthened.
    


            “That's frankly how we're able to respond to this whole crisis at the schools,” said Totoraitis, who joined the department in 2023.
    


            When news of the student poisoning broke this year, the health department set up a dedicated website where it has posted photos of affected schools, inspection reports and letters to parents. It has held regular news briefings and town halls. Totoraitis said it's also working to create a dashboard so parents can have more insight into the results of student blood tests.
    


            Under pressure from angry parents, the school district parted ways with its facilities manager. The director of the health department's home environmental health program has been loaned to the district to fill that role as abatement on the buildings continues.
    


            Totoraitis knows that the community remembers — and that shades the department's assurances to the public now.
    


            “Through that moment in our department's history to where we are now, we have always leaned into the issues that we've seen in our city, in particular with our lead program, and I think that's helped to rebuild some of the trust that we lost, rightly so, with the community,” Totoraitis said.
    


            At Trowbridge Street School, it's clear that Room 13 – home to Mr. Koney's Kindergarten Superheroes – has gotten a recent facelift.
    


            Photos taken during the health department's inspection showed bookshelves with cracked and peeling paint sitting close to the ground, but the wood is now sanded smooth and painted over. A hallway with hooks for kids' backpacks now has blotches of fresh paint just a shade lighter than the old blue underneath. Cracks in the walls outside the classroom have been sealed with a white caulk-like substance. The wooden floors of the 129-year-old building gleam with fresh polish.
    


            “It's almost a hospital-level clean that we're needing to do to clear the swabs,” Cassellius said, referring to how the health department tests to make sure there's no lead dust lingering on surfaces.
    


            The department said the lead has been contained at Trowbridge, for now.
    


            But some parents say argue that it doesn't address faucets where water has tested high for lead or soil around the schools. A soil sample at a playground at Golda Meir School surpassed the state's action level for lead but not a level set by the US Environmental Protection Agency.
    


            “This is an inadequate response that we're having at all levels of government here that we're fighting back, and we're kind of banding together and figuring out how we can force some of these institutions to do the right thing,” said Kristen Payne, whose son is a third-grader at Golda Meir, the site of the initial poisoning case.
    


            The health department and school district say that drinking water sources in schools are safe. The district has installed filtered water dispensers in schools, and any sinks that have been found to have elevated lead levels are supposed to be labeled as not for drinking.
    


            Totoraitis says that with strained resources, the city has to focus on lead hazards that are known to have poisoned students. For now, that's the paint.
    


            But he's asking for money to hire four more people to help him respond to community complaints of chipping paint or other potential hazards before they poison anyone. He could also then inspect school buildings regularly to make sure the district is following its plans to mitigate lead.
    


            Health officials are encouraging parents of students at affected schools to get them tested for lead. With 68,000 students in the district — most of them beyond the age when they'd get regular lead testing at a pediatrician's office — the city has been trying create more testing opportunities.
    


            Inside North Division High School on Wednesday, the district hosted a lead testing clinic that would give parents near-instant feedback on whether a child might have a high level of lead in their system.
    


            An earlier clinic tested about 250 kids, but only 22 were tested Wednesday. Of those, two had elevated blood lead levels and will require more testing.
    


            For now, given the funding they have, the schools and health department say, they can clean up chipped lead paint in homes and schools and seal it under new paint. They can make a building lead-safe but not truly lead-free.
    


            If the repairs are not maintained, the threat will eventually be back.
    


            “It's a constant cleaning, a constant upkeep, a constant painting. And it is expensive,” Cassellius said.
    


            At some point, trying to maintain Milwaukee's aging schools – some of which are more than 100 years old – simply won't be sustainable or safe anymore.
    


            There is some federal help coming for homes in Milwaukee. Totoraitis said the city recently got federal funding to remediate 600, but each project has cost much more than anticipated. In the end, he said, they'll probably be able to clean up 450 homes.
    


            Helping a single home can have an impact, though.
    


            Prince, who is now 10 and in fourth grade, has trouble reading and writing and needs remedial help in school. He's also been diagnosed with ADHD. His mother, Tracy Hampton, said doctors have told her that his issues were probably caused by his exposure to lead.
    


            Hampton moved again in 2023, this time into a house that she said was tested and shown to have no lead issues.
    


            This year, for the first time since he was a baby, Prince's blood lead level has fallen into the normal range again, Hampton said. His sister, who turns 3 next week, is in the normal range, too.
    


            Hampton hopes her story will motivate the city to proactively test more homes and schools for lead and not wait until more children are harmed.
    


            “We need our kids to live, to be smart, to be intelligent, to do what they want to be in life,” she said. “Not to grow up with a disability.”

            For around 2,000 years, global sea levels varied little. That changed in the 20th century. They started rising and have not stopped since — and the pace is accelerating.
    


            Scientists are scrambling to understand what this means for the future just as President Trump strips back agencies tasked with monitoring the oceans.
    


            Since 1993, satellites have kept careful watch over the world's oceans, allowing scientists a clear view of how they are behaving. What they have revealed is alarming.
    


            Sea level rise was unexpectedly high last year, according to a recent NASA analysis of satellite data.
    


            More concerning, however, is the longer-term trend. The rate of annual sea level rise has more than doubled over the past 30 years, resulting in the global sea level increasing 4 inches since 1993.
    


            “It's like we're putting our foot on the gas pedal,” said Benjamin Hamlington, a research scientist in the Sea Level and Ice Group at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. While other climate signals fluctuate, global sea level has a “persistent rise,” he told CNN.
    


            It spells trouble for the future. Scientists have a good idea how much average sea level will rise by 2050 — around 6 inches globally, and as much as 10 to 12 inches in the US. Past 2050, however, things get very fuzzy.
    


            “We have such a huge range of uncertainty,” said Dirk Notz, head of sea ice at the University of Hamburg. “The numbers are just getting higher and higher and higher very quickly.”
    


            The world could easily see an extra 3 feet of sea level rise by 2100, he told CNN; it could also take hundreds of years to reach that level. Scientists simply don't know enough yet to project what will happen.
    


            What scientists are crystal clear about is the reason for the rise: human-caused global warming.
    


            Oceans absorb roughly 90% of the excess heat primarily produced by burning fossil fuels, and as water heats up it expands. Heat in the oceans and atmosphere is also driving melting of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets, which together hold enough fresh water to raise global sea levels by around 213 feet.
    


            Melting ice sheets have driven roughly two-thirds of longer-term sea level rise, although last year — the planet's hottest on record — the two factors flipped, making ocean warming the main driver.
    


            It's likely that an increase of about 3 feet is already locked in, Notz said, because “we have pushed the system too hard.” The big question is, how quickly will it happen?
    


            Ice sheets are the biggest uncertainty, as it's not clear how fast they'll react as the world heats up — whether they'll melt steadily or reach a tipping point and rapidly collapse.
    


            From studying things like ice cores and sediments, scientists know sudden and dramatic melting happened thousands of years ago, Notz said, but it's still unclear how processes may unfold over the next decades and centuries.
    


            Antarctica is “the elephant in the room,” he said. Alarming changes are unfolding on this vast icy continent, which holds enough water to raise levels by 190 feet.
    


            Notz describes the ice sheet as an “awakening giant:” It takes a long time to wake up but once awake, “it's very, very difficult to put it back to sleep.”
    


            It will take time for scientists to unravel what the future holds for the ice sheets and what that means for sea level rise.
    


            “There'll be big uncertainties that persist for decades,” said Robert Nicholls, professor of climate adaptation at the University of East Anglia.
    


            The ocean is not flat like a bathtub and there are big variations in the way sea level rise is experienced.
    


            Some parts of the world see higher levels because of a tangle of factors, including regional currents, erosion and land shifts — some due to natural processes such as tectonic plate movements, others to human activities including fossil fuel and groundwater extraction.
    


            The US coastlines are tracking above global average and toward the upper end of climate model projections, NASA's Hamlington said.
    


            The Gulf Coast, where land is sinking in large part due to the extraction of oil, gas and groundwater, is a hotspot.
    


            Louisiana is particularly vulnerable as climate change-driven sea level rise meets fast-sinking land. The state has one of the highest rates of land loss in the world, with some areas experiencing relative sea level rise nearly four times the global rate.
    


            Outside the United States, low-lying Pacific island nations bear the brunt of sea level rise, which already poses a threat to their existence.
    


            Over the next three decades, islands such as Tuvalu, Kiribati and Fiji will experience at least 6 inches of sea level rise even if the world reduces planet-heating pollution, according to NASA.
    


            The world's coastal communities were built with an understanding of where high tides normally reach. “Now we're shifting that normal” and even tiny shifts can cause big  impacts, Hamlington said.
    


            Already, coastal flooding is increasing, even in the absence of big storms or heavy rainfall. High tide flooding is now happening two to three times more often since 1990 along most US Atlantic and Gulf coastlines, said William Sweet, an oceanographer at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
    


            Sea level rise also contributes to coastal erosion, chokes sewage systems and causes salty water to seep into underground freshwater supplies.
    


Where sinking cities are pushing sea level rise into overdrive



            Rising seas won't be felt equally. In some places, 6 inches might mean more frequent flooding during high tides; in others, it could lead to constant inundation, with water covering streets and coastal land for months at a time. The difference depends on a range of factors, including land shifts.
    


            The world can adapt to slow sea level rise, Notz said: “We might have to relocate cities; you might have to move people around,” but there are ways to build and prepare.
    


            This is already happening. “Entire villages in Fiji have been formally relocated,” said Fijian activist George Nacewa, from climate group 350.org, “the incoming tides are flooding our roads and inundating our crops.”
    


            However, if the pace accelerates rapidly, “it will be very, very difficult to adapt to, because things unfold too quickly,” he said. As ever, it will be the most vulnerable who feel the biggest impacts, he added.
    


            Many parts of the world aren't well prepared. Sea level rise is an “underappreciated” problem as “it's hard to grasp the implications” of even a few inches of rise, the University of East Anglia's Nicholls said.
    


            Humans still have control over how fast sea level rises over the next decades and centuries by cutting emissions, Notz noted.
    


            Global levels of planet-heating pollution, however, continue to tick up and the Trump administration is racing to undo climate policies, including slashing Earth science research at NASA, sweeping staff cuts at NOAA and withdrawing the US from global climate action.
    


            “One of the big concerns with the current US administration is that they won't renew satellites,” Nicholls said. This would take eyes off the oceans at a crucial time.
    


            What the world chooses to do is an ethical issue, said Notz.
    


            “The kind of sea level rise that we have to deal with is so much smaller compared to what future generations have to face,” he said; the real catastrophe will come further down the road when those who have caused the problem are no longer around.

Live Updates


• Fresh escalation: Explosions resumed in Jammu city today, according to the chief minister of Indian-administered Kashmir. Drones are “being engaged” in the region as well as in the Indian state of Punjab, where blackouts are also in effect, a defense spokesperson said.
    


• Death toll: The leader of Pakistan-administered Kashmir said 36 people have died in Pakistan and his region since Wednesday. More than 500 others evacuated along the de facto border dividing Kashmir, he added.
    


• Accusations on both sides: India said Pakistan launched hundreds of drones along the countries' border overnight, while a Pakistani security source said India carried out drone attacks on Pakistan early this morning. The rivals have repeatedly accused each other of launching aerial attacks since the conflict escalated on Wednesday, following a tourist massacre last month.
    


• Room for diplomacy: While Islamabad has vowed to retaliate, a senior Pakistani government source told CNN that it does not want to respond until its allies have tried diplomacy with both sides, denying that Pakistan had struck India.
    


            Two people living in Pathankot, in the Indian state of Punjab, spoke to CNN about the blackout happening in their city.
    


            Forty-year-old Ranbir Singh, who was at home with his wife and kids when the “complete blackout” happened, said they “aren't scared” because this is the second time such a blackout has happened.
    


                    “We are used to it now and we have faith in our armed forces, whatever explosions are happening, we know it won't affect us; they will fight it,” Singh told CNN.
                





            A 39-year-old doctor working at a government hospital in Pathankot told CNN on Friday that the hospital is still running during the blackout, but “shops closed early and people are indoors, so that's good, but of course there is still fear, these aren't normal circumstances.”
    


            “We've heard about 30 to 40 blast-like sounds over the last hour alone,” the doctor added.
    


            Drones have been seen in Pathankot, according to Suneel Bartwal, a defense spokesperson based in Jammu in Indian-administered Kashmir.
    


            Cross-border shelling by India killed five people in Pakistan-administered Kashmir overnight, according to the region's prime minister, raising the total death toll since Wednesday in Pakistan and the Pakistan-administered region to 36 people.
    


            Anwarul Haq, the leader of Azad Kashmir, which is the name given to the Pakistan-administered part of the divided region, warned that New Delhi's latest salvo and Islamabad's retaliatory attacks have “now escalated into a wartime situation” He added that those communities closest to the border are “bearing the brunt.”
    


                    “India is using artillery to deliberately target civilian populations,” he claimed to reporters today, adding that “the Pakistan Army has responded strongly.”
                





Hundreds evacuated: He said at least 510 people have been evacuated from three sectors along the de factor border dividing Kashmir, known as the Line of Control.
    


            Communities in both India and Pakistan-administered parts of Kashmir have been forced to flee their homes or shelter in bunkers in recent days, after New Delhi launched a series of strikes deep into Pakistan-administered Kashmir and Pakistan proper.
    


Remember: India said it launched the military operation in response to a shooting massacre in the idyllic tourist spot of Pahalgam, where gunmen killed more than two dozen tourists. Islamabad has vehemently denied involvement.
    


            New Delhi's initial strikes on Wednesday, local time, wounded at least another 46 people, Pakistani officials reported. Pakistani shelling has so far killed at least 16 civilians in the India-administered part of Kashmir, according to Indian authorities.
    


            The sound of explosions resumed in Jammu city today, along with a blackout, according to the chief minister of Indian-controlled Kashmir on X.
    


            Omar Abdullah said that he heard sirens across the city as well as “intermittent sounds of blasts.”
    


                    Deepika Singh Rajawat, a lawyer based in Jammu, described the scene to CNN: “We can hear sirens and there is complete blackout. … We can hear the blasts intermittently for about 20 to 30 minutes now; my family and I are hunkered down at home.”
                





            Drones have been sighted in Indian-administered cities of Jammu and Samba and in the city of Pathankot in the Indian state of Punjab, “and they are being engaged,” according to Suneel Bartwal, defense spokesperson based in Jammu.
    


            Pathankot and Samba are also experiencing blackouts, according to Bartwal.
    


            Shelling was additionally reported in Uri, a border town 102 kilometers (63 miles) north of city of Srinagar, also in Indian-administered Kashmir, a police official told CNN on Friday.
    


            It is unclear what is causing the reported sounds of explosions. It comes as India and Pakistan repeatedly accuse the other of launching attacks since their conflict escalated Wednesday local time.
    


            Pakistan targeted 36 Indian sites with 300 to 400 drones overnight on Thursday into Friday, an Indian military official said, an assertion denied by Islamabad.
    


            According to Indian military official Vyomika Singh, Pakistan's military carried out multiple violations of Indian air space along the entire western border, with military infrastructure the intended target.
    


                    “Along the international border and Line of Control Drone intrusions were attempted from Leh to Sir Creek at 36 locations with approximately 300 to 400 drones,” Singh told a Friday press briefing.
                





            She added that India's armed forces brought down “a number” of these drones. In response, India launched drones at four air defense sites in Pakistan, she said.
    


What Pakistan says: Speaking to CNN on Friday, a senior Pakistani government source strongly denied that Pakistan had launched drone strikes against India. While acknowledging heavy shelling across the Line of Control, the source said Pakistan had not yet used any of its drones.
    


            Singh also said that Pakistan's military fired heavy-caliber artillery guns and armed drones across the Line of Control (LoC) in Kashmir, resulting in the deaths and injuries of some Indian army personnel. She added that Pakistan's army also suffered “major losses” in Indian retaliatory fire.
    


            Photos show the aftermath at Rawalpindi Cricket Stadium, where an Indian drone fell yesterday, killing one man — a vendor — and injuring two others.
    


            Shrapnel marks are splattered on a wall, seen along with shattered glass and twisted metal.
    


            Rawalpindi lies adjacent to the capital, Islamabad.
    


            Pakistan's military said its armed forces downed over two dozen Indian drones on Thursday.
    


Watch CNN's Nic Robertson on the scene:

            Saudi Arabia's minister of state for foreign affairs arrived for an “official visit” to Pakistan's capital Islamabad on Friday on a potential mission to calm tensions between the country and its neighbor India, Pakistan's foreign ministry said.
    


            Adel al-Jubeir's surprise trip comes as regional leaders urge India and Pakistan to ease cross-border attacks following their latest military flare-up over the long-disputed region of Kashmir region — to which both nuclear-armed nations claim full sovereignty.
    


            A senior Pakistani government source had told CNN that Islamabad is “giving space for diplomacy” before any potential response to India's initial assault early Wednesday.
    


            The Saudi minister touched down from New Delhi — where he met India's Minister of External Affairs S. Jaishankar on Thursday to discuss “India's perspectives on firmly countering terrorism,” the latter said in a post on X.
    


            The Arab Gulf states — including Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates — are among the top candidates to mediate those potential negotiations, given their close ties to India and Pakistan.
    


CNN's Nic Robertson contributed reporting to this post. 



            In Pakistani-administered Kashmir's capital city, residents protested on Friday against India's recent military action at the site of a mosque destroyed by an Indian missile earlier this week.
    


            Bilal Mosque in Muzaffarabad sustained a hit from an Indian missile as strikes were launched on the area by India in the early hours of Wednesday morning, sending locals running for cover.
    


            Two days later, residents who had attended the mosque held a protest march at the site of the damaged religious building, with demonstrators chanting loudly against India and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. People from other mosques also joined the protest.
    


            Demonstrators also raised slogans in support of the Pakistan Army and Chief of Army Staff.
    


            The march began Bilal Mosque and continued for approximately two kilometers (about 1.24 miles), ending at Chhalla Bridge in Muzaffarabad.
    


            Tensions are high for those living near the de facto border separating Indian and Pakistan administered Kashmir, known as the Line of Control (LoC), a local resident living in the Pakistani-administered side of the heavily-contested region has said.
    


            The LoC continues to be one of the main flashpoints of the conflict that has erupted between the two neighboring countries since Wednesday.
    


                    “The firing continues the whole night. I have more than 20 family members. I am trying to evacuate them,” Mukhtar Qureshi, a local resident of a village at the Chakothi sector, told CNN. 
                





            Qureshi continued, “Our area is not in liveable condition. There has been heavily shelling in the area. People along the Line of Control are in high tension.”
    


            UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy spoke to both his Indian and Pakistani counterparts on Friday, according to both nations' foreign ministries, as global allies urged the South Asian neighbors to exercise restraint in their latest military flare-up over the long-disputed Kashmir region.
    


            India's Minister of External Affairs S. Jaishankar said he discussed a “zero-tolerance” approach to “countering terrorism” with Lammy, in a post on X.
    


            Meanwhile, Pakistan's Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar stressed that India's latest attack “threatened regional peace and security.”
    


                    “(Lammy) expressed deep concern over the unfolding situation and conveyed his condolences on the tragic loss of civilian lives,” according to a statement released by Pakistan's foreign ministry. “He underscored the need for both sides to exercise restraint and de-escalate.”
                





            New Delhi and Islamabad have traded accusations over cross-border attacks and shelling for a third day, after India launched an unprecedented assault on Punjab and Pakistan-administered Kashmir earlier in the week — reigniting historic tensions.
    


            The Indian Premier League (IPL) cricket tournament has been suspended for one week due to ongoing heightened tensions between India and its neighbor Pakistan, the sport's national governing board announced on Friday.
    


            The tournament, which is the most popular and richest cricket league in the world, began its current season on March 22 and was due to end on May 25. It was valued at $12 billion in 2024, according to Reuters.
    


            The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) cited the stakeholders' concerns for their players, as well as the views of the broadcaster, sponsors and fans, as reasons for the suspension.
    


                    “While cricket remains a national passion, there is nothing greater than the nation” and its “sovereignty, integrity, and security,” a statement from the BCCI said.
                





            The BCCI added that it remains committed to supporting “all efforts that safeguard India.”
    


            The announcement is the latest in a series of disruptions India and Pakistan's military actions have caused to one of the few things beloved by both countries: cricket.
    


            On Thursday, a cricket match in Dharamshala, in India's Himachal Pradesh state, was halted because of nearby military action, said an official at the cricket stadium.
    


            Similar disruptions are being seen across the border: the Pakistan Cricket Board announced on Friday it was moving all remaining Pakistan Super League matches to take place in the United Arab Emirates instead.
    


Some background: The game, a legacy of British colonial rule, holds a significant influence in both countries. The India-Pakistan cricket rivalry has endured for decades and is often considered one of the greatest sporting rivalries in the world.
    


            But it has also provided a rare bridge between the countries, uniting civilians on both sides. During the last Cricket World Cup in 2023 — a tournament which only happens once every four years — Indian fans applauded when Pakistan's team arrived in the southern Indian city of Hyderabad, and cheered when Pakistan defeated Sri Lanka. India eventually beat Pakistan at the World Cup.
    


            India continued to launch drone attacks on Pakistan early Friday morning, according to a senior Pakistani government source.
    


            The impact is unknown. The source said at least one had been shot down.
    


            India and Pakistan have repeatedly accused each other of launching aerial attacks since the conflict escalated Wednesday.
    


            India's army said Friday it also repelled multiple attacks from Pakistani drones and “other munitions” along their shared border overnight and warned it would respond with force to “all nefarious designs.”
    


            The source said earlier that Pakistan had not yet struck India and that “Pakistan is giving space for diplomacy” before it responds to India's attacks.
    


            In various parts of India's Punjab state on Thursday, lights were switched off by authorities around 9 p.m. — starting a night of fear and anxiety as residents took shelter in the dark, as tit-for-tat military actions between India and Pakistan continued.
    


            Indian officials claim Pakistan fired drones and missiles at military sites, including in the city of Pathankot in Punjab. Pakistan denies this.
    


            “You would see lights in the sky and hear an explosion immediately after,” said a 39-year-old doctor at a government hospital in Pathankot who wished to remain anonymous. They estimated they heard between 40 and 50 explosions. The sounds continued until midnight, pausing for several hours before resuming in the dawn hours.
    


            There were no casualties at the hospital, and lights came back on in the morning – but the doctor said their family was still scared.
    


                    “We aren't used to this, things have always been normal here.”
                





            Another Pathankot resident, 42-year-old property dealer Laxmi Kant, said his 8 and 13-year-old daughters were “quite scared when the lights went out.” Though Friday seemed calmer, none of them plan to leave the house today, he said. “When night comes, we don't know what will happen.”
    


            Similar scenes played out in the city of Amritsar, which is home to more than 2 million people and is around 15 miles from the Pakistan border. Residents described lights going out from 9 p.m. to about 5 a.m., with the internet cut and explosions through the night.
    


            Amritsar district officials had issued an order for residents to stay indoors on Friday, but a 39-year-old medical technician said things felt “normal” again by the daytime.
    


                    “I'll go to work today,” he said, requesting anonymity. “But when it gets dark we do get scared because we don't know what might happen.”
                





            After nearly a decade away from the Indian big screen, Pakistani actor and singer Fawad Khan was supposed to make his grand return to Bollywood on Friday with his new film “Abir Gulaal” — a move cheered by fans in the cinema-mad country.
    


            Then the India-Pakistan conflict escalated this week. Now, the movie appears to be largely unavailable in the country on the day of its scheduled release.
    


            Though the movie is listed on BookMyShow, one of the largest ticket sellers in India, the website on Friday said there were “no watch options.” Local media had also reported this week that the film will not hit cinemas Friday as planned.
    


            Khan has not publicly commented on the matter.
    


            While Pakistani and Indian performers have a long and storied history of collaboration, that came to an abrupt halt nine years ago after dozens of Indian soldiers were killed in a militant attack in the disputed Kashmir region. Much like last month's attack, India blamed Pakistan, and deadly clashes ensued along their contested border.
    


            Khan has a huge following in India, and has appeared in Indian films in the past. But he, too, disappeared from Indian media and platforms after the 2016 attack. Meanwhile, Pakistan has largely restricted Indian films from release in the country since then.
    


            The announcement of his planned return had been celebrated by Bollywood fans, with many expressing excitement and praising film as a medium to connect people across borders. But it also received strong criticism from right-wing politicians who vowed to block its release.
    


            Pakistan does not want to respond to India's attack until its allies have tried diplomacy, a senior Pakistani government source told CNN, as the US, Saudi Arabia and others engage with both sides to try to de-escalate tensions.
    


            “Pakistan is giving space for diplomacy,” the source said, denying that Pakistan had struck India. Earlier, Indian officials said Pakistan fired missiles and drones at military sites in India and Indian-administered Kashmir.
    


            On Thursday, Pakistan's military accused India of creating a “hype” about Pakistan attacking 15 locations in India and Indian-administered Kashmir. “It's such a fantastic and cooked-up story. You can just laugh about it,” spokesperson Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry told reporters.
    


            “Pakistan has not fired missiles or sent drones in to India yet,” the source told CNN.
    


            An Indian Army spokesperson told CNN earlier that explosions were heard in Jammu city, in Indian-administered Kashmir. Police in Pathankot, a city in India's Punjab state, also received reports of explosions, according to a police source. Officials said air defenses were at work in both places.
    


            The source said Pakistan had been urging the US to use its satellite analysis to verify or debunk India's claims of attacks in Jammu, Pathenkot and missiles fired elsewhere.
    


Diplomacy efforts: World leaders, including the US, have urged the two sides to exercise restraint as tensions between the two escalate.
    


            US Secretary of State Marco Rubio spoke with the Indian external affairs minister and Pakistani Prime Minister on Thursday. He expressed US support for “direct dialogue” between India and Pakistan and “encouraged continued efforts to improve communications,” according to State readouts of the calls.
    


            There has so far not been direct contact between Pakistan and India, the source said, adding “circuitous channels” are relaying information between them.
    


            India and Pakistan's military actions have disrupted one of the few things beloved by both countries: cricket.
    


            On Thursday, a cricket match in Dharamshala, in India's Himachal Pradesh state, was halted because of nearby military action, said an official at the cricket stadium.
    


            The Indian Premier League match was between the Punjab Kings and Delhi Capitals.
    


                    “We got instructions from the government to stop the match because there were attacks at Pathankot, which isn't too far from here,” the official told CNN.
                





            CNN has reached out to the Board of Control for Cricket in India, the national governing body for the sport, for comment.
    


            Similar disruptions are being seen across the border: the Pakistan Cricket Board announced on Friday it was moving all remaining Pakistan Super League matches to take place in the United Arab Emirates instead.
    


                    Board chairman Mohsin Naqvi said the move was made so that “domestic as well as foreign cricketers, who are our precious guests, can be saved from the possible reckless targeting by India.”
                





Some background: The game, a legacy of British colonial rule, holds a significant influence in both countries. The India-Pakistan cricket rivalry has endured for decades and is often considered one of the greatest sporting rivalries in the world.

            The escalating conflict between India and Pakistan could be offering the world a first real glimpse into how advanced Chinese military technology performs against proven Western hardware – and Chinese defense stocks are already surging.
    


            Shares of China's AVIC Chengdu Aircraft rose 40% this week, as Pakistan claimed it used AVIC-produced J-10C jets to shoot down Indian fighter jets during an aerial battle on Wednesday.
    


            India has not responded to Pakistan's claims or acknowledged any aircraft losses. When asked about the involvement of Chinese-made jets, a spokesperson for China's Foreign Ministry said on Thursday he was not familiar with the situation.
    


China is Pakistan's primary arms supplier: China is likely watching intently to find out how its weapon systems have and potentially will perform in real combat.
    


A rising military superpower: China hasn't fought a major war in more than four decades. But under leader Xi Jinping, it has raced to modernize its armed forces, pouring resources into developing sophisticated weaponry and cutting-edge technologies.
    


            It has also extended that modernization drive to Pakistan, long hailed by Beijing as its “ironclad brother.”
    


Weapons exports: Over the past five years, China has supplied 81% of Pakistan's imported weapons, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute.
    


            Those exports include advanced fighter jets, missiles, radars and air-defense systems that experts say would play a pivotal role in any military conflict between Pakistan and India.
    


                    “This makes any engagement between India and Pakistan a de facto test environment for Chinese military exports,” said Sajjan Gohel, international security director at the Asia-Pacific Foundation, a think tank based in London.

            India said Pakistan attacked it overnight using drones and “other munitions” along their shared and disputed border.
    


            Pakistan, meanwhile, has destroyed Indian Army checkpoints along their disputed border in Kashmir, a Pakistan security source said, as confrontations between the South Asian neighbors threaten to spill into a wider conflict.
    


            India and Pakistan have repeatedly accused each other of launching cross-border attacks since their conflict escalated on Wednesday.

'America Reports' has the latest on the lawsuit from the California governor over the Trump administration's tariff policies.

Gov. Gavin Newsom, D-Calif., a potential 2028 presidential candidate, launched a new fact-check website on Wednesday targeting ""right-wing misinformation,"" as a new poll found more than half of California registered voters believe he is more focused on becoming president than delivering for Californians. 

Newsom's campaign apparatus described the new fact-check website as a ""rapid-response website to set the record straight about the Golden State"" and President Donald Trump. 

A new survey conducted by UC Berkeley's Institute of Governmental Studies and co-sponsored by the Los Angeles Times found that 54% of California registered voters believe Newsom is more focused on his personal presidential ambitions than solving the ongoing problems at home in the Golden State. 

""By a more than a two-to-one margin (54% to 26%), most voters believe that as Newsom serves out his final two years as governor, he is devoting more of his attention to things that might benefit himself as a possible candidate for president than to governing the state and helping to solve its problems,"" according to the results of the poll completed April 21-28 among 6,201 registered voters in California.

Newsom's campaign, in a press release announcing the new fact-checking endeavor, touted California as the fourth-largest economy in the world, and said the blue state's population is growing, crime rates are at historic lows and California is leading the nation in clean energy and tech innovation. 

WHITMER DITCHES DEM PLAYBOOK ON TRUMP'S TARIFFS AMID 2028 SPECULATION

""This site is for everyone sick of the BS about California. We're done letting the MAGA trolls define the Golden State. We're going on the offense and fighting back — with facts,"" Newsom said. 

Newsom's latest endeavor targets misinformation from the devastating Los Angeles fires this year and other state issues, including crime, climate, the economy, immigration, energy and housing. California is often ridiculed by Republicans as a representation of the demise of Democratic states. Such was the case last month when a California lawmaker proposed a bill to allow state college and university students to sleep in their cars amid the blue state's housing crisis. 

The California politician has long been rumored to harbor presidential ambitions. He was one of several names floated as a potential Democratic nominee replacement for President Joe Biden before Biden suspended his re-election campaign last summer and ultimately chose former Vice President Kamala Harris as his successor. Newsom also campaigned for Biden and Harris in key battleground states, acting as a surrogate for both candidates when their names were on the top of the ticket.

Newsom launched a podcast this year embracing political dialogue across party lines, following Democrats losing the White House and the Senate and failing to regain the House of Representatives in 2024. Newsom has invited Trump allies and conservative guests, including Charlie Kirk and Steve Bannon, onto his podcast in an attempt to show he is open to ""criticism and debate without demeaning or dehumanizing one another."" 

The strategy follows criticism after the 2024 election that Democrats didn't prioritize new media appearances and unscripted conversations enough. 

But Newsom's willingness to soak up the national spotlight as Democrats look for someone to lead the party into the next generation may have backfired among his California constituents.

Newsom is one of several Democratic governors trying to balance diplomacy with rejecting Trump's agenda during the president's second term. Newsom has spoken out against Trump's tariff policies and executive orders while reaching across the aisle to secure disaster relief following the Los Angeles fires earlier this year. 

The poll found a majority of California voters believe the state would be negatively impacted by Trump's overhaul of the federal government, as 64% believe Trump's tariffs would negatively impact California business and agriculture and over 50% believe Trump's policies would have a negative impact on education.

Meanwhile, Californians are split on Newsom's job performance, with 46% both approving and disapproving of his job as governor and 45% reporting they are not confident in ""his ability to be effective in looking out for California's interests when dealing with the Trump administration.""

""The Governor is focused on one thing: his job — driving L.A.'s recovery, confronting the housing crisis, and taking Donald Trump to court over his disastrous tariffs that are raising costs for families and blowing a hole in California's budget,"" Newsom's office told Fox News in response to the new polling.

'The Big Weekend Show' co-hosts guess dye-free foods and weigh in on Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. unveiling a plan to phase out eight artificial food dyes.

President Donald Trump said he does not know his new nominee for U.S. surgeon general, telling reporters Thursday that he relied upon the recommendation of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

Trump withdrew the nomination of his first pick for surgeon general, Dr. Janette Nesheiwat, this week and instead nominated Dr. Casey Means. The president, upon announcing her nomination, said she has ""impeccable ‘MAHA' credentials."" 

TRUMP ANNOUNCES MAHA ADVOCATE CASEY MEANS WILL BE NEW SURGEON GENERAL NOMINEE

When asked Thursday about Means and why he tapped her for the role, the president said Kennedy recommended her. 

""Because Bobby thought she was fantastic, brilliant woman who went through Stanford — wanted to be academic instead of physician,"" the president said. 

""I don't know her, I listened to Bobby,"" Trump added. ""I think she'll be great.""

Means, a vocal ""Make America Healthy Again"" proponent, played a significant role in helping shape the administration's agenda surrounding health alongside her brother, Calley Means. 

She has made a name for herself as a wellness influencer alongside her brother. In 2024, both Casey and Calley co-wrote a book about the chronic disease epidemic titled ""Good Energy,"" and Casey is also the co-founder of a health-tech company called Levels.

Calley Means was previously tapped by the administration to serve as a top special advisor to Kennedy.

It is unclear why Nesheiwat's nomination was pulled. Fox News Digital reached out to the White House for more information and did not immediately receive a response. 

Meanwhile, in a follow-up post on X, Nesheiwat also said she was ""looking forward"" to continuing to support Trump while working closely with Kennedy ""in a senior policy role.""

""My focus continues to be on improving the health and well-being of all Americans, and that mission hasn't changed,"" Nesheiwat concluded in her public social media remarks.  

Nesheiwat is the sister-in-law of recently fired National Security Advisor Michael Waltz, whom the president indicated he will now be nominating to be the next ambassador to the United Nations after dropping his initial nominee, New York GOP Congresswoman Elise Stefanik.

Montclair Pickleball co-founders Aaron Reznick and Matt Slowinski discuss how pickleball can be a great place for singles to meet their partners on ‘Fox & Friends.'

Andre Agassi is back on the court, just a smaller one.

The eight-time Grand Slam winner made his professional pickleball debut last month at the U.S. Open Pickleball Championships, teaming up with 18-year-old Anna Leigh Waters, the top-ranked female player in the world, in a mixed tournament.

He won his first match before dropping his second, but after participating casually over the years, he's hooked.

""Dude, I'm not just liking it, I'm loving it. … It's an anomaly to see any support ever at this kind of pace, but it's easy to see why,"" Agassi said in a recent interview with Fox News Digital. ""My family was looking for things to do, and watching how like bring people together, generations together, how it breaks cultural barriers, breaks down gender barriers, breaks down generational barriers, low-point of entry, nobody's intimated to try it, it's challenging at every level. Tell me when to stop, for crying out loud.""

Agassi caught wind of ""Dreambreaker: A Pickleball Story,"" a Netflix documentary - now streaming on MAX - directed by Ashley Underwood, Larry David's wife. She, too, has caught the pickleball fever, which might make for an amazing ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"" episode.

NAOMI OSAKA'S FIERY MESSAGE TO CRITICS AFTER WINNING TOURNAMENT IN FRANCE

""I played pickleball, my husband and I played. We had a fun group during COVID. That's actually when I got started,"" Underwood told Fox News Digital. ""I was a tennis player before, and someone asked me to come play pickleball, and I fell in love with the sport. I went to a major league pickleball tournament in November 2021, and I couldn't believe what I saw in the pro game. They're just playing like a completely different sport almost than recreational players. Just real athletes, incredible to see, and honestly, I saw that this was the birth of a professional sport. So I wanted to chronicle a unique moment in time.""

Despite his tennis success, though, there are a lot of nooks and crannies that Agassi still needs to get used to.

""It's really hard. These guys are so specialized, it's so sensitive, such little margin for error,"" Agassi said. ""There's so much nuance that creates opportunity. It's not like ‘see space, hit space.' There was a lot I had to unlearn, but some things came instinctively. I grew up with a racket in my hand, and in this case it's a paddle, so I'm going to make good contact. But the blood pressure, it's hard to find a place to put it when you're out there on the pickle court.""

Nominated by former President Barrack Obama and confirmed by the Senate in 2016, Carla Hayden was the first woman and the first African American in the role.

Democratic leaders erupted late Thursday after it was reported that President Trump had abruptly fired Librarian of Congress Carla Hayden. 

Hayden was notified of her firing in an email late Thursday from the White House's Presidential Personnel Office, according to an email seen by The Associated Press. 

""Carla,"" the email reportedly began. ""On behalf of President Donald J. Trump, I am writing to inform you that your position as the Librarian of Congress is terminated effective immediately. Thank you for your service."" 

Nominated by former President Barack Obama and confirmed by the Senate in 2016, Hayden, whose term was set to expire next year, was the first woman and the first African American in the role. Advocates praised her tenure for helping to modernize the Library and make it more accessible with initiatives in rural communities and online.

But Hayden had come under fire from the conservative advocacy group American Accountability Foundation, which accused her and other library leaders of promoting children's books with ""radical"" content and literary material authored by Trump opponents. 

Earlier Thursday, just hours before the firing was made public, AAF derided Hayden on X as ""woke"" and ""anti-Trump,"" accusing her of promoting ""trans-kids."" 

""It's time to get her OUT and hire a new guy for the job!"" the group wrote. 

In a follow-up post on X, the group celebrated news of Hayden's firing, thanking President Trump. 

Hayden's reported firing ignited the fury of prominent Democratic leaders, including House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., and Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer of New York. 

NEW RESISTANCE BATTLING TRUMP'S SECOND TERM THROUGH ONSLAUGHT OF LAWSUITS TAKING AIM AT EXECUTIVE ORDERS

Jeffries applauded Hayden as ""an accomplished, principled and distinguished Librarian of Congress.""

""Donald Trump's unjust decision to fire Dr. Hayden in an email sent by a random political hack is a disgrace and the latest in his ongoing effort to ban books, whitewash American history and turn back the clock,"" Jeffries said.

""Enough is enough,"" Schumer said, calling Hayden a ""trailblazer, a scholar, and a public servant of the highest order.""

Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn., said Hayden was ""callously fired"" by Trump and demanded an explanation.

""Hayden, has spent her entire career serving people — from helping kids learn to read to protecting some of our nation's most precious treasures,"" said Rep. Joseph Morelle of New York, the top Democrat on the House Administration Committee that oversees the Library.

New Mexico Sen. Martin Heinrich, the top Democrat on the Senate panel that oversees funding for the library, said the firing, was ""taking his assault on America's libraries to a new level.""

""Dr. Hayden has devoted her career to making reading and the pursuit of knowledge available to everyone,"" he said.

The Library of Congress holds a vast collection of the nation's books and history, which it makes available to the public and lawmakers. It houses the papers of nearly two dozen presidents and more than three dozen Supreme Court justices. It also has collections of rare books, prints and photographs, as well as troves of music and valuable artifacts.

Robert Newlen, the principal deputy librarian, said he would serve as acting librarian of Congress ""until further instruction"" in a separate email seen by the AP.

""I promise to keep everyone informed,"" he wrote to colleagues.

Hayden's firing comes as the Trump administration has been purging officials seen as not aligning with the president's agenda – from the Justice Department to the Pentagon and beyond. 

Earlier Thursday, Cameron Hamilton, the acting administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, was fired just one day after telling lawmakers that dismantling the agency – as President Trump has proposed – is a bad move.

Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy addresses airport safety concerns and discusses his plan to improve an 'antiquated' travel infrastructure on 'The Story.'

The weeks of continued disruptions at Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR) has put America's Air Traffic Control System in the spotlight and has revealed a broken system. Decades of failing to properly invest in the system has prevented good-faith efforts to make technology upgrades and bolster the staffing of our nation's hard-working air traffic controllers.

But don't conflate these challenges and constraints with safety. The truth is that all the flights in and out of EWR are absolutely safe. When there are FAA issues -- technology outages, staffing shortages, etc. -- the FAA requires all airlines to slow down aircraft and/or cancel flights to maintain the highest levels of safety.

At United, we do our part to maintain safety as well by ensuring our pilots have thousands of hours of flight experience and supplement that with regular simulator training – we also have procedures that our pilots follow to re-establish communication if controllers lose radio contact to navigate the airplane safely to its destination.

In short, neither the FAA nor United will ever compromise on safety.

LAWMAKERS REACT TO NEWARK AIRPORT CHAOS: ‘YOUR FAMILY DESERVES TO KNOW YOU'LL BE SAFE'

But when the FAA has technology outages or staffing shortages, it leads to delays and cancellations for our customers and that's the issue we're determined to solve.

The good news is that we are on the verge of solving this persistent customer delay problem at EWR. All that's left is the FAA using the authority -- that only they have -- to designate EWR as a Level 3 airport.

United CEO Scott Kirby (United Airlines)

President Donald Trump and Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy have introduced a plan to fund and execute a long-term modernization of our antiquated system. And while that is a huge step forward, it will also take time -- there are no short-cuts to overhaul a technology system this vast, complex and critical to our economic and national security.

Immediately returning Newark to a Level 3 slot-controlled airport is the most effective way to provide relief to air traffic controllers and deliver a better experience for customers.

EWR is a crown jewel of the region and an international gateway for the U.S.– close to 50 million people flew through EWR last year – but the truth is there are more flights scheduled there than the FAA can handle.

Every other large capacity constrained airport uses slots to make sure that the number of scheduled flights in any given hour does not exceed the airport's maximum capacity. And EWR is the only large airport in the world that no longer has this basic common-sense rule (in 2016, the FAA de-slotted EWR).

Even worse, when you look at customer impact data at EWR before 2017 when the airport was slotted and compare it to the years just before and after the pandemic (2017-2019 and 2022-2025), the numbers are *worse* at a de-slotted EWR:

Newark's air traffic controllers do impressive work with professionalism and a deep focus on safety, while operating some of the most complex airspace in the world. But they manage it with technology developed during World War II and with staffing levels far below what is needed to operate at full capacity.

And again, the president and secretary's plan to modernize the ATC system and get EWR ATC fully staffed is a giant leap in the right direction.

CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP

But to make an impact at EWR that will be felt today, the FAA must also return EWR to a Level 3 slot controlled airport.

It was a mistake to de-slot the airport in 2016 -- every single data point says so -– and we know that implementing slots is the immediate action the FAA can take to reduce congestion there now.

What are the terrorism and extremism risks to U.S. national security posed by legal immigration?  

Immigration and Customs Enforcement is insufficiently tasked as a counterterrorism agency, which is hardly its fault. ICE catches many more criminals and immigration fraudsters than it does foreign extremists and terrorists. 

Still, the second Trump administration has unquestionably broadcast the terrorism threat caused by immigration, legal or not. On his very first day back in office, President Donald Trump signed an executive order protecting Americans “from aliens who intend to commit terrorist attacks, threaten our national security, espouse hateful ideology, or otherwise exploit the immigration laws for malevolent purposes.”

The White House justified this with claims that not only do foreigners coming here threaten U.S. national security, but many are scammers, including thousands of foreigners fraudulently claiming federal benefits, including Medicaid (among them four persons on the terrorist watch list).  

Democrats have pooh-poohed all this as MAGA political theater, but there's no doubt that the Biden administration witnessed a massive jump in the number of suspect foreigners entering this country with minimal, if any, security vetting. Even if the accusations of House Republicans last year that the Biden White House released at least hundreds of suspected foreign terrorists into the United States represent a worst-case scenario, the threat is real. 

But what about the terrorist-extremist threat from legal immigrants? This is a controversial subject, given political sensitivities, but counterterrorism professionals are keenly aware of this problem, which is hardly new. Ever since al Qaeda's Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on New York City's twin towers and the Pentagon, the federal government, led by ICE (which was created during post-9/11 security reforms), has made weeding out terrorists and extremists entering the U.S. a key mission. 

How well are they doing?  

It would be unwise to assume that the relative paucity of domestic terrorist attacks inside this country perpetrated by foreigners over the last two decades, much less the lack of large-scale attacks, can be attributed mainly to ICE's excellence. At least as significant a factor here is how competent the FBI has become at thwarting terrorist attacks inside the U.S. The FBI is greatly helped in its efforts to stop attacks “left of boom,” as the pros say, by the commonplace lack of competence and operational security among would-be terrorists. 

Take the fresh case of Abdullah Haji Zada, an 18-year-old Afghan national. This month, he pleaded guilty to his role in a jihadist terrorist plot to shoot up voting sites in Oklahoma City on last year's Election Day. Zada, who was legally in the U.S., agreed as part of his plea deal to be removed from the country and return to Afghanistan at the end of his prison sentence.

This plot, which was to be executed on behalf of the Islamic State, involved another Afghan national, 27-year-old Nasir Ahmad Tawhedi, who was admitted to the U.S. as a refugee not long after the 2001 fall of Kabul to the Taliban. Tawhedi, who is awaiting trial, was employed in his native country by the CIA as a security guard. It was reported that Tawhedi passed two security checks, so either the CIA missed his radicalization or Tawhedi embraced violent extremism while he was in the U.S.

The good news is that the FBI stopped this murderous plot early. As usual, the terrorists were sloppy in their planning. However, nothing in this case inspires confidence in federal vetting of immigrants. Clearly, ICE and partner agencies must do better — but how? 

It's time to dispense with niceties and euphemisms. The terrorist-extremist threat we face from immigrants comes overwhelmingly from the Muslim world. There will be outliers — for example, the ICE arrest last week of Harpreet Singh, a Sikh extremist and one of India's most wanted men. But from any profiling aspect, the strong majority of extremists we need to prevent from becoming immigrants are Muslims with radical views. 

It's not enough to keep out Islamic State fans. No visa applicant is going to admit terrorist membership anyway. It's time for ICE to ban the Muslim Brotherhood and its fronts. That's been the preeminent Sunni extremist organization for nearly a century and a top terrorism incubator worldwide. If you want to live in an Islamist theocracy, as the Brotherhood seeks, you're not a good fit with American values. This is particularly true now, when Brotherhood-linked groups have played a leading role in harassing and intimidating Jews on American college campuses.  

IS THERE ANY HOPE OF A NONPARTISAN FUTURE FOR OUR PLANET?

Moreover, banning the Brotherhood is a perfectly mainstream concept in Muslim countries, several of which have long banned the group on security grounds. Jordan, a close U.S. ally and intelligence partner, joined the list last week by banning the Muslim Brotherhood and its fronts due to their involvement in terrorism. Why, then, does the U.S. invite Muslim Brotherhood members to immigrate and operate freely here?

A surprise victory by Pakistani Chinese-made jet fighters in an air battle with Western-made Indian aircraft has triggered alarm in the global defense industry.

The opening of hostilities on Wednesday morning between India and Pakistan saw one of the largest air battles in modern history, with Pakistan emerging the victor. U.S. officials told Reuters that Chinese-made Pakistani J-10 aircraft shot down French-made Indian Rafale jets with Chinese PL-15 air-to-air missiles. The incident is the first time a Rafale has been shot down and the first time a J-10 has downed another aircraft.

Though the J-10 was introduced in 2004, China's lack of direct foreign engagements means it has never seen a combat deployment prior to Wednesday. The fact that its first combat deployment witnessed its triumph over its western equivalent is likely to serve as a major boost to the Chinese defense industry.

The J-10 and Rafale are considered Generation 4.5 fighters, equivalent to the U.S. F-16 and F/A-18.

Islamabad was quick to boast of its victory.

“Not Just Defence — It's Dominance in the Skies! Pakistan Shatters the Rafale's Streak of Invincibility with Unmatched Precision and Readiness, Becoming the First Ever Force to Shoot Down Rafale Jet Since Its Combat Debut in 2001. A Historic Blow to the Indian Air Force,” the Government of Pakistan X account said.

The shock of the victory over the Chinese hardware over its western counterpart was quickly reflected in the stock market, with the Eurasian Times reporting that stocks for the J-10C producer, Avic Chengdu Aircraft Co. Ltd., shot up by 36% in two sessions, while the stock of the Rafale producer, Dassault Aviation, fell 1.64-5%.

“Air warfare communities in China, the U.S. and a number of European countries will be extremely interested to try and get as much ground truth as they can on tactics, techniques, procedures, what kit was used, what worked and what didn't,” Douglas Barrie, senior fellow for military aerospace at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, told Reuters.

Of equal focus to the jets were the missiles they were carrying. Analysts speculate that each side used its most advanced missiles, with the Pakistanis using the Chinese PL-15 air-to-air missile and the Indians using the European Meteor air-to-air missile. The PL-15 appears to have emerged at the top of the engagement, downing at least three fighters, compared to no Pakistani fighters downed.

Pakistan's Foreign Minister claimed that its fighters only targeted Indian jets that fired first, limiting the number of Indian aircraft downed.

“This is why only five jets were taken down. Had the directive been different, nearly 10-12 jets would have been struck,” he alleged.

The engagement is a wake-up call for the Western defense industry, which has long been unsure about the viability of Chinese weapons.

“You have arguably China's most capable weapon against the West's most capable weapon, if indeed it was being carried; we don't know that,” Barrie said.

A Western industry expert told the outlet that the engagement showed the capabilities of the PL-15 “may be greater than was thought.”

“The PL-15 is a big problem. It is something that the U.S. military pays a lot of attention to,” a defense industry executive added to Reuters.

Debris showcased by Indian officials and shared on social media appears to confirm that at least one of the shoot-downs was done by a PL-15. Another intact PL-15 was recovered and showed off by Indian authorities.

Scant confirmed details remain regarding the Wednesday engagement, but one senior Pakistani security source told CNN that the dogfight was the “largest and longest in recent aviation history,” involving roughly 125 aircraft over an hour period. Opposing aircraft fired missiles at targets sometimes over 100 miles away.

Part of the reason for the long distance was the unwillingness of either aircraft to cross over the border, with a smaller dogfight between the powers in 2019 causing the downing of one Indian Air Force pilot in Pakistan, who was then paraded on TV. The source said that both sides were afraid of a similar humiliation.

The engagement was the first since India and Pakistan upgraded their air fleets; the last flare-up in hostilities in February 2019 featured engagements between older Pakistani F-16s and JF-17s and older Indian Mirage 2000s and MiG-21s. Though Pakistan has also modernized its F-16s since, the aircraft didn't take part in Wednesday's engagement.

The victory of the J-10 is likely to boost China's defense industry across the globe. The Eurasian Times reported that Uzbekistan is currently deciding between purchasing the J-10 and Rafale to modernize its air force. Egypt is allegedly interested in the J-10 as well.

Chinese social media users mocked the Indians over their loss, with one group posting a video to social media showing people dressed up as Indians bemoaning their loss of the aircraft.

So now Chinese are mocking India for losing Rafale fighter jets. This video is going viral on Chinese TikTok. 😀 pic.twitter.com/m7q27JAP5U

VANCE URGES NONINTERVENTION WITH INDIA AND PAKISTAN AS CONFLICT ESCALATES WITH MASS DRONE ATTACKS

Wars between allied countries are often used as a testing ground for opposing defense industries. During the Cold War, the U.S. and Soviet defense industries used Israel and its Arab opponents as testing grounds to view their weapons' performance before a hypothetical hot conflict.

The same pattern appears to be repeated in India-Pakistan, with the United States and China eager to view how Chinese weapons would perform in a possible war over Taiwan.

President Donald Trump wants to boost domestic manufacturing, but one sector has already massively increased output — of bogus news stories by hostile and biased media.

High productivity of superficial, misleading, and hostile “news” has always characterized Trump's 10 years in politics. But it's worth examining afresh because the 2024 election briefly encouraged hope that media shock might stop the news rot.

“Resistance” news outlets might have noted widespread revulsion at their maxim, “Don't let the facts get in the way of a story,” and repented. But after a couple of months' dismay that people prefer Republicans to run Washington, quiescent news organizations have rededicated themselves to “enterprise” stories — spinning thin and speculative yarns rather than telling people what's happening.

When Trump appeared on NBC News's Meet the Press with Kristen Welker, the big story was him responding, “I don't know,” after Welker asked, “Don't you need to uphold the Constitution?”

This was amid discussion of illegal immigrants' due process rights. Trump noted the difficulty of giving millions of illegal migrants court hearings, which would be used to stall their deportation — “a million or 2 million or 3 million trials.” It would take centuries, and Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama weren't similarly hobbled. Trump told Welker he'd rely on White House lawyers to interpret Supreme Court rulings.

Welker: “Your secretary of state says everyone who's here, citizens and noncitizens, deserve due process. Do you agree, Mr. President?”

Trump: “I don't know, I'm not a lawyer. I don't know. … I was elected to get them the hell out of here, and the courts are holding me from doing it.”

Welker: “But even given those numbers that you're talking about, don't you need to uphold the Constitution …”

Trump: “I don't know. I have to respond by saying, again, I have brilliant lawyers … and they are going to obviously follow what the Supreme Court said. What you said is not what I heard the Supreme Court said. They have a different interpretation.”

So Trump would follow Supreme Court rulings — i.e., uphold the Constitution — but his lawyers don't think the court agrees with Welker's implication that this means illegal immigrants get millions of trials. In short, there is debate about what process is their due.

A news outlet seeking to inform viewers rather than generate gasps of disbelief might follow up, “Mr. President, to be clear, are you saying you don't know if due process requires court hearings for each illegal immigrant, or that you don't know if you should uphold the Constitution?”

That was never going to happen. Instead, NBC and Welker thought, “Gotcha!” and ignited days of outrage from those who make a living being outraged over Trump, accusing him of not respecting and planning to break the Constitution.

TROUBLE AT THE NORTHERN BORDER 

The response of the ineffable Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) was typical. He commented on X that our “un-American” president “admitted” he didn't know if he should uphold the Constitution. No, no, he really didn't.

Trump invites this sort of disingenuousness sometimes by deliberately goading the Left, sometimes by speaking without lawyerly precision and care despite knowing their malevolence and cynicism. But the news media also have a responsibility to find out what is true rather than feed their appetite to be baited. They want what stirs people up, not what is real.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:washingtonexaminer.com","Former Supreme Court Justice David Souter dies at 85","https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/3406507/former-supreme-court-justice-david-souter-dies/","Fri, 09 May 2025 13:52:13 GMT","

Former Supreme Court Justice David Souter died “peacefully at home in New Hampshire” on Thursday, the high court announced Friday. He was 85.

Then-President George H.W. Bush appointed Souter to the court in 1990 after the long-serving Supreme Court Justice William J. Brennan Jr. stepped down.

Chief Justice John Roberts honored Souter in a statement. “Justice David Souter served our Court with great distinction for nearly twenty years. He brought uncommon wisdom and kindness to a lifetime of public service. After retiring to his beloved New Hampshire in 2009, he continued to render significant service to our branch by sitting regularly on the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit for more than a decade. He will be greatly missed,” he said.

Souter voted with the moderate wing of the court and often aligned with Democratic-appointed Supreme Court justices during his tenure, from 1990 to 2009. He voted to affirm Roe v. Wade in the 1992 Planned Parenthood v. Casey case.

Souter's 2009 retirement also made way for Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who is part of the court's Democratic-appointed wing and was appointed by former President Barack Obama.

The announcement of his death detailed that Souter “participated in civics education curriculum reform efforts in New Hampshire during his retirement.”

TRUMP'S VOW TO USE ‘IMPOUNDMENT' SETS UP SUPREME COURT CLASH

The former justice spent most of his legal career in his home state of New Hampshire. Souter was attorney general of the state from 1976 to 1978 before becoming a Supreme Court justice for the state's high court from 1978 to 1990. He then became a judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the 1st Circuit in 1990, shortly before his confirmation as a Supreme Court justice.

The Senate voted him in with a 90-9 vote, with only Democrats voting in opposition. A Democrat and adviser to the Senate Judiciary Committee, Walter Dellinger, called him “the most intellectually impressive nominee I've ever seen.”","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

McKEESPORT, Pennsylvania — Take the left off of Nessley Avenue after climbing the switchback up from this city's once-thriving downtown business district. For the next three blocks, you'll find yourself on the brick-paved portion of Jefferson Street.

Despite the impact weather has had on the bricks, giving them a wavy appearance, it adds a unique charm and character to the street, which is lined almost exclusively with tidy midcentury red brick homes. That is with the exception of one stone home on the slope side of the street with an architectural style that sets it apart from the rest.

Built in 1940, it was the home of Michael and Maryann LaCivita. For the first 12 years of Chris LaCivita's life, this neighborhood was his everything. It was where he and his four brothers were born. It was the neighborhood where he would go to school and church, deliver the newspaper, play football with the other children, and build a snow-shoveling business with his brothers.

This is the place that formed Chris LaCivita, who, along with Susie Wiles, led President Donald Trump‘s winning campaign last year.

It took a while for LaCivita to realize how this background and rootedness guided him throughout his political career. Sitting at the head of the table of honor at the Wyndham Hotel in downtown Pittsburgh with his mother beside him, LaCivita was humbled by the attention from local Republicans as he received an award from Sen. David McCormick (R-PA) at the Allegheny County GOP's annual Lincoln Day Dinner.

He was a little out of sorts about a profile being written about him. “I just want to go on the record to say I hate profiles,” he said.

LaCivita is the second oldest of five boys. His father was a public relations executive with Equitable Gas, and his mother was a stay-at-home mom. His parents surrounded the boys with grandparents, aunts, uncles, and cousins, all living within miles of each other.

“Sunday, there was a routine. You would go to Mass, and if it wasn't during Steelers football season, you'd go to Mass and then we would go visit one of my dad's sisters, which there were plenty of them, or at my grandmother's for Sunday supper,” he said.

LaCivita described his grandmother as “this tiny little Italian lady that barely spoke a word of English.” After she died, the family would do Sunday supper at one of his relatives' homes. “And that was quite the thing because my mom and dad were bringing in three boys, then four boys, then five boys. So you can imagine,” he said. “And it was always a big lunch or a big dinner, and that's what we did on Sundays.”

LaCivita said that even at the time, he understood it was a good childhood. “My mom was home,” he said. “My dad was at work in the summer months. We spent all of our time at McKeesport High School playing football or basketball. It's just what we did from sunrise to sunset.”

Every once in a while, they spent the day at Kennywood Park, a local amusement park on a ridge just across the Edgar Thomson Steel Works that was filled with old wooden rollercoasters, bumper cars, and cavernous pavilions.

“When my kids were old enough to appreciate it, the first thing I did was take them, too, and of course, they had more fun at Kennywood than they did at Disney World,” he said. “Oh, my God. And then we'd go to Pirates games. I was an altar boy at St. Pius and an altar boy at St. Mary's German.”

It was the mid-1970s, and the first sign of economic trouble was about to hit McKeesport. The Roman Catholic parish right by LaCivita's home closed at the end of his first year of grade school. It was once a thriving city, significant enough that President John F. Kennedy campaigned there in 1962. The downtown also boasted two large multilevel department stores, a luxury hotel, restaurants, supper clubs, and numerous specialized retail shops.

The world around LaCivita began to change. His father lost his job, several of his aunts and uncles died, and the community was hurting. The mills began to close, forcing people to move. Nearly 18% of the city's residents left, eventually including the LaCivitas. This fracturing of place happened across the Rust Belt for decades.

“First of all, we were moving to Virginia, and the only thing I knew about Virginia was what I saw on the television, and well, that was The Waltons,” LaCivita said. “Oh, and they did not have a football team.”

 LaCivita is constantly moving. This was true back when he was in school, too.

“I was a horrible student. Horrible student,” he admitted with a smile. “I don't know what it was. I just wasn't interested a whole lot. Just wasn't interested. I didn't get in trouble. I just was bored, I guess. I would read like crazy, but I just wasn't particularly interested in schoolwork.”

“I bombed my SATs. I mean, I started working when I was 15,” he added. “I spent my summers cutting people's grass, winters shoveling snow, cleaning people's gutters. I was always looking to make a buck. Always moving. But studying for SATs? No. That wasn't me.”

That's not all. “I delivered newspapers. Cleaned gutters. Cut massive lawns, and that was before high school,” he said. “Then, I got a job during high school working at Kings Dominion until I graduated. I worked rides and that kind of stuff at the amusement park with my older brother. And I worked at a steakhouse, washing dishes. I was also a stock boy at Food Lion, the night shift. I did everything, a little bit of everything.”

LaCivita said he always knew he was conservative, but he was never very political. That all changed as he was staggering through undergraduate studies at Virginia Commonwealth University in the late 1980s. He was disillusioned. He wasn't being challenged. Worse, he felt like he was being told what to think.

Then, a political science professor suggested that the government should be in charge of healthcare, which led to a robust debate. LaCivita eventually pursued a master's in public administration.

“So, at the time, I was somewhat active with politics, quasi-affiliated, but not really with the College Republicans,” he said, adding, “I'd go to their events basically to drink their beer and to meet the girls. It was my Marine buddies and I — that's what we would do. We'd go to CR stuff, not to be CRs, but to hang out and go to all their parties.”

The next thing that changed everything was that his Marine unit got activated for the Persian Gulf War while he was in graduate school.

LaCivita left for the war on New Year's Day 1991, returning five months later with a Purple Heart. He had been shot in the face on his mother's birthday.

LaCivita described the moment as a “pissing match with a bunch of Iraqis” in which his unit took direct fire. The scars on his face where he was hit left him with nerve damage. The Kevlar jacket likely saved his life when he took a hit from shrapnel, leaving him with three cracked ribs instead.

“I really had no idea of what I was going to do, was going to go back to school, and my energy level was like a hundred times more,” LaCivita said of his return home. “I couldn't sleep. I couldn't concentrate. There was a lot of things I couldn't do.”

So, LaCivita found an outlet. His father had a friend who was running for the board of supervisors and needed help with his race: “Dad said, ‘He is going to give you $500 and $50 for expenses.' And I said, ‘OK.'” That candidate was George Allen, who won and went on to run for Congress in a special election.

“Here is the thing: I went from a board of supervisors race straight into a congressional race, and I knew who George Allen was, but I did not know that he was running for Congress. I just thought he was running for reelection,” he said of his upgrade from a local race to the big times.

Allen won that race, too. LaCivita then got his first taste of Washington, D.C., after taking a job in Allen's congressional office. “I spent 14 months in Washington as a legislative assistant,” LaCivita said. “Loved it, thought it was the coolest thing. And then George got redistricted out of his House seat, and he ran for governor.”

LaCivita married his college sweetheart, Catherine, and had two children. He would go on to have his hand in numerous successful and some not-so-successful political races over the next 25 years. He was the political director of the Senate GOP's campaign arm, was the principal media adviser for the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth, and reshaped Republican politics with few people knowing his name. Until the fall of 2022, when Susie Wiles came calling.

Wiles, who did not know LaCivita at the time other than by his take-no-prisoners reputation, was looking for a certain kind of person to work with the Trump team. LaCivita fit that bill. “He's done every blue-collar job that could possibly be. He's worked in a factory. He's been a waiter. He grew up in a family where his dad worked for the government,” she said. “So, he understands that pretty uniquely, too. Just the culture of the bureaucracy and how corrosive it could be. There's not much he hasn't done. He's been a Marine for heaven's sake.”

“When the president decided to run [in the 2024 race], he said to me, ‘Well, you ran Florida, and you won and you've been doing great,'” referring to her overseeing his successful Florida operation in 2016 and 2020.

“'I think you should run the whole thing this time, but you're not a ‘blank' and you need to go find me one,'” Wiles said. “And so I thought, ‘OK, well, I mean, this is sort of a big deal for me,' so I called my best friend in politics, Tony Fabrizio, and told him this is what the president wants.”

Fabrizio didn't miss a beat. “He said, ‘I got the guy, can you come to dinner next Thursday?'” Wiles said. “And by now, I thought I knew everybody at politics in our level, and I knew Chris by name, but I had never met him.”

Wiles and LaCivita had what they now laughingly call work “dates” with Fabrizio in the mix to see if they clicked. “When I decided we did, then I invited him to meet the president. He comes to Mar-a-Lago, goes out and buys a new suit, got his shoes shined, and comes for dinner.”

It wasn't a perfect first meeting. It was just one of those days when Trump was not happy. “And I said to the president, ‘Well, Chris made the Swift Boat ads,'” Wiles said. “And [Trump] said, ‘Everybody says they made the Swift Boat ads. You didn't make the Swift Boat ads. Everybody claims credit for that.'”

Wiles said she approached Trump again a few days later about LaCivita. “I really think he's the guy,” she said. Trump told her, “If that's what you want, it's fine with me. Just do it.”

“Chris walked in the door, thinking he was going to have another dinner, hopefully more pleasant,” Wiles said. “And the president said, ‘Look, she wants you. If she wants you, I want you. Susie, you go negotiate the money thing and welcome him to the team.'”

“That was it,” she added. “And when you think about it, it's such a Donald Trump thing.”

LaCivita was working on Sen. Ron Johnson's (R-WI) reelection bid. He came on board right after that race ended.

LaCivita and Wiles are opposites in many ways, yet their partnership worked. “That's what I know best in politics, particularly at the level we just finished,” Wiles said. “I don't think it's ever happened before where there was really a partnership that worked, and he likes and is good at everything I'm not, and I like and am good at everything he's not.”

Wiles said presidential campaigns are “just so big and so multifaceted that it's hard for me to conceive of one person really doing it all by themselves.”

So, it was just common sense that they became co-campaign managers.

“But it could have gone wrong in many ways. And it did not,” Wiles said. “In fact, we are better friends today than when we started.”

As an observer who saw the two of them dozens of times on the campaign  you could see their genuine respect and affection for each other. It was something you never see in the politics business.

Wiles laughed. “No, you don't. And he doesn't want anybody to know it,” she said. “He has a gentle side. He doesn't want anybody to know that he is a wonderful husband. His wife, Catherine, is fantastic. He's a great dad. He's very proud of his children. And so those kinds of values we both share.”

LaCivita and Wiles spent much of their time together with Trump. But on July 13, Wiles was with Trump as he headed to Butler, Pennsylvania. LaCivita was in Milwaukee, where Trump was heading the next day to commence the Republican National Convention. Then came the assassination attempt that changed everything.

LaCivita was watching the rally in his hotel suite but was distracted by a staffer with a minor crisis. His door was open so staff could go in and out as needed. LaCivita's daughter Victoria, who was working the convention, burst through the door to tell him Trump had been shot.

LaCivita has a reputation for being stoic in emergencies. He quickly assessed the situation — yes, there was blood trickling down the side of Trump's face, but he was standing, so that was a good sign. LaCivita watched the Secret Service agent who had grabbed the ex-president by the collar, and he seemed calm — another good sign.

LaCivita quickly dialed Wiles. “What the hell?”

Wiles, who was getting into the car with Trump as they headed to the hospital, promised to call back.

It took two hours for them to connect. “We ultimately go back to the FBO, and it looks like we're in the middle of a war zone,” Wiles said. “Everybody has their long gun drawn, and people that I know and they know me are looking at me funny. It was a strange environment.”

“He's sobbing, sobbing,” Wiles said of her phone call with LaCivita. “He knew that the president was OK. But he was guilt-ridden that he wasn't there.”

LaCivita said his friendship with Wiles had only strengthened in the six months since the campaign ended.

LaCivita recently visited Wiles, now the White House chief of staff, in the West Wing. He did things he could not imagine while growing up on Jefferson Street. It was a pinch-yourself moment, LaCivita admitted, the culmination of a 35-year career.

“And to be just a small part of that, and then to be able to go to the White House and talk with the president and at the Oval next to the Resolute desk, and then the ride on Air Force One, those are such amazing, rare opportunities for any person,” he said.

LaCivita said Allen once told him while passing the illuminated Capitol dome on their way back from a reception, “If that view ever stops giving you goose bumps, it's time to get out.”

“I've never stopped getting goose bumps,” LaCivita said.

The ballroom at the Wyndham was packed to the rafters, with over 800 people coming to see McCormick honor LaCivita for his accomplishment. Just before LaCivita was called up to accept the honors, Trump's familiar face appeared at the center of the room on a screen, sitting at the Resolute desk.

“Chris, I know firsthand that you are an absolute warrior, an exceptional patriot, one of the greatest fighters in American politics, and I will tell you, you were by my side, and we won the presidency. That's all we can say that has to be said. Other than that, of course, you've learned how to fight from the very best: the United States Marine Corps. You bravely served our nation in uniform, and as of last July, we now have something in common: We have both taken a bullet for our country. But I want to thank you not only for your extraordinary service on our campaign, which was just leadership and brilliance, but to take back the White House. We did something very special. It was decades of political trenches fighting to defend America, and you learned a lot, and you gave me that knowledge. You should be incredibly proud of all you've accomplished. It's an honor to call you a friend, and really was an unbelievable honor to work with you toward our big victory in the presidency. Congratulations. Enjoy yourself and have a great life.”

LaCivita's mother reached over to hold his hand. A wave of emotion washed over his face.

“I would've never expected anything like that. I am a professional,” LaCivita said. “Everyone likes to be thanked. I don't have to be, and the thanks is in accomplishing the mission and being a part of a team of people and the lasting friendships that I have — those are the most important things to me.”

FETTERMAN'S REAL SICKNESS FOR THE LEFT? ISRAEL-ITIS 

“It was that much more touching for my mother to be able to experience it as well because I'm sure there were times in her life where she probably didn't know what I was doing,” he added.

LaCivita acknowledged, “Politics is a very tough, rough, and tumble business, and you don't often get to share these kinds of moments with anyone the older you get. It's harder and harder to find those opportunities to be able to share them with your parents.”

“And if you have your parents, you're lucky,” he added. “I just have my mother now, but I know my dad is extremely proud.”

President Donald Trump's return to the White House is reviving a push to defund Planned Parenthood, with abortion opponents seeing a rare chance to pass the language through Republicans' sweeping budget bill.

Conservatives have tried for years to strip federal funding from the abortion provider, only to see their efforts fall short in Congress or reversed when administrations change hands.

With limited exceptions, federal law already bars taxpayer dollars from being used for abortions, but the organization receives hundreds of millions of dollars in Medicaid reimbursements that anti-abortion groups want blocked as well.

Planned Parenthood also provides contraception and health services, such as STD screenings, that qualify under the program.

Trump has begun to pull some funding for Planned Parenthood. Last month, the administration froze tens of millions in Title X dollars directed to family planning centers, targeting Planned Parenthood affiliates in several states.

But anti-abortion activists see reconciliation, a budget process that allows Republicans to sidestep the filibuster, as the best avenue to pursue a broader and longer-lasting prohibition. Trump pursued a similar freeze in his first term that was reversed by former President Joe Biden.

Outside groups such as Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America have been engaging with lawmakers one-on-one while also applying public pressure. In March, hundreds of activists visited congressional offices in the House and Senate in a Washington lobbying blitz.

There are signs those groups will find opposition from a crop of centrist Republicans uncomfortable with defunding the organization.

Swing district lawmakers such as Rep. Mike Lawler (R-NY) have already begun to air concerns, throwing into doubt whether the language will be included in the GOP megabill, which sweeps together Trump's tax, border, and energy priorities. The Energy and Commerce Committee, which has jurisdiction over Medicaid, has yet to release its legislative text ahead of a Tuesday markup.

Yet Republicans, by and large, support defunding Planned Parenthood, arguing the Medicaid funding indirectly supports its abortion procedures. 

A week ago, Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) promised the House will “redirect funds away from big abortion” through reconciliation. Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-SD) has also aligned himself with the anti-abortion movement, attending this year's March for Life with Johnson in January.

“We know that this is achievable,” said Kelsey Pritchard, a spokeswoman for Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America.

“We've got the Republican trifecta, we've got strong pro-life leaders in the House and the Senate, and basically what we've heard is that people are enthused overall to get this done,” she added.

The first step will come next week, when the Energy and Commerce Committee holds a hearing to sign off on its portion of the megabill. 

The lion's share of the controversy has focused on separate Medicaid reforms, with fiscal hawks seeking to roll back the generous federal subsidies offered to expansion states, but Planned Parenthood could become another flashpoint if the legislation includes defunding language.

Committee Republicans would then have to reject any Democratic attempts to strip the provision from the underlying bill.

The language could also threaten its passage on the House floor, though it's unclear how deep concerns run among centrist Republicans. Rep. Don Bacon (R-NE) is open to defunding Planned Parenthood as part of reconciliation, telling the Washington Examiner that “a lot of folks don't like their taxpayer money going to the largest abortion provider in the country.”

Rep. Jeff Van Drew (R-NJ) is also receptive. Both lawmakers have caused headaches for GOP leadership, vowing in the reconciliation fight to oppose any bill that deeply cuts Medicaid benefits.

Ultimately, unease over Planned Parenthood defunding could be dwarfed by bigger fights over the bill. In addition to Medicaid, blue-state Republicans are bartering for an expansion of SALT, a tax deduction that tends to help higher-income earners.

But Republicans could face pressure in their districts from Planned Parenthood and its allied groups. They have run ads accusing Republicans of attempting to strip healthcare from women during past defunding attempts.

In a statement, the organization promised to “fight like hell” to make sure its funding is preserved. Last year, 34% of its revenue fell under the umbrella of “government health services reimbursements & grants.”

“Federal Medicaid funds don't pay for abortion except in rare exceptions, but that's not stopping these lawmakers from going after Planned Parenthood,” said Alexis McGill Johnson, president and CEO of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund. “They're set on depriving patients, particularly people who already have the hardest time getting healthcare, of access to affordable cancer screenings, birth control, STI testing and treatment, and many other essential reproductive healthcare services.”

So far, Planned Parenthood has survived GOP attempts at defunding. In 2011, the House passed the provision in a fight over government funding, but the language was removed ahead of a shutdown deadline.

The measure even made it to then-President Barack Obama's desk in 2016 but was vetoed.

With unified control of Washington, anti-abortion activists have renewed that push, describing it as their “first priority” with Trump's reelection. But the Senate will pose a challenge regardless of which party is in charge.

The Senate, too, has GOP centrists who are expected to oppose the provision. Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME) hasn't explicitly drawn a red line, but she and Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) have a long track record of voting to protect the organization.

Both unsuccessfully tried to remove the defunding language when it came before the Senate in late 2015.

“I'm going to wait and see what the full package is rather than singling out individual provisions,” Collins told reporters on Tuesday.

MIKE WALTZ BEGINS UN NOMINATION OUTREACH WITH CALLS TO SENATE ALLIES

The strict rules of budget reconciliation pose a second hurdle for anti-abortion groups. In 2017, the last time Republicans had unified control, the parliamentarian ruled the defunding language must be struck from their Obamacare repeal legislation.

If Republicans' budget bill fails this time, as it did with Obamacare repeal, they would likely have to wait for the next fiscal year to make another push through reconciliation.

How the “opinionated” chatbots destroyed AI's potential, and how we can fix it

Produced by ElevenLabs and  News Over Audio (Noa) using AI narration. Listen to more stories on the Noa app.

Recently, after an update that was supposed to make ChatGPT “better at guiding conversations toward productive outcomes,” according to release notes from OpenAI, the bot couldn't stop telling users how brilliant their bad ideas were. ChatGPT reportedly told one person that their plan to sell literal “shit on a stick” was “not just smart—it's genius.”



Many more examples cropped up, and OpenAI rolled back the product in response, explaining in a blog post that “the update we removed was overly flattering or agreeable—often described as sycophantic.” The company added that the chatbot's system would be refined and new guardrails would be put into place to avoid “uncomfortable, unsettling” interactions. (The Atlantic recently entered into a corporate partnership with OpenAI.)



But this was not just a ChatGPT problem. Sycophancy is a common feature of chatbots: A 2023 paper by researchers from Anthropic found that it was a “general behavior of state-of-the-art AI assistants,” and that large language models sometimes sacrifice “truthfulness” to align with a user's views. Many researchers see this phenomenon as a direct result of the “training” phase of these systems, where humans rate a model's responses to fine-tune the program's behavior. The bot sees that its evaluators react more favorably when their views are reinforced—and when they're flattered by the program—and shapes its behavior accordingly.



The specific training process that seems to produce this problem is known as “Reinforcement Learning From Human Feedback” (RLHF). It's a variety of machine learning, but as recent events show, that might be a bit of a misnomer. RLHF now seems more like a process by which machines learn humans, including our weaknesses and how to exploit them. Chatbots tap into our desire to be proved right or to feel special.



Reading about sycophantic AI, I've been struck by how it mirrors another problem. As I've written previously, social media was imagined to be a vehicle for expanding our minds, but it has instead become a justification machine, a place for users to reassure themselves that their attitude is correct despite evidence to the contrary. Doing so is as easy as plugging into a social feed and drinking from a firehose of “evidence” that proves the righteousness of a given position, no matter how wrongheaded it may be. AI now looks to be its own kind of justification machine—more convincing, more efficient, and therefore even more dangerous than social media.

Read: The internet is worse than a brainwashing machine

This is effectively by design. Chatbots have been set up by companies to create the illusion of sentience; they express points of view and have “personalities.” OpenAI reportedly gave GPT-4o the system prompt to “match the user's vibe.” These design decisions may allow for more natural interactions with chatbots, but they also pull us to engage with these tools in unproductive and potentially unsafe ways—young people forming unhealthy attachments to chatbots, for example, or users receiving bad medical advice from them.



OpenAI's explanation about the ChatGPT update suggests that the company can effectively adjust some dials and turn down the sycophancy. But even if that were so, OpenAI wouldn't truly solve the bigger problem, which is that opinionated chatbots are actually poor applications of AI. Alison Gopnik, a researcher who specializes in cognitive development, has proposed a better way of thinking about LLMs: These systems aren't companions or nascent intelligences at all. They're “cultural technologies”—tools that enable people to benefit from the shared knowledge, expertise, and information gathered throughout human history. Just as the introduction of the printed book or the search engine created new systems to get the discoveries of one person into the mind of another, LLMs consume and repackage huge amounts of existing knowledge in ways that allow us to connect with ideas and manners of thinking we might otherwise not encounter. In this framework, a tool like ChatGPT should evince no “opinions” at all but instead serve as a new interface to the knowledge, skills, and understanding of others.

This is similar to the original vision of the web, first conceived by Vannevar Bush in his 1945 Atlantic article “As We May Think.” Bush, who oversaw America's research efforts during World War II, imagined a system that would allow researchers to see all relevant annotations others had made on a document. His “memex” wouldn't provide clean, singular answers. Instead, it would contextualize information within a rich tapestry of related knowledge, showing connections, contradictions, and the messy complexity of human understanding. It would expand our thinking and understanding by connecting us to relevant knowledge and context in the moment, in ways a card catalog or a publication index could never do. It would let the information we need find us.

From the July 1945 issue: As we may think

Gopnik makes no prescriptive claims in her analysis, but when we think of AI in this way, it becomes evident that in seeking opinions from AI itself, we are not tapping into its true power. Take the example of proposing a business idea—whether a good or bad one. The model, whether it's ChatGPT, Gemini, or something else, has access to an inconceivable amount of information about how to think through business decisions. It can access different decision frameworks, theories, and parallel cases, and apply those to a decision in front of the user. It can walk through what an investor would likely note in their plan, showing how an investor might think through an investment and sourcing those concerns to various web-available publications. For a nontraditional idea, it can also pull together some historical examples of when investors were wrong, with some summary on what qualities big investor misses have shared. In other words, it can organize the thoughts, approaches, insights, and writings of others for a user in ways that both challenge and affirm their vision, without advancing any opinion that is not grounded and linked to the statements, theories, or practices of identifiable others.

Early iterations of ChatGPT and similar systems didn't merely fail to advance this vision—they were incapable of achieving it. They produced what I call “information smoothies”: the knowledge of the world pulverized into mathematical relationships, then reassembled into smooth, coherent-sounding responses that couldn't be traced to their sources. This technical limitation made the chatbot-as-author metaphor somewhat unavoidable. The system couldn't tell you where its ideas came from or whose practice it was mimicking even if its creators had wanted it to.

But the technology has evolved rapidly over the past year or so. Today's systems can incorporate real-time search and use increasingly sophisticated methods for “grounding”—connecting AI outputs to specific, verifiable knowledge and sourced analysis. They can footnote and cite, pulling in sources and perspectives not just as an afterthought but as part of their exploratory process; links to outside articles are now a common feature. My own research in this space suggests that with proper prompting, these systems can begin to resemble something like Vannevar Bush's idea of the memex. Looking at any article, claim, item, or problem in front of us, we can seek advice and insight not from a single flattering oracle of truth but from a variety of named others, having the LLM sort out the points where there is little contention among people in the know and the points that are sites of more vigorous debate. More important, these systems can connect you to the sources and perspectives you weren't even considering, broadening your knowledge rather than simply reaffirming your position.

I would propose a simple rule: no answers from nowhere. This rule is less convenient, and that's the point. The chatbot should be a conduit for the information of the world, not an arbiter of truth. And this would extend even to areas where judgment is somewhat personal. Imagine, for example, asking an AI to evaluate your attempt at writing a haiku. Rather than pronouncing its “opinion,” it could default to explaining how different poetic traditions would view your work—first from a formalist perspective, then perhaps from an experimental tradition. It could link you to examples of both traditional haiku and more avant-garde poetry, helping you situate your creation within established traditions. In having AI moving away from sycophancy, I'm not proposing that the response be that your poem is horrible or that it makes Vogon poetry sound mellifluous. I am proposing that rather than act like an opinionated friend, AI would produce a map of the landscape of human knowledge and opinions for you to navigate, one you can use to get somewhere a bit better.

There's a good analogy in maps. Traditional maps showed us an entire landscape—streets, landmarks, neighborhoods—allowing us to understand how everything fit together. Modern turn-by-turn navigation gives us precisely what we need in the moment, but at a cost: Years after moving to a new city, many people still don't understand its geography. We move through a constructed reality, taking one direction at a time, never seeing the whole, never discovering alternate routes, and in some cases never getting the sense of place that a map-level understanding could provide. The result feels more fluid in the moment but ultimately more isolated, thinner, and sometimes less human.

For driving, perhaps that's an acceptable trade-off. Anyone who's attempted to read a paper map while navigating traffic understands the dangers of trying to comprehend the full picture mid-journey. But when it comes to our information environment, the dangers run in the opposite direction. Yes, AI systems that mindlessly reflect our biases back to us present serious problems and will cause real harm. But perhaps the more profound question is why we've decided to consume the combined knowledge and wisdom of human civilization through a straw of “opinion” in the first place.

The promise of AI was never that it would have good opinions. It was that it would help us benefit from the wealth of expertise and insight in the world that might never otherwise find its way to us—that it would show us not what to think but how others have thought and how others might think, where consensus exists and where meaningful disagreement continues. As these systems grow more powerful, perhaps we should demand less personality and more perspective. The stakes are high: If we fail, we may turn a potentially groundbreaking interface to the collective knowledge and skills of all humanity into just more shit on a stick.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

What Netanyahu describes as impending victory is a dive into the morass.

Produced by ElevenLabs and  News Over Audio (Noa) using AI narration. Listen to more stories on the Noa app.

After 19 months of war in Gaza, the Israeli government has decided to march deeper into the quagmire.

Israel has announced its intention to take and retain a significant part of the Gaza Strip. Call-up orders are going out to tens of thousands of already exhausted reservists. The battered, hungry population of Gaza is to be forced into an even smaller part of the narrow enclave. The lives of the remaining Israeli hostages are in greater danger than ever.

The plan came with a caveat: The escalation will reportedly not start until the end of U.S. President Donald Trump's tour of the region next week, allowing for the possibility of a new hostage deal. But reports of an impending deal have become such a constant background murmur that few observers count on a diplomatic breakthrough to head off the new operation.

“We will achieve full, absolute victory in Gaza,” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in Hebrew in a social-media clip just before the decision Sunday night by the security cabinet—the committee of senior ministers responsible for military affairs. “We are in the stages of victory,” Netanyahu added. Or, to paraphrase in American English: We can see the light at the end of the tunnel.

Read: How to say no to a would-be autocrat

For this Israeli, as for many others, the escalation is a promise to plunge deeper into darkness, militarily and morally.

The Israeli army will seek to take and hold more territory in Gaza and to “destroy all terror infrastructure, above- and belowground,” a government spokesperson said Monday. “Belowground” refers to Hamas's tunnel network, which has bedeviled the Israeli army since the war began. What will be left standing aboveground remains to be seen.

The spokesperson, David Mencer, said that the objective was both to “return the hostages”—the 59 captives, alive and dead, still in Gaza—and to defeat Hamas. But Netanyahu made the order of his priorities clear in a controversial speech last week: Freeing the hostages was “an important goal,” he said, but the “supreme goal” was victory over Hamas. Or, as he put it in another clip for his social-media followers this week, to drive Hamas “from the face of the Earth.”

Netanyahu has made this overambitious promise—of “absolute” triumph over Hamas—since early in the war, and has repeatedly said that it is around the corner. But total victory is a chimera. Reoccupying larger chunks of Gaza is unlikely to eliminate Hamas. Instead, it will expose Israel's soldiers to a long war of attrition with the extreme Islamist organization. Hamas's losses will mount, but this will not make the deaths on the Israeli side any easier to bear.

Israel's military doctrine relies on mobilizing large numbers of civilians to fight short wars. This war is no longer short, and many reservists have spent more time in uniform than in civvies since October 7, 2023. They, their families, and their workplaces are very tired. Netanyahu's government promises more exhaustion.

The Palestinian civilians of Gaza, of course, are much more exhausted and traumatized. In the name of protecting them, the Israeli army intends to order yet another evacuation, reportedly to a single “humanitarian zone” in the southern part of the Gaza Strip. Netanyahu said this week that the intention is for the army to continue to hold whatever territory it takes. Implicitly, then, Palestinian civilians won't be returning until the promised day when Hamas is erased—and maybe not even then.

If permanent displacement is the government's policy, the proper term for it is ethnic cleansing—a moral catastrophe.

And what will happen inside the “humanitarian zone”? The government reportedly has a plan for providing food aid via a largely unknown foundation and private security firms. Nothing has been reported about who will govern the area, provide health services, or enforce public order. If Israel were to try to impose a military government, soldiers would be under constant attack. Netanyahu has been unwilling to discuss proposals for creating a new Palestinian government in Gaza. Hamas is likely to fill the vacuum.

The security cabinet apparently paid little attention to this problem in setting its policy. It also reportedly ignored an explicit warning from the military chief of staff, General Eyal Zamir. “In the plan for a full-scale operation, we won't necessarily reach the hostages,” Zamir told ministers in a preparatory session before Sunday's decision, according to Israel's Channel 13. “Keep in mind that we could lose them.”

As of now, Israel's official count is that 21 hostages are still alive, the fate of three is unknown, and Hamas is holding the bodies of 35. Netanyahu insists that military pressure is the only way to save the remaining living hostages. But no hostages have been found or released since fighting resumed in March. A New York Times investigation concluded that 41 hostages have died in captivity since the war began, including at least four who were killed in Israeli bombings and seven who were murdered by their captors to keep Israeli troops from rescuing them. Those dangers will only increase if the fighting intensifies.

Read: Why 70 percent of Israelis want Netanyahu to resign

The gap between the Israeli public and the government is most stark on the hostage issue. A recent poll found that more than two-thirds of Israelis see saving the hostages as the most important goal in the war, compared with one-quarter who say that toppling Hamas is most important. Last month, nearly 1,000 current and former Air Force reservists signed a public letter calling on the government to reach an agreement immediately with Hamas to release the hostages and end the war. That set off a wave of statements by reservists and veterans of other units.

So far, Netanyahu has refused to change course. To do so would mean admitting that his promise of absolute victory is hollow. It could spark a revolt by the two far-right parties in his coalition, and bring down his government.

It's just possible, nonetheless, that Netanyahu will change his mind and finally respond to the fury and despair of his own people. Or that during his stops in Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Qatar, the erratic American president will hear something to persuade him to tell Netanyahu to hold his fire. Or that Hamas and Israel will agree to one of the latest proposals for a renewed cease-fire and hostage deal.

But if such a deus ex machina does not appear, there's every reason to fear that Israel will plunge deeper into the morass.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

﻿A former presidential candidate's dubious plan for winning back Republican zoomers.

by  Eric Levitz

Many liberals would like the Democratic Party to put climate change at the center of its messaging and policy agenda. They would also like Democrats to win more elections. In a recent column in the Washington Post, former Washington governor and presidential candidate Jay Inslee argued that there is no tension between these two objectives: The best way for Democrats to defeat Republicans is to focus more on bold climate action.

Inslee's case can be broken down into three claims:

Inslee is right that young voters swung hard against the Democratic Party in 2024. AP VoteCast, a high-quality exit poll, showed Kamala Harris winning voters under 30 by just 4 points. By contrast, Joe Biden won young voters by more than 20 points in 2020. And it's also true that young voters are more worried about climate change than older ones. 

Nevertheless, the evidence for Inslee's fundamental thesis — that the best way for Democrats to win back power is to focus more on climate — is weak. 

The problem with his argument is simple: Voters — both old and young — do not consider climate change a top priority. And focusing on an issue that voters care relatively little about isn't a great way to win their support.

Sign up here for more stories on the lessons liberals should take away from their election defeat — and a closer look at where they should go next. From senior correspondent Eric Levitz. 

When Gallup asked Americans last year which issues were most important to their vote, climate change ranked 21st out of the 22 issues tested — above transgender rights but below “relations with Russia.” A separate Gallup survey right before the election asked Americans to name their country's most important problem, and only 2 percent mentioned climate change or the environment. Similarly, in Pew's polling published in February on the biggest problems facing America today, climate change came in at 17th. 

In his op-ed, Inslee's prime concern is with winning over young voters, on the grounds that declining youth support for Democrats was “the dynamic that caused” Trump's election. But this is an overstatement. Democrats also lost ground with voters over 30 in 2024. And since older voters far outnumber younger ones, Democrats can't afford to give exclusive consideration to the latter's concerns.

This said, young voters' priorities aren't actually that distinct from the broader electorate's. According to AP VoteCast data — which Inslee himself cites — only 8 percent of young voters listed climate change as their No. 1 issue in 2024, while 40 percent named the economy and jobs. 

The share of younger voters who considered climate change a top three issue is more substantial. In Tufts University's post-election survey of the youth vote, 26 percent of respondents put climate as one of their top three priorities. Yet this still constitutes a small minority of the under-35 voting population. Notably, young Americans who did not cast a ballot in 2024 were especially unlikely to prioritize climate, with only 18 percent putting the issue in their top three. 

A proponent of Inslee's strategy might blame Democrats for the public's limited concern about climate change. After all, political parties have influence over which issues are and are not salient. If Democrats centered climate change in their messaging, perhaps voters would start prioritizing the issue. 

But there are a couple problems with this reasoning. First, as Inslee himself writes, Democrats did put climate at the center of their agenda under Biden, making “historic investments in clean energy” through the Inflation Reduction Act. And Biden and Harris spoke frequently about the need to combat the climate crisis. Yet none of this was sufficient to turn climate change into a top 15 issue for the American public. 

Second, and most critically, Americans are well aware that the Democratic Party deems climate change a policy priority. In January, when the New York Times and Ipsos asked voters to name the issues that are most important to Democrats, climate came in third. 

In other words, the party does not need to put greater emphasis on climate in order to convey its commitment to decarbonization — that message is already coming through. And last year, Harris won voters who considered climate change one of their top three issues by 70 points, according to Navigator Research.

The problem is simply that such voters aren't very numerous. This is a point that progressive donors and activists are liable to miss, since voters who prioritize climate change are heavily overrepresented in their social circles. According to polling from Democratic data firm Blue Rose research, wealthy and/or “very liberal” Democrats are much more likely than the broader public to name climate as a top concern. 

Meanwhile, on the issues that Americans do broadly prioritize — such as the cost of living, the economy, and inflation — Republicans boasted a double-digit advantage in 2024. 

Focusing more rhetorical energy on climate change is unlikely to enhance Democrats' credibility on bread-and-butter issues. To the contrary, there's reason to fear it would hurt that cause. 

One of the party's biggest challenges today is that voters don't think Democrats share their priorities. In the Times's poll mentioned above, voters were asked to name their top five issue priorities and then those of the Democratic Party. Respondents said their top issues were the economy, health care, immigration, taxes, and crime — while the Democrats' were abortion, LGBT policy, climate change, the state of democracy, and health care. 

In other words, they suggested that Democrats weren't focused on their top concerns, with the exception of health care policy.

This sense that Democrats are more preoccupied with niche social causes than the middle-class's core material needs surfaces in other survey data. For instance, even after Trump engineered an economic crisis in April with his unpopular tariffs, Quinnipiac still found the public evenly split on the question of which party “cares more for the needs of people like you.”

Making progress on climate requires removing the GOP from power.

Thus, were Democrats to put greater emphasis on climate change, they would risk perpetuating the idea that the party does not share ordinary Americans' priorities. 

And doing so would also risk directly undermining the party's standing on the cost of living. 

Inslee rightly notes that it is possible to reduce emissions and raise living standards simultaneously. But it's nevertheless true that there are some tensions between cutting carbon pollution and increasing affordability in the near term. The climate movement has sought to block new fossil fuel extraction and transport projects, an objective that would limit the supply of energy in the near term, thereby potentially increasing costs. 

Therefore, if Democrats signal that climate change is their overriding concern, some voters may conclude that the party isn't committed to keeping gasoline or home heating oil cheap. 

Or so some polling would suggest. During the Biden administration, Blue Rose gauged the persuasive impact of hundreds of Republican messages by polling voters, exposing them to a conservative argument, and then polling them again to see if any had switched their voting intentions. The firm found that one of the GOP's best attack lines — one that outperformed 90 percent of all other Republican messages — was, “Since Day 1, Biden has waged war on energy independence. His failed policies, like canceling the Keystone Pipeline, have led to Americans paying higher heating costs.”

To be fair to Inslee, he acknowledges that young voters are preoccupied with the cost of living. And his vision for climate policy foregrounds direct material benefits for ordinary people: He touts the fact that Washington's “cap-and-investment” program has subsidized working families' electric bills and provided young people with free access to transit. 

This is a fine program. And a national version might deserve a place on Democrats' laundry list of policy proposals. But the idea that the party's most electorally expedient message is one that centers climate change just isn't plausible. 

This doesn't mean that Democrats should never discuss the climate crisis, or advocate for emissions-reducing policies. But the party should not overestimate the political utility of the issue. Climate change is a top priority for progressive donors and activists — but not for swing voters, old or young.

That reality does not render decarbonization any less important. But making progress on climate requires removing the GOP from power. And it will be difficult for Democrats to do that, if they refuse to align their party's priorities with those of the electorate.

Paying for school could become a lot more difficult — on multiple levels.

by  Kevin Carey

Five years ago, as death, panic, and viruses were spreading across the globe, the Trump administration announced it was halting collections of college debt. At the time, almost everyone agreed this was a good idea. “It is going to make a lot of students happy,” President Donald Trump remarked. 

This week, an entire Biden administration later, Trump's Department of Education began throwing the full force of the federal government against people who had defaulted on their student loans. Employers will be contacted, wages garnished, and debt collectors deployed. 

The move came a week after House Republicans released plans for a massive overhaul of student financial aid policy. Their bill would reduce the number of students eligible for need-based federal financial aid, make it harder for students to pay for tuition, books and living expenses, increase monthly loan payments for millions of borrowers, and make some people wait as much as 20 years longer to have their debts forgiven. Student happiness will no longer be a consideration.

Sometimes, members of Congress propose radical changes they know have little chance of becoming law. This isn't one of those times. The Republican plan is part of the “big, beautiful” budget reconciliation bill, some version of which is likely to pass Congress before the year is out.

The much-debated dream of broad-scale debt relief and friendly student loans is fading. This is the beginning of a harsh new era for the roughly 43 million people who hold almost $1.7 trillion in federal student loans. For people who are struggling to make ends meet and are most vulnerable to Trump's government service cuts and the economic devastation of his reckless trade policies, the timing couldn't be worse.

Trump's initial move to suspend loan payments in 2020 was ratified by Congress a few weeks later in the CARES Act, which passed the House with a 419-6 vote. That was the last time Democrats and Republicans agreed on the issue. 

Loans were hotly debated during the Democratic primary that year. After Joe Biden's November victory, influential party figures like Sen. Elizabeth Warren pressed him to unilaterally forgive some or all outstanding student debt. Biden was reticent — he preferred making a deal with Congress — but over time, progressive activists convinced him to launch an ambitious plan to wipe $10,000 off the balance of nearly every federal loan, and another $10,000 from debt held by low-income students. It was a historic opportunity, they argued, to help close the racial wealth gap and give relief to people who had been victimized by too-expensive colleges. 

Biden also untangled a knot of existing loan forgiveness programs designed to help people including public servants, students with disabilities, and people who were defrauded by their college. Those actions alone resulted in 5.3 million students having $188 billion in loans wiped away. 

A group of Republican attorneys general sued over the $10,000 plan, and the Supreme Court obliterated the program based on its newly fabricated “major questions doctrine.” Biden pressed forward with more loan forgiveness schemes. 

The most important was the SAVE plan, which was designed for (but not limited to) community college students. It lowered students' monthly payments from 10 percent of their discretionary income to as little as 5 percent, and forgave any outstanding debts in as soon as 10 years for students with loans smaller than $12,000 (instead of 20 years). Almost 8 million people enrolled in SAVE.

As for student loan repayments, Biden extended the collections pause all the way until October 2023, when he was forced to restart the system by Republicans. After a one-year “on-ramp” to payment, the clock began ticking last October. 

The Department of Education has since told the servicing companies that manage the loans to start reporting non-paying borrowers to credit agencies. In just the last three months, millions of borrowers have suddenly seen their credit scores dip. This week marked the beginning of the federal government's drive to start collecting on loans that were already in default before the pandemic. 

College students and people with loans aren't just facing harsh new debt collection tactics from the Trump administration. The president's Republican allies in states and Congress are working to make college loan policy far less student-friendly in the future.

Another group of Republican attorneys general sued to stop SAVE, and the program is currently held up in federal court. (During this time, everyone in the program has had their loan put in suspended animation, meaning no interest has accrued and they didn't owe payments.) The House Republican plan would reverse its efforts, eliminating a provision that set loan payments to $0 for low-income borrowers, and instead increasing payments to up to 15 percent of income for current borrowers and 10 percent for future borrowers. It would also deny forgiveness until 30 years of payments — that is, most of a borrower's working life. 

Those who do borrow will face repayment on much harsher terms.

Biden's Department of Education wrote tough new rules designed to prevent students, particularly members of the military, from being defrauded in the first place. One rule cuts off federal financial aid to college programs that load up students with too much debt and don't prepare them to get jobs that pay an adequate wage. The Republican plan would repeal virtually all of those regulations. It would also prevent future education secretaries from creating new loan forgiveness plans. 

This means that, for students entering college or graduate school for the first time, the financial aid landscape could be grim. The Republican plan puts new limits on how much students in high-cost areas or in high-cost programs can borrow for tuition, books, room and board, even as moderate-income students will no longer be eligible for federal grants. Borrowing for graduate and professional school could be capped in a way that would make it much more difficult for lower-income students to pursue careers in medicine and law. 

Those who do borrow will face repayment on much harsher terms. And with most of the guardrails protecting students from predatory for-profit colleges lifted, it's more likely that they will be saddled with loans for degrees that have little or no value in the job market — if they manage to graduate at all. 

For the last five years, many borrowers held out hope that they could move forward in their lives without the yoke of student debt. Debt forgiveness plans were announced and congratulatory letters mailed, only to have the courts and electoral politics pull those promises away. Now the Department of Education has declared, “There will not be any mass loan forgiveness.” As long as Trump is president, this is certainly true. 

Borrowers who took advantage of the five-year hiatus will need to get back in the habit of loan repayment. So will recent graduates who haven't made payments before. For those in financial difficulty, even less-generous payments plans are almost certainly a better option than default. 

If the loan collection system cracks and falters under the strain, the government won't have people with enough expertise to step in and fix it.

One student loan servicer reports that only 38 percent of borrowers are up-to-date and actively making payments on their loans as of February, down from 60 percent before the pandemic. This is partially a problem of Republicans' own making — millions of borrowers have had their payments suspended while the SAVE lawsuit plays out in court. But there is no doubt that millions of people are at serious risk of defaulting on their student debt and suffering serious financial consequences. 

Restarting a collection system that was never designed to be turned off in the first place will be an enormous challenge for the Education Department and its contractors. Normally, the Federal Student Aid office (FSA) in the Education Department would have experts in place to help manage the vast, complex student loan system during a once-in-a-lifetime challenge. But Education Secretary Linda McMahon and Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency minions gutted FSA during their recent purge of department employees. That means if the loan collection system cracks and falters under the strain, the government won't have people with enough expertise to step in and fix it.

A wave of new student loan defaults later this year could dovetail in the worst possible way with a self-induced tariff recession, restricting access to credit at exactly the same time people are losing their jobs. College is supposed to be a path to economic mobility and security. The Trump administration and the Republican-controlled Congress seem determined to make that road as narrow, treacherous, and obstacle-strewn as it possibly can.

The justices will soon decide whether to weaken the courts holding back Trump.

by  Ian Millhiser

On May 15, the Supreme Court will hear three cases — consolidated under the name Trump v. CASA — which concern his unconstitutional attempt to strip many Americans born in the United States of citizenship. The mere fact that this hearing is happening is significant, as the Court rarely gives cases a full hearing in May, and typically only does so for matters of extreme urgency.

There is no plausible argument that the Donald Trump executive order at the heart of this case, which targets birthright citizenship — the constitutional principle that nearly anyone born in the United States is automatically a citizen — is lawful. As Judge John Coughenour, a Reagan appointee who was the first judge to block the order, said from the bench, “I've been on the bench for over four decades, I can't remember another case where the question presented is as clear as this one is.”

Get the latest developments on the US Supreme Court from senior correspondent Ian Millhiser.

That said, the specific legal questions before the Court have little to do with birthright citizenship. At least three courts issued “nationwide injunctions” against Trump's anti-citizenship order, meaning that lower court judges handed down orders that bind the entire federal government and prohibit Trump from canceling anyone's citizenship anywhere under his executive order.

The question of whether a single federal trial judge may issue an order that binds the entire country is fraught and has been hotly disputed for years. During the later days of the first Trump administration, Republican Justice Neil Gorsuch published an uncharacteristically persuasive concurring opinion arguing that these nationwide orders must be reined in.

Gorsuch argued that injunctions — court orders that either require a party to take a particular action or forbid them from doing so — are “meant to redress the injuries sustained by a particular plaintiff in a particular lawsuit.” When one judge can go much further, halting an entire federal policy nationwide, that creates an asymmetry. “There are currently more than 1,000 active and senior district court judges,” Gorsuch wrote. In a world with nationwide injunctions, plaintiffs can shop around for the one judge in America who is most likely to be sympathetic to their cause, and potentially secure a court order that no other judge would hand down.

This “judge-shopping” became a huge problem during the Biden administration, as there is a cohort of judges in Texas who proved quite willing to issue injunctions against a wide range of liberal policies that are unquestionably lawful. Think of Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk and his infamous court order attempting to ban the abortion drug mifepristone.

The GOP-controlled Supreme Court, moreover, often treated nationwide injunctions against the Biden administration very differently than injunctions binding a Republican president. In the first Trump administration, when lower court judges blocked Trump's immigration policies, the Court often intervened within days to halt those injunctions. But when judges like Kacsmaryk enjoined Biden's immigration policies, the Supreme Court would sometimes sit on those cases for nearly a year before ruling that the injunction was illegal.

Indeed, nationwide injunctions so frustrated the Biden administration that, on her way out the door, Biden's solicitor general, Elizabeth Prelogar, filed a brief asking the justices to limit these broad orders. That brief was filed in December 2024, after Trump had won the election, so Prelogar knew that Trump was likely to benefit if the justices took her up on her invitation.

Ultimately, they did not — but they've instead decided to consider the question of nationwide injunctions in CASA. That's an odd choice, because the case for a nationwide injunction on this particular issue is unusually strong. 

If Trump's lawyers convince the Supreme Court to limit nationwide injunctions, however, it will have enormous implications that stretch far beyond the birthright citizenship issue. As of this writing, there are more than 200 lawsuits challenging actions by the Trump administration. If lower court judges cannot issue nationwide injunctions, Trump will have far more leeway to implement policies even after a lower court deems them illegal or unconstitutional.

Still, the nationwide injunctions issue has lingered for a long time, upsetting the Justice Department in both Democratic and Republican administrations. So the Court probably could not continue ignoring it forever.

Before we dive deeper into the nationwide injunctions issue, it should be noted that the merits of the CASA case are as straightforward as any issue that has reached the Supreme Court in recent memory. Trump's attack on birthright citizenship is obviously unconstitutional, and there are no good-faith arguments for his position.

On his first day back in office, Trump signed an executive order that purports to strip citizenship from many babies born in the United States. The order targets children born to undocumented mothers whose fathers were neither citizens nor lawful permanent residents at the time of the child's birth. It also targets children of fathers with similar immigration status, and mothers who were lawfully, but temporarily, present in the United States when their child was born.

The order does not apply retroactively — by its terms, only babies born 30 days after it was issued would be ineligible for citizenship. Had it applied to adult citizens, however, it would likely denationalize many very prominent Americans, including former Vice President Kamala Harris.

The problem with this order is that the 14th Amendment provides that “all persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the state wherein they reside.” “All persons” means all persons, regardless of their parents' immigration status.

As the Supreme Court held in United States v. Wong Kim Ark (1898), moreover, the 14th Amendment's exception for children who are not “subject to the jurisdiction” of the United States is very narrow. The United States has “jurisdiction” over anyone who is bound by its laws — if the US did not have jurisdiction over undocumented immigrants, for example, then it would not be legal to deport them.

Wong Kim Ark explained that there are three classes of people, two of which are still relevant today, who are not subject to US jurisdiction. One is the children “born of alien enemies in hostile occupation.” The other is children of “diplomatic representatives of a foreign state,” who have diplomatic immunity from US law. (The third category is some “children of members of the Indian tribes,” but a 1924 law established that tribal citizens are also US citizens.)

Indeed, it's worth noting that Trump's lawyers didn't even ask the Supreme Court to fully restore his birthright citizenship order — they merely asked the Court to limit the scope of the lower courts' injunctions so that they only apply to the specific plaintiffs challenging the order. That strategic decision by Trump's lawyers is unsurprising, because the unconstitutionality of Trump's order was settled more than 125 years ago in Wong Kim Ark.

While there is no serious argument that Trump's birthright citizenship order is legal, there are very serious arguments on both sides of the nationwide injunction question. Gorsuch and Prelogar are correct that, when a single trial judge can set policy for the entire nation, it can needlessly disrupt the federal government's legitimate activities.

At the same time, a blanket rule against nationwide injunctions would render many court orders worthless. As one of the plaintiffs challenging the birthright citizenship order points out in their brief, the appropriate remedy in a gerrymandering case is that the entire gerrymandered district must be redrawn — not that the individual plaintiffs who brought that case be moved to another district. A more limited order would be unworkable and would impose impossible burdens on election officials who would have to track which voters are plaintiffs in which lawsuits in order to determine which candidates they may vote for.

Similar problems would arise in the birthright citizenship cases if the Supreme Court attempted to limit the injunctions against Trump's executive order. Two of the plaintiffs challenging that order, CASA, Inc. and the Asylum Seeker Advocacy Project (ASAP), say that they have “more than 800,000 members, spread across all 50 states.” When an organization secures an injunction against a federal policy, that injunction typically covers every member of that organization.

Were the injunction against the executive order limited to CASA and ASAP members, in other words, states and the federal government could have to track whether the parents of impacted children are members of either group (or perhaps if the children are — again, it's not at all clear how this would work), and extend citizenship only to those individuals. A parent who lets their membership lapse could see their child denationalized, perhaps to become a citizen again once they rejoin. That would create an unworkable administrative nightmare for everyone involved.

Meanwhile, two other cases were brought by two blocs of states, led by Washington and New Jersey, respectively. And it's not at all clear how an injunction against the executive order limited to these states alone would work: Would someone born in Washington cease to be a citizen if they crossed the border into Idaho? Or would someone born in Idaho suddenly become a citizen if they entered Washington, only to lose that status the minute they returned to a non-plaintiff state? Such a rule wouldn't just be exceedingly difficult to administer, it would likely violate the Constitution's equal protection principle, which prohibits arbitrary distinctions among similarly situated individuals.

Fortunately, the Supreme Court's current precedents offer a framework that can be used to resolve this tension between giving judges too much power to set national policy and forcing them to draw arbitrary lines that needlessly burden both the plaintiffs and the government. As the Court said in Califano v. Yamaski (1979), the ordinary rule is that “injunctive relief should be no more burdensome to the defendant than necessary to provide complete relief to the plaintiffs.”

In many cases, Califano will preclude nationwide injunctions. But, in the birthright citizenship cases, it's hard to see how anything other than a nationwide injunction could suffice. CASA and ASAP members won't receive complete relief if they are constantly having to prove their membership (or their parents' membership) in one of these two organizations to obtain the benefits of citizenship, including the right to be free from deportation. And states can't administer programs like Medicaid, where eligibility often turns on a beneficiary's immigration status, if they can't tell who is or is not a citizen.

It's worth acknowledging one additional wrinkle in this case, which the Court could decide to take up at the May 15 argument. The Trump administration claims that the state plaintiffs aren't entitled to any relief at all because they lack “standing” — the requirement that a litigant show that they were injured in some way by the defendant they are suing before bringing a federal lawsuit.

But the states have a very strong argument that they have standing to challenge the birthright citizenship order. As one bloc of states explains in their brief, many federal programs tie funding to the number of citizens within a particular state, so states will lose money if the birthright citizenship order goes into effect. Loss of funding is one of the most common ways to establish standing to bring a federal lawsuit.

Additionally, the states argue that ending birthright citizenship for many children of immigrants would require them to make “substantial changes to existing public programs such as Medicaid, the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP), Title IV-E foster care, and the Social Security Administration's (SSA) Enumeration at Birth program.”

Ultimately, because the case for a nationwide injunction in CASA is so strong, the Court probably will not use this case to unravel many of the more difficult questions posed by more questionable nationwide injunctions. But, at the very least, the case is likely to offer an early window into how these justices will determine which nationwide injunctions are allowed and which ones are forbidden.

Two bitter enemies, more than 300 nukes, and no end in sight.

by  Joshua Keating

The most likely outcome is that the latest deadly flare-up between India and Pakistan will end relatively soon: In the little over 25 years that the two countries have possessed nuclear weapons, both have become very good at engaging in tense and violent confrontations without them escalating to threaten the entire planet. 

When he announced the cross-border missile strikes that began what India is calling “Operation Sindoor,” Indian Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri described his country's actions as “measured, non-escalatory, proportionate, and responsible” Neither side has yet sent ground troops into the other's territory, which would be the clearest sign yet of a wider war. 

On Wednesday, India launched missile attacks into Pakistan in response to a brutal massacre of tourists in April by militants that the Indian government alleges have links to the Pakistani state. Since then, the two countries have been trading artillery and drone strikes across the border, with around four dozen deaths reported so far. 

All the same, in its scale and intensity, and without an obvious off-ramp for the combatants, some analysts are describing the current conflict as the most dangerous episode of violence between India and Pakistan since the Kargil War of 1999, in which hundreds of troops were killed on both sides. 

Just because the two sides don't want the crisis to escalate doesn't mean it won't anyway. 

Since majority-Hindu India and majority-Muslim Pakistan were partitioned in 1947, they have fought four major wars and a number of smaller skirmishes. The primary source of tension between the two has been the disputed region of Kashmir, which since 1972 has been divided by an unofficial border known as the Line of Control. 

Even in peaceful times, alleged violations of the line and cross-border firing have been relatively common. India also accuses Pakistan of sponsoring a long-running Islamist insurgency in the parts of Kashmir it controls — which Pakistan denies, although it does openly support autonomy for the region. 

The stakes of the conflict were raised by the introduction of nuclear weapons, which India first tested in 1974 and Pakistan acquired in 1998. The year after Pakistan got its nukes, the Kargil War began when Pakistani fighters covertly crossed the Line of Control and took up positions in Indian-administered Kashmir. 

The war, which lasted around two months, is often held up as the primary counterexample to the idea of “nuclear peace” — the concept that nuclear weapons make war less likely because of the risk of escalation.

Pakistan and India demonstrated that two nuclear powers can fight a war, albeit a short and relatively limited one, using only conventional weapons. Some political scientists have used India and Pakistan's case to demonstrate what's known as the “stability-instability paradox”: The introduction of nuclear weapons makes large-scale war less likely, but small-scale violence more likely, because each side assumes the other will not want to escalate. 

There have been a number of additional flare-ups in the years that followed, and they've been getting gradually more intense and dangerous with each new episode. 

“You can see the quantitative, qualitative, sort of growth in the Indian response to Pakistan in the last 24 years,” said Happymon Jacob, an Indian security analyst and the editor of India's World magazine. 

 In 2001, after terrorists attacked the Indian parliament, the Indian government accused Pakistan's intelligence services of being involved in the attacks, and both countries amassed nearly 1 million troops on the border, but ultimately did not go to war. Similarly, in 2008, after terrorist attacks in Mumbai killed nearly 200 people, India again refrained from direct strikes against Pakistan. 

In 2016, after 19 Indian troops were killed by militants in an attack on a base in Kashmir, India responded with “surgical strikes” at militant camps across the line of control. 

Then in 2019, after 40 Indian police were killed in a suicide bombing, India carried out airstrikes against militant targets on Pakistani territory. Pakistan responded with strikes of its own on the Indian side of the line, which led to an air battle and downing of an Indian fighter jet.

Since then, the conflict has been relatively quiet, even as clashes between India and its other nuclear-armed neighbor, China, have been more intense. That all changed last month. 

The current crisis began on April 22, when gunmen killed 26 people in Pahalgam, a popular tourist resort in Indian-administered Kashmir, appearing to specifically target Hindu men. 

A militant group called the Resistance Front has claimed responsibility, but India says the group is an offshoot of Lashkar-e-Taiba, the group that carried out the Mumbai attacks and which has alleged links to Pakistani security services. 

The Pakistani government denies any links to the attacks and the Indian government has not presented any direct evidence of their involvement, but Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi vowed to “raze whatever is left of the terror haven,” referring to terrorist camps in Pakistan.

After weeks of rising tensions, including cross-border fire, the expulsion of diplomats, and India's withdrawal from a key water-sharing treaty, the military conflict began in earnest on Wednesday when India fired missiles into Pakistan, targeting nine sites “where terrorist attacks against India have been planned,” according to the Indian defense ministry. 

At least 31 people, including women and children, were killed, and two mosques were hit, according to Pakistani authorities. Pakistan has responded with drone and missile strikes of its own against Indian military targets. The attacks and counterattacks have been ongoing. Pakistan also appears to have downed a number of Indian aircraft, though the exact number is unclear and both sides are accusing the other of spreading misinformation.

For the moment, there isn't an obvious “off-ramp,” which would allow the two sides to defuse tensions. 

For instance, in 2019, Pakistan's release of a captured Indian pilot helped deescalate the crisis. Srujan Palkar of the Atlantic Council has written that a renegotiation of the water treaty that India has suspended could provide an opportunity for dialogue. (Pakistan relies on the Indus River system, which passes through India, for much of its agriculture and economic activity. Amid the growing crisis, Indian officials have threatened to withhold that water.) 

“The United States has always been the default crisis broker between India and Pakistan, but it is becoming more awkward for Washington to play that role.”

The brutality of the Pahalgam massacre touted with the fact that Modi's government had been touting Kashmir as a safe and pacified tourist destination made a strong Indian military response almost inevitable, and one need only look at the examples of September 11 or October 7 to see how the anger provoked by a deadly terrorist attack can lead a country into a long-term war. Nationalist fervor is running high in both countries, but ironically Foreign Policy magazine editor Ravi Agrawal suggests that the sheer amount of misinformation circling around the conflict could help defuse it by making it easier for both sides to claim victory 

For the moment, the two sides don't appear to have much interest in talking. America's role in the crisis is also something of a question mark. 

US diplomacy has played a critical role in resolving India-Pakistan crises in the past, including in 1999 and 2019, but Joshua White, former director of South Asian Affairs on the Obama administration's National Security Council, said America's leverage is not what it once was. 

While the Indian government has been growing ever closer to Washington, thanks to their mutual distrust of China, the US-Pakistan relationship has deteriorated since the US withdrawal from Afghanistan. 

Secretary of State and national security adviser Marco Rubio has been in touch with the governments of both countries. President Donald Trump has declared the fighting a “shame” and said, ““They've gone tit for tat, so hopefully they can stop now,” and added, “If I can do anything to help, I will be there.” Vice President JD Vance was more equivocal, saying that while the US would encourage both sides to deescalate, “we're not going to get involved in the middle of war that's fundamentally none of our business.” In contrast to other recent crises, such as 2016 and 2019, the US has not criticized India's strikes on Pakistan. 

“The United States has always been the default crisis broker between India and Pakistan, but it is becoming more awkward for Washington to play that role because of the thinner, more tenuous, and more conflictual relationship that it has developed with Pakistan in recent years,” White said. 

India's defense ministry claims it demonstrated restraint by striking against alleged militant targets rather than Pakistan's military in its initial strikes, but the situation has already escalated. 

Pakistan's retaliation did target the Indian military (there aren't non-state “militants” to attack on the Indian side, so this was basically inevitable) and India has not targeted Pakistan's air defense systems.

It's not hard to imagine scenarios that could cause this conflict to escalate. A missile strike could — intentionally or inadvertently — cause a large number of military or civilian casualties, prompting an even larger retaliation. 

Indian authorities have claimed that the purpose of their strikes is to deter terrorist attacks, not to seize territory, but if they sent troops over the Line of Control into Pakistani-administered Kashmir, leaders in Pakistan might still interpret it as an invasion. 

Given the potentially global consequences of a worst-case scenario, these are risks people everywhere are forced to take seriously. 

India and Pakistan have around 180 and 170 nuclear warheads, respectively. Pakistan, crucially, does not have a “no first use” policy around these weapons, meaning it does not rule out using nuclear force to deter a conventional attack. It has also introduced low-yield “tactical” weapons into its arsenal specifically for battlefield use to counter India's conventional military superiority. India does have a declared no-first-use policy, though some officials' recent statements have cast doubt on it. 

In the current crisis, Pakistan's defense minister has said they would only consider using their nukes if “there is a direct threat to our existence.” That sort of threat is in the eye of the beholder, but we're still likely a long way from it, particularly given the alleged losses India's air force has already sustained. 

But, says White, the former National Security Council staffer, “so long as we continue to see back and forth missile strikes, the nuclear question is not off the table.”

Beyond this immediate crisis, India's increasing willingness to use conventional military force against Pakistan — with greater and greater intensity — to respond to terrorist attacks on its territory, suggests that the fear of nuclear escalation may not be as powerful a deterrent as it once was. 

So far, these two long-time belligerents demonstrated an ability to keep these conflicts limited. The main victims, as always, will be the people of Kashmir, subject to both war and increasingly dire human rights conditions. But with each new crisis, they also seem increasingly willing to push the envelope.

﻿Trump is threatening the independence of the Fed. That's dangerous.

by  Nicole Narea

The Federal Reserve arguably saved the US from a recession in 2024: Fed chair Jerome Powell calibrated interest rates to gradually bring down inflation without triggering an acute slowdown in economic growth. 

But President Donald Trump isn't satisfied with Powell's performance, though. On Thursday, a day after the Fed decided against lowering interest rates, Trump called Powell a “FOOL, who doesn't have a clue” on his social platform, Truth Social.

Trump wants to lower interest rates because he thinks that high rates are no longer needed to check rising prices. Inflation has come down to under 3 percent, but it threatens to increase again due to tariffs. 

But Powell has full license to ignore what Trump thinks. The Fed and the president are supposed to act independently so that the country's macroeconomic policy can be insulated from political concerns. 

That's why past presidents have largely — thought not always — steered clear of commenting on the Fed's decisions, even when they have had political incentives to do so.

Former President Joe Biden was reluctant to publicly criticize the Fed and repeatedly emphasized its independence, deferring to its judgment on interest rates during a period of high inflation following the Covid-19 pandemic.

But Trump's most recent attack on Powell was just the latest in a long string of his attempts to influence the central bank. Trump has recently dubbed Powell, whom he appointed in 2017, a “major loser” who was “too late and wrong” on inflation. He's previously called the Fed itself “crazy,” “loco,” and “a bigger problem than China.” And he has repeatedly sought to dictate Fed policy: “It is a perfect time to lower interest rates,” he said last month. 

However, independent central banks have a far better track record than those governed by political interests. Politicians have an incentive to boost short-term prosperity, even at the expense of a country's long-term economic prospects, because they are beholden to voters in regular elections. Independent central bankers, on the other hand, can afford to take a longer view.

That approach reflects the understanding that “A mark of a successful country in the modern era has been an independent central bank,” as Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Vice Chairman Rob Kaplan said in an address last month. 

The Fed has faced political headwinds before. But the degree to which this administration is seeking to meddle in Fed policy is unprecedented and could potentially exacerbate already heightened economic uncertainty stemming from Trump's tariffs. 

Past presidents have disagreed with the Fed in a few notable incidents — but they haven't vocalized their concerns as publicly and brazenly as Trump.

Former President Richard Nixon joked that while he respected the independence of the Fed, he hoped that then-Fed chair Arthur Burns would “conclude that my views are the ones that should be followed” and bring down interest rates during the early 1970s. 

Some historians theorize that Nixon exerted more explicit pressure on Burns in private and that the Fed chair ultimately caved to that pressure, allowing inflation to get out of control. But if Nixon did, he never spoke about it publicly.

The email you need to stay informed about Trump — without letting the news take over your life, from senior editor Patrick Reis.

In the early 1980s, former Fed chair Paul Volcker aggressively raised interest rates to temper the inflation crisis that Burns started, triggering a recession. Former President Ronald Reagan never publicly criticized the Fed during that time, but made his agenda known behind closed doors. 

Volcker recalled in his memoir that, in 1984, he was called into a private meeting with Reagan in which the president ordered him not to raise interest rates before the November election. Volcker, “stunned,” writes that he walked out without saying a word, and that was the last he heard of it. 

For the most part, however, both Republican and Democratic presidents, from George W. Bush to Barack Obama, have respected the independence of the Fed and declined to comment on its monetary policies. 

”One of the hallmarks of our economic strategy has been a respect for the independence and the integrity of the Federal Reserve,” former President Bill Clinton said in 2000.

Technically, the Fed isn't completely independent. The authority of the Fed stems from Congress's 1937 Federal Reserve Act, which lawmakers have tweaked over time. The president also nominates the Fed's Board of Governors, whom the Senate confirms.

But there is good reason for Congress and the president to keep the Fed at arm's length.

The stability of the US financial system rests on the perception that the Fed and its Board of Governors, with their vast economic expertise, control the levers of monetary policy and do not answer to short-term political interests. This allows the Fed to focus on the country's long-term economic welfare — which might sometimes require raising interest rates to cool inflation — rather than the more instant economic relief that politicians might demand.

If Trump's attacks on the Fed continue, it might only deepen the struggle of Americans who were already grappling with an affordability crisis. 

Research has shown that central bank independence corresponds with a long-term reduction in annual inflation, even in advanced economies. 

That's good for American consumers, businesses, and foreign investment. 

Attacks on central bank independence, on the other hand, can lead to what former Fed chair Ben Bernanke described in a 2010 speech as “undesirable boom-bust cycles that ultimately lead to both a less stable economy and higher inflation.” 

There are many examples of countries that suffered economically after their central banks were co-opted by political interests. 

Take Venezuela, where the country's authoritarian leaders, Hugo Chávez and Nicolás Maduro, ended the independence of the country's central bank and ordered it to print more money to finance government deficits during the 2000s and early 2010s. What followed was a period of hyperinflation, where prices rose by double-digit percentage points per month. As their economic prospects dried up, nearly 8 million Venezuelans fled the country in search of opportunities elsewhere. 

Turkey also plunged into an economic crisis in 2022 after President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan exercised greater control over the central bank and pressured it to keep interest rates low. As a result, inflation reached a 20-year high, hitting 61 percent in April 2022. The Turkish Lira collapsed in value, and the country was forced to implement capital controls — restrictions on the movement of money in and out of the country — to prevent it from falling further. 

The US does not have to go the way of Venezuela and Turkey.

The Fed is set up to respond to a moment like the present: Trump's tariffs threaten to drive up inflation, and the Fed has the power to raise interest rates or maintain them at their current level to mitigate inflation. But if Trump were in charge, he's made clear that he would cut interest rates, which could drive up prices even higher in the long run. 

Trump seems to have changed his mind about trying to fire Powell for now. But if his attacks on the Fed continue, it might only deepen the struggle of Americans who were already grappling with an affordability crisis.

A barrage of products promise you can get your hair — and self-esteem — back.

by  Maria Yagoda

I never appreciated how much I aspired toward conventional hotness until I got cancer and lost all my hair. As I underwent 12 rounds of chemotherapy in 2023 to treat advanced-stage Hodgkin lymphoma, I became measurably “uglier”: bald, muscle-free and inflated by steroids, with only three eyelashes to my name. The Mitski lyric “But if I gave up on being pretty, I wouldn't know how to be alive” comes to mind.

Ironically, as my hair fluttered to the ground like falling leaves during those early days of treatment, I realized that the wild, oft-frizzy hair I'd spent my whole life tussling with was central to my look. I tried my best to hold onto it. 

During my first few rounds of chemo, I opted to try a relatively new process called “cold capping,” which is what it sounds like. The patient wears an ice-cold cap before, during, and after chemo, and for some, it can reduce the amount of hair loss during treatment by up to 50 percent. (New York recently became the first state to mandate insurance coverage of scalp cooling; I had to sink a chunk of my GoFundMe to afford it.) 

Understand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.

The cap is, unfortunately, a torture device. Just 15 seconds into my first treatment with the freezing helmet latched to my head and with six more hours to go, the cold was unbearable. I took more Advil and Tylenol, and requested more Ativan, too. An hour later the nurse returned with the benzos and began pumping me with four types of poison, as I shivered on the most depressing floor in Murray Hill.

Once I experienced the brutality of chemo, it became unimaginable to elect additional discomfort. The moment I stopped capping, the hair loss quickened, thinning out my wavy bob. Every day I asked myself: Is today the day I shave it? Would classic bald look better at this point? How much longer can I cling to hair normalcy? 

When I found clumps of hair caking the pillow on my hospital stretcher, I asked the emergency room doctor to buzz it.

During the treatment, losing my hair was upsetting, but I had bigger problems, like cancer and sepsis. The post-chemo hair regrowth process — slow, uneven, patchy, lonely — has been more gutting because I'm supposed to be normal now. 

More than 80 million people in the US experience hair loss. In addition to affecting cancer patients, hair loss is also a common but rarely talked-about side effect of perimenopause and childbirth. While baldness, thinning, and hairline woes are more commonly associated with men, female pattern hair loss is estimated to impact 40 percent of women before age 50. Hair loss in women is more likely to be caused by medical conditions, medications, or psychological distress. Across the board, it has a significant impact on a patient's quality of life, but women are more likely to experience psychosocial problems as a result. 

“Hair is deeply tied to our identity, confidence, and even how we just move through the world.”

“Hair is deeply tied to our identity, confidence, and even how we just move through the world,” Dr. Asmi Berry, a board-certified dermatologist in Los Angeles, says. “Our hair is one of the first things that people notice. So when a patient or anyone experiences hair loss, especially after something life-altering like chemo or pregnancy or a severe illness, it's not just physical. It could feel like you've lost a part of yourself and that has an emotional impact.”

People often get “chemo curls” after cancer treatment: Their hair grows back thicker and curlier, sometimes in a different color. My alleged curls sprouted up unevenly on my head, as I was now expected to find work, love, and normalcy. 

After I begged, my oncologist finally referred me to a dermatologist at the cancer hospital who prescribed me minoxidil (Rogaine), spironolactone (a heart medication that can help treat female pattern hair loss), a scalp solution, and a military-grade anti-fungal shampoo that turns hair into straw. Neither the anti-fungal shampoo, which is also used to treat athlete's foot and ringworm, nor the topical solution are FDA-approved for hair loss, but have shown promise as adjunctive therapies and are among many tools a dermatologist may use to help a patient. 

Unfortunately for me, the growth process has remained slow-going. I'm grateful, though, that the dermatologist was willing to help me try — that she took my distress seriously. 

“It's just hair,” people with an abundance of it tell me. “You're rocking the short look!” Imagine if the most traumatizing thing that ever happened to you were visible on your body, and people made upbeat comments about it. When I finally worked up the courage to post a wig-free photo on my Instagram Stories, after over a year of hiding, someone told me I looked like Stockard Channing's Rizzo from Grease — the famously mid-30s actress playing a high schooler whose hair I hate. 

This is all to say, I'm not surprised that people go on hair plug vacations to Turkey. (“First stop is always Istanbul!” as they say). 

Unfortunately, there are few solutions for hair regrowth that are guaranteed to be effective. “My advice is just to look for treatments that are backed by science and clinical data,” Berry says. 

When people ask Lindy Segal, a beauty writer and author of the Gatekeeping newsletter, what hair growth products are “worth it,” Segal's answer is always the same: minoxidil, also known as Rogaine. “It's still the only FDA-approved ingredient for hair growth in those assigned female at birth,” Segal wrote in an email. Finasteride (Propecia) is the other FDA-approved medication to treat hair loss and pattern baldness, but only for men. “There's some research that red light therapy could boost hair growth, but a $45 bottle of Rogaine is a safer financial bet than a $500 device,” Segal says. “Girl math!” 

And the girl math can add up: There are myriad supplements and hair products boasting ingredients like biotin, collagen, and zinc on the market, and they're not all bogus. Oral biotin, for example, is quite safe to ingest and studies show it could help prevent hair loss — though there's not enough research to show that it encourages growth. 

When I first saw my dermatologist, she first had me do a ton of bloodwork, to try to identify any other root causes of both hair loss and slow regrowth (aside from, you know, 12 infusions of the most toxic substances on Earth.) I was very low in zinc and vitamin B6, both of which are important for hair growth, so she prescribed me supplements for those, along with all the other pills and potions we tried. 

“I think what's really important in the whole conversation of hair loss is a root cause approach,” Berry says. “Figuring out, is the hair loss hormonal? Is there a nutritional component? Stress-induced? Getting a comprehensive evaluation by a dermatologist can really help with avoiding wasted time, money, or even hope on the wrong path.”

Frustratingly, hair loss is also something that some doctors outside dermatology are quick to dismiss, regarding it as a problem of vanity. After giving birth to her 2-year-old son, my friend Alicia, a 35-year-old in North Carolina, watched in dismay as much of her hair came out (Vox is only using Alicia's first name so she can freely discuss a sensitive medical issue). When she brought the shedding up to her primary care physician, the doctor said, “Oh, it looks fine to me!” and failed to refer her to a dermatologist. 

That's the big problem in the wild world of hair regrowth: Most stuff can't hurt. But most probably can't help.

“It was just a constant self-esteem bummer,” Alicia told me via text message. “I just felt like no matter how I tied it back or what I did, I couldn't get it to look good. And there's no makeup or anything you can do for your hair.”

The regrowth process was long, demoralizing, and expensive. “I gave a lot of my money to Vegamour,” Alicia says. She thinks the Insta-friendly hair serum that contains turmeric, caffeine, and biotin helped, to some extent. Other well-advertised solutions that she bought seemed less effective for her hair, including growth supplements that contained biotin and acerola extract — a Brazilian fruit containing vitamin C that is supposed to help boost collagen production. 

That's the big problem in the wild world of hair regrowth: Most stuff can't hurt. But most probably can't help. One website selling Acelora as a hair supplement cites a 1954 study on scurvy, the vitamin C deficiency that can cause hair loss. I'm assuming, today, most people's hair loss is no longer scurvy-induced.

Like mine, Alicia's algorithm is plastered with hair growth ads boasting dubious claims. Indeed, it seems we are living in a time of unprecedented claims about hair. “There's a lot of noise out there and people market in ways that are really psychologically triggering,” Berry says. 

Segal has also observed a distinct uptick in the noise. “I've definitely noticed more products, brands, and general coverage targeted to hair growth for women in the last few years,” she says. She suspects some of it is related to the pandemic. Indeed, studies have indicated that roughly 20 percent of people who had Covid-19 later developed temporary hair shedding, usually starting a few months after recovering. 

It's best to be wary of any product that claims to regrow your hair “instantly” or “quickly.” Not to mention viral over-the-counter products can't help you with potential side effects: Nutrofol, for example, can perpetuate liver injury. 

I'll admit that, out of desperation, I've tried well-marketed hair regrowth products that aren't what you might call “vetted.” Herbal oils, turmeric scalp elixirs, collagen powders, “density” shampoos and conditioners, serums. I've lived in constant fear of more hair falling out, so I carefully ration hair brushing and washing, terrified to detach any more strands than inevitable. 

A year and a half after finishing treatment, I worked up the courage to get my first blowout, which would involve brushing, washing, scrubbing, and hair blowing. The stylist showed me her comb and her hands after massaging my head. “See? Only a couple hairs came out, which is normal,” she said. I'd expected a wig's worth. The blowout looked pretty, if thin. The varying lengths, caused by uneven regrowth, looked like cool, choppy layers. 

Patrice Grell Yursik, creator of the hair and beauty blog Afrobella, was diagnosed with multiple myeloma in January 2024. After bone marrow biopsies and weeks of hospitalization, she had a stem cell transplant, followed by chemotherapy, and she lost all her hair. 

Yursik is also in the regrowth phase. I asked her if she'd tried anything to encourage the process. 

“My oncologist is very wary of the wellness industry and doesn't recommend any additional supplements or hair growth medicines for me at this time,” she wrote in a message, adding that she couldn't cold cap because her type of cancer is located in the bone marrow, “so we didn't want to basically refrigerate my skull while I was trying to heal.”

“I've tried a few topical products, specifically scalp oils intended to stimulate growth,” she says. “My hair is growing back super thick and coily at the roots, and it is absolutely fascinating. For someone who made so much of her name and identity around hair, it has been an unexpected education in learning to love myself at every stage of my new journey.”

For the rest of my life, I'll have fewer hairs than I did before I got sick. No product will change that, and maybe that's just fine. But I'll keep searching, just in case.

If it ain't broke, don't fix it.

For many workers, that well-worn bit of folk wisdom may be the best advice for deciding whether to switch jobs in 2025.

Labor market observers told Business Insider that if you have a job and aren't in a hot field like artificial intelligence, it's probably smart to stay put unless you're worried about getting cut — or are simply miserable.

In the third installment of BI's six-part series on making major life decisions in periods of immense policy-driven change, we're looking at whether now is a good time to change jobs. We've already covered best practices for starting a business and buying a house.

There are some key reasons you may want to stick it out in your current role. Among the biggies: Overall job openings are down, hiring is happening at the slowest pace in about a decade, and some employers feel jittery.

That's partly because many are facing major questions about what will happen with tariffs and interest rates. The uncertainty has spilled into financial markets, whose swings have at times been like a check engine light for the US economy.

It all adds up to a labor market that's ""paralyzed,"" Cory Stahle, an economist at the Indeed Hiring Lab, told BI.

""Employers are not sure if they can commit to certain hiring plans,"" he said.

That means if you're thinking about handing in your two weeks' notice, you probably have more to consider than only a few months ago — including how robust your network is, how many job postings there are in your field, and how well your employer is doing, Susan Peppercorn, an executive coach, told BI.

""It's not the strongest job market, but then again, it's not the weakest,"" she said.

Overall, job postings in the US have dropped by 5 percentage points in 2025, Stahle said.

Postings for white-collar roles fell by 12.7% from the first quarter of 2024 to the first quarter of 2025, according to Revelio Labs, which examines employment trends. In the same period, openings for blue-collar jobs dropped by 11.9%.

Taking a longer view, opportunities for some desk jobs are far less prevalent than during the job-hopping bonanza of a few years ago. From the Great Resignation era in early 2022 through the first quarter of 2025, postings for software developers and business analysts each fell by about 76%, while openings for market research work dropped by about 80%, Revelio found.

Yet, it's not all bad news. Stahle said demand for workers in areas including healthcare and construction had held up. On top of that, he said, many employers that struggled to attract workers just a few years ago aren't eager to lay them off now, especially as it's unclear how long factors such as the tariff morass may persist.

To know whether it's a good time to make a move, you may just need to ask someone out of work. On average, people are spending more time looking.

As of April, the median time job seekers were unemployed was a seasonally adjusted 10.4 weeks, according to the Labor Department. That's up from eight weeks in June 2022.

You may be tempted to jump because, broadly, fewer of us are dialed into what we do. Gallup recently found that in 2024, the global share of engaged employees dropped to 21% from 23%. That's only the second annual drop since 2009; the other was 2020, during pandemic lockdowns.

Stahle said that if you don't like your job and there aren't other options at your employer, you should be prepared for the search to take longer.

If you're unhappy in your role, you may want to focus on growing by adding skills or looking for other spots at your employer, Jennifer Dulski, the CEO and founder of Rising Team, a team-performance platform, told BI.

If your job is at risk, or you think it might be, start searching, she said.

Dulski said that your search should involve more than scrolling through openings. You'll need to contact people and start connecting — a term she prefers over networking.

With fewer openings and employers taking longer to bring people aboard, any edge can help.

""People need to work harder now to stand out,"" said Dulski, who's spent some 25 years in tech, including leadership positions at Yahoo, Google, and Facebook.

Peppercorn offered similar advice, saying that if you're in the market, you have to be able to show what makes you ""unique and compelling.""

How successful you're likely to be in your job search — and how quickly it plays out — will have a lot to do with your skills, she said.

Those abilities have to be well-suited to what employers want, Peppercorn said. A job change may not be hard if you're a nurse or someone developing AI tools, for example.

Ultimately, the jobs have to be there. Peppercorn said you should hope to see at least 10 open roles you could apply for and would have a reasonable shot at landing.

It also makes more sense, she said, to put in well-crafted job applications rather than go after loads of openings in hopes of getting a bite. Peppercorn also said that if a posting has more than 50 applicants, it might be worth looking elsewhere.

Perhaps above all, she said, forging ties with others will remain essential.

For decades, Chinese video games and American gamers just didn't mix. US audiences were receptive to all manner of weird and wonderful experiences, from Finnish Angry Birds to Japanese Pokémon, but sidestepped anything coming out of China.

That was until Genshin Impact arrived five years ago with two dozen plucky anime characters that fought monsters and took on quests. The HoYoverse production was an instant hit and went on to earn about $6.2 billion from smartphone players purchasing the chance to win alluring fighters and their magical weapons, according to data from Sensor Tower.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg'}","business"

Retired Supreme Court Justice David Souter died Thursday at his home in New Hampshire, the court said in a statement. He was 85 years old.

No cause of death was given in the court's statement.

Souter was appointed to the high court in 1990 by his fellow Republican, President George H.W. Bush, and retired in 2009.

Souter, while serving on the court, often vexed Bush and other Republicans by aligning himself with liberal justices in decisions on cases.

One such notable decision was in 1992's Planned Parenthood v. Casey, in which he joined with the majority in upholding the federal constitutional right to abortion first established by the case known as Roe v. Wade. The Supreme Court, in its 2022 decision in Dobbs vs. Jackson Women's Health Organization, undid that right to abortion.

In 2000, Souter dissented with liberal justices on the case Bush v. Gore, which halted the presidential election vote recount in Florida, guaranteeing that Bush's son, George W. Bush, would win that contest.

Souter's retirement at a relatively young age allowed a new, Democratic president, Barack Obama, to appoint a liberal justice to replace him: Justice Sonia Sotomayor.

After he retired, the bookish bachelor for more than a decade regularly sat as a judge on the U.S Circuit Court of Appeals for the 1st Circuit, which handles cases arising out of federal district courts in New Hampshire, as well as Maine, Massachusetts, Rhode Island and Puerto Rico.

Souter had served for just three months as a regular judge on the 1st Circuit before Bush nominated him to the Supreme Court.

""Justice David Souter served our Court with great distinction for nearly twenty years. He brought uncommon wisdom and kindness to a lifetime of public service,"" Chief Justice John Roberts said in a statement on Friday.

""After retiring to his beloved New Hampshire in 2009, he continued to render significant service to our branch by sitting regularly on the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit for more than a decade,"" Roberts said. ""He will be greatly missed.""

Souter, who was born in Massachusetts, graduated from Harvard, and afterward was a Rhodes scholar at Oxford University in England. He later graduated from Harvard Law School, and after a brief stint in private practice became an assistant attorney general in New Hampshire, and eventually attorney general of that state.

Souter later served as a judge on New Hampshire Superior court and as a justice on the state Supreme Court.

In this article

Upwards of 12,000 shipping containers that are subject to the 145%-plus tariffs levied by President Trump are on the first flotilla of Chinese freight vessels arriving at the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach.

A total of seven vessels that left China after the announcement of the 145%-plus tariffs are currently at the nation's two busiest ports for container traffic from Asia, according to vessel arrivals tracked and aggregated by MarineTraffic. An additional five freight ships are expected to arrive in the coming days.

Amazon, Home Depot, Ikea, Ralph Lauren and Tractor Supply are among the companies with Chinese goods in these containers, spanning a wide range of consumer items.

In addition to housewares, apparel, and furniture, Amazon imported a wide variety of products on behalf of sellers, including refrigerators, deep fryers, mousepads, bookshelves and living room sofas.

Tractor Supply shipments include portable drum fans, garden tools, and men's work boots.

Lamps and ceiling fans have been processed through customs for Home Depot.

A Tractor Supply spokesperson referred CNBC to its recent earnings call on April 24 when the company pointed to ""notable uncertainty"" as a result of the tariffs. ""Tractor Supply is actively working with its vendor and supply chain partners to navigate the impact of recently announced tariffs, while also monitoring the broader macroeconomic factors impacting its customers,"" the spokesperson said.

Ikea furniture; Speedo swim goggles and swim caps; Procter & Gamble tissue holders; Samsung printed circuit boards, microwaves and refrigerator parts; Ralph Lauren sweaters, cashmere, and blazers; Dr. Martens Airwair footwear; Samsung microwaves and refrigerator parts; LG washing machines, air conditioners, ranges, refrigerators and dishwashers; Bauer Hockey sporting goods; Lenovo computer parts; auto parts for Valeo North America; and headsets and computer keyboards for Polaris, were all among the Chinese container goods.

For many of the companies, products in categories deemed as essential to replenish are brought in despite concerns about consumer demand and an economic slowdown.

Amazon said in a statement sent by email that it is working with its ""broad, varied range of valued selling partners in our store to support them in adapting to the evolving environment while maintaining broad selection and low prices for customers.""

Home Depot is in a quiet period ahead of announcing its quarterly results, and referred CNBC to an existing statement citing ""a fluid environment.""

""We, together with our vendors, are monitoring developments and will work closely to manage with the goal of being our customers' advocate for value,"" a Home Depot spokesperson said.

Trump suggested on Friday, ahead of key trade talks, that he was willing to lower tariffs on China to 80%, a rate many businesses would likely still consider to be extremely high.

""80% Tariff on China seems right! Up to Scott B,"" Trump said in a Truth Social post, referring to a planned meeting between Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and counterparts from China in Switzerland this weekend.

Brian Bourke, global chief commercial officer at SEKO Logistics, told CNBC that his clients continue to struggle in understanding how all of the various tariff provisions are stacked, or in some cases cancel each other out.

""This confusion has led them to continually alter and update their scenario planning, freezing any other decisions for the business they would be making,"" said Bourke. ""Many of our clients priced and sold their products or projects prior to the tariff amounts being announced, and with the speed and severity as well as the quantity of new tariff provisions being announced, they are not able to change the pricing on items that have already sold and are arriving in May and June, or beyond.""

The number of freight vessels and shipping containers headed to the U.S. from China has plummeted since the tariffs announcement in early April.

Across the Asia-North America West Coast and Asia-North America East Coast trade routes, there was a total of 90 blank sailings across April and May, according to Sea-Intelligence. The Ocean Alliance (a freight consortium including Chinese-owned and operated COSCO and OOCL, Taiwan-based Evergreen, and French-owned CMA) accounted for 48 of those canceled sailings.

Bookings are down anywhere from 30% to 50%, according to logistics providers and ocean carriers.

According to the Global Port Tracker report released on Friday by the National Retail Federation and Hackett Associates, import cargo at the nation's major container ports is expected to see its first year-over-year decline since 2023 as a result of the tariffs.

In addition to decreased vessel sailings as a result of paused manufacturing orders from shippers and fewer containers to fill, ocean carriers are using smaller vessels to move trade. MSC, the largest ocean carrier in the world, along with the Gemini Alliance (comprised of Maersk and Hapag Lloyd), are among the freight companies using smaller vessels between the Asia-North America West Coast routes.

MSC has reduced its container capacity by 28% year-over-year, according to Sea-Intelligence data analyzing the impact of canceled sailings and vessel changes, while Ocean Alliance container capacity is down by 26% year-over-year.

Bourke said once shippers have finished bringing in what they consider essential stocks, they are in various degrees of ""wait-and-see"" mode with their supply chains, and continuing to cancel orders from China, which has led to widespread fears about product shortages and the potential for empty shelves. ""What happens when safety stocks that had been built up disappear?"" Bourke said.

President Donald Trump on Friday tepidly backed the idea of raising taxes on the richest Americans, while openly wrestling with the politics of such a move and suggesting that his fellow Republicans should ""probably"" oppose it.

Trump's public deliberation on social media came after he reached out to House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., about adding a tax hike on the highest earners to the major tax and spending bill that the GOP aims to pass this year.

It's the latest signal that Trump — whose agenda leans heavily on what he calls the ""one, big, beautiful bill"" passing through a divided Congress — is willing to buck the traditional Republican orthodoxy on taxing the rich.

Trump in the Truth Social post Friday morning said he ""and all others"" would ""graciously"" accept ""even a 'TINY' tax increase for the RICH"" for the benefit of ""lower and middle income workers.""

But ""the problem"" with that idea, he wrote, ""is that the Radical Left Democrat Lunatics would go around screaming, 'Read my lips,' the fabled Quote by George Bush the Elder that is said to have cost him the Election.""

""The problem with even a ""TINY"" tax increase for the RICH, which I and all others would graciously accept in order to help the lower and middle income workers, is that the Radical Left Democrat Lunatics would go around screaming,""Read my lips,"" the fabled Quote by George Bush the Elder that is said to have cost him the Election. NO, Ross Perot cost him the Election! In any event, Republicans should probably not do it, but I'm OK if they do!!!"" — Donald Trump, Truth Social post

Trump was referring to then-candidate George H.W. Bush's 1988 campaign promise that he would not raise taxes as president. Bush's eventual failure to keep that promise created a major target for his political opponents and was seen as a factor in his loss in the 1992 election.

Trump's post disputed that history. ""NO, Ross Perot cost him the Election!"" he wrote.

""In any event, Republicans should probably not do it,"" Trump added.

But then, apparently reversing himself, he wrote, ""I'm OK if they do!!!""

The post could put even more pressure on GOP leaders who are already struggling to craft a bill that meets Trump's demands for a slew of major tax cuts, without adding so much to the deficit that the party's fiscal hawks won't vote for it.

Trump promised on the campaign trail and as president that he would eliminate taxes on overtime pay, on service workers' tips and on Social Security for seniors, while extending the corporate tax cuts implemented in 2017 during his first term.

Rep. Jason Smith, R-Mo., chairman of the tax-focused House Ways and Means Committee, is scheduled to meet with Trump on Friday, Politico first reported.

On Thursday, Johnson told Republicans that they will not be able to pay for the $4.5 trillion in tax cuts that they had previously been targeting, according to Politico.

Trump, in a phone call with Johnson on Wednesday, floated the idea of a higher tax bracket for top earners, albeit with a carve-out for small businesses, CNBC reported.

Trump also proposed closing the ""carried interest loophole,"" a feature of the tax code taken advantage of by Wall Street investors, NBC News reported.

President Donald Trump indicated Friday ahead of key trade talks that he was willing to lower tariffs on China to 80%, but that level may still be higher than what investors and business leaders were hoping for.

Trump said in a Truth Social post: ""80% Tariff on China seems right! Up to Scott B."" Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent is one of the U.S. officials set to speak with counterparts from China at meetings in Switzerland this weekend.

An 80% levy would be a significant reduction from the 145% tariff currently facing many Chinese goods. However, that number could still be seen as prohibitive to trade. It is also much higher than the 10% baseline tariff in the U.S.-U.K. trade agreement that was announced Thursday.

It is unclear whether Trump wants the 80% rate to be the long-term tariff for China, or whether it should be viewed as a step in negotiations.

In a separate post, Trump said ""Many Trade Deals in the hopper, all good (GREAT!) ones!""

China is seen as the key hurdle in Trump's effort to shake up the global trading environment. While many other major countries saw his previously announced tariffs partially paused on April 9, tensions rose between the White House and Beijing until both countries had imposed a tariff of more than 100% on goods.

China is one of the U.S.' largest trading partners. In 2024, the U.S. exported $143.5 billion in goods to China, while importing $438.9 billion, according to the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative.

In another Truth Social post on Friday morning, Trump said, ""CHINA SHOULD OPEN UP ITS MARKET TO USA — WOULD BE SO GOOD FOR THEM!!! CLOSED MARKETS DON'T WORK ANYMORE!!!""

The talks in Switzerland this weekend are not expected to result in a full trade deal. U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said Thursday on ""Power Lunch"" that he wants the discussions to result in ""stability"" that could be ""a foundation for something more.""

The latest shipping data shows a drastic decline in the amount of goods moving from China to the U.S., leading to concerns about the potential for higher prices or even shortages of certain goods in the coming weeks.

Friday's comments on China tariff rates appear to signal a shift for Trump. The president said on Wednesday he would not lower tariffs in order to get China to the negotiating table.

America's supply chain is under attack.

From coast to coast, organized criminal groups are hitting trucks on the road, breaking into warehouses and pilfering expensive items from train cars, according to industry experts and law enforcement officials CNBC interviewed during a six-month investigation.

It's all part of a record surge in cargo theft in which criminal networks in the U.S. and abroad exploit technology intended to improve supply chain efficiency and use it to steal truckloads of valuable products. Armed with doctored invoices, the fraudsters impersonate the staff of legitimate companies in order to divert cargo into the hands of criminals.

The widespread scheme is ""low risk and a very high reward,"" according to Keith Lewis, vice president of Verisk CargoNet, which tracks theft trends in the industry.

""The return on investment is almost 100%,"" he said. ""And if there's no risk of getting caught, why not do it better and do it faster?""

In 2024, Verisk CargoNet recorded 3,798 incidents of cargo theft, representing a 26% increase over 2023.

Total reported losses topped nearly $455 million, according to Verisk CargoNet, but industry experts told CNBC that number is likely lower than the true toll because many cases go unreported. Numerous experts who spoke to CNBC estimate losses are close to $1 billion or more a year.

Train cargo thefts alone shot up about 40% in 2024, with more than 65,000 reported incidents, according to the Association of American Railroads.

Industry experts and law enforcement officials say a more sophisticated and insidious form of cargo theft called strategic theft is also on the rise.

The way the system is supposed to work is this: A shipper pays a broker, and the broker, after taking its fee, pays the carrier, the trucking company that moves the load.

In strategic theft, criminals use deceptive tactics to trick shippers, brokers or carriers into handing cargo or legitimate payments, sometimes both, over to them instead of the legitimate companies.

Strategic theft represented 8% of all cargo theft in 2020, according to Verisk CargoNet figures, but by the end of 2024, it had risen to represent about one-third.

Tracking down the fraudsters, particularly if they are overseas, is almost an impossible task, Lewis said.

""Think of identity theft,"" Lewis said. ""Think of a friend that's had their identity stolen or their credit card stolen. There's no difference ... There's no bread crumb trail to follow. It's a ghost.""

Verisk CargoNet said it has tracked criminal groups that have tried to disrupt the U.S. supply chain to origins in 32 countries.

""There's no deterrent for these guys,"" said Jerry Jacobs, who oversees risk management at Prosponsive Logistics in Atlanta. The company is a broker connecting shippers with the carriers that move their products.

In an interview with CNBC, Jacobs said the criminals ""literally have a license to steal.""

""You're hiding out in a foreign country, and all you need is a cell phone and a computer to conduct this type of fraud,"" he said.

""Every day, we're seeing the bad guys trying to infiltrate our network. And our sales reps have to constantly stay vigilant,"" Jacobs said. ""I say this all the time to my sales folks, that there's probably a 33% chance that you're going to be talking to a bad guy that's looking to steal freight.""

Jacobs told CNBC during his interview in February that he was actively dealing with a fraud case. The offenders had stolen his company's identity and were booking shipments, he said. Their goal was to convince a legitimate trucking company to pick up a shipment and unwittingly deliver it so that the criminals, rather than the real carriers, would get paid, he said.

Jacobs showed CNBC the online platform used by brokers to book shipments, called DAT Freight and Analytics. There were listings purportedly initiated by his company, but they weren't legitimate — they were booked, he said, by the criminals.

""Right now, we're dealing with a ton of calls about this,"" Jacobs said at the time. ""A lot of [carriers], unfortunately, picked up the shipment already for the bad guys, and they have already delivered it for the bad guys.""

Weeks later, Jacobs was still dealing with the fallout. He said some of the loads were delivered, but not others, suggesting cargo and payments were stolen in the scheme. None of the carriers were paid, he said.

Jacobs said crime costs the average consumer, too, as cargo theft fuels retail price increases.

""I have to pay more at the grocery store, at the checkout line, because these bad guys want to come in and steal freight,"" he said.

Barry Conlon, founder and CEO of Overhaul, an in-transit supply chain security and risk management company based in Austin, Texas, said the crime groups are very familiar with how freight is moved across the U.S.

""They have people who are literally pulling the information off websites, scraping it, in some cases,"" Conlon told CNBC. ""And then they're attacking at a chosen location once they see the product they want. And it's literally gone into the supply chain within days.""

He contrasted the ease and payoff of cargo theft to the high risk and often lower reward of a bank robbery.

""Rob a million-dollar load, that's going to give you hundreds of thousands of dollars in return. And there's literally no risk,"" he said.

Cargo theft, which is almost always nonviolent, is considered a property crime. According to industry experts, it's underreported for a reason.

""A lot of cases, they don't report it because they feel they're not going to get it back. It's been weeks since they lost it and they've just found out about it,"" Conlon said.

Overhaul estimates there will be a 22% increase in incidents of cargo theft in 2025, according to the company's most recent report on trends in the industry.

Scott Cornell, the national transportation leader for insurance company Travelers Insurance, said he is also alarmed at what he's seeing in the industry.

""[There are] two things that I always point out about the organized cargo theft rings that are committing these crimes,"" Cornell said. ""They know what to steal and when to steal it, and they're really good at return on investment.""

Food and beverage is the thieves' No. 1 targeted commodity, according to Verisk CargoNet.

""It's consumable. So, the evidence disappears,"" Cornell said. ""It's hard to chase. If you're a cargo theft investigator and you're trying to do a recovery investigation, the evidence is going be consumed, right? Or it's going to spoil. There's no barcode on a pistachio.""

Household goods are the second-most commonly targeted cargo, followed by electronics, Verisk CargoNet found.

Cargo loss isn't something many retailers are eager to talk about.

Meta, which was hit by a $500,000 theft of its Ray-Ban and Oculus glasses last year in Texas, declined to comment to CNBC. Nike, whose sneakers are favorites of cargo thieves, according to police and court records, did not respond to repeated requests for comment.

The problem is ""noticeably increasing,"" said Birger Buesching, head of the supply chain for Philips' personal health consumer business, which includes Sonicare toothbrushes and Norelco shavers, among other products.

""Two, three years ago, I didn't have to worry about this,"" Buesching told CNBC in February at the Manifest Conference in Las Vegas, where companies that focus on the supply chain showcased solutions to protect it. ""But we do see an uptick in any kind of commercial shipments, bigger value shipments that are going out to our customers or traditional retail customers.""

Replacing a stolen load is not so simple, he said.

""First of all, we can't ship that load on time and in full as we promise, so we're letting our customers down,"" Buesching said. ""Often we have safety stock, so we can usually backfill orders very quickly, within days. But especially when you have custom-made products, then it might take a little longer, because you have to make more of that product.""

Ellen Kapiloff, vice president of operations for North and Central America at Lacoste, said the threat of cargo theft can lead to inventory challenges on the floor.

""If you're a consumer and you wanted this shirt and we only made 100 of them and 50 of them were stolen, we are strategically going to place the other 50 in a different location, as well as a different channel,"" Kapiloff told CNBC in an interview at the Manifest conference. ""So, it might not be available to you at a store or online when you want it.""

Coincidentally, in February, just 10 days after CNBC spoke with Kapiloff, California Highway Patrol's Cargo Theft Interdiction Program served a search warrant at a store in Los Angeles' fashion district. Officers found five boxes containing Lacoste slides footwear that law enforcement said was part of a large cargo heist.

California sees more cargo theft than any other state in the U.S.

In a separate case, in May 2024, athletic apparel retailer Lululemon reported a burglary at a distribution center in Ontario, California, in which thieves made off with ""well over a million dollars' worth of Lululemon product,"" according to the California Highway Patrol.

Police said a person was arrested on suspicion of selling the stolen goods.

In a statement to CNBC, Lululemon said, ""Retail crime, including cargo theft, is a serious industry-wide challenge, and we are taking decisive action to combat it. ... In this specific case, our collaborative investigation led to arrests and recovery of stolen products.""

While there are financial impacts, cargo theft has been mentioned only sparingly in public companies' earnings conference calls and investor webcasts over the last year.

Knight-Swift is the industry's largest full truckload carrier, but it has only spoken publicly about cargo theft once in the past year, according to a CNBC document search. CEO Adam Miller noted on the company's October earnings call that it is ""starting to hear a lot more comments around cargo security.""

""I've gone to different conferences here over the last few months, and cargo theft is now a prevailing topic when it really wasn't discussed that much in the past,"" Miller said.

On a January conference call for transportation company Landstar, Chief Financial Officer Jim Todd explained to investors that the increase in its insurance and claim costs in 2024 compared with 2023 was ""primarily attributable to increased severity on cargo claims, primarily due to cargo theft and fraud in the supply chain.""

Trucking company J.B. Hunt mentioned cargo theft more often over the past year than other publicly traded companies in the industry, though it was still light on details. In April 2024, the company's president of highway services, Bradley Hicks, said technology has ""opened new avenues for bad actors to engage in sophisticated strategic theft, giving these organized groups access to thousands of loads through our platform.""

Hicks added J.B. Hunt is ""making some adjustments to harden the security of our system.""

Not everyone is raising alarms.

C.H. Robinson has 450,000 contracted carriers and handles more than $23 billion in freight annually. The company's success rate in deterring theft and fraud is ""99.999%,"" according to Michael Castagnetto, C.H. Robinson's North American surface transportation president, who oversees cargo theft for the logistics company.

""In January, for example, our North American trucking division recorded only two incidents. To put that in perspective: We move over 5 million truckload shipments a year,"" Castagnetto told CNBC.

Castagnetto said the company has strategies to weed out potential fraudsters, but, he added, ""I can't give you all the details, because we don't want the bad actors to know how we catch them.""

Cargo transportation companies of all sizes are working to address the rise in theft.

Zak Bowyer, vice president of sales support operations at TQL, the second-largest freight brokerage firm in the U.S., said the company has invested $4 million in technology and specialized personnel to combat the issue.

Nolan Transportation Group said in a statement that protecting customers from cargo theft is a ""top priority.""

""We take a proactive, data-driven approach, focusing on early detection and prevention to ensure the security of shipments,"" Katie Wild, vice president of marketing at Nolan, said in the statement. ""We continuously strengthen our carrier onboarding process with additional security measures and increased real-time monitoring to proactively address fraudulent activities and identify suspicious behavior before it escalates.""

DAT Freight and Analytics, the online platform widely used by brokers to book shipments, shows where freight is being moved around the country by a carrier and the broker that handled the transaction.

Jeff Hopper, the chief marketing officer of DAT, said 90% of all fraud that takes place in the cargo industry is identity theft. He said Prosponsive Logistics ""reported the phishing attack to DAT, and we worked with them to address it. We encourage all customers to report suspicious activity so we can respond appropriately.""

To combat strategic theft, he said DAT employs a team that spots attempts at illegal activity about a dozen times a day.

""We have a whole team of people that that's all they do all day long — 25 people all day long — is chase these things down and remove those people that we know to be bad actors,"" Hopper said. ""Our biggest investment that we're making is to fight that battle and to put the protections in place for our customers so that they don't have to worry about that.""

Targeting criminals before they disrupt the supply chain is the core business for Highway, a security company based in Dallas.

""It's like a virus,"" Highway CEO Jordan Graft said in an interview. ""So, whenever an industry or a segment becomes infected, it spreads. ... These aren't just single individual actors deciding to wake up one day and say, 'I'm going to target freight brokers in the U.S.' They're working in groups and cohorts.""

Highway itself is also regularly targeted by criminal groups trying to infiltrate the security service and disrupt its ability to flag fraud to clients, it said.

The company said its software blocked more than 914,000 fraud attempts last year. It also said 9,829 carrier users from 75 countries tried to get unauthorized access to its platform. The company said it believes those users wanted to steal the identity of legitimate motor carriers.

Highway said most of those attempts originated from six countries: India, Mexico, Moldova, Pakistan, Serbia and Uzbekistan.

Highway alerts its customers if there's a change to a company's phone number, email or address on the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration's site, where shippers register.

""If [hackers] can gain access to the carrier's information, if they can get control of the carrier's email inbox or they can phish the carrier to sharing a code with them, then they can change that information,"" Graft said. ""So, doing it thousands of times a month — it's relatively easy.""

He said the FMCSA needs better support to protect carriers, brokers and shippers, a concern that several brokers shared with CNBC.

""I think they are doing the best they can,"" Graft said. ""You're asking an under-resourced government agency whose mandate is motor carrier safety to try and attempt to fight a cybercrime attack on behalf of an entire industry.""

Chris Burroughs, CEO of the Transportation Intermediaries Association, agreed that it's been ""too easy for these scammers"" to hack the FMCSA system.

""The fraud has been going on for years. These are well-organized crime rings,"" he said.

FMCSA spokesman Matt Schuck, in a statement to CNBC, said: ""The agency continuously introduces security enhancements and upgrades to help safeguard the commercial motor vehicle industry and the American public. Recent initiatives to combat cargo theft include implementing multi-factor authentication across all FMCSA systems and strengthening security protocols. Additionally, FMCSA is developing a modernized registration system featuring even stronger safeguards and processes.""

In response to the surge in cargo theft, U.S. Rep. David Valadao, R-Calif., along with other lawmakers, in April introduced a bipartisan bill called the Combating Organized Retail Crime Act. The bill would set up a coordination center within the Department of Homeland Security tasked with fighting cargo theft and organized retail crime.

""It incorporates the FBI and Homeland Security,"" Valadao told CNBC, ""and it creates the task force [to] communicate with my local agencies but also amongst themselves so that they can be informed about what's going on ... around the district or even around the country.""

The legislation is pending.

On the other side of Congress, the Senate Subcommittee on Surface Transportation, Freight, Pipelines, and Safety has taken a particular focus on cargo theft.

""In this era of increasing permeability of our southern border, in particular, we've seen a lot of criminal elements come through, including those who are engaging in cargo theft,"" said Sen. Todd Young, R-Ind., who chairs the subcommittee.

In an interview in his Senate office, Young said the FMCSA is ""unable"" to identify and remove fraudsters from online shipping systems.

""That means a lot in this age of e-commerce, when people depend on this website,"" he said, ""to identify appropriate shippers and to trust in that information.""

The Household Goods Shipping Consumer Protection Act, a bipartisan bill introduced in the Senate, would give the FMCSA authority to impose civil penalties and other stricter regulations against fraudsters.

DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — U.S. President Donald Trump will touch down in the Persian Gulf region – or as he may soon be calling it, the Arabian Gulf – on May 13, for an official trip with stops in Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates. 

The stakes are high, as the visits take place amid turbulent geopolitical tensions. On the agenda will be Israel-Gaza war ceasefire talks, oil, trade, investment deals, and the potential for new policy developments in the areas of advanced semiconductor exports and nuclear programs.

""We expect to see a lot of announcements. And I think in a broad spectrum of areas as well,"" Monica Malik, chief economist at Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank, told CNBC's Dan Murphy on Friday. She noted the potential removal of Trump's 10% tariffs on aluminum and steel, which would be a positive for the Gulf states as some of them export those metals to the U.S., though they make up only a small percentage of the countries' GDPs. 

Trump has long enjoyed a warm relationship with Gulf Arab states, in particular the UAE and Saudi Arabia, where his children have several business ventures and planned real estate projects. Those relationships could strengthen the countries' hands when it comes to negotiating new trade deals – while also raising concerns among critics over potential conflicts of interest, accusations the Trump family rejects. 

During the president's initial term in office, his first overseas trip was to Saudi Arabia – a country now hosting the negotiations that Trump hopes will end the Russia-Ukraine war, making the kingdom ever more important to Washington. Qatar, meanwhile, has played a central role in negotiations between Israel and Hamas over ceasefires and hostage releases.  

The presidential visit is drawing several Wall Street and Silicon Valley titans to the Saudi kingdom. A Saudi-U.S. investment forum announced just this week and set to take place on May 13 in Riyadh will feature guests including BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, Palantir CEO Alex Karp, and CEOs of major firms like Citigroup, IBM, Qualcomm, Alphabet, and Franklin Templeton, among others. White House AI and crypto czar David Sacks will also be in attendance. 

""We also expect to see a lot of investment deals being announced,"" Malik said. ""And both ways, we've already seen the UAE announce a number of investments in the U.S. in areas such as AI, energy, aluminum, but we also think that there will be opportunities for U.S. companies to increase investment.""

Both Saudi Arabia and the UAE have invested heavily in AI infrastructure with the goal of becoming global hubs for the technology. Therefore, likely top of mind for those leaders is the future of U.S. semiconductor exports, the most advanced of which they so far have not gained access to due to national security concerns. But that may soon be changing.

The Trump administration on Wednesday announced its plan to rescind a Biden era ""AI diffusion rule,"" which imposed strict export controls on advanced AI chips, even to U.S.-friendly nations. The rule will be replaced with ""a much simpler rule that unleashes American innovation and ensures American AI dominance,"" a U.S. Commerce Department spokesperson said Wednesday, though the details of the new rule have not yet been shared. 

UAE-based AI firm G42 has made efforts to align with U.S. regulations, including divesting from Chinese companies and partnering with Microsoft, which last year invested $1.5 billion in G42.

The Trump administration has been actively engaged in talks with Iran over its nuclear program – talks that the UAE and Saudi Arabia have expressed support for. That enthusiasm marks a stark contrast to those countries' attitudes toward any U.S. deals with Tehran during the Obama years. 

At the same time, Saudi Arabia wants its own civilian nuclear program and has asked the U.S. for approvals and assistance in this direction. Any U.S. support for a Saudi nuclear program was previously contingent on Saudi Arabia normalizing diplomatic relations with U.S. ally Israel – but that could change during this visit, according to media reports citing sources with knowledge of the matter. 

U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright, during a visit to the kingdom in April, said that Saudi Arabia and the U.S. were on a ""pathway"" to a civil nuclear agreement – but that any further announcements would come from Trump himself. 

Another major topic will be the future of Gaza. Trump has vowed to bring about an end to the war, while also controversially suggesting that the U.S. could take control of the war-ravaged Strip which he described as ""important real estate,"" comments that drew strong rebukes from Arab leaders. 

The U.S. has continued to push for ceasefire deals, most recently floating a 21-day cessation of hostilities and release of some hostages, while Israel this week approved expanding fighting and territorial control in Gaza. 

""We have yet to hear a comprehensive plan from the Arab world,"" Greg Branch, founder of UAE-based Branch Global Capital Advisors, told CNBC on Friday while discussing Trump's upcoming visit. 

""If we're going to see a response that's going to be Arab-led, it's probably now or never,"" Branch said. ""I think that will be handled very delicately behind the scenes … probably more of a long-term geopolitical risk than any immediate macro risk.""

Branch suggested that lifting U.S. sanctions on Syria under its new government could also potentially be discussed. Meanwhile, reports that the Trump administration will announce a U.S. renaming of the Persian Gulf to the Arabian Gulf would be enthusiastically welcomed by Arab states, but could draw severe anger from Iran at a time of delicate nuclear negotiations with Tehran. 

Oil prices will also be in focus; Trump has long pushed OPEC states, led by Saudi Arabia, to pump more oil to lower prices for American consumers. For a combination of reasons, Saudi Arabia is doing precisely that – but it may have to change course in the coming months if prices stay subdued, hurting the kingdom's revenues. 

In that vein, financing will be an important agenda item for the kingdom during Trump's visit, according to ADCB's Malik. 

Saudi Arabia in November pledged to invest $600 billion in the U.S. over the course of Trump's term — but it also has sky-high costs for its own Vision 2030 investment ambitions. Lower global oil prices and big-ticket public spending projects have brought about widening budget deficits for Riyadh.  

""With oil prices where they are, Saudi will look at more financing support from America as well as they look to progress with their investment program,"" Malik said.

Germany needs to take more risks and boost its stagnant economy with a decade of investment in infrastructure, German Minister for Economic Affairs and Energy Katherina Reiche said Friday.

""The next decade will be the decade of infrastructure investments in bridges, in energy infrastructure, in storage, in maritime infrastructure... telecommunication. And for this, we need speed. We need speed and investments, and we need private capital,"" Reiche told CNBC's Annette Weisbach on the sidelines of the Tegernsee summit.

While 10% of investments could be taken care of with public money, the remaining 90% relied on the private sector, she said.

The newly minted economy minister also addressed regulation coming from Brussels, warning that it could hinder companies from investments and start-ups from growing if it is too restrictive. Germany has had to learn that investments comes with risks ""and we have to kind of be open for taking more risks,"" she said.

Initiating regulatory changes will in fact be one of the most important jobs for the new German government, Veronika Grimm, member of the German Council of Economic Experts, told CNBC on the sidelines of the Tegernsee summit.

""It will be important to adjust regulation, so removing or changing innovation-stifling regulation so that more is possible again in many areas of technology,"" she said in comments translated by CNBC.

""And then of course it is about improving the environment or businesses, making it more attractive so that we are competitive again,"" Grimm said.

Germany's economy contracted slightly on an annual basis in both 2023 and 2024 and the quarterly gross domestic product has been flipping between growth and contraction for over two years now, just about managing to avoid a technical recession. Preliminary data for the first quarter of 2025 showed a 0.2% expansion.

Forecasts do not suggest much of a reprieve from the sluggishness, with the now former German government last month saying it still expects the economy to stagnate this year.

""This country needs an economic turnaround. After two years of recessions the previous government had to announce again [a] zero growth year for 2025 and we really have to work on this. So on the top of the agenda is an investor booster,"" economy minister Reiche said.

Lowering energy prices, stabilizing the security of energy supply and reducing bureaucracy were among the key points on the agenda, she added.

This is despite a major fiscal U-turn announced earlier this year, which included changes to the country's long-standing debt rules to allow for additional defense spending and a 500-billion-euro ($562.4 billion) infrastructure package.

Several of Germany's key industries are under pressure. The auto industry for example is dealing with stark competition from China and now faces tariffs, while issues in housebuilding and infrastructure have been linked to higher costs and bureaucratic hurdles.

Trade is also a key pillar for the German economy and therefore uncertainty from U.S. President Donald Trump's changing tariff policies are weighing heavily on the outlook.

In this article

Lyft shares climbed 23% Friday after the ride-sharing company upped its share buyback plan and posted better-than-expected gross bookings.

During an interview with CNBC's ""Squawk Box,"" CEO David Risher said that Lyft isn't seeing ""anything to worry about"" despite widespread concerns of a slowing consumer amid ongoing economic uncertainty.

""Our team is stronger than it's ever been, and the consumer demand is absolutely there,"" he said.

Gross bookings grew 13% from a year ago to $4.16 billion, slightly beating a $4.15 billion estimate from StreetAccount. The company said the quarter was its 16th straight period of gross bookings growth.

Rides increased 16% to 218.4 million, topping a FactSet estimate of 215.1 million.

Lyft's revenues grew 14% during the first quarter from a year ago to $1.45 billion, but fell short of a $1.47 billion estimate from LSEG. The company reported net income of $2.57 million, or 1 cent per share. That's up from a net loss of $31.54 million, or 8 cents per share, a year ago.

The board also authorized boosting Lyft's share repurchase plan to $750 million from $500 million. The company said it aims to use $500 million over the next year.

Activist investor Engine Capital said Friday it would halt its campaign at Lyft and withdraw its nominations to the company's board of directors, citing the share buyback news.

""Following a series of productive conversations, the Board has taken an important first step by committing to significant share repurchases in the coming quarters,"" founder and portfolio manager Arnaud Ajdler said in a release.

Shares of ride-sharing competitor Uber declined earlier this week after posting mixed first-quarter results.

Goldman Sachs upgraded shares to a buy from a neutral rating following the report, citing rides and bookings growth and ""strong execution in a stable industry backdrop.""

The U.K. and U.S. agreed to a landmark trade deal on Thursday — yet the agreement appears to be far from free of tariffs.

The deal is the first made by the United States since President Donald Trump unveiled his so-called reciprocal tariffs on countries around the world last month.

The United Kingdom's position as one of a handful of countries where the U.S. boasts a trade surplus in goods — meaning the U.S. exports more to the U.K. than it imports — put the country at the front of the queue for officials to broker an agreement with the Trump administration.

However, even Britain, with its ""special relationship"" with the U.S., didn't manage to persuade Trump to drop all tariffs during trade talks.

Under the deal, the U.K. can export 100,000 vehicles each year at a 10% rate, with any additional vehicles facing 25% duties. British steelmakers and the aluminum industry will be able to export tariff-free, down from the 25% rate that the U.S. imposed in February.

However, all other goods imported to the U.S. from the U.K. will still be subject to a 10% baseline tariff — which Trump says is the lowest country-specific tariff that will be applied to trading partners.

Trump also suggested the deal is likely to be rare due to the two countries' balanced trading relationship and close political ties — meaning it's unlikely any country will be tariff-free under his second administration.

Asked if the 10% baseline tariff is a template for future trade deals, Trump said, ""That's a low number.""

""They made a good deal,"" he added. ""Some will be much higher because they have massive trade surpluses.""

Analysts took that to mean that tariffs of 10% at the very minimum are the best deal other countries and trading blocs could achieve.

""The details of the US-UK deal suggest that the US 10% baseline tariff is likely to remain in place for other trading partners with virtually no exceptions, but signals more flexibility than expected on sectoral tariffs,"" said Jan Hatzius, chief economist and head of global investment research at Goldman Sachs.

JPMorgan's U.S. economist, Abiel Reinhart, also noted that ""the chances that a rate of at least 10% on most goods across most countries could be maintained this year,"" in a note to clients.

Reinhart also pointed out that the carve-outs the United Kingdom secured for its auto, steel and aluminum sectors indicated the U.S. may be willing to cut bespoke — yet narrower in scope — deals with other nations.

""This has been a key sticking point in recent trade discussions with Japan, given the importance of its auto sector,"" Reinhart added. ""But it's also possible that the US was more willing to make concessions with the UK on autos given that the UK only accounts for about 2.5% of US imports of vehicles and parts. By contrast, Japan accounts for close to 12%.""

However, Rella Suskin, equity analyst and autos expert at Morningstar, pointed out that the deal to reduce tariffs on only 100,000 cars effectively capped the market share of many of Britain's largest automakers, including Tata Motors-owned Jaguar Land Rover.

Instead, it would benefit automakers such as BMW that import some auto parts tariff-free and assemble vehicles in the U.S., according to Suskin.

""The limitation of the benefit of the UK being able to export 100 000 cars annually to the US at a 10% tariff means that Jaguar is unable to take any market share from a 'preferential' tariff relative to European automakers,"" Suskin said.

Andrew Hood, head of international trade at European law firm Fieldfisher and former advisor to British Prime Minister David Cameron, said the deal did more to support ""the wider UK-US relationship"" than help smooth trade between the two countries.

""It is notable that the deal is far more restricted than most Free Trade Agreements,"" Hood said. ""Rather, the deal focuses on supporting particular sectors, notably the automotive industry, ethanol producers and the steel and aluminium manufacturers where tariffs have been substantially reduced or eliminated.""

As damaging the residual 10% tariffs could be for the U.K., others point out the deal could dent U.S. economic growth, too.

""While exemptions will nibble away at the effective tariff rate, with the baseline 10% not going anywhere, the average US tariff is still set to remain in double digits, which will deliver a big hit to real incomes in the US which will cause growth to slow sharply in the second half of the year,,"" said Michael Pearce, deputy chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics.

China's exports surged in April on the back of a jump in shipments to Southeast Asian countries, offsetting a sharp drop in outbound goods to the U.S. as prohibitive tariffs kicked in.

Exports jumped 8.1% last month in U.S. dollar terms from a year earlier, according to data released by customs authority on Friday, sharply beating Reuters' poll estimates of a 1.9% rise.

Imports slumped by just 0.2% in April from a year earlier, compared with economists' expectations of a 5.9% drop.

China's shipments to the U.S. plunged over 21% in April year on year, while imports dropped nearly 14%, according to CNBC's calculation of official customs data. Chinese U.S.-bound shipments had risen 9.1% in March, as exporters rushed to frontload orders ahead of tariff hikes.

In the first four months this year, China's exports to the U.S. dropped 2.5% while imports fell 4.7% from a year earlier, according to official data.

The surge in overall exports could be partly due to transshipment through third countries and contracts that were signed before the tariffs were announced, Zhiwei Zhang, president and chief economist at Pinpoint asset management said in a note. Zhang expects trade data to weaken gradually in the next few months.

China's exports to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations surged 20.8% in April from a year earlier, accelerating from a 11.6% growth in March. While Vietnam and Malaysia remained the main destinations for Chinese exports to the region, Indonesia and Thailand saw shipments from China grow 37% and 28% year on year, respectively.

Meanwhile, China's exports to the European Union rose 8.3%, while imports fell 16.5% year on year. Exports had risen by 10.3%, while imports had dropped 7.5% in March.

U.S. President Donald Trump has placed tariffs of 145% on imports from China, prompting it to retaliate with tariffs of 125% on American imports. So far, both sides have sought to blunt the economic impact of triple-digit levies by granting exemptions on certain critical products.

The number of container vessels from China to the U.S. had dropped dramatically toward the end of April, Raymond Yeung, chief economist for Greater China at ANZ Bank said in a note Thursday.

Chinese authorities have ramped up stimulus efforts in recent weeks to counter the impact from tariffs on its economy, with steps including easing monetary policy and measures to support tariff-hit businesses.

China's factory activity fell to a 16-month low in April, with a gauge on new export orders dropping to its lowest since December 2022.

Concerns have been growing that the fallout from tariffs would soon spill over to the job market, with Goldman Sachs estimating the county could lose 16 million jobs, or 2% of its labor force, involved in the production of U.S.-bound goods.

The latest purchasing managers' index indicated that employment fell across the board last month, as manufacturers started to halt production and put workers on paid leave.

Local Chinese governments and major businesses have voiced support to help tariff-hit exporters redirect their products to the domestic market for sale, a move that will likely deepen deflationary pressure in the country.

China is set to release its consumer and wholesale inflation data on Saturday, which will likely show a sustained deflation. Consumer price index is forecast to slip 0.1% from a year ago and the producer price index decline 2.8%, according to economists polled by Reuters.

The benchmark CSI 300 index fell 0.23% on Friday. Chinese offshore yuan was steady at 7.2483 per U.S. dollar.

Investors would follow closely the upcoming meeting between U.S. and Chinese officials in Switzerland over the weekend that has raised the prospects for a potential de-escalation in the ongoing trade war.

The planned meeting would mark the first high-level U.S.-China trade talks since the latest tariff escalations in April. U.S. Senator Steve Daines met Chinese Premier Li Qiang in Beijing in March.

While reaching a comprehensive deal is likely to be complex and time-consuming, a phased rollback of tariffs from both sides is possible, although analysts are split on the pace of such de-escalation.

""Tariff de-escalation, if it materializes, would serve as a major positive for Chinese equities,"" said Laura Wang, equity strategist at Morgan Stanley, while cautioning that the negotiation process would be ""lengthy, with ups and downs.""

The investment bank projects U.S. effective tariffs on Chinese goods could be lowered from the current prohibitive levels to a terminal rate of 45% by year-end, while a ""durable resolution remains elusive.""

A slew of Wall Street banks had lowered their forecasts for China's economic growth this year to around 4%, citing tariff-inflicted pains, what would be a significant shortfall to Beijing's growth target of around 5%.

As President Donald Trump tiptoed away this week from the idea that he might try to win a third term, he opened the door to a fresh round of intrigue: Whom does he see as his successor?

In practically the same breath in an interview with NBC News' ""Meet the Press,"" Trump suggested national security adviser and Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Vice President JD Vance — in that order — as potential candidates.

""You look at Marco, you look at JD Vance, who's fantastic,"" Trump replied when Kristen Welker asked him what gives him confidence that his MAGA movement will continue once he's out of office. ""You look at — I could name 10, 15, 20 people right now just sitting here.""

That he mentioned Rubio at all struck a senior White House aide as notable, given that it was the first time Trump had so publicly identified him as a favorable prospect. And the development, while not exactly surprising to anyone aware of Rubio's long-held White House ambitions, quickly injected the elements of competition and rivalry that Trump has long enjoyed fostering among those who work for him.

Expectations of such a clash are premature and overblown, those close to both Rubio and Vance told NBC News. They are ideological allies and have become good friends.

""They've got a really good personal and professional relationship, so if they're both running, I have no doubt there will be a [conversation] about it beforehand,"" said a person familiar with their relationship, who, like others interviewed for this article, was granted anonymity to offer candid insights about a politically sensitive topic. 

Three people in Rubio's orbit who spoke with NBC News, cognizant of Vance's higher rank in the line of succession and of polling that reinforces his higher standing among Republican voters, see Vance as having right of first refusal on the Republican nomination in 2028.

Among Vance's allies, too, there's no ill will. A person close to Vance emphasized that the two remain extremely close and didn't see a scenario in which Vance and Rubio would run against each other for president in 2028 at this point. 

But Rubio is, without question, ascending in Trump world. His rise was punctuated last week when Trump appointed him as his interim national security adviser. Rubio is the first person to hold both roles at the same time since Henry Kissinger in the mid-1970s.

While internally there has long been an overwhelming sentiment that Vance will be the first in line to carry on Trump's political legacy, even some White House advisers are starting to see him and Rubio on an equal playing field in Trump's estimation.

""President Trump sees them as both very loyal and very talented, I think that's very fair to say,"" a senior Trump adviser said. 

The expanded portfolio is a signal that Rubio, according to four sources who have long advised him, is building a substantial footing that can position him well as the heir apparent to Trump — if Vance stumbles over the next three years.

""You would still have to give the advantage to Vance because he is the sitting vice president,"" a Rubio ally said of the hypothetical 2028 showdown. ""But everyone in Rubio's orbit is feeling really good about how things are playing out. If for any reason Vance isn't the guy or the electorate is seeking an alternative, there is no question that Rubio is in the pole position for that.""

""He is a guy who can speak MAGA but can also gather the confidence of your more traditional Republican,"" this person added.

Another longtime Rubio ally allowed that ""Vance is the guy for now, but as we have seen, for now isn't forever.""

""There is a lot of time,"" this person added. ""Important to remember it's early, but Rubio wears many hats now. That's not by mistake.""

In the meantime, neither Rubio nor Vance is shy about asserting his strengths in meetings with Trump. Just days before the ""Meet the Press"" shoutouts, Rubio sat next to Trump at an hourslong Cabinet meeting wearing a matching blue suit and red tie. At one point, Rubio said he had uncovered that a State Department office built a dossier on someone else seated at the table, identifying the person ""as purveyors of disinformation,"" which he said would soon be turned over.

""Was it me or Elon?"" Vance interrupted, referring to Trump adviser Elon Musk and drawing laughs with what amounted to a flex of his ""deep state"" enmity.

Trump's indulgence in succession talk barely 100 days into his second administration follows his indulgence of scenarios in which he would circumvent the Constitution to serve a third term. The latter has had a freezing effect on the GOP's 2028 field, with no prospective candidate daring to get too far ahead of him.

But Trump backed away from the third-term talk in the ""Meet the Press"" interview, suggesting he would be comfortable going into the history books as an ""eight-year president.""

""So many people want me to do it. I have never had requests so strong as that,"" Trump said, referring to tactics that could circumvent the Constitution. ""But it's something that, to the best of my knowledge, you're not allowed to do.""

Early polls taking stock of a potential 2028 Republican primary field show Vance with a wide plurality, assuming Trump doesn't try to run again, and Rubio in the single digits. A recent Economist/YouGov survey found that 43% of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents who responded picked Vance as their ""ideal"" GOP nominee, followed by Donald Trump Jr. at 11%, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis at 8% and Rubio at 4%.

Critics have for years tried to square the Rubio of the 2016 campaign — in which he ran as an establishment-friendly candidate known for his openness to immigration reform — with the Rubio they now see as embracing a MAGA doctrine. But those close to him say any so-called transformation wasn't some overnight phenomenon that took place once he was picked to be secretary of state.

""He showed the one thing Trump values above any other quality,"" said a longtime Republican operative who has previously supported Rubio — ""loyalty to Trump while going out preaching the gospel of Trump.""

In the years leading up to Trump's second presidential bid, Rubio gravitated toward the school of right-wing thought that has risen in the party — attending National Conservatism conferences popular with then-colleagues like Vance and Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., who are in alignment on several key policy areas in which Trump has led the charge in shifting GOP orthodoxy. 

""I think my instincts have always been where they are now,"" Rubio told NBC News in a 2021 interview. ""As you're exposed to new facts, new realities, and as the world changes, so, too, does your public policy response to it.""

Vance and Rubio became friends when they served together in the Senate. They viewed each other as fellow converts to Trump's movement and as ideological peers on issues that Trump had reoriented Republicans around, like trade. A person close to Rubio said he and Vance are close and ""were very much swimming in the same policy circles.""

Also key to Rubio's ascension in Trump's inner circle has been how much face time he has spent around Trump both in the White House and at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida. Four senior administration officials told NBC News that Rubio spends as much time as he can at the White House to be close to Trump, while a person close to him said he has become a regular at Mar-a-Lago, where Trump spends most weekends.

To the extent that Vance and Rubio were rivals in Trump's running mate search last year, there was limited sniping between their teams and a mutual understanding that both were more in sync with Trumpism than then-North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, another finalist for the job.

Their friendship has tightened in the Trump administration. Each has worked to cultivate and maintain relationships with tastemakers on the far right. Vance and Rubio both, for example, were among the guests at an inaugural ball hosted by Turning Point USA, the group led by influential far-right activist Charlie Kirk.

The vice presidency might offer Vance more built-in steppingstones to the Oval Office. Like Rubio, he has been able to travel the globe, gaining the type of experience that can bolster a White House bid. 

Vance doesn't have the same constraints that Rubio, as a diplomat, faces when it comes to moonlighting in politics and campaigns. His hand is already seen in Ohio's race for governor, a key midterm contest next year that could elevate Trump ally Vivek Ramaswamy. With Trump's blessing, Vance is finance chair for the Republican National Committee — a position that will keep him connected to some of the party's top donors between now and 2028. 

And while Trump seemed to put Vance and Rubio on an equal 2028 plane in the ""Meet the Press"" interview and stopped short of anointing Vance as the favorite, he indicated that the nomination could be Vance's to lose.

""Marco is great. There's a lot of them that are great,"" Trump said. ""I also see tremendous unity. But certainly you would say that somebody's the VP, if that person is outstanding, I guess that person would have an advantage.""

At long last, ESPN has chosen a name for its upcoming all-access streaming service.

Ready?

It's ""ESPN.""

Disney's sports media division will announce the new — and also sort of old — name for the all-access streaming application at a media event next week, according to people familiar with the matter who declined to be named speaking about not-yet-public details. A Disney spokesperson declined to comment.

Disney executives have referred to the streaming product, which is expected to cost $25 or $30 a month, as ""flagship"" internally for the past two years as they have developed the service. It will consist of everything ESPN has to offer, including all games; programming on other ESPN cable networks such as ESPN2 and the SEC Network; ESPN on ABC; fantasy products; new betting tie-ins; studio programming; documentaries and more.

This will differ from ESPN's current streaming product ESPN+, which does not include the most-watched live games, such as Monday Night Football, that currently only air exclusively on traditional pay-TV. ESPN+ costs $11.99 per month and can be bundled with Disney+ and Hulu for $16.99 per month with commercials. ESPN+ will remain a less expensive offering for consumers, according to people familiar with the matter.

ESPN Chairman Jimmy Pitaro decided to name the application ESPN to simplify what has become a cluttered streaming world, filled with different media products that can be bundled with other services at different price points, according to those people. The CNBC Sport newsletter first reported in February that ESPN executives were considering naming the application ESPN among other options.

The new ESPN streaming service is a new distribution mechanism, but most of the content is not new. Rather, the launch is about introducing consumers to a different way customers can access ESPN's programming. That led executives to gravitate toward carrying over the legacy name, said the people.

The ESPN mobile application will be reimagined and act as the gateway to the all-access service on smart TVs and devices. Pay-TV subscribers who already get ESPN will automatically be able to authenticate into the new app to get the digital bells and whistles that are not available through cable TV. That overlap also played into executives' decision to maintain uniformity with the name ESPN, rather than a different name that may increase confusion, the people said.

ESPN will next week announce the pricing of the application, as well as associated bundled discounts, Disney CEO Bob Iger said Wednesday during Disney's quarterly earnings conference call.

ESPN has previously said the service will debut in the fall.

The U.K. is the first country to seal a trade deal with the U.S. Cue the jubilations. And investors certainly did, giving the three major U.S. indexes back-to-back winning sessions. Curiously, the mood across the Atlantic wasn't as upbeat: the U.K.'s FTSE 100 closed lower following the announcement of the agreement.

To be sure, the U.K. extracted some concessions, such as a lower tariff rate on its first 100,000 vehicles exported to the U.S. and securing new discussions for U.S. President Donald Trump's universal 25% levies on steel and aluminum imports.

That said, the deal does seem more advantageous to the U.S., at least based on the fact that a 10% tariff will remain on all U.K. imports, alongside other compromises allowed by Britain.

The U.S. already runs a trade surplus with the U.K., meaning that it exports more to the country than it imports. And a 10% tariff was what Trump slapped on the U.K. on April 2, so there was no reduction in those levies despite both countries reaching an agreement.

""What we heard today is just noise for most U.K. imports. It doesn't affect the majority of products,"" Andy Abbott, CEO of niche ocean liner company Atlantic Container Line, told CNBC's Lori Ann LaRocco.

Based on the available details, Washington seems to have got the better end of the deal.

UK takes lead: strikes a deal with U.S.U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday laid out the outline of a trade agreement with the United Kingdom. Many specifics about the deal were not immediately clear, and nothing was signed during the Oval Office event. A White House fact sheet stated that the U.S. will keep a blanket 10% tariff on U.K. imports, which Trump said will be floor for tariffs. The impact of the deal could be limited, a freight CEO said.

Most markets rally on trade deal newsU.S. stocks climbed Thursday on news of the freshly minted U.S.-U.K. agreement. The S&P 500 added 0.58%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.62% and the Nasdaq Composite advanced 1.07%, boosted by a broad rise in tech shares. The pan-European Stoxx 600 index rose 0.4%. The U.K.'s FTSE 100 dropped 0.32%, giving up earlier gains as the country and the U.S. announced a trade deal and its central bank cut interest rates.

Britain's central bank lowers ratesThe Bank of England on Thursday cut interest rates to 4.25% from 4.5%. The cut had been widely expected, especially after a slowdown in price rises, with annual inflation cooling to 2.6% in March, down from 2.8% the previous month. Five of the BOE's nine policymakers voted for the cut, with two members wanting a larger 50-basis-point reduction, and two wanting to keep rates on hold.

Coinbase misses estimates as bitcoin jumpsCoinbase shares fell nearly 3% in extended trading after it reported first-quarter revenue that failed to meet expectations. The company said consumer trading volume fell 17% from the fourth quarter. The same day, bitcoin prices rose almost 7% to above $100,000 for the first time since February, and a Standard Chartered analyst wrote a tongue-in-cheek apology that his target of $120,000 for bitcoin ""may be too low.""

First American pope electedCardinal Robert Francis Prevost was elected as pope on Thursday, the first time an American has been selected as pontiff of the Roman Catholic Church. Prevost, 69, chose the papal name Leo XIV. Following the news, Trump congratulated the new pope, writing on Truth Social that Leo being the ""first American Pope"" is ""a Great Honor for our Country.""

[PRO] Trade deal only a temporary stimulus?Even though investors cheered the U.S.-U.K. trade deal and sent stocks higher Thursday, CNBC Pro contributor Josh Brown, CEO of Ritzholtz Wealth Management, is keeping his expectations of a prolonged market rebound in check — and points out two defensive tech stocks because they behave more like consumer staples.

Why the Bank of England governor thinks uncertainty is here to stay despite a trade deal

Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey told CNBC on Thursday that the U.K. was heading for more economic uncertainty, despite the country being the first to strike a trade agreement with the U.S. under President Donald Trump's controversial tariff regime.

""The tariff and trade situation has injected more uncertainty,"" Bailey told CNBC in an interview. ""A U.K.-U.S. trade agreement is very welcome in that sense, very welcome. But the U.K. is a very open economy.""

That means that the impact from tariffs on the U.K. economy comes not just from its own trade relationship with Washington, but also from those of the U.S. and the rest of the world, he said.

China's April exports surge despite U.S. tariffsChina's exports in April jumped 8.1% in U.S. dollar terms from a year earlier, according to data released by the country's customs authority on Friday, sharply beating Reuters' poll estimates of a 1.9% rise. The surge in exports defies a 21% year-on-year plunge in China's outbound shipments to the U.S., based on CNBC's calculation of official customs data. China's exports to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations climbed 20.8% in April from a year earlier, helping to offset the drop in exports to the U.S.

U.S. tariff pressure has retailers evaluating their prices

Household brands including Pandora, Puma and Hugo Boss said this week that they are evaluating their pricing strategies in the U.S. and beyond, in the event that President Donald Trump's most punitive levies come into effect. Others said that they are altering their supply chains and potentially revising their sales forecasts amid U.S. trade policy uncertainty.

Last month, Trump announced sweeping, so-called reciprocal import duties on all U.S. trading partners. The charges were later paused for 90 days and reduced to 10% for most countries except China, pending trade negotiations.

Here's what some major European retailers have been saying about their product prices and earnings outlooks.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:cnbc.com","The U.S. and China are set for icebreaker trade talks. Here's what to expect","https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/09/what-to-expect-from-us-and-chinas-icebreaker-trade-talks.html","Fri, 09 May 2025 13:09:52 GMT","



The stakes are high for the U.S. and China's icebreaker trade talks this weekend as the outcome could reset the future of economic relations between the world's two largest economies.

U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Trade Representative Jamieson Greer are scheduled to meet with Chinese lead economic representative and Vice Premier He Lifeng in Switzerland on Saturday.

Analysts say a comprehensive deal is unlikely to come out from a single meeting, however, they are hopeful that a partial rollback of the sky-high tariffs will be on the table.

Both sides have been looking for a pathway to de-escalation, as the economic toll of tariffs have become increasingly difficult to ignore.

The U.S. economy contracted 0.3% in the first quarter this year amid mounting concerns that the economy will slip into a recession with higher inflation and unemployment. And while the Chinese economy grew a better-than-expected 5.4% in the first three months this year, major banks have slashed their full-year growth forecasts for the country to just around 4% — below the government's target of around 5%.

Trump still might have more to lose, as the Chinese political system grants the country's leadership a ""higher pain threshold"" and a ""greater degree of control over macro policy support in the short term,"" said Dan Wang, China director at political risk consultancy firm Eurasia Group.

Vice Premier He's main mission will simply be seeking clarity on what Trump wants and assessing whether the U.S. intends to hurt China's interests, Wang said.

In what appeared to be a confidence boost ahead of the meeting, China released trade data that showed its exports surged 8.1% year on year in April on the back of a jump in shipments to Southeast Asian nations, shrugging off the 21% drop in outbound goods to the U.S.

And on Friday, China's Commerce Ministry launched a ""special operation"" to combat the smuggling of strategic minerals, including gallium, germanium, antimony, tungsten and medium and heavy rare earths.

Without naming specific entities, the ministry framed the operation as ""a crackdown on overseas entities that had colluded with domestic illegal personnel"" to bypass the export control rules it had ratcheted up earlier this year.

""It serves as a useful reminder of the leverage China possesses as the negotiations are set to get underway in Geneva,"" said Stephen Olson, a visiting senior fellow at the Institute of Southeast Asian Studies and a former U.S. trade negotiator.

China is the world's largest producer of several critical minerals crucial to making semiconductors, defense equipment and clean energy. As part of the retaliatory measures against Trump's tariffs announced last month, China has increased export controls of the metals.

""The sharpest arrow that China has in its quiver would be to restrict U.S. access to critical minerals that can't readily be sourced elsewhere,"" Olson said.

High on Washington's agenda is securing the removal of China's export restrictions on rare earths used to make magnets, Bloomberg reported Friday, citing people familiar with the matter.

Another potential pressure point for Trump is China's vast holdings of U.S. Treasuries, which could pose risks to financial market stability, said Wu Xinbo, director of the Center for American Studies at Fudan University.

Beijing is likely to further trim its nearly $800-billion stockpile of U.S. government debt if it wants to turn up the heat on Trump, said Wu.

Despite market speculation that China might unload its Treasury holdings to hit back at tariffs, a significant sell-off could also backfire. Such a move might strengthen the yuan, undermining China's export competitiveness, and lead to substantial losses on its dollar-denominated assets.

A partial reversal of tariffs is one of the most likely outcomes of the meeting, according to analysts who remain split on the extent of any adjustments and the pace of de-escalation.

Robin Xing, chief China economist at Morgan Stanley, projects that effective U.S. tariff rates on Chinese goods could be lowered from the current 107% to a terminal rate of 45% by year-end.

Similarly, Tianchen Xu, senior economist at Economist Intelligence Unit, expects the U.S. and China to scale back their mutual weighted average tariff rates of around 50% in the near term.

That's still elevated compared to the tariff rates of 10.9% on Chinese goods and 16% that China had imposed on American products before Trump returned to office, according to Xu's estimates.

In recent days, senior U.S. officials have sounded an optimistic tone over the upcoming talks, saying they could ease the trade barriers that Trump raised last month.

""De-escalating, bringing those rates down to where they could, where they should be, I think it's Scott Bessent's goal,"" Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick told CNBC Friday. ""And that's what the president hopes is a good outcome, is a de-escalating world where we go back to each other and then we work on a big deal together.""

During a White House press conference on the signing of a trade deal with Britain, Trump said of the Switzerland meeting, ""I think we're going to have a good weekend with China.""

The U.S. president then said in a post on social media platform Truth Social on Friday, that ""80% Tariff on China seems right! Up to Scott B.""

Chinese officials, on the other hand, have struck a firmer tone, reiterating the country's demand for the Trump administration to cancel all unilateral tariffs on China.

A spokesperson for the Commerce Ministry said Wednesday that ""China will not sacrifice principle to reach [a] deal with U.S.,"" while repeating that Washington must ""rectify its wrongdoing"" by removing all unilateral tariffs.

During the upcoming talks, China could still offer some ""sweeteners,"" such as promises to step up its crackdown on fentanyl flows, said Xu, which could lead to a near-term removal of the 20% fentanyl-related tariffs Trump imposed.

Both sides have sought to temper the economic pain from the exorbitant tariffs, exempting the levies on a range of goods, including consumer electronics, semiconductors and auto parts.

China reportedly exempted import duties on select pharmaceuticals, microchips and aircraft engines from the United States. It has also created a ""whitelist"" of U.S. goods that will be exempted from extra levies, according to Reuters.

However, attempts to achieve a more comprehensive deal, similar to the Phase One deal signed during Trump's first term, will likely be ""lengthy and unproductive,"" said Xu, as both sides have shown little appetite for compromise over respective strategic priorities and economic red lines.

""We severely doubt the possibility of the U.S. and China reaching something close to the Phase One trade agreement reached in 2020—a model that has been discredited in the eyes of senior US officials,"" Xu added.

China had alleged it fulfilled the terms under the Phase One trade deal that Trump struck with Beijing during his first presidential term, while claiming the U.S. violated certain mandates in the agreement.

The deal required China to boost purchases of U.S. goods by $200 billion over a two-year period, but Beijing did not meet the targets as the Covid-19 pandemic hit.

Short traders have been pummeled over the last 24 hours as the prices of top crypto assets spiked, contributing to a total of $1.12 billion worth of crypto positions liquidated during that span.

According to data from CoinGlass, shorts make up the bulk of that figure, with nearly $777 million worth of positions liquidated over the past day. Short positions are bets that the price of a particular asset will fall, with long positions being the opposite. Some $350 million worth of longs were zapped in the same span.

Bitcoin usually leads the list of liquidations, but over the past day, it's been Ethereum traders weathering the most damage with $439 million worth of liquidations.

That's because of Ethereum's incredible price rise, with the asset skyrocketing nearly 25% over the last week to a current price of $2,303. Earlier Friday, the price rose to $2,448 for the first time in two months. The Ethereum jump comes amid this week's launch of the long-awaited Pectra network upgrade.

Ethereum isn't the only big gainer this week, however, even if its rise has outpaced most other giants. Bitcoin is up 5% to a current price of $102,858, topping $100,000 on Thursday for the first time since February. The top cryptocurrency touched a high of $103,890 earlier Friday, with $307 million worth of Bitcoin liquidations piling up over the last day.

Other big movers in the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market cap this week include Solana with a 12% rise and Dogecoin with a more than 11% climb on the week.

Solana yielded the third-most liquidations for any single asset over the last day with over $40 million worth, with Dogecoin a little further down the list with $19 million worth of liquidations.

Per CoinGlass, the single-largest liquidation over the last day came from a trader betting against Bitcoin, losing an $11.97 million position in the process.

Home » Beyond Bitcoin: Why Litecoin Caught Wall Street's Eye

For years, Bitcoin held the spotlight as the poster child for crypto. Institutional investors and average users, though, are seeking the next crypto giant now, so the attention is gradually shifting. There's one currency that has quietly lingered in the shadows with a consistent presence: Litecoin. While it's also sometimes called the “digital silver” to Bitcoin's gold, litecoin news today suggests that this investment may be overdue for a revival and Wall Street is starting to notice.

While investors are looking for the best coin to invest in an expanding crypto market, one of the most intelligent first moves is to keep your money safe.

Litecoin's Legacy: More Than a Fork

Litecoin was developed in 2011 by former Google engineer Charlie Lee as a faster and more scalable alternative to Bitcoin. It is based on Bitcoin's code but with some significant changes, including smaller block times (2.5 minutes versus 10) and a different hashing algorithm (Scrypt versus SHA-256).

This means Litecoin transactions confirm faster, and its network is secure but energy-efficient. Litecoin has always performed as a reliable transactional currency throughout the years. It has been the coin where new updates are tested prior to being rolled out to Bitcoin most frequently.

Even its look has become emblematic – litecoin's logo has become household in the parlance of cryptomaniacs, representing convenience, speed, and decentralization. Upgrades to litecoin's logo recently revived its marketing without changing its message of consistency and dependability. The updated litecoin logo now appears across most major wallets, exchanges, and payment integrations — signaling its continued relevance in the crypto world. If you're interested in expanding your crypto holdings beyond Litecoin, you can also buy Solana for a solid investment alternative.



So why is Litecoin again making headlines? For several reasons:

A CoinDesk report in 2024 referenced how old-school cryptos such as Litecoin are beating out newer tokens during times of intense stress in the markets because they're well-tested with regard to security and because they continue to see active development.

Additionally, money and large holders are beginning to see Litecoin as a long-term store of value. It's less volatile than the majority of the newer coins, has a capped supply of 84 million, and has a network uptime of over ten years.



With each crypto cycle, there are new stars born. But Litecoin has demonstrated it's not one of them. Here's why it should be shined under the limelight again:

If you're searching for the most stable coin to invest in that balances innovation with reliability, Litecoin is a good middle ground.



Every bull cycle has a wave of speculation, and many coins ride that wave on hype alone. Litecoin never finds itself at the center of salacious headlines, but it's always in the mix. That stability could be its biggest strength.

Relative to overhyped coins, Litecoin still performs. In a report by Cointelegraph, analysts suggest that Litecoin's focus on utility rather than style might cause it to overshadow newer tokens in the future.

Litecoin news cycle might not be as glamorous as that of its competitors, but it has solid fundamentals. This combined with its age and market acceptance is why some call it the most “underestimated asset” in crypto. Analysts who have been tracking litecoin news have noted that the coin's resilience and incremental progress are impressive considering that the market is volatility-driven.



Litecoin isn't a meme coin. It isn't a speculative bet. It's a decade-old network that still runs smoothly, remains decentralized, and continuously improves. As Wall Street evaluates which crypto assets to embrace next, Litecoin checks many of the right boxes.

Whether you're an institutional investor or an individual planning your first steps in crypto, Litecoin offers clarity in a market that's often clouded by hype. So if you're in the process of creating your portfolio and wondering what could be the next big crypto, Litecoin is worth a serious consideration. Sometimes the best investments are not the most flashy. They're the ones that quietly endure the test of time.

 Crypto banking group Sygnum says it doesn't expect Solana to beat Ethereum in the medium term, partly due to the blockchain's revenues being too tied to memecoins. 

Solana has yet to show convincing signs that it could surpass Ethereum as the preferred blockchain for institutions, as its revenue, heavily reliant on memecoins, is considered unstable, according to crypto bank group Sygnum.

In a May 8 blog post, Sygnum said that the current sentiment around Ethereum “remains poor,” with the market focused on Solana's “transaction volumes and its recent dominance in fee generation.”

However, Sygnum said “the medium-term outlook will primarily be shaped by traditional financial institutions' platform choices to bring their product offerings,” not by sentiment.

“We do not yet see convincing signs that Solana would be the preferred choice as Ethereum's security, stability and longevity are highly prized,” it added.

Sygnum argued that institutions could choose Ethereum over Solana as the market has viewed the latter's revenue generation as “less stable” due to being “highly concentrated in the memecoin sector.”

“This will limit outperformance as it could be argued that the differential in valuation is accounted for by this difference in revenue sources,” the company said.

Another factor is Solana's tokenomics, which Sygnum said was “a comparable issue” to the criticism levelled at Ethereum over its mainnet's stagnant transaction volumes due to it lowering the cost for its layer 2 networks.

The company said Solana is leading Ethereum in market share for layer-1 fee generation, but “most of the fees are paid to validators and do not grow the value of the Solana token.”

“In fact, when it comes to revenues, Ethereum still exceeds Solana 2- 2.5x,” Sygnum said.

It argued that Solana's tokenomics are “easier to modify” than Ethereum's scaling strategy. Still, it said that Solana “does not appear inclined to drive more value to the token,” as its community shot down a proposal to cut the SOL's inflation rate in March.

Sygnum noted that Solana, which some have hailed as an “Ethereum killer” that could challenge the network's market share, could make some gains on the No. 2 blockchain.

The company said Ethereum has the dominant market share in “use cases that are showing traction” with support from governments, regulators, and traditional finance — such as tokenization, stablecoins, and decentralized finance.

However, it added that Solana had made progress in the amount of value locked on its decentralized finance protocols, and if it gains in “more stable revenue sources” such as tokenization and stablecoins, it could gain on Ethereum.

Sygnum added that Solana still has a strong backing, even with the Ethereum Foundation reshuffling its priorities to the layer 1 and recognising “the need to adjust its go-to-market strategy.”

However, that could give a sentiment tailwind to Ethereum as the blockchain's “2-year-long underperformance vs Solana has been temporarily arrested” since the foundation's pivot.

Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) short traders took a major hit on Thursday, sparking nearly $1 billion in crypto liquidations. The short squeeze was fueled by BTC and ETH crossing $100,000 and $2,100, respectively, following President Trump's announcement of the US and UK reaching a trade agreement.

The crypto market saw a quick rebound on Thursday, with the total market cap climbing to $3.3 trillion for the first time since early March. Bitcoin and Ethereum led the charge, gaining 6% and 20%, respectively, at publication time.

The rally triggered a wave of futures liquidations worth $964 million across the crypto market in the past 24 hours, with short liquidations accounting for $834 million, per Coinglass data. The value may be understated, considering Coinglass' aggregated liquidation data from exchanges delays a few hours.

Bitcoin accounted for $416 million in liquidations as the sudden price rebound caught short sellers off guard. The largest liquidated position occurred on Binance, wiping out a BTC/USDT trade worth $11.97 million.

The rise follows Bitcoin breaking past the $100,000 mark for the first time since February 4. Despite the increased bullish sentiment dominating the market, Bitcoin's march to $102,000 could have mixed implications for its price, according to an X post from on-chain analytical platform Santiment.

The post reveals that retail fear of missing out (FOMO) — sparked by media coverage of Bitcoin's milestone — could sustain the rally in the short term. However, similar crypto rallies in the past have been halted due to increased calls of ""higher or above like we're seeing now,"" the analysts wrote.

On the other hand, Ethereum rallied above the $2,000 psychological level for the first time since early March, sparking $259 million in short liquidations.

According to Santiment, Ethereum showed an example of contrarian success, rebounding sharply after a wave of retail-driven FUD. The asset saw significant sell pressure following a negative price response to the Pectra upgrade, with many traders rotating into meme coins and urging others to do the same, noted Santiment analysts.

Despite the negativity, ETH surged past $2,100 for the first time in over six weeks, outperforming the top 10 cryptocurrencies. Santiment noted that the turnaround came as crowd sentiment hit heightened negative levels, a dynamic that has historically preceded strong price recoveries.

The crypto market rally began following President Donald Trump's announcement of a trade agreement with the United Kingdom (UK) to ease some of the tariffs imposed on British goods on Liberation Day.

Trump stated that the deal with the UK is the first among many, as talks are in advanced stages with other international trading partners.

According to a recent CryptoQuant Quicktake post by on-chain analyst BorisVest, Ethereum (ETH) appears to be stuck in a state of limbo. While retail investors are increasingly sending ETH to exchanges such as Binance – typically a sign of selling pressure – large investors are steadily withdrawing ETH from these platforms, indicating accumulation and long-term confidence.

Ethereum Stuck In A Tug-Of-War

As ETH inches closer to the $2,000 mark for the first time since March 27, market sentiment appears to be shifting. Optimism is building around the potential for a trend reversal, but on-chain data continues to deliver mixed signals regarding Ethereum's short- to medium-term direction.

In his analysis, BorisVest highlighted that Ethereum metrics from Binance are sending ‘mixed signals.' While short-term indicators reveal underlying weakness and investor indecision, longer-term metrics point to resilience and strength.

Notably, mean exchange inflows have increased significantly since late 2024, suggesting growing sell pressure from retail traders. This pattern resembles the behavior seen during 2022–2023, when a surge in ETH deposits to exchanges preceded a steep price decline.

Similarly, mean exchange outflows have also been rising steadily since October 2023. However, these outflows are largely linked to whale wallets – addresses holding large amounts of ETH – implying that high-net-worth individuals are accumulating rather than selling. This divergence highlights a classic tug-of-war between retail fear and institutional confidence.

The analyst also pointed to funding rate trends. He noted that during ETH's rally to $4,000 in early 2025, funding rates became overly positive as bullish sentiment took hold. This over-leveraged long positioning resulted in a sharp correction, driving ETH's price down to $1,400 by April.

At present, funding rates are hovering in neutral territory, indicating a lack of clear leverage bias. BorisVest noted that if short interest rises and funding rates fall below zero, a short squeeze could ensue – potentially driving prices higher. However, no such setup has formed yet.

Meanwhile, the taker buy/sell ratio, which tracks aggressive market orders, showed heavy selling pressure in late 2024 and early 2025 – right before Ethereum's steep decline. This ratio is now stabilizing, suggesting that sellers may be exhausted and buyers are gradually regaining strength.

Change Of Fortunes For ETH?

Although ETH is down 34.3% over the past year, several technical and on-chain indicators point toward a potential bullish trend reversal for the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap.

For instance, Ethereum recently flashed a golden cross on the daily chart, a bullish indicator that typically leads to major upward moves. Further, there are signs that the cryptocurrency may have already bottomed out for this market cycle. 

That said, uncertainty remains. Recently, machine learning algorithm CoinCodex predicted that ETH may witness another crash that may push its price down to $1,500. At press time, ETH trades at $1,966, up 7.8% in the past 24 hours.

This is a daily technical analysis by CoinDesk analyst and Chartered Market Technician Omkar Godbole.

About two weeks ago, I discussed bitcoin's (BTC) bullish breakout above a technical resistance called the Ichimoku cloud and potential for a rally to $100,000. This week, the cryptocurrency obligingly surged into six figures.

Now, top alternative cryptocurrencies such as memecoin DOGE, payments-focused XRP, the Ethereum blockchain's ether (ETH) and Solana's SOL have also crossed above the cloud, flashing bullish signals.

The analysis, developed by a Japanese journalist in the 1960s, is used to identify support and resistance, momentum and trend change in price actions. The indicator comprises five lines: Leading Span A, Leading Span B, Conversion Line or Tenkan-Sen (T), Base Line or Kijun-Sen (K), and a lagging closing price line.

The gap between the first two lines makes the cloud. Crossovers above and below the Ichimoku cloud are taken to represent bullish and bearish shifts in momentum.

The chart shows XRP and DOGE moving above their respective Ichimoku clouds, signaling more gains.

In XRP's case, the breakout shifts focus to resistance at around 30 cents, characterized by the trendline falling from February highs. DOGE is trading close to its bear market trendline, which, if topped, would expose resistance at $3.02, the lower high created on March 2.

In ETH's case, the breakout has opened the doors to the 200-day simple moving average (SMA) at $2,700. Meanwhile, SOL may encounter resistance at $218, the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement of the January to April sell-off.

Oops, something went wrong

In recent years, the global demand for sustainable practices has grown, with industries across the world rethinking how they can reduce their environmental impact. One area receiving increasing attention is packaging.

Traditional packaging methods, particularly those reliant on plastic, have led to significant environmental damage, contributing to pollution, excessive waste, and resource depletion.

As businesses seek to align with consumer demand for sustainability, the need for innovation in packaging is more critical than ever. One such innovative solution gaining momentum is blockchain technology.

Blockchain, the underlying technology behind cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, offers a new way of tracking, verifying, and enhancing the sustainability of packaging materials.

This combination of digital technology and environmental consciousness is transforming the packaging sector, offering new opportunities to improve transparency, reduce waste, and promote the use of recyclable and renewable materials.

So, how exactly can blockchain be leveraged for sustainable packaging, and what are the benefits it brings?

One of the most significant benefits of blockchain technology is its ability to enhance transparency and traceability across supply chains.

Traditional packaging supply chains can be opaque, making it difficult for consumers to know the true environmental impact of the products they purchase.

In an age where customers are increasingly interested in the sustainability credentials of the brands they support, blockchain offers a solution by providing a decentralised, immutable ledger that records every transaction made along the packaging supply chain.

With blockchain, every step of a product's packaging journey can be tracked, from the sourcing of raw materials to manufacturing, distribution, and end-of-life disposal.

This transparency allows consumers to verify claims about the sustainability of products, including the use of eco-friendly materials, recycling efforts, and carbon footprint reduction strategies.

For businesses, it offers an opportunity to demonstrate accountability, reinforcing their commitment to sustainability in a way that is easily verifiable.

For example, a company producing recyclable packaging can use blockchain to prove that the materials used were sourced responsibly and that the product can indeed be recycled at the end of its life.

This level of traceability not only builds consumer trust but also helps companies adhere to regulations and certifications that require proof of sustainability, such as the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) certification for paper products.

One of the critical challenges in the pursuit of sustainability is the issue of waste, especially in the packaging industry. According to a report from the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, over 80% of packaging is not recycled properly, leading to vast amounts of waste that pollute landfills and oceans.

This is where blockchain can help drive change by promoting circularity — the process of reusing, recycling, and regenerating materials within the supply chain.

Blockchain can facilitate the creation of circular packaging systems by providing an efficient way to track the lifecycle of packaging materials. For instance, once packaging is used, blockchain can help companies track and incentivise the return and recycling of packaging materials.

By using smart contracts and tokens, businesses can reward customers who return packaging for reuse, further encouraging sustainable behaviour. Additionally, blockchain can assist in monitoring the effectiveness of recycling programs, ensuring that materials are returned and processed correctly, ultimately reducing the need for new resources.

With these advanced tracking systems in place, businesses can make more informed decisions about the design of their packaging. For example, a company can identify packaging that is not being recycled effectively and shift towards more recyclable or compostable materials.

Furthermore, blockchain allows for more efficient waste management practices, improving the ability to sort and process waste, which in turn reduces landfill usage.

One of the challenges in achieving truly sustainable packaging is the fragmented nature of the packaging industry. Companies often work with a multitude of suppliers, manufacturers, and logistics providers, all of whom may have different practices when it comes to sustainability.

Blockchain's decentralised and secure nature can break down barriers between these stakeholders, fostering collaboration and alignment on sustainability goals.

By creating a single, transparent ledger that all stakeholders can access, blockchain enables real-time sharing of data across the supply chain. This collaboration can lead to the sharing of best practices, the development of joint sustainability initiatives, and more consistent standards across industries.

Moreover, blockchain helps prevent greenwashing — the practice of making misleading claims about the environmental benefits of products. With verified data available to all parties, companies are held accountable for their sustainability claims, creating a more truthful and consistent approach to sustainable packaging.

For example, a consortium of companies could work together on a blockchain-enabled platform to create a more sustainable packaging solution that meets the needs of all stakeholders.

These could include packaging manufacturers, brands, recyclers, and even waste management organisations. By using blockchain to coordinate efforts, these diverse parties can work together more effectively, ensuring that packaging materials are sourced, used, and disposed of responsibly.

This level of collaboration could result in more efficient systems that reduce waste and improve recycling rates across industries.

As the world continues to prioritise sustainability, blockchain technology is likely to play an increasingly vital role in the packaging sector.

The potential for blockchain to enhance transparency, reduce waste, and foster collaboration makes it a powerful tool for tackling the environmental challenges posed by traditional packaging methods.

While the adoption of blockchain for sustainable packaging is still in its early stages, the growing interest in this technology suggests that it will be a significant force in the years to come.

In the future, we may see widespread adoption of blockchain in the packaging industry, with companies and consumers alike benefiting from a more sustainable and circular system.

As more organisations embrace this innovative approach, we can expect to see an acceleration in the development of new sustainable packaging solutions, which could ultimately lead to a reduction in waste, a decrease in the carbon footprint of packaging, and a cleaner, more sustainable environment for future generations.

Ultimately, blockchain presents an exciting opportunity for revolutionising the packaging industry.

By improving traceability, reducing waste, and fostering collaboration, blockchain can help businesses achieve their sustainability goals while providing consumers with greater confidence in the products they purchase.

As the world continues to face pressing environmental challenges, blockchain for sustainable packaging could be a pivotal solution in the ongoing pursuit of a greener planet.

Hong Kong, Hong Kong, May 9th, 2025, Chainwire



Launching Summer 2025, T-Rex's built-in distribution engine introduces a radically simple idea: rewarding people seamlessly for doing what they already love online.

T-Rex, a purpose-built blockchain for entertainment, content, and cultural virality, today announced a $17 million fundraise and Incubation Fund to revolutionize online content publishing by seamlessly rewarding consumers for everyday interactions on social platforms such as YouTube, TikTok, or X (formerly Twitter) and reshape how consumer-facing decentralized applications (dApps) are discovered, published, distributed and scaled across Web3.

Backed by strategic investors including Portal Ventures, North Island Ventures, Framework Ventures, Arbitrum Gaming Ventures, ArkStream Capital, Mindfulness Capital, Hypersphere, SNZ, and Arche Fund, and developed by EVG, Asia's prominent product builder and publisher, known for driving mass adoption, T-Rex directly addresses the critical “ghost town” and “mercenary users” challenges in blockchain.

“Arbitrum Gaming Ventures recognizes the transformative potential of platforms like T-Rex that are expanding Web3 beyond DeFi. EVG's strong regional influence and deep understanding of the Southeast Asian market, projected to reach $7 billion by 2028, provide a strategic gateway for us to significantly scale our footprint within this high-growth region. Combining our robust scaling capabilities with EVG's extensive ecosystem expertise, we are strategically positioned to penetrate the entertainment industry and broader consumer market in a pivotal and rapidly expanding part of the world,” said Dan Peng, Partner at Arbitrum Gaming Ventures.

​​T-Rex leverages Arbitrum's powerful Layer-2 scaling solution, delivering ultra-fast, secure, and low-cost transactions essential for consumer-scale adoption. Arbitrum Gaming Ventures has specifically identified T-Rex as key to its regional growth strategy.

T-Rex: A New Kind of Blockchain for the Culture-First Internet

While Web3 holds the promise of revolutionary change, the current landscape is fragmented, user-unfriendly and often empty with underutilized dApps. Despite all its innovation, most chains lack real users, real culture, and real reasons to stay. T-Rex flips the model with its simple first principle: stop trying to reinvent user habits and instead enhance them invisibly. Its core innovation, Proof-of-Engagement (PoE) mechanism, automatically rewards users on apps they already use daily through a privacy-preserving browser extension, turning everyday online actions like watching videos, liking posts, and sharing memes into tangible, valuable digital ownership and offline perks.

“Instead of building another blockchain pipe, we're delivering actual water: engaging content, thriving communities, real-world rewards”, said Allen Ng, Co-Founder of T-Rex and EVG. “Users shouldn't have to think about crypto until they want to. Our blockchain stays invisible, letting them effortlessly turn their online fun into meaningful rewards. Our vision is to let attention becomes equity, community becomes power and participation becomes currency.”

Radical Simplicity: Web3 That Feels Like TikTok, Not A Crypto Wallet



(UI screenshot: Home Discovery pushing relevant content and dApps to user.)

At launch, users simply install T-Rex's browser extension and continue browsing popular social media platforms. Every interaction is quietly, securely recorded via advanced zero-knowledge tech (zkTLS), and seamlessly turned into rewards, with no wallet or tech jargon required.

Creators and projects benefit from instant audience discovery and viral distribution, while end users earn rewards effortlessly, redeemable both digitally and offline, such as cash back at favorite restaurants or exclusive local deals.

“The next wave of breakout applications will be defined by distribution, UI / UX, and product differentiation. The team at T-Rex gets this. They're building a protocol that seamlessly onboards social media users and allows them to monetize their data through network rewards. We're excited to back T-Rex as they merge protocol-native network design with clean consumer product expertise,” said Evan Fisher, Founder and General Partner of Portal Ventures.

“Web3 infrastructure has matured, but it still lacks consumer momentum because only a few use cases resonate with the masses. T-Rex is a strong contender to bridge this gap. By prioritizing culture and abstracting complexity, it offers a path to broad adoption,” said Travis Scher Managing Partner and Co-founder of North Island Ventures.

Incubating the New Digital Metropolis

The $8 million Incubation Fund backed by EVG with support from the Arbitrum Gaming Ventures will accelerate ecosystem growth, offering comprehensive developer support beyond capital, including engineering resources, media partnerships, community activations, premium events, Key Opinion Leader (KOL) networks, and strategic Intellectual Property (IP) applications.

“We provide real firepower, not just capital”, Joyce Yim, Co-founder of T-Rex emphasised. “Developers gain immediate user traffic, creators grow loyal audiences effortlessly, and users become not just spectators, but stakeholders in the success of viral content.”

Set to launch in Summer 2025, T-Rex's distribution layer and browser extension create the railroads linking popular online consumer applications such as gaming, music, interactive media, and Web3. From creators rewarding top users with digital assets, to new projects gaining instant discovery, to active users earning a stake, T-Rex's ecosystem is designed for intuitive use, cultural resonance, and economic empowerment at scale.

About T-Rex

Ethereum NFT Project Doodles Launches DOOD Solana Token Airdrop

memes

Doodles took its next major step forward Friday after switching CEOs in January, launching its ecosystem token—DOOD—on Solana with an airdrop for NFT holders.

The initiative is the first critical launch since Scott Martin, better known as Burnt Toast, assumed the project's chief executive role, beginning an era in which he planned to introduce more risk while doing away with its previously “extractive corpo” initiatives. 

Martin, who is also the artist behind the Doodles brand, previously spoke about the struggle the collection had in simultaneously pleasing its crypto-native holders while growing a consumer brand for everyone to love. Doodles has previously collaborated with giants like McDonald's and Adidas.

“DOOD is our answer to that exact tension,” he told Decrypt. “Web3 is the infrastructure powering what we do, but we're building experiences that resonate far beyond the typical crypto crowd. We've always believed you can build something that earns respect from the Web3 community and also feels culturally relevant to someone who's never touched a wallet before.”

Alongside its token launch, the project is also unveiling DreamNet, a decentralized storytelling platform that's powered by artificial intelligence. With DreamNet, community members can create worlds and characters inside an “evolving shared universe,” and if those creations are used in other media, then creators earn DOOD rewards. 

According to Martin, there will be other utilities for the DOOD token in the future. 

“We're being intentional about how we roll things out, but rest assured DOOD will be at the heart of our growing brand in more ways than one,” he said, mentioning gaming as a way to “create culture and break into everyday people's lives.”

Though Doodles got its start as an Ethereum NFT collection, its native ecosystem token launched on Solana thanks to its speed and accessibility, Martin said. Solana has become the epicenter of the meme coin universe over the last year-plus.

“Doodles is chain-agnostic,” said Martin. “We build wherever it makes the most sense.” 

Holders of Doodles NFTs have been allocated 30% of the DOOD token supply via an airdrop claim, with an additional 13% allocated to other Web3 communities.

By dropping DOOD, Doodles joins a growing list of Ethereum NFT projects that went on to release tokens, including recent launches by Pudgy Penguins and Azuki with PENGU and ANIME, respectively.

And while both those tokens launched to substantial initial excitement, they now sit 78% and 88% off their respective all-time price highs.

DOOD, which is now trading on exchanges like Bybit and KuCoin, is currently down about 12% on the day to a price of $0.007, per data from CoinGecko—though newly launched tokens are typically volatile and may swing wildly as more and more traders enter the market.

How will Doodles reassure its community if DOOD falls as sharply as some of its contemporaries?

“We launched DOOD not to follow trends but because we believe in building real, long term, value for our community,” said Martin, “and we've already started that with DreamNet and with many more activations coming soon.”

“Most importantly,” he concluded, “DOOD is at the center of our brand in every single way.”

The Information Commissioner issued Decision 13/2025 regarding the Department of Health.

A spokesperson said, “On 2 May 2025, Information Commissioner Jason Outerbridge issued Decision 13/2025, Department of Health, which found that the Department failed to decide the Applicant's request for an internal review on a PATI request, seeking correspondence about the importation of goods, within the 6-week statutory timeframe set by the Public Access to Information [PATI] Act 2010. The Information Commissioner has ordered the Department to issue an internal review decision to the Applicant on or before Friday, 30 May 2025.



“In ‘failure to decide' cases, such as this, the Information Commissioner's Decision does not address access to the public records being requested. Rather, it focuses purely on whether a public authority has responded to a request for access to public records within the statutory timeframe. The Information Commissioner's decision and order, in such instances, allows the public authority the chance to make one final decision on granting or refusing access to public records that it holds—by way of an internal review by the head of the public authority.

“Once an internal review decision has been issued by the public authority, if a PATI requester is not satisfied with the authority's response, they may seek an independent review by the Information Commissioner of the authority's internal review decision. It is at that stage that the Commissioner will consider whether a public authority, such as the Department of Health, has properly decided that refusing access to public records is justified according to the PATI Act.”

This year's show is no exception, “MIX TAPE” features a vibrant mix of student-composed pieces and popular favourites, all brought to life by the energy and spirit of the children themselves.

The performance opens with a medley of favourite songs, followed by the Schools Orchestra. Younger pupils (Junior to Second Class) will charm the audience with classics such as Down By the Bay and Three Little Birds, while senior students (3rd to 6th Class) perform Count Me In by Bruno Mars alongside their own compositions, reflecting themes of hope, unity, and imagination.

The children will be joined on stage by some of Limerick's finest musicians including Cian Boylan (keyboard), Dave Keary (electric guitar), and John Daly (drums). As always, ICO musicians—including Kenneth Rice (violin) and Malachy Robinson (electric bass) have been working closely with the children, offering mentorship and musical collaboration throughout the year.

ICO Schools is a cornerstone of the Irish Chamber Orchestra's vision for community connection, using music to inspire creativity, foster resilience, and build a strong sense of belonging among young people in the heart of Limerick.

TICKETS ARE FREE

Admission is free, and everyone is welcome to experience this inspiring morning of music and celebration. Collect you tickets at the UCH foyer when you arrive!

As Ireland's national chamber orchestra, ICO is proud to call the University of Limerick its home, while also regularly touring across Ireland and internationally. ICO is supported by the Arts Council of Ireland / An Chomhairle Ealaíon.

KARACHI: The Institute of Cost and Management Accountants of Pakistan (ICMAP), through its Research and Publications Department, has unveiled a comprehensive policy proposal titled “ICMA Proposes Crypto Adoption Framework and CBDC Launch Plan to Government.”

This timely initiative introduces a Four-Pillar Framework for the responsible adoption of crypto currencies in Pakistan and outlines a strategic Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) Development and Regulatory Launch Plan. The proposal is intended for consideration by the Pakistan Crypto Council (PCC) and relevant policymakers, aiming to facilitate a secure and well-regulated digital financial ecosystem in the country.

In view of the rapidly evolving global landscape of digital finance and crypto investments, ICMAP's proposal serves as a much-needed foundation for Pakistan's policy direction. The Four-Pillar Framework focuses on key dimensions necessary for crypto integration, each supported by international case studies to guide implementation. 

The first pillar emphasizes the creation of a clear regulatory framework. It highlights the need for robust, transparent, and internationally aligned regulations to support the development of a safe crypto environment. This includes full compliance with Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Counter-Terrorism Financing (CFT) measures, as well as lessons from other jurisdictions that have effectively implemented such frameworks.

The second pillar advocates for alignment with global crypto and blockchain standards. ICMAP stresses that Pakistan must actively engage with international standard-setting bodies and adopt best practices to ensure credibility and innovation. This involves the appropriate classification of digital assets, setting up effective controls for digital asset transactions, and encouraging blockchain innovation. The case study provided shows how a country successfully built a compliant yet dynamic crypto ecosystem by closely working with global organizations.

The third pillar calls for active industry-government collaboration to encourage responsible innovation while maintaining financial stability. ICMAP highlights that close coordination between regulators and industry stakeholders is essential to strike a balance between enabling innovation and safeguarding the economy. The included case study illustrates how a country effectively fostered such cooperation, promoting growth while ensuring regulatory oversight.

The fourth and final pillar underlines the importance of consumer protection and financial stability. ICMAP recommends clear and enforceable measures to ensure that consumers are protected from abuse and that markets operate with integrity. A case study demonstrates how another country implemented robust consumer safeguards in the crypto sector, ensuring both user confidence and market stability.

Complementing the crypto framework, ICMAP has proposed a structured Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) Development and Regulatory Launch Plan. Recognizing the need for a state-backed digital alternative to crypto currencies, this plan recommends that the State Bank of Pakistan introduce a CBDC to enhance regulatory control, reduce volatility, and expand financial inclusion. A government-issued CBDC would provide a stable digital option that supports innovation without compromising monetary sovereignty.

The proposal also reflects on global investment trends, noting that crypto currencies have attracted investors due to their higher returns compared to traditional stock markets and real interest rates. As more countries increase their exposure to digital assets, ICMAP believes Pakistan must take strategic steps to prepare for the financial future. The document also provides valuable insights into global developments in CBDC implementation, drawing lessons from countries at the forefront of digital currency adoption.

Through this initiative, ICMAP reaffirms its role as a leading policy advisor and thought leader in Pakistan's financial landscape. The Institute remains committed to supporting policymakers in developing forward-looking, well-regulated frameworks that enable innovation, protect consumers, and preserve economic stability.

Today, we're talking about Trump's ventures into cryptocurrency and the web of conflict of interests that those ventures are just one small part of. On April 23rd, Trump announced that he would hold a private dinner with the largest investors in his self-branded cryptocurrency, TrumpCoin. The announcement created a trading frenzy that on paper added hundreds of millions of dollars to Trump's net worth. The dinner has now been officially set for May 22, and it is raising ethical and constitutional concerns, with many pointing out that the president is effectively selling access to his administration, but that's just the beginning of how Trump's ongoing business ventures are pushing the line between money and politics. I'm Michael Calore, director of consumer tech and culture here at WIRED.

Lauren Goode: I'm Lauren Goode. I'm a senior writer at WIRED.

Katie Drummond: And I'm Katie Drummond, WIRED's global editorial director.

Michael Calore: So before we dive into Trump's crypto saga, it's worth pointing out that he wasn't always the biggest fan of the industry. As early as 2021, he called bitcoin a scam and said that it should be regulated “very, very high.” Not only has Trump changed his views on cryptocurrency, but in January of this year, three days before he was inaugurated for his second term, he launched his own meme coin. This is where the technical terms come into the show, because I just said meme coin. Maybe we should define some of these things like meme coins and cryptocurrency and how it differentiates from bitcoin and stablecoin.

Lauren Goode: Yes, good call. Cryptocurrency, let's start with cryptocurrency. Basically, it is decentralized, not regulated, digital money.

Michael Calore: OK, I'm bored.

Lauren Goode: No one government controls it, either the governance of it or the market value of it, and I think a lot of people conflate cryptocurrency with bitcoin because bitcoin is the Kleenex of crypto or the Tampax. I want to force all of the crypto boys to compare this in their minds to Tampax. Bitcoin is the name brand everybody thinks of. It was the first established cryptocurrency. Bitcoin's value is determined both by people essentially believing in it and also by the fact that it does have scarcity. No more than 21 million bitcoins can exist, though there are plenty of other crypto coins people can get into.

Katie Drummond: People are going to get so mad at me for saying this, but just listening to you talk about that, I still cannot believe that this even exists. I'm just like, “Uh-huh.”

Lauren Goode: It has existed in concept for decades. Then, while getting ready for this podcast, I realized that it only came into existence around 2009.

Katie Drummond: Early recent history.

Lauren Goode: It's one of those moments that I have from time to time covering this world where I go, “Oh, my God. We've lived through bitcoin, the smartphone, and now this AI revolution. Literally, what a time to be alive.”

Katie Drummond: Oh, I remember a friend in … I guess it would've been the early 2010s who had to divest of her bitcoin because she was a journalist and she took me out for sushi dinner and paid for it with bitcoin that would now be worth half a million dollars, like something like deeply, deeply upsetting. But let me explain my favorite type of coin. This will tell you a little bit about my personality: stablecoin. A stablecoin is probably the only type of cryptocurrency I would ever consider investing in. It is a cryptocurrency whose value is pegged or tied to a stable asset. We like stable assets here in the Drummond household. Often that is a fiat currency, so like the US dollar or a commodity like gold. So, the most common stablecoin that you may have heard of is tether. So, I think tether is the biggest stablecoin out there on the market, and it is pegged to the US dollar.

Lauren Goode: That means that when the value of the dollar fluctuates, the value of the stablecoin also fluctuates.

Katie Drummond: Yes.

Michael Calore: Because you can always trade a stablecoin for a dollar.

Lauren Goode: Got it.

Michael Calore: Yeah. So, if you own 80 coins, you can get $80 tomorrow.

Katie Drummond: There's something very reassuring about that to me personally.

Michael Calore: Same. Well, I'll tell you about the absolute opposite of that, which is the chaos known as the meme coin.

Lauren Goode: Exciting.

Katie Drummond: I don't like this.

Michael Calore: The only reason that meme coins exist is to enable people to financially speculate on the market. So, a meme coin is generated based on a person or a meme or a concept like Doge, Dogecoin, Trump, TrumpCoin. They say, “I'm just going to make a coin, and if you buy a bunch of these coins, then I get the money and the value goes up, or it goes down based on how popular I am and how much people want to give me money.”

Lauren Goode: And how much people are posting about it on Reddit or doing Twitch Live streams about it.

Michael Calore: Yeah. And theoretically, it could be a good investment. Most likely it is a bad investment. It's basically you buy meme coins to establish clout in certain communities. There are some meme coins that will serve as a ticket. So, when we're talking about Trump selling TrumpCoin and people buy TrumpCoins so that they can attend a dinner, then that is a use for a meme coin that's pretty common. It turns into something called a utility asset, which is boring. All you need to know is that if you buy the coins, then you gain clout in the community that is around that coin's personality.

Lauren Goode: And even if it turns into that utility asset, it's still not regulated. None of this is regulated.

Michael Calore: No, no. None of this is regulated.

Katie Drummond: Well, let's talk more about that dinner, that dinner.

Michael Calore: So Trump's meme coin has gathered a lot of attention. The exclusive access that he's promising will go to the top 220 owners of TrumpCoins. So, of all the people who went out and bought TrumpCoin, the top 220 asset holders are going to attend a private dinner that is set to happen later this month.

Lauren Goode: So our colleague Joel Khalili has been reporting on this, and we just have to go back very quickly to January. This was a few days before Trump entered the Oval Office again. That's when Trump launched his meme coin. He put on Truth Social, “My new official Trump meme is here.” Also, he put winning.

Katie Drummond: I mean, there are so many things I could say about Donald Trump. His voice on social can be very funny.

Lauren Goode: I mean, we can all hear it in our heads. The following day, the coins that were released into circulation, which Joel reported was around 20 percent of the coins to start, were worth $14 billion. Let's just sit with that for a second. An incoming president of the United States launched an online cryptocurrency scheme days before taking office that boosted his own net worth significantly. Axios reported at the time that the value of these coins made up 89percent of Trump's net worth. On top of that, a week later, Melania, his wife, the first lady, also released a meme coin. Around the time those coins were circulating, they were worth a billion dollars.

Katie Drummond: I wonder, two things, and then Lauren, I'll let you keep going. I wonder one, why throw the Melania coin in there? We're already talking about $14 billion of value. I guess they felt like throwing another $1 billion on top of that. Random, maybe she just really wanted her own meme coin. The other question I have is, have we figured out who got to him? So this is a president who when he was in office the first time, had only bad things to say about cryptocurrency. Right before he's inaugurated, second go around, has come up with the ultimate scheme to massively enrich himself and his family and is all in on crypto. I am very curious about how he went from point A to point B, and essentially who got to him. Who got in this man's ear and told him to do this? Because he certainly does not have the technological prowess or the cryptocurrency expertise to come up with this plan on his own. It's just an interesting question to think about. I would love to see that reported somewhere.

Michael Calore: I would speculate that it was his oldest sons.

Katie Drummond: The boys.

Lauren Goode: Oh, interesting.

Michael Calore: Yeah, Don Jr. and Eric Trump, because they got into cryptocurrency in 2024 when they launched World Liberty Financial with a couple of business partners.

Katie Drummond: Oh, of course, which we're going to talk about later. That makes a lot of sense while I'm filing that away to force someone to report it out.

Lauren Goode: Well, yeah, and if anyone has any insight into that, we'd love to hear it. My guess would be it would be the direct pipeline from Silicon Valley to the administration. But once again, we're all ears. I mean, I think we should just very quickly, the concerns about this, right? One is that this whole thing ends up being a rug pull where there are regular people who actually buy into this coin and stand to lose a lot from it. The other concern is that this ends up being a catalyst for bribery, and then it becomes a question of whether or not this is even constitutional.

Michael Calore: Right. So, let's talk about the bribery aspect or the access peddling aspect. What's up with the dinner?

Katie Drummond: Trump essentially offered to host this private dinner, 220 of his top meme coin investors, essentially offering, just to make this very, very clear, direct access to him in exchange for buying into a meme coin that will personally enrich him and his family. So, as Joel wrote in a piece, “The dinner gambit puts the TrumpCoin in a different class entirely. In establishing an explicit quid pro quo, a large investment in exchange for an audience, the maneuver has effectively turned Trump into a utility coin, an asset that bestows on holders some perk or advantage, not what you like to see in the context of the United States President.” I think it's also worth broadening this out for a minute to point out that President Trump is actually having a lot of dinners. He is having many, many dinners of a suspicious flavor, right? Not all of them are even tied to his meme coin. This meme coin dinner is the latest in what has been a pretty steady line of events that he has been hosting. Not so much acting in capacity as President Trump sitting in Washington, DC, but he has been hosting dinners at Mar-a-Lago, where he is asking business leaders or anyone with money to spend somewhere between $1 million and $5 million for the privilege of eating dinner with him, sometimes involving candles, as we have seen in some of these invitations that WIRED has obtained and reported on. So, this is a pay-for-access scheme that is happening right out in the open between the president of the United States and business leaders with an agenda who want to curry favor. This meme coin dinner is basically a new version of that. In the case of these Mar-a-Lago dinners he was hosting previously, the money from those dinners ostensibly appears to funnel into a PAC, which is a little bit mystifying given that Trump cannot run for a third term, unclear exactly what is happening with that money from the Mar-a-Lago dinners. But when we're talking about the meme coin dinner, the money essentially goes to the Trump family pot, which as far as the White House and the president's communication staff are concerned, that money is being overseen by the Trump family, by the Trump sons. There's no conflict of interest here. This has nothing to do with Donald Trump. At some point in the very near future, this man will be out of office and he will once again be able to access the many billions of dollars he has amassed by allowing anyone with a checkbook and some basic competency around buying cryptocurrency to eat a meal with him. So, that's a little bit about the dinners.

Michael Calore: So what do people get? Is it just a candlelight dinner?

Katie Drummond: Well, presumably they get a meal, unclear on exactly what is being served. But there are even tiers for these dinners, for this meme coin dinner. So, there are additional perks. There is a VIP White House tour and a special reception for the meme coin's 25 biggest holders. So, if you are among this very small elite group, you get a tour of the White House. I don't know. I can think of better VIP perks off the top of my head, and that wouldn't be one of them. But I think my favorite part of all of this, from everything that I have read, is that anyone buying into this meme coin dinner. So, if you are amassing a fortune of Trump meme coin, I mean God help you, if you are amassing a fortune to try to get into this dinner, you should be aware of the fact that there is a warning attached to this invitation saying that the president himself may not even attend the dinner or that the event could be canceled for any reason. Individuals would get a Trump NFT. Remember that scam, a Trump NFT as a consolation prize. So, what this all says is that obviously, to Trump, the dinner actually happening doesn't matter. He doesn't give a shit who ends up sitting at a dinner table trying to trade this or that with him or barter this or that. He doesn't care about any of these relationships or any of these people. The speculative bidding against the meme coin, driving up the value of that meme coin is the entire point. Whether this dinner actually happens or not, TBD.

Michael Calore: There's a secondary aspect too to the meme coin, because let's say you want to go to the open market and you want to buy TrumpCoin. So, two of the organizations that are in charge of the buying and the selling of the coins in the open market are called CIC Digital LLC and Fight Fight Fight LLC.

Katie Drummond: I can't believe that LLC was up for grabs. I can't believe I didn't get that.

Lauren Goode: Say what you will about the current administration. The naming convention is just …

Katie Drummond: It's beautiful.

Michael Calore: Fight Fight Fight. So, both of these companies are offshoots of a larger conglomerate that is owned by the Trump family.

Lauren Goode: Well, we know that CIC Digital is owned by the Trump organization. Fight Fight Fight, which I can't believe I have to say again, it's a little less clear. But together, these two entities collectively own 80 percent of the Trump carts.

Michael Calore: What these two companies do is they make money and they make profit from fees whenever people buy and trade coins. So, they basically serve as an intermediary for transactions between anybody selling a coin, anybody buying a coin. In the crypto market, when you serve as an intermediary, they call this market making. So, these are market maker companies. As Joel Khalili, our colleague, he's written a lot about TrumpCoin. In a recent story, a source told him this, and I want to say it to you, “The optics of profiting from selling your own coin are terrible, while profiting from the market making is opaque enough to protect your reputation.”

Katie Drummond: I really want to know who that source was.

Michael Calore: Basically like serving as a banker is better than owning the bank account with regards to your public.

Katie Drummond: But just to be clear, in this case with regards to the TrumpCoin, the Trump family is both the bank account and the banker, right? This is Trump's meme coin, but his family is essentially overseeing the LLCs that are profiting from the coin. Is that right?

Michael Calore: Yeah.

Katie Drummond: Which is nuts.

Lauren Goode: I just looked up the official Trump token on Robinhood right now. According to gettrumpmemes.com, 20 percent of the supply, like Joel reported, was available at launch. Then it goes on to describe how CIC Digital LLC, an affiliate of the Trump organization, collectively own 80 percent of the remaining non-public supply subject to a three-year unlocking schedule. So, yeah, the other 80 percent is owned by a Trump family organization.

Michael Calore: They can just sell them whenever.

Katie Drummond: Good opportunity to remind everyone that this is not regulated. These transactions and these coins are not regulated. This is wild. It is wild.

Michael Calore: So the price has been fluctuating a lot, and there is some incentive to buy TrumpCoin if you are a speculator and you want to buy low and sell high, but really, who is buying these coins? Is it just Trump supporters with disposable income? Is it people who want to sit down for a candlelight and get a VIP tour of the White House?

Lauren Goode: That's an expensive candle.

Katie Drummond: I think what's additionally galling and frightening about all of this is that we don't know and we really can't know. That is part of the problem, a big part of the problems. So, the names of the Trump meme coin holders are concealed, right? These are alphanumeric crypto wallet addresses. These are pseudonyms. We don't actually have the full names and the full backstories of any of these people who are buying and selling this meme coin. Usually, this makes sense for lots of reasons, right? Access to the president of the United States is a controlled matter. You can't buy your way in. You can't just call the president and set up coffee. That is not how this works. So, let's say foreign actors buy their way into this dinner. Let's say a representative of Russia or a government decide that they want a seat at this table. Based on how this process works, that is by all appearances entirely possible. The fact that the American public, that Congress, that nobody has any idea who is buying and selling this coin, who is in that top group of 220 people, who is in that top group of 25 people who are apparently getting a VIP tour of the White House, we have no idea who any of them are.

Lauren Goode: The really big question with that is whether this means the president is in violation of the emoluments clause of the US Constitution, which restricts federal officeholders from accepting gifts, emoluments, offices, or titles from foreign states without the consent of Congress. So, if someone from Russia, just use that example again, is buying into the TrumpCoin and contributing directly to Trump's net worth, they don't have to disclose their identity when they're buying that coin. That's by nature of the technology. That's not by nature of the law.

Michael Calore: We can't look and see who is on the list of 220 people because it's just a bunch of cryptocurrency wallet numbers.

Lauren Goode: The Trump administration has not said whether or not they're going to publicly reveal the list of people who are at this dinner.

Michael Calore: So this is obviously all very distressing, but we should outline quickly before we move on, who are the winners here and who are the losers?

Katie Drummond: Well, look, I'll take the winners. That's easy. The Trump family, big winner here, and whichever meme coin holder or foreign actor manages to convince the president to do some business. Those are the winners. The people with a seat at the table who spent the money to get the access to get what they want, those people might win. The Trump family certainly is coming out way ahead on this, billions of dollars ahead on this, while Donald Trump is sitting in office as the president of the United States. It's unbelievable. Lauren, any losers?

Lauren Goode: I mean us, the American people. There is just almost nothing about this that benefits the people of the United States. I feel like if we could all just take a step back for a moment in this year, and by we, I mean the American people, and remind ourselves that our public servants are supposed to be serving the American people. They're supposed to be providing opportunities for the people of the country to live a better life. They're supposed to facilitate a fair market and stable economy. Katie, your favorite word, stable.

Katie Drummond: I do like a stable economy.

Lauren Goode: Which as of April has not been the case, supposed to offer protections and support in terms of public health, which as we discussed last week on the podcast, has not been the case. They're supposed to carry out priorities in the interest of national security. If they would only stop using unauthorized Signal chats to do that, they're not supposed to be running a crypto grift or any grift that benefits them this richly. You could maybe, maybe argue that having a tech-forward administration committed to seriously evaluating the role of cryptocurrency in modern society is a good thing, but that's not what this is. This to me feels like a scheme.

Michael Calore: And it's difficult to pin actual tangible harm on people because if you look at some of the things that the Trump administration has been doing with regards to trimming back government spending, they're cutting programs that cut access to people and then you can actually trace that they actively cause harm. They're denying people specific benefits that help them stay alive, help them stay in their homes, et cetera. With this, it's like, ""Yeah, who's it really hurting?"" Well, it's hurting our whole notion of how government is supposed to work and how international relations are supposed to work, how access to powerful people in our government is supposed to work. It's breaking my mind.

Lauren Goode: There's a famous Alexander Hamilton quote, which I'm not going to get right at the moment, but is basically that one of the greatest threats that you have to the republic is the idea that a foreign adversary could buy its way in.

Michael Calore: So, beyond the TrumpCoin frenzy, there has also been increasing reporting and scrutiny surrounding the recent business deals led by Donald Trump's two oldest sons, Eric and Donald Trump Jr. Let's run through those business deals.

Katie Drummond: Boy, there's a lot to cover here. So, let's start with stablecoin business. So, last week, Eric Trump showed up on stage. He was in Dubai. He showed up at a crypto conference, Token 2049, and he was with the cofounder of World Liberty Financial. He was with the son of the White House envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, where they announced the USD1 crypto stablecoin. Now, it's important to note here that the Trump family holds a 60 percent stake in World Liberty Financial. So, basically by transacting in this stablecoin USD1, entities who are affiliated with foreign powers, essentially foreign actors could indirectly transfer wealth, transfer money to the Trump family, and essentially buy their way in to access, again, similar to the dinner we were just talking about, buy access to the president of the United States. Now, it doesn't stop there. There was a New York Times story published earlier this week that literally, like I was reading the story, I was in a cab, my jaw was on the floor of the taxi through the entire story. So, the story was about Don Jr. and Eric, and let me read you just a little bit of it. This story touched on all of the different business exploits that these boys have going on all around the world, particularly in the Middle East. So, ""a luxury hotel in Dubai, a second high-end residential tower in Saudi Arabia, two cryptocurrency ventures based in the United States, a new golf course and villa complex in Qatar, and a new private club in Washington."" So those are just a few of the deals that Eric and Don Jr. are brokering all over the world, all on behalf of the Trump Foundation, which Eric runs. Now, some of these ventures, it's important to note, also involve foreign governments. So, including the government of Qatar, government of the UAE, it's a mess. I mean, these guys are everywhere all at once. They are doing a lot of business deals, leveraging the Trump name for sure, leveraging the fact that their dad is in office, but the complexity here is that all of this money funnels into the Trump Foundation, which will directly benefit Donald Trump himself. So, it's not out of the ordinary. It's not crazy for the offspring or the family members of a sitting president to essentially cash in on that status. It's a little icky, but it happens all the time. It's very conventional, at least in US politics. What is particularly unique about this situation is that the president himself also stands to gain financially from the ventures that his sons are undertaking. That is the key distinction here.

Michael Calore: And to be clear about how this works, the announcement that you're talking about that was made on stage in the Mideast was that there was an investment fund that is controlled by the United Arab Emirates. They said that they were going to invest $2 billion in Binance and that they were going to make that investment with USD1 coin, which is the coin that is run by World Liberty Financial. So, they take $2 billion and they buy $2 billion worth of this coin. So, now World Liberty Financial is controlling $2 billion. What do they do with it? They buy Treasury bonds. That's how they lock the price of the coin to the US dollar. They invest in the US Treasury. So, you earn interest when you buy treasury bonds. So, with today's exchange rates, if you buy $2 billion worth of treasury bonds—

Lauren Goode: Two bills.

Michael Calore: … you will make $85 million approximately in interest every year.

Lauren Goode: Who makes that money though, the UAE fund that invested?

Michael Calore: World Liberty Financial.

Lauren Goode: Which is partially owned by the Trumps.

Michael Calore: Yes.

Katie Drummond: Well, they have a 60 percent stake. So, largely, yes.

Michael Calore: Yes.

Katie Drummond: Mike, that was a very good explanation.

Michael Calore: Thanks.

Katie Drummond: I'm honestly surprised that Eric and Don were smart enough to cook this up. I mean, this is pretty good. It's pretty good.

Michael Calore: Well, as you mentioned, they only owned a portion of the company. There are also a lot of crypto people working at the company behind the scenes.

Katie Drummond: Someone else had a strategic hand in this one. But still, I mean, we are talking about just astronomical wealth accumulation. I mean, these are huge amounts of money that we're talking about just on that one piece around the stablecoin, not to mention all of these other business deals happening all across the Middle East, happening here in the United States. It is a sweeping grift, a global grift by the Trump family to capitalize on the fact that their dad is the president of the United States. It is really, really, truly unprecedented. I think it's also important to note that I think in a more normal news environment, in a more conventional news cycle, any single one of these business ventures would be getting a ton of attention. In the Biden era, I mean, this would be Super Bowl. This is really truly nutso stuff. It is genuinely not getting that much attention. There has not been much reporting about what Don Jr. and Eric are doing at all of these conferences and events and with all these business deals because their dad is making so much news on a daily basis that nobody can keep up. Nobody is paying attention to the fact that any of this is happening because it's chaos out there, right? Everybody's talking about tariffs. Meanwhile, Eric and Don Jr. just landed a stablecoin deal that would net their family 85 million bucks a year. It's crazy.

Michael Calore: Yeah, I mean, there have been some political responses to it, right? Congress is slightly concerned about this at least.

Katie Drummond: Yeah, I mean, in the way that US politics is working so well right now. I mean, look, the GOP, not surprisingly, to my knowledge, I have not heard much from them. I think that they are largely silent and continue to support Trump as president and all of the blatant grift and corruption that comes with it. The Democrats, as they have been for many months now, arguably many years, they're upset. They're not happy. Not sure what they're going to do about it, but they're there expressing their displeasure. So, there is crypto legislation making its way through Congress right now. There is the Genius Act named for Donald Trump. No, I'm just joking. It wasn't. The Genius Act, actually, thank you for the laugh.

Lauren Goode: It was named for Marc Andreessen.

Katie Drummond: Wait, was it actually?

Lauren Goode: No, but let's go with that.

Katie Drummond: OK. Sorry. I'm a dual citizen. I grew up in Canada. I'm very gullible. So, the Genius Act actually had bipartisan support until very recently. So, the Genius Act, I think it's important to note it is backed by the crypto industry, but it would basically make it easier for stablecoins specifically to grow in the United States. It would basically create a regulatory framework for that one type of cryptocurrency to allow it to operate in a much more above-board conventional way in this country. But because of all these Trump family shenanigans, now some Democrats are getting cold feet. So, Elizabeth Warren is one example. She's been particularly fervent as she often is to her credit in opposing the Genius Act. She actually gave a speech on the Senate floor earlier this week where she had a lot to say. So, she said in part, ""The Genius Act makes this kind of corruption worse. There is nothing in this bill to stop it. Instead, the bill would accelerate it. President Trump and the crypto industry are not trying to jam through this bill because they know it will make the bribery and corruption harder. They are trying to jam it through because they know it will turbocharge the size and scale of the stablecoin market and help boost the value of their own stablecoin ventures, all while containing no real restrictions on the president's self-dealing."" That really is, I think, the biggest concern among Democrats, which I don't know, somehow they didn't flag this several months ago. It was only when the Trump families started getting really blatant about this, was that the Genius Act, this bill basically does not have adequate protections for corruption. It's just not set up to deal with what we're seeing from the president himself, let alone independent actors who are not in office and who decide to behave in unscrupulous ways with stablecoins.

Lauren Goode: This is what I was saying earlier too, in that if we had an administration on either side of the political aisle that was committed to embracing the technology that we live with now, that is not going away, whether it is content moderation issues, policies around AI, or really seriously evaluating the role of cryptocurrency in the market, I think that that would be a valiant thing to do. I think that that would be a good effort to make. I don't understand how you can be sitting in public office at the highest level and have these private investments while you're also directly in charge of basically regulating this type of currency.

Katie Drummond: Well, you can't. I mean, you can't be doing that.

Lauren Goode: But they are.

Katie Drummond: Yet here we are.

Lauren Goode: Right.

Michael Calore: Yeah. I mean, this is also a symptom of the fact that the Republican Party controls the executive branch and the legislative branch, and basically, the entire crypto industry is now aligned politically to the right, not the entire crypto industry, but a very large sector of the crypto industry is now aligned to the political right because of this. Because the SEC, the Securities and Exchange Commission, who typically would be the people who would be very alarmed with what is going on, have said, ""Yeah, this type of cryptocurrency, that falls outside of our jurisdiction.""

Lauren Goode: So, we keep saying that this is unprecedented. I mean, presidents have used their station of office to enrich themselves before, have they not?

Lauren Goode: Unfortunately, there are a lot of precedents for this. I think that in the most recent administration, the Biden administration, a lot of folks would point to the example of Hunter Biden, where his lucrative involvement with the gas company Burisma drew a lot of criticism. Republicans had alleged that this influenced Biden's policy positions towards Ukraine just as one example. There are other examples of Neil Bush, the brother of President George W. Bush, Billy Carter, the brother of President Jimmy Carter, all having business dealings that created questions about potential conflicts of interest. This goes back to Lyndon Johnson. I was reading about how in the 1940s, Lady Bird Johnson bought a small broadcasting company in Texas. Lyndon Johnson was in the House of Representatives at the time. Later he became president. He claimed he had no stake in it, but by Texas law, he did have a half stake in this broadcasting station. There was a reportedly favorable string of decisions made by the FCC over the next several years that really benefited the Johnsons. They made millions off of this station that they bought for, I think, $17,500 back in the day. So, there are prior examples of this, not exactly crypto or meme coins, but business dealings. Lots of presidents also benefit from their status after they leave office, paid speeches, book deals, entire production companies like the Obamas. This is what typically happens when an American president leaves office these days. You could launch a goddamn Bush coin for all I care right now. I still won't buy it, but feel free to tinker on the blockchain if you are no longer in office. While you are in office, the president must divest of private interests, so should the VP, so must their spouses and minor children. They have to be put in a blind trust. Sometimes high ranking officials might even choose to divest even if they're not legally required to. That has happened before as well. So, I am not a presidential historian, but it does seem to me that the Trump family has just taken this to new levels with cryptocurrency, with everything else, and that the conflict of interest is actually happening right in front of us now.

Michael Calore: Yeah, except we still can't see what's happening because we don't know who's going to be at the dinner. It's just so weird.

Lauren Goode: But even if we don't know, even if let's say we can somehow eliminate the concern that it is foreign adversaries who end up, not even adversaries, just foreign governments who end up buying into this coin, even if it's all just incredibly wealthy Americans who want in, there's still the opportunity for the sitting president to rake in millions of dollars and his family members to do that as well while he is acting president. It comes back to that question you asked earlier, Mike, of who are the winners and who are the losers? It's really hard to say who the winners are here in the American public.

Katie Drummond: Well, other than that one big winner, the one who runs the country, he's winning.

Michael Calore: So for parting thoughts, how do we see this all playing out over the next couple of months? I mean, obviously, we have the dinner coming up in May. Do we think there will be more dinners? Do we think that there will be more opportunities to buy an audience with the president?

Lauren Goode: I can tell you that we are probably not getting invited.

Katie Drummond: We didn't get invited to Elon Musk's exit interview that he did with 20 press outlets when he allegedly stepped back from Doge. So, no, I don't think we're getting invited to that dinner. I mean, I wish I could say, ""Oh, no, Congress is going to come out swinging. This is going to get shut down. There's no world in which this continues."" I think that realistically, the dinner will or will not happen. It doesn't really matter. The money has been made. The precedent has been set. There will be more dinners. There will be more business dealings for the Trump family around the world. They will find, I suspect, new and honestly to their credit, enterprising and creative ways to leverage the family name and leverage cryptocurrency to continue to enrich themselves. I think that that's not just the next couple of months. I think that that is the foreseeable future for as long as this presidency lasts.

Lauren Goode: I just want to know where the money's going.

Michael Calore: It's going to Mar-a-Lago. OK. Well, thanks to both of you for this lovely and uplifting conversation about the state of cryptocurrency and US politics. I really appreciate you both.

Lauren Goode: Buy the UV coin, the Uncanny Valley coin.

Katie Drummond: Oh, my God. Can you imagine?

Lauren Goode: We should launch a meme coin.

Katie Drummond: Guys, we could get rich. This is our move. Let's do this.

Michael Calore: No, thanks.

Bitcoin's rapid price rally has caught traders off guard, triggering large liquidations of bearish short positions.

The leading cryptocurrency by market value has risen over 3% to $102,500 in the past 24 hours, with prices topping $104,000 at one point, the highest since Jan. 31. The bullish move came as President Donald Trump announced a comprehensive trade deal with the U.K. and the cumulative inflows into the spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) hit a record high above $40 billion.

The broader market rallied as well, with the total market cap of all coins excluding BTC surging by 10% to $1.14 trillion, the highest since March 6, according to data source TradingView.

That has led to substantial liquidations of bearish short positions, or leveraged plays aimed at profiting from price losses. A position is liquidated or forced closed when the trader's account balance falls below the required margin level, often due to adverse price movements. This leads the exchange to close the position to prevent further losses automatically.

Nearly $400 million in BTC short positions were liquidated in the past 24 hours—marking the highest single-day total since at least November, according to Coinglass. Meanwhile, $22 million in long positions were also wiped out.

This significant imbalance indicates that leverage was heavily tilted towards the bearish side, and the rapid liquidation of shorts suggests there could be more upside potential for the market ahead.

A Florida-based pharmaceutical distributor is backing XRP as a treasury and payments asset, putting the token at the center of a $50 million financing deal.

Wellgistics Health (WGRX) said Thursday it had secured an equity line of credit to support XRP-based reserves and infrastructure for real-time payments.

The company plans to use the blockchain to settle transactions across its pharmacy network, manage vendor payouts, and issue credit lines backed by XRP.

The move makes Wellgistics one of the few publicly listed U.S. firms to actively integrate XRP into its financial operations. XRP will help eliminate banking delays and lower settlement costs of fractions of a cent, two key resistance points in pharmaceutical supply chains.

“We believe that there are certain advantages to integrating XRP and its related infrastructure into its healthcare ecosystem,” the firm said in the release. 

“XRP settles transactions in 3-5 seconds vs. 1-3 days for ACH or wire transfers, allowing for near real-time settlement among pharmacies, suppliers, and manufacturers. All transactions are logged on the XRP Ledger for real-time compliance, rebate tracking, and auditability,” it said, adding that the token will help process global vendor payouts at very low foreign exchange rates.

The credit facility is being provided by New York-based LDA Capital. No timeline was provided for the XRP-based services would actually begin.

 The $38 million crypto seizure from Bybit hack-linked eXch was the third-largest crypto confiscation in the history of Germany's federal criminal police. 

German law enforcement seized 34 million euros ($38 million) in cryptocurrency from eXch, a cryptocurrency platform allegedly used to launder funds stolen after Bybit's record-breaking $1.4 billion hack.

The seizure, announced on May 9 by Germany's Federal Criminal Police Office (BKA) and Frankfurt's main prosecutor's office, involved multiple crypto assets, including Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), Litecoin (LTC) and Dash (DASH). The move marks the third-largest crypto confiscation in the BKA's history.

The authorities also seized eXch's German server infrastructure with over eight terabytes of data and shut down the platform, the announcement added.

In the statement, the BKA described eXch as a “swapping” service that allowed users to exchange various crypto assets without implementing Anti-Money Laundering (AML) measures.

The platform had operated since 2014 and reportedly facilitated about $1.9 billion in crypto transfers, some of which were believed to be of “criminal origin,” including assets laundered during the Bybit hack.

“Among other things, a portion of the $1.5 billion stolen from the Bybit crypto exchange, which was hacked on Feb. 21, 2025, is said to have been exchanged via eXch,” the authorities wrote.

According to a post by crypto sleuth ZachXBT, eXch was also involved in laundering millions of funds from other crypto thefts and exploits, including Multisig, FixedFloat and the $243 million Genesis creditor theft.

Those were in addition to “countless phishing drainer services over the past few years with refusal to block addresses and freeze orders,” ZachXBT said.

ZachXBT was among the first security analysts to report on eXch's links to laundering $35 million of crypto assets stolen from Bybit soon after the hack was confirmed.

“Lazarus Group transferred 5K ETH from the Bybit Hack to a new address and began laundering funds via eXch (a centralized mixer) and bridging funds to Bitcoin via Chainflip,” ZachXBT wrote in a Telegram post on Feb. 22.

After initially denying involvement in laundering funds from the Bybit hack, eXch eventually announced it would cease operations by May 1 in a Bitcoin Talk post published in mid-April.

“Even though we have been able to operate despite some failed attempts to shut down our infrastructure [...], we don't see any point in operating in a hostile environment where we are the target of SIGINT [Signals Intelligence] simply because some people misinterpret our goals,” it wrote.

Addressing the seizure, senior public prosecutor Benjamin Krause stressed the importance of action against “quick and anonymous opportunities for money laundering for any amount.”

“Crypto swapping is an essential component of the underground economy, used to conceal incriminated funds from illegal activities such as hacking or trading in stolen payment card data, thus making them available to perpetrators,” he said.

 Ether has surged following the Pectra hard fork, with analysts suggesting a growing number of long positions could signal a turnaround for the asset. 

Ether surged 20% in the past 24 hours following the launch of the Pectra upgrade, with some crypto traders suggesting the growing number of ETH long positions could mark a “turning point” for the asset that has faced uncertain sentiment throughout most of 2025.

At the time of publication, Ether (ETH) is trading at $2,230, up 19.6% over the past 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap data. Pseudonymous crypto trader Daan Crypto Trades said it was a “pretty insane candle.” Over the same 24 hours, Ether Open Interest (OI) spiked 21%. 

The surge followed the long-awaited Pectra Upgrade, which went live on May 7, introducing new wallet features, increased staking limits and scalability improvements to Ethereum. 

Popular crypto trader Alex Kruger said on May 8 that Ether's price spike was primarily due to “new longs.”

If Ether were to fall back to $2,000, approximately $2.06 billion in long positions would be at risk of liquidation, according to CoinGlass data. The price surge caught many traders offside, with approximately $328 million in Ether short positions liquidated over the same period.

Crypto trader Bob Loukas said, “ETH holders thinking this might finally be the turning point.” 

2025 has not been a strong year for Ether's price, which fell 56% from its Jan. 1 price to $1,472 by April 9 — its lowest point this year — as sentiment weakened throughout the year.

Ether's recent rally coincides with Bitcoin (BTC) gaining 3.59% over the same period and nearly 6% over the past seven days, reclaiming the $100,000 mark on May 8 for the first time in over three months. 

In comments to Cointelegraph, onchain options protocol Derive founder Nick Forster said Ether's recent price surge was due to a combination of factors, beyond just the Pectra hard fork. 

Forster pointed out the US trade deal with the UK, where US President Donald Trump “slashed tariffs on British cars and steel.” He also pointed to the crypto exchange Coinbase, which announced the acquisition of Deribit for $2.9 billion.

Since 2013, Ether has averaged a 62.2% return in the second quarter. Based on its price on April 1, Ether could reach around $2,950 by the end of June if history repeats. 

However, the momentum has not crossed over with spot Ether ETFs yet. For the third day running, spot Ether ETFs posted outflows on May 8, totaling $16.1 million, according to Farside data.

Meanwhile, the overall crypto market also saw an uptick in prices and sentiment following Bitcoin's surge. Over the 24 hours, the entire crypto market surged 4.95%, and the Crypto Fear & Greed Index has moved further into “Greed' territory, bumping up another 8 points to a score of 73.

 The roadmap was supposed to be gradual: start with mobile mining, then move toward a testnet, KYC rollout and, finally, full mainnet launch with real trading and utility. But that last step took a lot longer than anyone expected.After years in limbo, the Pi Network finally opened its mainnet to external trading in February 2025. That should've been a big win. But it didn't go smoothly. For one, not all users were able to migrate their balances. Know Your Customer (KYC) verification became a bottleneck, and many were left wondering when — or if — they'd ever be able to access the tokens they'd mined for years.Then there was the price. When Pi first started trading on external platforms, the price spiked, hitting as high as $2.98 in late February. But the hype didn't last. As early adopters started selling off their tokens and real-world use cases remained thin, the price slid hard. By early May 2025, it had dropped to around $0.58, wiping out more than 70% of its value.There's also still no real utility. You can't spend Pi on much (only in small, community-run markets and pilot programs).

 As the months turned into years, more and more red flags started popping up, and the community started asking hard questions.1. Still waiting on the mainnetPi launched in 2019, and for years, users kept hearing that the open mainnet was “just around the corner.” First there was the testnet. Then the “enclosed mainnet.” Then a roadmap update. The actual open network didn't arrive until early 2025 — six years later. And by that time, a lot of early believers had started losing faith.2. All roads lead back to the core teamDespite the talk of decentralization, the reality is that the Pi Core Team has retained almost total control over the project. Every active mainnet node? Controlled by them. Most of the token supply? Still in their hands. That doesn't sit well with crypto users who believe in distributed power and community-driven networks. Right now, Pi feels more like a private company than a decentralized protocol.3. Where's the transparency?Another sticking point has been the lack of detail on how Pi actually works under the hood. The white paper is vague. There's no clear breakdown of tokenomics, no timelines on when tokens unlock, no burn mechanics and no insight into supply control. Without that info, it's hard for anyone to judge the health or future value of the project.4. Exchange listingsDespite years of hype, Pi still isn't listed on major exchanges like Binance or Coinbase. It is tradable on some platforms like OKX and Bitget, but even there, things are shaky. Some users have reported trouble withdrawing their tokens, with exchanges blaming “traffic spikes” and other vague technical reasons. It all feels a bit fragile.For instance, one user on Bitget reported depositing 1,500 Pi tokens but found them inaccessible, with no clear timeline for resolution. On OKX, withdrawals were suspended for over 24 hours, with users asked to provide ID and email verification but given vague responses like “Your request will be completed within 24-48 hours.”By April 2025, users reported that MEXC, another exchange listing Pi, suspended Pi withdrawals, sparking concerns about liquidity and platform reliability. This was compounded by reports of large Pi transfers from MEXC, Gate.io and Bitget to OKX wallets, raising suspicions of coordinated price manipulation or exchange-level issues.5. Fake volume and fading hypeAt its peak in February 2025, Pi was trading at nearly $3 and generating billions in volume. Fast forward a few months, and that volume has dropped off a cliff — down to around $40 million. That kind of collapse raises serious questions: Was the demand real, or was it inflated by speculation, bots or internal market-making?6. Users trapped in a closed loopEven now, many users can't actually use or withdraw their Pi tokens. Without access to real exchanges or spending options, they're stuck in a kind of token limbo, watching a number go up in an app but with no way to convert that into anything useful.Did you know? While Pi Network claims over 70 million users, blockchain data indicates that only about 9.11 million wallets exist, with approximately 20,000 showing daily activity.

The Only Particle Collider in the U.S. Will Be Replaced with an Upgrade

Brookhaven National Laboratory is pushing the boundaries of particle physics.

Jeffery DelViscio/Scientific American

Rachel Feltman: For Scientific American's Science Quickly, this is Rachel Feltman. Today we're taking you on another one of our Friday Fascination field trips with an auditory journey to Brookhaven National Laboratory. This Long Island facility boasts seven Nobel Prize–winning discoveries and more than 70 years of groundbreaking research into energy and the environment.

Earlier this year the Science Quickly team visited Brookhaven to get a look at its Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, or RHIC, which has been helping scientists study subatomic particles since 2000. RHIC's 25th year of operations is set to be its last—but only because something new is on the horizon: the Electron-Ion Collider [EIC], which scientists hope can reveal the secrets of the “glue” that binds the building blocks of visible matter together.

To guide us through these weighty subatomic topics, I chatted with Brookhaven's own Alex Jentsch. You'll notice that this episode's audio quality is lower than usual, but that's because we were hanging out next to giant science machines. If you want to see those incredible instruments for yourself—and get access to an extended version of my conversation with Alex—check out our YouTube channel for a video edition of today's episode. For now here's part of our chat at Brookhaven.

Feltman: So where are we? What goes on here [laughs]?

Jentsch: Well, right now we are in the experimental hall for the STAR experiment, which is one of the two operating experiments right now at the collider.

Feltman: Mm-hmm.

Jentsch: And this monstrosity behind us is basically just a very large digital camera that we use to take pictures of collisions of particles.

Feltman: Wow, and what's the point of taking a picture of a collision of a particle?

Jentsch: Well, the only way that we can really understand what's going on inside of the atom—or inside the nucleus of the atom, really—is by destroying it. And so basically you can imagine this digital camera taking a picture of a firecracker after it blew up and then trying to put it all back together. So it's basically the only tool we have to look inside the nucleus.

Feltman: And what kind of stuff can we learn with that?

Jentsch: Well, there's various different things. So the original reason that we built this facility and built this collider was to study the early universe, so we were actually trying to recreate stuff that would've existed right after the big bang. So we obviously can't go visit the big bang very easily, unless you're a Time Lord, and so ultimately the only way we can do this is by trying to recreate those conditions in the lab.

So that was kind of the first main pillar of the science program, was looking at a situation where protons and neutrons were not protons and neutrons; they were actually melted into their constituents for a very short period of time. So we do that for very, very, very small amounts of time ...

Feltman: Mm.

Jentsch: In collisions in the middle of this detector.

Alternatively, we can also look at just basic structure of the proton. We can understand things like its mass, its charge and its spin, which is kind of the esoteric aspect of a proton, but that's another thing we can do with this camera.

Feltman: Cool. It would be great if you could just give us a quick overview of sort of the basic terms we need ...

Jentsch: Sure.

Feltman: To understand to wrap our heads around this.

Jentsch: So atoms are already fairly complicated. So we learn in chemistry that atoms have these electrons zipping around the outside in this cloud. And then if you go deeper into the inside of the atom, you get to the core thing that we call the nucleus.

So the nucleus is made up of these positively charged particles called protons and these neutral particles called neutrons. And for a long time we thought the electrons, the protons, the neutrons, they're fundamental. Well, then we looked deeper. We got new tools that we could use to probe deeper inside and found, “Oh, there's stuff inside the proton and neutron. Dang it, that's more complicated now.”

So we found these objects—we had no name for them yet; we didn't really expect them to be there. And one of the first things we had to figure out was what they're doing, what their properties are, how they're held together. They seem to be always bound up inside the protons and neutrons.

So we start out calling these things quarks because we couldn't really figure out a name and we found something in a James Joyce novel that sounded like it matched the, the weird thing we found. And they're seemingly glued together inside the protons and neutrons. And we know that, from the electromagnetic force, that photons are kind of the force-carrying particle between charged items.

Feltman: Mm.

Jentsch: So electrons, protons, they see their electric force by being able to exchange a photon; there must be something similar for quarks. And so since they're kind of glued together, we thought, “Okay, maybe this particle's called a gluon. Maybe it's the thing that's actually communicating this much stronger force than what we see for electromagnetism.”

And so from all of that we learned that the, the strong force is actually much stronger than electromagnetism, it's communicated via this thing we call the gluon. And so all of a sudden a whole new branch of physics became a thing and is now why we build these new machines.

Feltman: Quick follow-up: And what's the strong force [laughs]?

Jentsch: So the strong nuclear force is actually what binds protons and neutrons together and eventually binds them inside of atoms together. 'Cause if you think about it, protons have positive charge, neutrons have no charge—how are the positive charge items holding themselves together into a nucleus? So the strong force allows the nucleus to actually hold together.

Feltman: So can you walk me through what goes on when the accelerator's turned on? You know, what does an experiment entail?

Jentsch: So the accelerator part is immensely complicated; it's actually a whole complex of accelerators. So you can picture it kind of like the entrance ramp onto a highway. So we start the cars off, you know, after a red light on the access road. They eventually get on the ramp, and then they get on the highway and speed up.

Feltman: Right.

Jentsch: That's kind of how the RHIC facility operates. RHIC is short for Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider—RHIC is easier to say. So RHIC is kind of like the highway, and then the other parts of the complex are like the access roads.

Feltman: Mm.

Jentsch: That part is a whole set of expertise and a whole lot of challenges, and getting the particles into RHIC is only half the battle. Once they're there they have to accelerate. So we have to basically accelerate them at the same time that we ramp up all of the over 1,000 magnets that are inside the ring.

Feltman: Wow.

Jentsch: So those ring magnets are being ramped up in their field at the same time that we're speeding the particles up really, really close to the speed of light. And then eventually our friends at the collider department use other magnets to force the two beams to collide at the center of our detector, and then we start working.

So we're in a control room on the other side of this building. We turn on all of our detectors and start taking data, and that process goes on for about eight hours at a time. And so while we're in the control room, we babysit [laughs] all of the detectors, make sure the data-taking is going smoothly, and things always happen that we don't expect. And so we try not to run in the middle of summer, for example, because it gets hot and the power grid on Long Island [laughs] is not so happy with how much power we're drawing, and so eventually we get little dips, and that can shut things down for quite a while. So just getting the particles to the middle of the detector is really, really, really hard.

Feltman: So what are some examples of findings that have taken place because of the work here at Brookhaven?

Jentsch: So one of the initial things that was really interesting is that when we smashed these particles together, we originally started smashing gold ions together, and there was a reason for that. To recreate the early universe we want a lot of density and a lot of temperature.

Feltman: Mm-hmm.

Jentsch: And so by smashing heavy ions together the hope would be that in a very, very, very tiny nuclear scale you recreate the early universe—really, really, really small. And the thought was that when we do that the energy density becomes so high that the protons and neutrons “melt.”

Feltman: Mm-hmm.

Jentsch: And you get what, originally, we thought was a gas of the quarks and gluons inside. That wasn't really what we ended up finding. We actually found that they don't really behave like a gas at all. They kind of behave like a liquid …

Feltman: Mm.

Jentsch: Which is really not something we expected. And so as we started to do more work and study different things about the properties of this quark-gluon plasma we created inside, a lot of it was not what we really expected it to be.

So for example, we expected, because it might be a gas, that it would be fairly weakly interacting, which is not what you'd expect from the strong force, right? But it turns out it's actually quite strongly interacting—that's why it moves kind of like a fluid: all the particles actually kind of talk to each other.

Feltman: Mm.

Jentsch: And that has consequences for some of the things we try to measure. And so many of the things we initially measured were quite different from what we expected. As particles go through this plasma they lose energy. And so when we measure them in our detector they are not really behaving the way we originally thought they might.

The other aspect of things that we try to study here is the, the basic, fundamental property of the proton ...

Feltman: Mm-hmm.

Jentsch: The spin. And a long time ago we found out that the proton spin is not just coming from the quarks; it's coming from some combination of the quarks and the gluons.

Feltman: Mm-hmm.

Jentsch: And so we actually made some of the first constraint measurements here at STAR and at PHENIX down the road that showed the amount of spin that could be coming from the gluons, and that was, like, a first-ever measurement. So now the goal is to figure out the last part, which is how the motion of the quarks and gluo ns contribute to the proton spin.

So we can't answer all the questions with one facility, and so the hope would be that we can use the new facility, the Electron-Ion Collider, to start looking at that as well.

Feltman: Yeah, well, and speaking of, you know, answering new questions, one of the reasons we're here is that this is sort of the end of the line for this version of the accelerator ...

Jentsch: Mm-hmm.

Feltman: As far as I understand it. Can you tell us a little bit about the transition that's happening?

Jentsch: Yeahthis year we'll have our final data-taking for RHIC. And at that point we spend a couple of years taking all this stuff out because we have to make room for the new facility. And that process is really difficult 'cause you can see this is not a small piece of equipment. In parallel we'll also be retrofitting whole sections of the accelerator to build the components for the Electron-Ion Collider.

So it's exciting—we're really ready for the new physics—but it's also bittersweet because a lot of us have been working on this for a long time. I've been working on STAR for, like, 13 years, and so I have fond memories of sitting in the control room with friends from all over the world eating, you know, really salty snacks to stay awake and drinking coffee. And that's gonna be, you know, going away at the end of this year, and we'll have quite a long time before we start taking data with the new facility.

Feltman: Yeah, and what's the reason for the changeover?

Jentsch: So the kinds of collisions we do right now are either gold smashing on gold or proton smashing on proton or even proton smashing on gold. The problem there is that you have two items that are full of quarks.

Feltman: Mm.

Jentsch: They're really complicated items, and as you speed 'em up to really high energy they get more complicated. And smashing two really complicated objects together means that trying to study it is not easy.

Feltman: Yeah.

Jentsch: By using electrons as one of the beams instead of another proton or an ion— so you have an electron smashing into an ion—the electron basically serves as a source of light. It serves as a source of photons. And so you can actually take, essentially, snapshots of the nuclei, of the protons. It's a cleaner collision environment.

Feltman: Mm.

Jentsch: You can't study everything that we study here—you can't study a quark-gluon plasma, for instance, 'cause you don't have the energy density of all those quarks together—but you can study what the nucleus really looks like at a very, very, very small scale. You can study what the nucleus might look like before it would've collided in RHIC.

And so in some sense you can actually use the data we'll take 10 years from now to reanalyze data from now to try to understand more than we do now, which means we have to preserve [laughs] all the data that we've been taking for the last 25 years, and so there's a whole discussion now about the computing facility resources we're gonna need to store all of the data we've been taking …

Feltman: Mm.

Jentsch: Make sure it stays safe [laughs].

Feltman: Can you give me a sense of how much data has been collected in that time [laughs]?

Jentsch: Right now we're collecting an average of something like 15 petabytes per year …

Feltman: I don't even know what a petabyte is [laughs].

Jentsch: So a petabyte is—let's see; we're at terabytes—terabytes, gigabytes, so it's a, it's one million gigabytes.

Feltman: Wow.

Jentsch: And we're doing that now per year; it's gone up with each passing year. So when we first started taking data we were not taking so much data. The machine was at, you know, a much lower rate of collisions because we had to make sure the detector was safe, and computing power was not as good 25 years ago as it is now. So basically, as computing has caught up with what we wanna be able to do, we've increased the amount of data we take with each passing year to kind of make use of [laughs] all the computers we have available now.

Feltman: Yeah.

Jentsch: And so we've really stretched them to their max.

Feltman: What kinds of questions are you most excited to try to answer with the EIC?

Jentsch: So for me I'm probably interested in the stuff that's the less sexy aspects of the physics. I really wanna know the basic, fundamental aspects of the proton that we don't know. The proton mass, for example, it's a given; if you go into a chemistry textbook, there's a mass number there for the proton. But the quarks don't make up most of that mass. One percent of the mass of the proton comes from the quarks.

Feltman: Mm.

Jentsch: The rest of it is coming from the strong force itself, these interactions inside the proton. We still don't really understand how that works, and that's basic ...

Feltman: Yeah, yeah.

Jentsch: We know how much things weigh—we measure this all the time. Why don't we know how a proton gets the mass it has?

Feltman: Yeah.

Jentsch: So that's interesting to me. But then also even the proton spin. Spin is a less understood quantity, it's more esoteric, but we thought originally that this was coming just from the quarks. Then we learned that only about 30 percent comes from the quarks, so where the hell is the rest of it coming from? And so the EIC gives us the ability to combine data that we take at RHIC with the new data from the EIC and hopefully answer some of those questions.

There's stuff that's more interesting to other people in the community, such as what happens when you take a nucleus of gold, for example, and you accelerate it near the speed of light? And now it's incredibly complicated—it's quarks, it's gluons, but it's many, many, many gluons. The question is: Does it just keep producing gluons infinitely? Or does it—at some point does that production cease? If it does the former, that's new physics; that's going outside of what we know from quantum mechanics. If it kind of saturates at some point, then that would be something we more or less would expect, but we don't know, and that's kind of studying something that's in the same ballpark as the quark-gluon plasma. It's basically a state of matter that is dominated by the strong force. To people who have been interested in the RHIC program this is probably the fundamental thing they wanna focus on, is the, the heavy ion part of it—the really crazy stuff that happens when you make a heavy ion go near the speed of light.

Feltman: Yeah, and also very obvious question I should have started with: How big is it [laughs]?

Jentsch: [Laughs] So this thing is a little bit bigger than a three-story house.

Feltman: Wow.

Jentsch: It weighs about 1,200 tons. The detector that will replace this for the EIC weighs a few hundred tons more. It's not small. And most of what you see that's heavy is iron. So there's a big magnet inside of this, and that magnet has to have a place for those magnetic fields to go ...

Feltman: Mm-hmm.

Jentsch: So we have iron to protect and remove all that magnetic field. And then we have lots of detectors, somewhere like 10 subdetectors inside, but they're made up of thousands of components.

Feltman: When you're, like, talking to a member of the public and physics makes their head spin, what is your headline—like, “This is why what we're doing is really cool and important”—for them?

Jentsch: Well, we're made of protons and neutrons. Everything around us is made of protons,neutrons, electrons; they're fundamental. And we have an understanding of quite a bit of it—I mean, our chemistry textbooks and physics textbooks, there's a lot of information there.

Feltman: Mm-hmm.

Jentsch: But isn't it interesting to wanna understand how these things achieve their basic properties? We know they have an electric charge. We know they have a mass. At the end of the day it's a basic thing for human nature to try to understand the world around us. If we know we're made up of these things, we don't understand those things, it should be something that just drives our curiosity.

Additionally, it's really cool to be able to study things from the early universe in a laboratory environment. And the fact that you have to build something this large to study something so small is also rather insane.

Feltman: Yeah.

Jentsch: So in and of itself this is just kind of a wild idea: that we have a machine this large to study something that we cannot see with the human eye.

Feltman: Yeah.

Jentsch: And so my, my hope would be that that is enough to drive someone toward a little bit of curiosity: You know, what are we made of? Why are we made of it? How does it have the properties it has? That's really what kind of drives me toward it.

Feltman: Yeah, I think most people would agree that understanding the basic particles that make up literally everything is pretty important, so thanks so much for taking the time to tell us about it and show us around.

Jentsch: Yeah, thanks for having me, and I hope to see you again in 10 years when we start taking data with the EIC.

Linguists Find Proof of Sweeping Language Pattern Once Deemed a ‘Hoax'

Inuit languages really do have many words for snow, linguists found—and other languages have conceptual specialties, too, potentially revealing what a culture values

By Cody Cottier edited by Allison Parshall

In 1884 the anthropologist Franz Boas returned from Baffin Island with a discovery that would kick off decades of linguistic wrangling: by his count, the local Inuit language had four words for snow, suggesting a link between language and physical environment. A great game of telephone inflated the number until, in 1984, the New York Times published an editorial claiming the Inuit have “100 synonyms” for the frozen white stuff we lump under a single term.

Boas's observation had swelled to mythic proportions. In a 1991 essay, British linguist Geoff Pullum called these claims a “hoax,” citing the work of linguist Laura Martin, who tracked the misinformation's evolution. He likened it to the xenomorph from Alien, a creature that “seemed to spring up everywhere once it got loose on the spaceship, and was very difficult to kill.” His acerbic critique rendered the subject taboo for a generation, says Victor Mair, an expert on Chinese language at the University of Pennsylvania. But now, he says, “it's coming back in a legitimate way.”

In a sweeping new computational analysis of world languages, researchers not only confirmed the emphasis on snow in the Inuit language Inuktitut but also uncovered many similar patterns: what snow is to the Inuit, lava is to Samoans and oatmeal to Scots. The results were published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA in April. Charles Kemp, a computational psychologist at the University of Melbourne in Australia and senior author of the study, says the results offer a window onto language speakers' culture. “It's a way to get a sense of the ‘chief interests of a people'—what's important to a society, what they prioritize and value,” he says, quoting Boas.

The researchers analyzed bilingual dictionaries between English and more than 600 languages, looking for what they call “lexical elaboration,” in which a language has many words related to a core concept. It's the same phenomenon that fueled the Inuit debate. But this study brings a twist: rather than the number of words, it measured their proportion, the slice of dictionary real estate taken up by a concept. This produced elaboration scores for hundreds of concepts, from “abandonment” to “zoo,” based on how many times the English words for those concepts appeared in the definitions of foreign words. You can explore the results in this online module that shows which languages have the most words for each concept and which concepts have the most words in each language.

Ripley Cleghorn; Source: “A computational analysis of lexical elaboration across languages,” by Temuulen Khishigsuren et al., in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA, Vol. 122, No. 15; April 15, 2025

Often the elaboration is clearly a product of environment—small wonder that Arabic, Farsi and Indigenous Australian languages abound with words to describe the desert, and Sanskrit, Tamil and Thai with words for elephants. Other cases aren't so straightforward. Many Oceanic languages, for example, have highly specific words for smell. In Marshallese, meļļā means “smell of blood” and jatbo means “smell of damp clothing.” This may be explained by the humidity of the rainforest, which amplifies scents. But why is the concept of rapture so prominent in Portuguese and agony in Hindi? What historical and cultural circumstances lead a language down such obscure paths? “I'm not sure if anybody knows,” Kemp says.

Mair says this research, which he highlighted on the popular linguistics blog Language Log, helps resurrect the much-maligned idea of linguistic relativity, sometimes known as the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis. At its boldest, linguistic relativity asserts that language determines how we perceive things, causing speakers of different languages to experience the world in radically different ways (think of the movie Arrival, in which a character becomes clairvoyant after learning an alien language). But in Mair's opinion, this study supports a softer claim: our brains all share the same basic machinery for perceiving the world, which language can subtly affect but not restrict. “It doesn't determine,” he says. “It influences.”

Similarly, Lynne Murphy, a linguist at the University of Sussex in England, who was not involved in this study, notes that “any language should be able to talk about anything.” We may not have the Marshallese word jatbo, but four words of English do the trick—“smell of damp clothing.” It's not that having many precise words for smell reveals mind-blowing cognitive abilities for processing smell; it's simply that single words are more efficient than phrases, so they tend to represent common subjects of discussion, highlighting areas of cultural significance. If we routinely needed to talk about the smell of damp clothing, we'd whittle that unwieldy phrase down to something like jatbo.

Still, “lexical elaboration alone cannot tell us about the culture of its speakers,” at least not with certainty, says study lead author Temuulen Khishigsuren, a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Melbourne. And because this analysis was based on dictionaries, it comes with the biases and limitations of the lexicographers that wrote them. As Murphy puts it, they “offer only snapshots of a language at a particular time, from a particular angle.” Some of the dictionaries used are decades or centuries old, and they may reflect the archaic concerns of colonizers—to translate the Bible or establish a trade route—as much as those of modern-day speakers. Dictionaries of vast written languages like German or Sanskrit are much larger than those for languages that are exclusively spoken and are loaded with esoteric terminology.

Because dictionaries don't represent how people use language in the real world, the next step would be to measure how often people actually talk or write about the concepts being studied, such as snow and smells and elephants. This is difficult for languages without large bodies of written text but could be possible for many languages, especially those used heavily on social media.

It bears remembering that these lexical elaborations come from comparison between languages—French only has “many” words for futility because other languages have fewer. And because all the bilingual dictionaries in this study map back to English—it's the language into which everything else gets translated—the analysis is influenced by the words used in English itself. If we find the patterns of elaboration in other languages unusual, it's safe to assume their speakers will return the favor. “English is as ‘different' as any other language,” Murphy says, which raises the question: “If we had started from, say, Spanish or Chinese or Malayalam, which concepts would have stood out for English?”

Zero Is Foundational to Modern Mathematics. But It Was Rejected for Centuries

Conceptual problems, ideology clashes and xenophobia prevented the concept of zero from catching on for a long time. Today all mathematics is based on it

By Manon Bischoff edited by Daisy Yuhas

I'm a zero at mental arithmetic. It's true—I struggle with this skill—but I want to focus on the phrase itself. In our language, we often equate zero with something negative. But zero is the only real number that is neither positive nor negative. It is neutral.

Why the negative association? Humankind has long harbored strong feelings toward zero; it was even banned in some places at one point. Xenophobia and ideology held back this powerful concept. Yet today all of mathematics is based on this number.

Defining “zilch,” “nil” or “0” is not easy. In fact, neuroscientists have studied how we conceive of nothing in varied ways. It should be no surprise, then, that cultures have approached zero in different ways over time.

If you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today.

But what is surprising is just how long people got on without this concept. Numbers have accompanied humankind throughout history. The oldest documents record them. Trade cannot be conducted without them, and they are needed to measure land or record a recipe for beer. Zero is somewhat unusual and not strictly necessary for all of these activities.

As a result, it took several millennia for zero to be accepted as a number in its own right. People have repeatedly resisted it. Yet today we know that all other numbers—and all of modern mathematics—would truly be nothing without zero.

Zero may have been invented more than once, with different functions. For example, around 5,000 years ago the Babylonians had a concept of zero, but it wasn't a number that stood for itself. Instead they—like us—used a place-value system to indicate numbers: if I write down three digits in a row, such as 145, then the first number corresponds to the place of hundreds, the second to tens and the last to ones (or units).

The Babylonians used a similar approach except that their system was not based on 10 but on 60. In a place-value system, you need a zero to distinguish a number such as 105 from 15. The Babylonians usually made do with inserting a space, which is one of the oldest references to something like a zero.

It's also notable that many ancient societies got by without this concept. In ancient Greece, all kinds of advanced mathematical considerations were made (just think of Pythagoras' theorem or the basic pillars of logic by Aristotle) without a zero per se. The abstract concept of nothingness was well known to the ancient Greeks, but they regarded it as part of logic, not mathematics. Zero is strange, after all. For example, no number can be divided by zero. The ancient Greeks disliked this property.

The exact origin of zero as we use it today has been the subject of some debate, but we know that in the seventh century C.E., the brilliant Indian scholar Brahmagupta introduced zero as a number, along with negative numbers, which had not been used before.

Previously, mathematical problems were usually illustrated using geometric objects. For example, you might want to know how two rectangular fields can be connected to form a square piece of land of equal size. Negative numbers are irrelevant for such tasks, as is zero.

Brahmagupta was also interested in such abstract problems, however. To use these new numbers correctly, he first needed a functioning set of rules that clearly specified how to deal with these quantities. In his book Brāhmasphuṭasiddhantā, for example, he wrote that the sum of two positives is positive, the sum of two negatives negative, and the sum of a positive and a negative is their difference; if they are equal, it is zero. He also wrote that the sum of a negative and zero is negative, that of a positive and zero is positive, and the sum of two zeros is zero.

In a similar style, Brahmagupta also described how to multiply and divide the new numbers. The rules he laid down around 1,400 years ago are the same we learn at school today—except for one. He defined zero by zero as zero, which is wrong from current mathematical perspectives.

Brahmagupta's rules, together with the Indian decimal number system, quickly spread throughout the world. Arabic scholars took up the concepts and developed the Arabic number system, on which our modern numbers are based. From there, the zero and Arabic numerals arrived in Europe—albeit at the worst possible time. The Crusades took place between the 11th and 13th centuries, and with them came an immense rejection of all ideas and knowledge of Arab or Islamic origin.

In Florence, Italy, this development culminated in the banning of the number zero in 1299. At that time, the economy in that city was flourishing, and merchants from all over the world came together to sell their goods. In a town famous for banking and trade, the zero posed a real problem: it was very easy to increase the size of a number on a piece of paper by simply adding a few zeros. A 10 quickly became a 100 or even a 1,000, whereas the Roman numeral system did not allow such manipulation. City leaders therefore decided to banish the zero and rely on the tried and tested Roman numerals.

But calculation with Roman numerals is incredibly complicated and cumbersome. So gradually, over more than 100 years, Arabic numerals, including the zero, prevailed. In the 15th century the concepts finally became accepted by society at large.

At the beginning of the 20th century, mathematician Ernst Zermelo created the set of rules on which modern mathematics is based. At that time, logicians were looking for the simplest possible rules from which everything in mathematics could be derived. Whether numbers, systems of equations, derivations or geometric objects, everything should spring from a few basic assumptions.

Zermelo developed nine simple axioms, that is, unproven basic assumptions, on which everything is based in math. These are still used today. One of the axioms is: “There is an empty set.” This is something like the zero of set theory. That's where it all starts—it's the “Let there be light!” of mathematics. And, in fact, this is the only set that Zermelo constructed so explicitly. The other rules say, for example, that you can “combine two sets to form a third set” or “select an element from a set.”

Everything else follows from the empty set, the “zero.” For example, the numbers are constructed from it. To do this, it helps to imagine a set as a bag into which you can pack objects. An empty set corresponds to an empty bag.

When constructing the numbers, Zermelo started with zero. It corresponds to the empty set or empty bag. “One” is the quantity into which the previously defined zero is packed, so it's a bag with an empty bag inside. Two is the quantity that contains the 1 and the 0, or a bag containing a bag that itself contains a bag. The 3 is then the quantity that contains the 2, the 1 and the 0—okay, I admit it gets confusing.

Graphically, this can be represented a little better if ∅ symbolizes the empty set:

0 = ∅ 1 = {0} = {∅} 2 = {0, 1} = {∅, {∅}} 3 = {0, 1, 2} = {∅, {∅}, {∅, {∅}}}

Zermelo has thus laid the foundations for integers. From here, all other numbers can be defined, including negative numbers, fractions, irrational numbers, and so on.

Mathematical concepts other than numbers can also be obtained in this way. You can gradually work your way up in complexity until you end up with the most abstract structures of modern mathematics. It is fortunate for humanity that we eventually came to realize the power of zero as a starting point and to accept it.

What Is a Galaxy?

Galaxies come in many shapes and sizes, and trying to define them is difficult

By Phil Plait edited by Lee Billings

A view of the spiral galaxy NGC 3982, as seen by NASA's Hubble Space Telescope. Galaxies come in many different variations, but astronomers classify them into four main types: spiral, elliptical, irregular and peculiar.

If you've been reading this column lately, you might have noticed a recent trend where I try to answer some deceptively simple questions: What is a planet? What is a moon? What is a star? A recurring theme here is that it's hard to define such terms because definitions are, well, definite, while nature is seldom so.

In keeping with both trend and theme, it's time to take a step outward—a big step.

What's a galaxy?

The word itself comes from galaktikós kyklos, or “milky circle,” the ancient Greek term for the Milky Way, our home galaxy.

In modern times, though, we use “galaxy” more generically to refer to any large system of stars, gas, dust and dark matter, all held together by their mutual gravity. That's actually not a bad definition, except for the small fact that not every galaxy has all these features. There are galaxies without any detectable gas and dust, and some that seem to have little or no dark matter. I suppose the common thread is that they do all have stars, but even then we run into trouble because not all gravitationally bound systems of stars rate as galaxies.

Very generally speaking, galaxies are tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of light-years across and have millions to several trillions of stars. Our Milky Way, for example, is about 120,000 light-years wide and contains somewhere between approximately 100 billion to 400 billion stars. It's hard to get even a rough number because faint red dwarfs are the most common kind of stars, but they're so dim they fade to invisibility even relatively close to our solar system.

Still, we do know the overall shape of our galaxy, which is a gigantic flattened disk with a central bulge of older, redder stars that is about 20,000 light-years wide. The structure of the disk is dominated by four major spiral arms and several smaller ones. These arms are dotted by huge clouds of gas and dust from which stars are born. Many of these stars are massive, luminous and blue, giving the spiral arms their characteristic azure hue. Because we're inside the galaxy, mapping it is difficult, so many details of its structure remain to be determined.

Spirals are only one of four major classifications for galaxies; the others are elliptical, irregular and peculiar.

Elliptical galaxies would be better called spheroidal; they can be spherical but are more commonly elongated, a bit like a cotton ball. Some of the largest galaxies we know are elliptical, like the mighty M87 galaxy, which has several trillion stars. M87 sits in the center of the Virgo Cluster—a large group of galaxies bound together by gravity that boasts about 2,000 members. In fact, such giant ellipticals are common in the centers of galaxy clusters. These galaxies grow by eating other ones, both large and small, that venture too close to the cluster core, so the elliptical shape itself may be caused in part by this cannibalism process.

Not all ellipticals are huge, though: many are quite small. These are called “dwarf elliptical galaxies” and are satellites of larger galaxies. The Andromeda galaxy, for example, has many dwarf ellipticals orbiting it.

Ellipticals don't have much gas in them, if any. They appear to have exhausted essentially all their gas by making stars long ago. Massive blue stars don't live long; they explode as supernovae within millions of years of their birth, so a few billion years after its gas is depleted, an elliptical galaxy will look very red, dominated by ruddier lower-mass stars.

Peculiar galaxies are rare. They have all sorts of shapes but tend to be, well, odd. They are usually the result of galactic collisions, train wrecks on a cosmic scale. The mutual gravity of two interacting galaxies stretches and distorts their otherwise regular shapes, creating long, curving tails of flung-away stars. Sometimes, if a smaller galaxy plows right through the center of a larger one, the collision creates a ring galaxy, in which the stars and gas are splashed away from the larger galaxy's center like ripples on a pond after a rock is dropped in.

Finally, there are the irregulars. These tend to be on the small end of the galactic scale and, as their categorization suggests, have no overall shape. The Small Magellanic Cloud (or SMC), a companion satellite of the Milky Way, is an irregular galaxy. Its sibling, the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), appears irregular at first by eye, but we now know it has some structure in it in the form of a single spiral arm. Both of these galaxies are small compared to the Milky Way; the SMC has a few hundred million stars and is just under 20,000 light-years across, while the LMC has billions of stars and is just more than 30,000 light-years wide.

The existence of the irregulars raises an important question: How small can a galaxy get? The current paradigm is that galaxies initially formed shortly after the big bang. Huge clouds of invisible dark matter accumulated regular matter (in the form of gas) via gravity, which eventually collapsed to form galaxies and the stars in them. A study published in April 2025 in the Astrophysical Journal Letters showed that there is a minimum mass needed for such a dark matter cloud to cause the normal matter to collapse, and it's around 10 million times the mass of the sun. This may, then, be a lower limit on the smallest galaxy that can form.

But this lower end of the galactic scale is still rather murky, in part because the stars that serve as observable tracers of small galaxies can form even smaller structures called star clusters. One kind, called open clusters, can have thousands of stars in them. Globular star clusters, on the other hand, can host tens of millions of stars that total up to several million times the mass of the sun. Even the biggest known globular cluster (about 150 light-years or so across) is still smaller than a dwarf galaxy. We think that many of the largest of these clusters, such as Omega Centauri, actually once were dwarf galaxies themselves, however. Their shrunken state is from multiple passes near a larger galaxy that stripped them of stars, leaving a smaller, more compact object behind.

What do we call Omega Centauri, then? A huge globular cluster or a partially digested dwarf galaxy? Also, some dwarf galaxies appear to contain no dark matter, and some have far fewer stars than expected, even below the theoretical lower limit, further confusing the issue. At the smaller end, it seems, the border becomes irritatingly fuzzy. That, too, is a recurring theme when we try to create rigid definitions for cosmic objects. Humans love sharp delineations, but the universe is under no obligation to obey them.

One last thing: in 2016 a study showed that the universe may contain as many as two trillion separate galaxies. The cosmos clearly likes making galaxies, and however you define them, there are a vast number for us to study and learn from.

How relatedness to nature is linked to well-being is determined by district-level socioeconomic status. The Kobe University analysis is based on survey results from two major Japanese metropolitan areas.

Hiking. Camping. Even just walking in the park. Be it a current hobby or a childhood pastime, many urban residents have engaged in activities that have nurtured in them a positive relationship with nature. But in our modern society, disparities in access to nature have only grown larger between residential areas. And while this especially affects those that face social and economic challenges, research that explores the relationship between district-level socioeconomic status, nature and well-being remains limited.

Kobe University human environmental scientist UCHIYAMA Yuta specializes in studying how differences in urban and rural lifestyles affect quality of life. He and his team surveyed 3,500 residents in two major metropolitan areas of Japan (Tokyo-Yokohama and Osaka-Kobe) in order to determine their relationship with nature both objectively (based on proximity and access to natural spaces) and subjectively (based on perceived relatedness to nature). The responses were then categorized based on socioeconomic status by area and the degree of urban development of their residential area to serve as a third dimension in clarifying the relationship between well-being and nature.

The results of this study, published in Landscape and Urban Planning, show that the more related to nature people feel, the better their overall well-being is, and that this relationship is particularly pronounced in urbanized areas with poorer socioeconomic conditions.

But why is this the case? Related studies have suggested that nature visits are important for maintaining and improving health for those under substantial stress, and that this is especially true for residents of areas with poorer socioeconomic conditions. Conversely, residents of areas with better socioeconomic conditions have access to additional resources for enhancing their health and overall well-being, making the effects of nature visits relatively less pronounced.

Uchiyama explains what this means for policies aimed at reducing inequality in well-being, saying: ""We anticipate that conserving and enhancing existing natural spaces and organizing community events will have a positive effect on well-being in areas of relatively poor socioeconomic status. Interestingly, of the factors we surveyed, childhood experience with nature in particular was a significant predictor of adult well-being."" This finding further emphasizes that early-life exposure and equitable access to nature are essential to public health.

Moving forward, further analysis of the relationships between independent variables as well as key factors that vary over time (e.g., moving between regions of differing socioeconomic level) should prove useful in obtaining a clearer picture of the relationship between nature relatedness, socioeconomic level and well-being. Uchiyama says, ""As these findings are consistent with similar studies conducted in other regions, interventions for both subjective and objective factors should be applicable to other regions with similar socioeconomic contexts, such as other cities in Monsoon Asia. Currently, as part of an international collaborative project, we are analyzing how knowledge and perceptions influence well-being, resilience, and preparedness of citizens and decision-makers in major cities in Asia including Bangkok and Manila.""

Metrics details

The evolution of isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)-wildtype glioblastoma (GBM) after standard-of-care therapy remains poorly understood. Here we analyzed matched primary and recurrent GBMs from 59 patients using single-nucleus RNA sequencing and bulk DNA sequencing, assessing the longitudinal evolution of the GBM ecosystem across layers of cellular and molecular heterogeneity. The most consistent change was a lower malignant cell fraction at recurrence and a reciprocal increase in glial and neuronal cell types in the tumor microenvironment (TME). The predominant malignant cell state differed between most matched pairs, but no states were exclusive or highly enriched in either time point, nor was there a consistent longitudinal trajectory across the cohort. Nevertheless, specific trajectories were enriched in subsets of patients. Changes in malignant state abundances mirrored changes in TME composition and baseline profiles, reflecting the co-evolution of the GBM ecosystem. Our study provides a blueprint of GBM's diverse longitudinal trajectories and highlights the treatment and TME modifiers that shape them.

Despite significant advances in basic and translational research, isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)-wildtype glioblastoma (GBM)1 remains incurable. The standard treatment for newly diagnosed GBM consists of maximal surgical resection followed by radiotherapy and concurrent treatment with the alkylating agent temozolomide (TMZ). This treatment often elicits a partial response, particularly when the promoter of the O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) gene is methylated, as this gene encodes a DNA-repair protein that can remove alkyl groups added to O6-methylguanine by TMZ. However, the disease invariably recurs with a median overall survival of 14.6 months2,3. To interrogate mechanisms of recurrence, several studies have analyzed the longitudinal evolution of GBM specimens4,5,6. The Glioma Longitudinal Analysis (GLASS) consortium reported high similarity in genetic driver alterations between primary and recurrent GBM, indicating that standard treatment does not exert substantial clonal selection7. Conversely, transcriptome and proteome studies have demonstrated more dynamic evolutionary patterns, such as a proneural-to-mesenchymal (MES) shift, enhanced neuronal signaling and upregulation of extracellular matrix (ECM)-related genes at recurrence5,6,8,9,10,11,12,13,14. However, published longitudinal GBM studies have typically relied on bulk tissue profiling (averaging the signal across the malignant and tumor microenvironment (TME) compartments) and lack the granularity to independently interrogate the evolution of malignant and TME cell types and cell states. Single-cell longitudinal studies have had limited cohort size and limited clinical metadata, precluding a direct analysis of single-cell profiles with clinical correlates14. These limitations, along with the challenge of reconciling results from different groups that leverage diverse analytical and classification schemes, underscore the need for a larger single-cell longitudinal GBM dataset with detailed clinical and genomic annotations and with robust analysis.

We sought to address these challenges in two studies that we present here. We established the GBM Cellular Analysis of Resistance and Evolution (CARE) consortium to characterize the longitudinal evolutionary trajectories in GBM at single-cell resolution. We performed single-nuclei RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) of paired primary and recurrent GBM samples from 59 patients with detailed clinical annotations and genetic profiles. In the companion study of ref. 15, we conducted an analysis of the data independent of sampling time (primary versus recurrent) that characterized GBM transcriptional ecosystems across multiple layers. In this work, we examine the longitudinal changes in these ecosystems between primary and recurrence and identify molecular and clinical features that modify their trajectories. We show that a lower malignant cell fraction and a reciprocal increase in proportions of glial and neuronal (that is, glio-neural) TME cell types is the most consistent longitudinal change at recurrence, observed in 66% of cases. Contrary to prior studies, we observed no consistent malignant GBM state enrichment at recurrence across the cohort. However, specific trajectories were associated with defined subsets of cases, such as GBMs with MGMT methylation or radiation-related small deletion phenotype. Notably, changes in malignant state abundance were mirrored by corresponding changes in baseline profiles and TME composition, reflecting interdependent alterations of the GBM ecosystem. Our study highlights the diverse longitudinal GBM trajectories that are shaped by treatment response and TME interactions.

We collected matched snap-frozen GBM specimens from primary and recurrent surgeries (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Table 1). Tumor samples were obtained from seven hospitals, resulting in a total of 121 tumors from 59 patients profiled by snRNA-seq and whole-exome sequencing (WES) or whole-genome sequencing (WGS; Fig. 1b; Methods). For the majority of patients, we profiled samples from two time points (labeled T1 and T2); for three patients, we profiled samples from three time points (T1, T2 and T3). Most matched sample pairs were derived from primary and first recurrent tumors, except for three pairs that consisted of two recurrent samples and four pairs that consisted of a primary and a second recurrence.

The donut chart at the top represents average somatic mutation distribution for whether an alteration was detected at both time points (T1 + T2), the primary tumor only (T1) or the recurrent tumor only (T2). The bar plot at the bottom is for the known driver genomic events and the representative phenotypes related to the genomic alterations—arm-level refers to whole chromosome arm amplification (amp) (chr7q)/deletion (del) (chr10q), CNA refers to high-level gene amplification or deletion, and SNV refers to single-nucleotide mutations. De novo hypermutation (HM) indicates a high mutation burden at both time points without evidence for treatment-associated mutational signatures. Small deletion indicates tumors with increased small deletion burden at recurrence. UMAP, uniform manifold approximation and projection; chr, chromosome; assoc., associated.

Tumor location was known for 51 patients, of whom 45 cases locally recurred at the surgical margin and six cases recurred at a site distant from the resection cavity. The majority of patients (51/59) received radiotherapy with concurrent TMZ and adjuvant TMZ following surgery. The improved clinical outcomes in our cohort (median interval between two surgeries = 12.4 months, median overall survival = 24 months), compared with historical cohorts, likely reflect better performance status of patients eligible for multiple surgical resections, consistent with a younger age at diagnosis (median = 53 years, range = 19–73 years).

In our 10x Genomics snRNA-seq dataset, 429,305 cells passed quality filters (Methods). Cells were classified as malignant (246,408 cells) or nonmalignant (182,897 cells) based on inferred chromosomal copy-number aberrations (CNA). Nonmalignant cells were further classified and annotated based on established cell-type signatures and marker gene expression16,17,18,19 (Fig. 1c; Methods). Nonmalignant cells clustered together across time points (Fig. 1c, bottom), and we did not observe a significant difference in the number of cells profiled or the number of genes detected per cell between time points (Extended Data Fig. 1a,b).

Mutational and CNA profiles were derived from bulk DNA-sequencing data (Fig. 1b). The frequency of GBM driver alterations was consistent with prior studies7 and remained largely stable across time points (Fig. 1d and Extended Data Fig. 1c). However, 26% of cases (14 of 54 patients) acquired treatment-related DNA hypermutation20 or an increase in small deletion burden21 at recurrence (Fig. 1d, right).

Global (nonmatched) comparison of cell-type abundance showed overall similarity between time points, except for significantly lower abundance of malignant cells and higher abundance of glio-neural TME (oligodendrocytes, neurons and astrocytes (ACs)) in recurrent tumors (Fig. 2a and Extended Data Fig. 2a). We further separated the broad nonmalignant cell types (for example, myeloid) into more granular states (for example, microglia and bone marrow-derived macrophages) using non-negative matrix factorization (NMF; Methods). Analysis of these higher-resolution cell states demonstrated that recurrences were enriched with reactive ACs and with oligodendrocytes expressing an interferon program (Extended Data Fig. 2b). To further evaluate differences in cell-type composition, we categorized tumors into six compositional groups based on the relative abundance of malignant and TME cell types (Methods). Briefly, tumors were divided into the following three main groups based on their malignant fraction: high malignant fraction (HMF), intermediate malignant fraction (IMF) and low malignant fraction (LMF). The latter group was further subdivided by the dominant TME cell type (for example, LMF—tumor-associated macrophages (TAM), oligodendrocyte (OC) and glio-neural (GN); Extended Data Fig. 2c, left). The HMF group was enriched in primary tumors, while the LMF with glio-neural (LMF—GN) or oligodendrocytic TME (LMF—OC) were enriched at recurrence (P = 0.005 for both groups, two-sided Fisher's test; Fig. 2b, left).

Correlations were computed separately in primary samples (top-left) and in recurrent samples (bottom-right) and are ordered according to the hierarchical clustering pattern of the recurrent samples. NS, not significant.

To validate our findings, we re-analyzed an independent longitudinal GBM snRNA-seq cohort14 (Extended Data Fig. 2d,e). Consistent with our cohort, we observed lower malignant cell abundance, higher oligodendrocyte abundance and similar enrichment of LMF compositional groups at recurrence (P = 0.04, two-sided Fisher's exact test; Extended Data Fig. 2f).

Survival analysis stratified by compositional groups showed significant differences in survival time after the second surgery (Extended Data Fig. 2g, top) but not in the time interval between the first and second surgeries. Patients with glio-neural TME at recurrence had significantly longer survival time after second surgery than patients with other recurrences (median = 19 versus 8 months, P = 0.012, log-rank test; Fig. 2c, left). These differences in clinical course were independent of other clinical characteristics, including MGMT methylation status (Extended Data Fig. 2h, top).

Next, we investigated changes in malignant cell state abundance across time points. As described in more detail in the companion paper15, we applied NMF to malignant cells and identified ten GBM metaprograms (MPs) representing intratumoral cellular heterogeneity (Methods)22,23,24. This included the cell cycle and the previously identified AC-like, MES-like, stress, hypoxia, neural progenitor cell-like (NPC-like) and oligodendrocyte progenitor cell-like (OPC-like) states. In addition, we identified the following three previously undescribed states: a differentiated neuronal state (NEU-like), a glial progenitor-like state (GPC-like) and a cilia-related state (Cilia-like), characterized by marker genes, pathway enrichments and similarity with normal neural cell types. Beyond cell states, we defined three baseline gene expression profiles (BP), reflecting intertumor heterogeneity that is not driven by differences in malignant cell state abundance. The three BPs were annotated as glial-BP, ECM-BP and neuronal-BP.

Comparison of malignant cell state abundance between primary and recurrent samples did not reveal significant differences both in our cohort and in the cohort of ref. 14 (Extended Data Fig. 3a,b). Moreover, we did not detect significant differences across time points when considering a division of tumors into six groups based on dominant malignant states or by BPs (Fig. 2b (middle and right), Extended Data Fig. 2c (middle and right) and Extended Data Fig. 3c,d). However, survival analysis stratified by dominant malignant cell states showed significantly worse prognosis in the MES-like/hypoxia group at recurrence (median survival time from second surgery = 5 versus 10.3 months, P = 0.00086, log-rank test; Fig. 2c (right) and Extended Data Fig. 2g,h), consistent with a recent study14.

The multiple transcriptomic layers of cell-type composition, malignant cell states and malignant BPs are significantly associated with each other and define three stereotypical GBM ecosystems (that is, glial, neuronal and ECM)15. We next investigated whether interactions between components of the GBM ecosystems are maintained between primary and recurrent tumors. We separately computed for each time point the correlations between (1) proportions of 11 TME cell types, (2) proportions of ten malignant cell states and (3) three BP scores. In both time points, we found three comparable clusters of correlated features (Fig. 2d and Extended Data Fig. 3e). These conserved associations (P < 0.01 by permutation test) remain largely stable.

Nevertheless, we did observe some differences, such as preferential association of the neuronal-high ecosystem with OPC-like malignant cells (in primary samples) and with NEU-like malignant cells (in recurrent samples; Fig. 2d and Extended Data Fig. 3e). Interestingly, ligand–receptor analysis with CellChat25 showed some differential enrichment of predicted interactions across time points. For example, neuroligin (NLGN) and neuregulin (NRG) gene families—expressed by oligodendrocytes and neurons—are predicted to interact with the neurexin (NRXN) gene family or ERBB4 on NEU-like and NPC-like malignant cell states, preferentially at recurrence (Extended Data Fig. 3f)15,26,27,28. Taken together, global analysis of our cohort (not matched per sample pairs) shows differences in cell-type composition that are consistent with decreased malignant cell fraction and further integration of recurrent GBM cells with the brain parenchyma9,29,30, but does not reveal substantial global differences either in malignant cellular states or in BPs.

Despite global conservation of cell types and malignant cellular states, when examining individual matched sample pairs, we found extensive divergence (Fig. 3a). Most (68%) sample pairs diverged from one compositional group at diagnosis to a different one at recurrence. Similarly, 64% and 56% switched groups of dominant malignant states and of BP, respectively. We observed the same phenomenon in the cohort of ref. 14, with 68% of patients switching compositional groups and 72% switching malignant groups at recurrence (Extended Data Fig. 4a). While no group was significantly enriched, there was a trend toward increased neuronal-BP and reduced glial-BP at recurrence (Fig. 3a (right)). Remarkably, we observed 72% of all possible trajectories at least once (63 of 88 trajectories), including opposite trajectories. For example, patient P1 had an increase of AC-like and decrease of GPC-like malignant cells at recurrence, while patient P2 had an opposite trajectory (Extended Data Fig. 4b). Furthermore, patients profiled at three time points showed opposite trajectories between two treatment intervals (T1–T2 and T2–T3), despite recurrences occurring at the same site (Fig. 3b). Finally, the frequency of conservation was not significantly different between local and distant recurrences (P = 0.66, two-sided Fisher's test).

This divergence of individual sample pairs prompted us to compare the observed patterns of conservation to those expected by a null model in which matched primary–recurrent pairs are as similar to one another as pairs of randomly selected samples. This analysis revealed that, across all three layers, matched pairs were significantly more conserved than expected by chance (P < 0.004 for each layer, binomial test; Fig. 3c). Thus, matched samples usually diverge in their transcriptomic classification and may diverge in a wide range of trajectories between and within patients but remain significantly more likely to retain any specific classification compared to a random pair of samples. This observation prompted us to further stratify our cohorts and attempt to identify predictors/modifiers of evolutionary trajectories.

Previous studies have shown that patients with methylated MGMT promoter exhibit better response to TMZ and have more favorable prognosis2,31, but whether this is mirrored by differences in either cellular architecture or in cellular trajectories following treatment is unknown. We classified patients as methylated (MGMT-MET, n = 12), unmethylated (MGMT-UM, n = 19) or unknown (n = 28), based on the primary tumor's MGMT promoter methylation status. As expected, MGMT-MET patients exhibited longer surgical intervals than MGMT-UM patients, both in our cohort and in the GLASS cohort (Extended Data Fig. 5a,b).

We next assessed whether MGMT promoter methylation status correlated with MGMT expression in single cells, as this association has been challenging to establish in bulk analyses32. Malignant cell expression of MGMT was significantly lower in primary MGMT-MET samples than in primary MGMT-UM samples (P = 5.3 × 10−6, two-sided Wilcoxon rank-sum test; Fig. 4a)32,33, but this effect was not observed for TME cell types (Fig. 4b). In a subset of MGMT-MET cases, MGMT expression increased at recurrence, possibly reflecting a competitive disadvantage of cells with low MGMT expression during treatment.

a, Average MGMT expression in malignant cells per sample across time points. Samples were included only if the MGMT promoter status was verified using a methylation assay and were annotated as methylated/unmethylated according to the status of the primary sample (n = 12 methylated and n = 19 unmethylated). Dashed lines connect matched samples. Statistical significance was estimated using a two-sided Wilcoxon rank-sum test; unadjusted P values are shown. In a, for within-group comparisons, a Wilcoxon signed rank test (paired) was used. b, MGMT expression level in each cell type between methylated and unmethylated samples. Statistical significance was estimated using a two-sided Wilcoxon rank-sum test; unadjusted P values are shown. c, Survival curve for the patients included in this analysis stratified according to MGMT expression level.

Statistical significance of survival difference between the groups in each panel was computed using the log-rank test. d, Survival curves for MGMT-MET patients stratified according to MGMT expression level.

Statistical significance of survival difference between the groups in each panel was computed using the log-rank test. e, Survival curves for MGMT expression high group stratified according to MGMT promoter methylation status.

Genes are ordered according to their correlation (across patients) with the difference between signature scores. FC, fold change.

The correlation between MGMT promoter methylation and low MGMT expression prompted us to build a logistic regression model that uses average malignant cell MGMT expression to infer MGMT methylation status (Extended Data Fig. 5c). When applying this model, we found that classification by MGMT expression levels was associated with surgical resection interval (Fig. 4c) and, in fact, led to improved association compared to classification by MGMT promoter methylation alone—within the MGMT-MET group, we observed significantly longer surgical interval for the MGMT-low expression group relative to the MGMT-high/MGMT-intermediate expression groups (Fig. 4d); in contrast, within the MGMT-high expression group, there was no significant difference in surgical interval when further stratifying by MGMT promoter methylation status (Fig. 4e). This improved performance of MGMT expression level could be due to exclusion of nonmalignant cells that may affect MGMT promoter methylation assessment; alternatively, it could indicate that MGMT expression level in the therapeutically targeted malignant cells more directly reflects MGMT protein activity and hence is more predictive of treatment response.

Comparison of cellular architecture between MGMT-low and MGMT-high expression samples showed no significant differences in cell-type composition and malignant state distribution (Extended Data Fig. 5d,e). However, MGMT expression level was significantly associated with changes in abundance of MES-like states at recurrence, both in our CARE dataset and in ref. 14 (Fig. 4f and Extended Data Fig. 5f). Specifically, MGMT-low tumors recurred with a lower abundance of MES-like states compared to their primary samples, while MGMT-high tumors displayed the opposite pattern. Baseline profiles changed in a similar manner—trending toward decreased ECM in MGMT-low, highlighting the coordinated evolution of cellular states and BPs (Extended Data Fig. 5g).

To further identify longitudinal gene expression patterns specific to MGMT-high and MGMT-low samples, we compared their malignant pseudobulk expression (aggregated gene expression from all malignant cells per sample) across time points. This revealed four groups of genes—those consistently upregulated or downregulated in recurrence, regardless of MGMT expression (CONS-UP and CONS-DN), and those upregulated specifically in MGMT-low (low-UP) or MGMT-high samples (high-UP; Extended Data Fig. 5h). CONS-UP was enriched with genes involved in postsynaptic activity (for example, GRIN1/GRIN2A/GRIN2B, GABRA1/GABRA4), consistent with the trend toward increased neuronal-BP in recurrence (Fig. 3a), while CONS-DN was enriched with genes related to oxidative phosphorylation (for example, NDUFB4/NDUFB11, UQCRB/UQCRQ) and stemness (for example, CD24, DCX, SOX4/SOX11 and SOX11; Extended Data Fig. 5i). In contrast to those MGMT-independent gene sets, low-UP genes were enriched with genes linked to gliogenesis (for example, ACSL1, OLIG1/OLIG2 and SOX8), whereas high-UP genes were enriched with mesenchyme development and ECM remodeling (for example, COL1A1/COL1A2, COL1A2, DCN, FN1 and LOXL1; Fig. 4g). To validate our findings, we repeated this analysis in the ref. 14 dataset and found significant similarities, especially in the high-UP signature (Jaccard index 8.5% versus 1.2% expected, P < 0.0001, bootstrapping).

In summary, our single-cell analysis revealed that MGMT expression in malignant cells predicts time to recurrence and influences longitudinal cellular trajectories—MES-like state and ECM-related genes tend to be enriched in recurrence in MGMT-high (likely nonresponsive) patients, while in MGMT-low (likely responsive) patients, recurrence is associated with loss of MES-like states and enrichment of genes related to gliogenesis. Our results suggest that prior attempts that failed at correlating MGMT expression with treatment response32 were likely confounded by bulk analysis and expression of MGMT by nonmalignant cells.

Treatment may affect GBM genetic evolution, as supported by reports of somatic hypermutation following TMZ chemotherapy and/or small deletion phenotype following radiotherapy7,20,21,34. To analyze the longitudinal mutation patterns in the CARE cohort, we examined mutation burden and mutational signatures following therapy. We observed that mutation burden (mutations per megabase) generally increased at recurrence (P = 0.01, two-sided paired Wilcoxon; Extended Data Fig. 6a) and identified four treatment-associated hypermutant samples (mutation burden > 10 mutations per megabase (Mut per Mb) at recurrence; Methods)34. Two tumor pairs displayed high mutation burden at both time points without evidence of treatment-associated mutation signature (COSMIC single base substitution (SBS) 11; Extended Data Fig. 6b).

To investigate new mutational signature associations at recurrence, we examined the frequency of the COSMIC v3 SBS signatures35, both in our CARE cohort (n = 46 patients) and in the GLASS cohort (n = 138 patients). In both cohorts, we observed a significant decrease in SBS1 (aging/clock-like etiology) and an increase in SBS21 (defective mismatch repair) at recurrence (Fig. 5a and Extended Data Fig. 6c). Notably, patients with increased mutations attributed to SBS21 did not tend to acquire mutations in mismatch repair genes. While mutational signatures temporally differed, we did not observe individual mutations enriched at recurrence (adjusted Fisher's exact test P > 0.05). Among small insertion/deletion variants, we observed increased burden of deletions (Fig. 5b) but not insertions (Extended Data Fig. 5d), including ten recurrences that acquired the small deletion phenotype without treatment-associated hypermutation (Methods; Fig. 5b). Taken together, our analyses reveal that subsets of tumors acquire consistent patterns of genetic alterations following treatment.

To understand whether post-treatment genetic alterations modify cellular state evolution, we investigated the specific trajectories of tumors with hypermutation, SBS21, and small deletion phenotypes. For hypermutant tumors, we did not observe a consistent cellular phenotype at recurrence, although this analysis was limited by sample size (n = 4). In contrast, patients who acquired small deletions were enriched with hypoxia and MES-like cell states (Fig. 5c and Extended Data Fig. 6e; paired Wilcoxon rank-sum test, P < 0.05). We observed a similar effect for tumors with increased SBS21 signal, although this effect was weaker when excluding samples with co-occurring small deletion phenotype (Fig. 5c and Extended Data Fig. 6f). The association between recurrence-specific small deletions and hypoxia state was recapitulated in analysis of bulk samples from GLASS9 (Fig. 5d). In contrast, the MES-like observation did not validate in the GLASS cohort (Extended Data Fig. 6g), possibly due to similarities between MES-like and nonmalignant profiles that make it difficult to disentangle these signals in bulk datasets. Hypoxic cells have been linked to deregulated epigenetics and stress responses36 and, consequently, to increased resistance to radiation37. Thus, malignant cells in hypoxic regions may be better able to repair radiotherapy-associated DNA damage, leading to an outgrowth of hypoxic state at recurrence.

Finally, we examined the correlation between overall genetic distance, as defined by longitudinal single-nucleotide variant (SNV)/CNA differences, and overall malignant transcriptional distance (Methods). We found a significant correlation (Pearson's correlation = 0.42, P = 0.009; Fig. 5e) that was retained when analyzing only SNV or CNAs (Extended Data Fig. 6h,i), suggesting that intratumoral genetic evolution during disease progression contributes to transcriptional evolution.

Intertumoral and intratumoral heterogeneity in GBM has been associated with treatment resistance and disease recurrence, but how specific subsets of GBM cells respond to therapy remains poorly understood. Here we leveraged a longitudinally matched multi-omic GBM snRNA-seq and bulk DNA dataset of 121 tumors from 59 patients consisting of ~430,000 nuclei to comprehensively characterize the compositional, transcriptional and genetic changes that GBMs undergo following standard-of-care. We found extensive variability in longitudinal trajectories of different patients (Fig. 6). While many trajectories were unpredictable, we identified patient characteristics—MGMT methylation and increased small deletion burden—that were associated with particular trajectories and expanded our understanding of recurrences.

Analysis of the GBM CARE dataset reveals key patterns of GBM evolution following treatment. (1) The most common observation was in the cell-type composition layer, where many samples exhibited a reduced malignant cell fraction at recurrence. (2) At the malignant state level, many tumors recurred with an unpredictable trajectory that likely reflects patient-specific evolution (top). A smaller subset of tumors recurred with more predictable trajectories, such as reduced MES-like fraction for MGMT-MET versus MGMT-UM primary tumors (middle) or increased hypoxia fraction for samples with increased small deletion burden following treatment (bottom). Columns separated into malignant and nonmalignant fractions indicate the relative proportions per tumor. Only selected nonmalignant and malignant cell states are shown for clarity. Hyp, hypoxia.

Previous studies have highlighted specific transcriptional trajectories during GBM evolution. The recent GLASS consortium study highlighted three trajectories toward neuronal, MES and proliferative profiles9, and other studies have highlighted proneural-to-MES phenotypic shifts11,14,38. While we similarly identified these recurrence-associated patterns, our analysis suggests that their overall frequency is limited and that such trajectories are enriched only in specific subsets of patients, while global comparison of cell states between primary and recurrent samples shows overall similarity. In particular, a shift toward the MES phenotype following treatment was not observed as a globally enriched trend in our dataset, only in specific subsets of patients. This discordance with prior studies may be attributable to at least the following three effects: (1) differences in technology (for example, bulk versus single-cell profiling), (2) cohort/sampling (for example, single-center sampling, tissue digestion versus not) and (3) analysis methods. There may also be biases due to additional treatments that were not addressed (bevacizumab, corticosteroids, etc.).

Our dataset contains tumor samples that were collected from seven medical centers across six countries, limiting the possibility of results being skewed toward a particular recurrence trajectory due to institution-specific procedures. Moreover, the samples in our dataset were processed and profiled by three different labs, limiting the possibility of skewing due to a lab-specific batch effect. The snRNA-seq protocol used by our labs to process and profile tumor samples was digestion-independent and optimized for brain tumors39, capturing a higher number of transcripts than prior single-nucleus GBM studies (Extended Data Fig. 2e). This likely results in a more faithful representation of the tumor tissue, as evident by the higher diversity of TME cell types in our dataset and the discovery of new malignant cell states.

Neuronal pathways were consistently found to be upregulated in recurrent GBM8,9,12. However, it is important to note that this reflects only subsets of patients in each study and that we observe a wide diversity of trajectories from primary to matched recurrent samples. Leveraging the resolution and scale of our dataset, we showed that this phenomenon correlates with decreased malignant cell fraction and concomitant increased proportions of neurons in the TME; only in a small subset of cases, this is accompanied by the enrichment of NEU-like malignant state and the neuronal baseline expression profile of the tumors. These results suggest that, following treatment, integration of the residual GBM cells with the brain parenchyma is likely enhanced29,30.

Beyond defined subsets, our study makes the challenging observation that, for the majority of GBMs, longitudinal cellular trajectories are diverse and unpredictable. We speculate that this diversity reflects at least the following three phenomena: first, given the genetic and epigenetic heterogeneity in primary tumors, it might be expected that tumors with distinct underlying biology will also have distinct trajectories of recurrence. Second, even within a single GBM, there is extensive spatial heterogeneity23,40; as primary and recurrent samples are obtained from different locations, their differences might reflect such spatial heterogeneity and, therefore, depend on sampling40. Third, patients vary considerably both in their treatment histories and in their response to treatments, potentially leading to distinct recurrence trajectories. Many GBM patients are treated by additional therapies in diverse combinations beyond standard-of-care, which is a limitation in this study. Moreover, even standard-of-care induces distinct patient responses, and we identified the following two cases in which treatment responses are linked to recurrence trajectory: (1) MGMT-MET (MGMT-low expression) samples (more likely to respond to alkylating agents) are associated with depletion of MES-like states in recurrence and (2) the small deletion phenotype, previously linked to radiotherapy21, is associated with increased hypoxia states in recurrence.

In summary, we present a comprehensive analysis of GBM recurrence at single-cell resolution. Our analysis shows that, globally, recurrent GBMs are generally similar to primary GBMs in their cellular states, composition and other features of the GBM ecosystem. Accordingly, a wide range of recurrence trajectories are observed, highlighting extensive diversity in GBM evolution. Nevertheless, subsets of tumors with evidence for particular treatment responses are skewed toward specific transcriptional trajectories. These findings offer more detailed insights over prior observations and provide an opportunity to stratify recurrent patients more precisely, potentially leading to specific treatment strategies.

It was approved by the Institutional Review Board of SNU Hospital (approval H-2004-049-1116). NORLUX Neuro-oncology Laboratory (NORLUX) cohort (n = 13)—the tumors were collected from Centre Hospitalier de Luxembourg (CHL, Neurosurgical Department). It was approved by the National Committee for Ethics in Research, Luxembourg, under the protocol 201201/06. Cohorts were added to the Institutional Review Board protocol Dana–Farber/Harvard Cancer Center 10-417. Patients were male and female. Clinical information of the cohorts is summarized in Supplementary Table 1.

No statistical method was used to determine the sample size. Data were excluded from select analyses when the number of malignant cells within a sample was low in at least one time point. Throughout the figures in this manuscript (Figs. 2–5 and Extended Data Figs. 1–3, 5 and 6), the boxplots reflect the following summary statistics: (1) the line splitting the box represents the median value; (2) the lower and upper edges correspond to the first and third quartiles (the 25th and 75th percentiles); (3) the upper whisker extends from the edge to the largest value no further than 1.5× interquartile range (IQR) from the edge; (4) the lower whisker extends from the edge to the smallest value at most 1.5× IQR of the edge; and (5) if the plots do not include jitter points representing the actual data, then data beyond the end of the whiskers are plotted individually as outlying points. The statistical analysis described in this work was done using R version 4.0.1 and above.

Protocol 1 (laboratory 1 and laboratory 2 for the cohorts from Duke University, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Tokyo University Hospital, St. Michael's Hospital and Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital)—nuclei from frozen tumor tissue were isolated as follows: tissue was thawed and mechanically dissociated in salt-Tris buffer (10 mM Tris–HCl (pH 7.5), 146 mM NaCl, 1 mM CaCl2 and 21 mM MgCl2) with 0.49% CHAPS (3-((3-cholamidopropyl) dimethylammonio)-1-propanesulfonate) (Millipore, 28300). Single-nuclei suspensions were filtered using a 40 μm strainer, centrifuged at 500g for 5 min and resuspended in salt-Tris buffer supplemented with 0.01% BSA (NEB, B9000S). Nuclear suspensions were inspected by microscope, counted using a hemocytometer and used for 10x Genomics workflow.

Protocol 2 (laboratory 3 for the cohorts from NORLUX and SNU cohorts)—tissue samples were thawed and mechanically dissociated in nuclei EZ lysis buffer (Millipore Sigma, NUC101) via Dounce homogenization. The solutions were incubated on ice for 5 min and mixed one to two times during incubation. Single-nuclei suspensions were filtered through a 70 μm strainer and centrifuged at 500g for 5 min at 4 °C, resuspended in nuclei EZ lysis buffer and incubated on ice for 5 min. The solutions were centrifuged at 500g for 5 min at 4 °C and resuspended in 1% BSA/0.2 U μl RNase inhibitor/PBS buffer (three times). For the final resuspension, the DAPI was added to the buffer, the solution was filtered through a 40 μm strainer, cells were counted on a Countess II automated cell counter (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and nuclei were taken into the 10x Genomics workflow.

The 10x Chromium Single Cell 3′ Reagent Kit v3 (10x Genomics, PN1000128) was used according to the manufacturer's protocol. In brief, nuclei were loaded on the Chromium Chip (10x Genomics, PN12000120) with a target cell recovery of 6,000–8,000 nuclei and processed in the Chromium Controller. Single nuclei were partitioned into gel beads-in-emulsion (GEMs), followed by RNA reverse transcription with barcoding. Libraries were created by breaking GEMs and pooling barcoded fractions, cDNA amplification, fragmentation and attachment of sample index and adapter and sequenced on NextSeq500 or NovaSeq (Illumina). For NORLUX and SNU cohorts, nuclei were loaded on a Chromium chip with a target cell recovery of 6,000 nuclei for single-cell multiome ATAC and gene expression according to the manufacturer's protocol. The gene expression chemistry for the 10x multiome possesses the same chemistry as the 10x v3 3′ snRNA-seq.

WES for the samples from Duke University, MDACC, Tokyo University Hospital and St. Michael's Hospital was performed as follows: DNA was extracted from each frozen tumor sample and blood sample corresponding to the patients using the DNeasy Blood & Tissue kit (Qiagen, 69504). The genomic DNA (100–250 ng) was acoustically sheared by an ultrasonicator (Covaris), targeting 150 bp fragments. Library preparation was performed by KAPA HyperPrep Kit (KAPA Biosystems, KK8504) followed by the enzymatic clean-up using AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter, A63882). Exome capture was performed using a custom exome bait (manufactured by Twist Biosciences to Broad Institute's specification). Captured libraries were sequenced with 150-base-pair paired-end sequencing on a NovaSeq 6000 (Illumina). For the samples from Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital, after the DNA was fragmented by a LE220 ultrasonicator (Covaris) and size selected, library preparation and capture were performed using the Twist Human Core Exome kit (Twist Bioscience) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Sequencing was performed on a NovaSeq 6000 (Illumina) with 200-base-pair paired-end sequencing.

Newly generated whole-genome DNA-sequencing data were collected for a cohort of frozen samples from the NORLUX Neuro-oncology Laboratory. Briefly, DNA was extracted from each tumor sample using the AllPrep DNA/RNA Minikit (Qiagen, 80204) for samples with sufficient tumor tissue and matched normal blood when it was available. Note that the selected tissue for bulk DNA isolation was adjacent to the tissue used for single-nuclei data generation. Briefly, DNA was sheared to 400 bp using a LE220 ultrasonicator (Covaris) and size-selected using AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter, A63882). Whole-genome libraries were prepared and sequenced with 150-base-pair paired-end sequencing on a NovaSeq 6000 (Illumina). WGS data for the SNU cohort were prepared identically and were previously reported in ref. 9. Data for the SNU cohort are available on Synapse (https://www.synapse.org/glass).

DNA-sequencing alignment, fingerprinting, somatic variant detection (Mutect2) and copy-number segmentation were performed in accordance with the Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK) best practices using GATK 4.0.10.1, as previously described7,9. Briefly, whole-exome and whole-genome reads were aligned to the b37 genome (human_g1k_v37_decoy) using BWA MEM 0.7.17. DNA fingerprint analysis using ‘CrosscheckFingerprints' (Picard) confirmed that all samples belonging to a patient came from the same individual, indicating that there were no sample mismatches in this study. Somatic mutations were detected using Mutect2 (v4.1.0.0) for tumor samples with a matched normal blood sample. A panel of normals was constructed for each sequencing batch to account for differences in DNA library prep (for example, whole genome versus whole exome) and used to filter out common artifactual and germline variants. Patient tumor samples without matched normal blood were analyzed for copy-number alterations and tumor-only SNV detection was performed with a panel of normal reference according to GATK best practices. Tumor-only somatic variants were used to identify hypermutant tumors. To identify samples with increased small deletion mutation burden, the following thresholds were applied: the recurrence-specific small deletion mutation burden needed to be greater than 0.2 Mut per Mb sequenced and greater than 0.1 Mut per Mb increase when comparing all small deletion variants in the recurrence versus the primary tumor. Mutational signature estimation was performed using COSMIC v3 signatures for the GLASS and CARE datasets according to previously published methods41. Briefly, all WGS samples were used to generate a mutational matrix and extract de novo signatures using SigProfilerExtractor (v.1.1.4)41 using maximum signatures set to 10 and NMF replicates set to 100. The de novo signatures were then deconvoluted to COSMIC v3.3 signatures. Finally, mutations for each sample were assigned to the most probable signature among the deconvoluted COSMIC signatures using the R package Palimpsest (v.2.0.0)42. Acquired SBS21 samples were denoted as those that were in the top quartile of SBS21 change at T2. For samples with matched blood, hypermutation was determined according to the cutoff of 10 Mut per Mb and further separated into de novo versus treatment-associated based on COSMIC mutational signatures. Treatment-associated hypermutation in samples with matched normal blood was classified by a longitudinal increase in mutation burden (that is, from <10 Mut per Mb to >10 Mut per Mb) and SBS11 signal (alkylating agent-associated signature). For samples without matched blood, a single recurrent sample with a large increase in mutation burden at recurrence compared to the initial tumor (18.3-fold increase) and SBS11 signature was indicative of treatment-associated hypermutation. Genetic distance between time-separated samples from the same patient was defined as the bulk DNA proportion of private mutations (SNV) and differences in CNA segments between the two samples.

For droplet-based snRNA-seq data, the Cellranger v3.1.0 pipeline provided by 10x Genomics was used for alignment (GRCh38 release 93) and to generate count matrices. We quantified the gene expression levels as \(\scriptstyle{E}_{i,j}=\log_2(\frac{{{\mathrm{CPM}}}_{i,j}}{10}+1)\), where CPMi,j refers to counts-per-million for gene i in sample j. We divided the TPM/CPM values by 10 as the size of single-cell libraries is estimated to be in the order of 100,000 transcripts, and we, therefore, would like to avoid inflating the expression levels by counting each transcript ~10 times. Following these normalization steps, initial filtering of low-quality cells was done based on low number of detected genes (less than 200 genes) or high expression of mitochondrially encoded genes (more than 3%). The majority of low-quality cells were removed downstream in case they could not be robustly classified as malignant or nonmalignant (see in later section on CNA analysis ‘Classification of cells into malignant or nonmalignant cell types'). Finally, we computed the average expression of each gene i as \(\scriptstyle\log_2((\frac{1}{n}{\sum }_{j=1}^{n}{{\mathrm{TPM|CPM}}}_{i,j}+1))\) and filtered out the lowly expressed genes by limiting the analyzed genes to the top 3,000 most highly expressed genes (using the Seurat v4.0.4 (ref. 43) function CreateSeuratObject). For the cells and genes that passed these quality control filters, we defined relative expression levels by centering the expression levels for each gene across all cells in the dataset as follows: \({{\mathrm{Er}}}_{i,j}={E}_{i,j}-\,\frac{1}{n}{\sum }_{k=1}^{n}{E}_{i,k}\), where n is the number of cells in the dataset.

To facilitate clustering, cell-type annotation and scoring of droplet-based data, we used the R package Seurat (v4.0.4)43. Unique molecular identifier counts data were normalized and scaled (using the NormalizeData and ScaleData functions) and then clustered (by projecting the data to a lower dimensional space using principal component analysis and then running FindNeighbors and FindClusters functions). Initial classification of tumor-associated macrophages, T cells, oligodendrocytes and endothelial cells was based on the expression of known marker genes16,17,18,19,44, whereas the rest of the cells were annotated as presumed malignant. Following classification of cells as malignant or nonmalignant (see sections ‘Inferring CNAs from gene expression data' and ‘Classification of cells into malignant or nonmalignant cell types'), the cells classified as nonmalignant were scored (using the AddModuleScore function) for known cell-type signatures and assigned with a cell type using the method explained in the section ‘Assignment of cells to states'. Finally, heterotypic doublets were filtered out using the R package scDblFinder45.

CNAs were estimated as previously described46,47,48,49 using the function infercna from the R package infercna (an implementation of the original method presented in ref. 50, which is available at https://github.com/jlaffy/infercna) with default parameters. Briefly, the algorithm sorts the analyzed genes in each sample according to their chromosomal location and applies a moving average with a sliding window of 100 genes within each chromosome to the relative expression values. The scores computed for the cells classified as nonmalignant (oligodendrocytes, macrophages and endothelial cells) define the baseline of normal karyotype, and their average CNA values are used to center the values of all cells.

In cells classified using single-nucleus droplet-based sequencing, we generally encountered lower CNA signal and continuous signal distributions related to (1) lower data quality relative to that observed in single-cell data and (2) inclusion of nonmalignant cell types such as ACs and neurons in the presumed malignant group, as these cell types could not be classified a priori as nonmalignant due to transcriptional similarity with the malignant cells.

We, therefore, used a multistep classification scheme for the droplet-based single-nucleus sequencing data.

For each cell j, we computed the CNA signal on each chromosome separately as \({{\mathrm{CNA}}}_{j}^{C}=\frac{1}{n}{\sum }_{i=1}^{n}{{\mathrm{CNA}}}_{i,j}^{C}\), where n is the number of genes on chromosome C included in the analysis. We fitted a normal distribution (that is, a classifier) to the signal distributions of the reference cells for each chromosome (using the function fitdistr from the R package MASS v.7.3-56). This enabled assigning each cell with a P value for each chromosome using a two-sided z test (function pnorm from the R package stats v.4.1.1), reflecting whether the cell has a CNA signal that is substantially different than expected from nonmalignant cells. These P values were further corrected for multiple testing (for each chromosome) using the Benjamini–Hochberg (BH) method, and cells with BH-adjusted P value < 0.05 for a particular chromosome were considered as having a copy-number event on that chromosome (either amplification or deletion based on the sign of the CNA signal). Cells with an unadjusted P value < 0.05 for a particular chromosome that failed to achieve statistical significance following adjustment were considered to have a ‘suspicious event' on that chromosome. Following this, inferred copy-number events were cross-referenced with copy-number calls from WES/WGS data, and only events detected in both methods were considered for classification and were termed ‘real' events. For a subset of samples, this procedure was not possible due to (1) lack of WES/WGS data or (2) inability to call CNA events from WES/WGS due to low purity/quality. For this subset of cases, we defined a panel of highly recurring CNA events (intersection of highly recurring events inferred from snRNA-seq and WES/WGS data) that were used as a short list of potential events. Cells classified a priori as nonmalignant were reclassified as ‘unresolved' in case a ‘real' or ‘suspicious' CNA event was detected and ‘nonmalignant' otherwise. Presumed malignant cells with at least one ‘real' CNA event were classified as ‘malignant', those with a ‘suspicious' event were classified as ‘unresolved' and those with no events at all (‘real' or ‘suspicious') were classified as ‘nonmalignant'.

We define the CNA correlation as the Pearson correlation between each cell and the average CNA profile of the tumor sample the cell originated from. We limit the computation to the chromosomes on which ‘real' events were detected and a control panel of ~1,000 genes from other chromosomes. Based on the distribution of CNA correlations across the cells classified as Malignant, we defined 0.5 as the lower threshold of malignancy. To determine the upper threshold for nonmalignancy, we performed SNV calling from the snRNA-seq data to estimate the algorithm misclassification rate. Briefly, for each sample with available WES data, we called SNVs for each cell using the Vartrix tool (https://github.com/10XGenomics/vartrix) from the FASTQ files. Misclassified cells were defined as cells harboring a malignant mutation that were classified as nonmalignant in step 1 of the algorithm. Following a cost-effectiveness analysis (misclassification rate versus percentage of excluded cells), we set 0.35 as the upper threshold for nonmalignancy. Finally, cells classified as ‘malignant' with CNAcor < 0.5 or cells classified as ‘nonmalignant' with CNAcor > 0.35 were reclassified as ‘Unresolved' and excluded from downstream analysis.

To refine the classification, we defined confidence levels. Confidence level 1 includes cells classified as malignant that harbor a malignant SNV, cells in which at least 50% of the expected CNA events were detected, including chromosome 7 amplification or chromosome 10 deletion, and cells classified as nonmalignant with CNAcor < 0.25. Confidence level 2 includes cells classified as malignant in which at least 50% of the expected CNA events were detected that do not include chromosome 7 amplification or chromosome 10 deletion, cells classified as malignant in which less than 50% of the expected CNA events were detected, including chromosome 7 amplification or chromosome 10 deletion, and cells classified as nonmalignant with CNAcor < 0.5. The rest of the cells classified as malignant or nonmalignant were assigned confidence level 3.

In the analysis presented in this work, we used only cells in confidence levels 1 and 2.

To capture the heterogeneity between cells from the same cell type, we leveraged NMF51. NMF was performed on the relative expression values of each sample independently after setting negative values to zero. The NMF algorithm requires defining a priori the ‘k' parameter, reflecting the expected number of latent features in the data. Because ‘k' varies between samples and is largely unknown, we ran the NMF algorithm on each sample using different values (3–10), thereby generating 52 programs for each sample. Each of these NMF programs was summarized by the top 50 genes based on the NMF coefficients. Derivation of the metaprograms from the NMF programs is described thoroughly in ref. 24 and will be described here briefly. The method first filters out NMF programs that are not robust (do not recur within the sample it originated from or across several samples) or are redundant within the sample (that is, it highly overlaps with other NMF programs within that sample). Following this, the robust NMF programs are clustered according to the Jaccard similarity using a customized clustering algorithm that iteratively considers the degree of overlap between robust NMF programs and combines the highly overlapping ones to form a cluster. The top 50 most recurring genes in each cluster define a metaprogram.

Overall, the algorithm yielded 16 metaprograms that were annotated based on functional enrichment analysis (using Gene Ontology (GO) terms, mSigDB Hallmark gene sets and gene sets derived from normal brain development datasets). MP 16 included genes from various cell types, resulting in a metaprogram that fits almost all cells and thereby did not reflect any heterogeneity and was therefore excluded from analysis. This same procedure was independently repeated for each nonmalignant cell type.

Malignant cells were scored for the NMF metaprograms using the Seurat function AddModuleScore. To facilitate cell classification, we generated 20 shuffled expression matrices by sampling 5,000 cells each time and shuffling the expression values for each gene. We then scored each shuffled matrix for the NMF metaprograms, thereby yielding 100,000 normally distributed scores for each expression program. These served as null distributions for cell state classification. For each original cell, we computed a P value for each of the expression programs with a z test (R's pnorm function) using the statistics of the null distributions that we previously generated. We adjusted all P values for multiple testing using the BH method. Each cell was classified into a specific state if the adjusted P value computed for that state was smaller than 0.05. Cells that achieved an adjusted P < 0.05 for multiple states were assigned to the state for which they scored maximally. Cells that did not achieve an adjusted P < 0.05 for any of the states were assigned an ‘unresolved' state.

Cells were assigned a ‘cycling' state on top of their cellular state if they achieved an adjusted P < 0.05 for the cell cycle metaprogram and ‘noncycling' otherwise.

We define hybrids as cells scoring significantly (that is, with adjusted P < 0.05) for at least two cellular states with a difference between the top two significant scores smaller than expected by chance. To quantify the score difference expected by chance, we leveraged the null distribution generated for the state classification algorithm and computed for each artificial cell the difference between the top two states. The 95 quantiles of this score difference distribution (equal to a difference of 0.24) were set as the threshold for determining if a state is singular or hybrid.

To estimate the expected frequency of technical hybrids, we first computed for each pair of states, \(\left(A,{B}\right)\), the expected frequency of hybrids, defined as \({\mathrm{Exp}}\left(A,B\right)={\mathrm{Freq}}\left(A\right)\times {\mathrm{Freq}}\left(B\right)\), and the O/E ratio defined as \({\log }_{2}(\frac{{\mathrm{Obs}}(A,{B})}{{\mathrm{Exp}}(A,B)})\). As this is an overestimation of the expected frequency attributed to technical effects, we estimated this technical factor by averaging across O/E ratios of hybrid pairs detected less than expected by chance (that is, O/E < 0). Following this, we computed the expected frequency of technical hybrids for each hybrid pair by multiplying the expected frequency with the technical factor and defined the O/tE ratio as \({\log }_{2}(\frac{{\mathrm{Obs}}(A,{B})}{{\mathrm{TF}}\times {\mathrm{Exp}}(A,B)})\). Finally, we filtered out insignificant hybrid pairs with large O/tE ratio (attributed to small numbers) using a one-sided Fisher test. The hybrid lineage model was generated using the R package igraph with cell states as nodes and edges connecting the states that form significant hybrid pairs. We did not include the ‘cycling' state in this analysis because we don't view ‘cycling' as an independent state but rather as an additional feature that cells can have on top of their neurodevelopmental identity (that is, AC-like, OPC-like, etc.).

Each tumor sample was decomposed into seven pseudobulk profiles (one for each of the common states—AC-like, MES-like, hypoxia, GPC-like, OPC-like, NPC-like and NEU-like—given at least 25 cells classified to the particular state) by averaging across the normalized unique molecular identifier counts and log2-transforming. Genes were included if their mean log2-expression value across all pseudobulks was at least 1 and if their median variance (computed separately within state) was at least 2.5. Overall, 1,005 genes passed these filters. Following this, the pseudobulks were analyzed within the state to remove the state-specific signal using principal component analysis. We then derived six gene programs from each state (top and bottom 50 genes of the first three principal components), computed the Jaccard similarity index between each pair of programs and clustered the similarity matrix using hierarchical clustering. This revealed five distinct clusters from which we derived five consensus signatures by including genes that recurred in at least 25% of programs in each of the clusters (with a hard minimum of at least three times). By manual inspection and GO enrichment, we annotated the consensus signatures. Two signatures were excluded due to short length or high suspicion of reflecting a technical artifact. To exclude the possibility that ambient RNA has a role in driving the baseline profiles, we estimated per sample using the R package SoupX the contamination by ambient RNA. There was no difference in the estimated contamination level across the different baseline profiles as well as no significant overlap between the topmost contaminated genes per sample and the metaprogram or baseline profile signatures (data not shown due to lack of significance).

To measure the differences in tumor composition, we generated for each tumor sample a composition vector reflecting the proportion of each cell type in the tumor sample. This enabled assigning tumors to the following three main composition groups: HMF (percentage of malignant cells >75%), IMF (percentage of malignant cells, 50–75%) and LMF (malignant cells <50%), where the LMF group could be further subdivided according to the dominant TME cell types (percentage of TAM/oligodendrocyte/glio-neural >40%, or mixed in case of no dominant TME cell type). Similarly, we defined proportion vectors for the malignant cell states and assigned tumors to six groups according to the dominant cell state (at least 25% of cells assigned to the particular state)—AC, MES/hypoxia, GPC, OPC/NPC, neuron and mixed (in case of no dominant state). Tumors were classified according to the baseline profile with a maximal score and to the mixed category if the maximal score was less than 0.25.

The association between each pair of features (A, B) was computed using a binomial test with the number of times the pair was observed as the number of successes, the number of tumor samples as the number of experiments and the frequency of feature A times the frequency of feature B as the expected probability of success (under the assumption that the features are independent). We then generated an undirected graph by defining each feature as a node and connecting the nodes with edges in case a statistically significant association (unadjusted for multiple testing) between the two features was observed.

To measure the transcriptional distance between matched pairs, we generated state-controlled pseudobulk profiles from each pair. State control was achieved by downsampling both samples to 25 cells from each state, given that both samples contain at least 25 cells from the particular state, resulting in samples that contain the same number of cells and are balanced across the different gene expression profiles of the cellular states. Following this, the pseudobulk profiles were computed by averaging for each gene across the selected cells, resulting in two pseudobulk profiles. Finally, the Euclidean distance between the two vectors was computed and served as the metric for transcriptional distance.

Survival analysis was performed using the R packages survival v.3.3-1 and survminer v.0.4.9. Kaplan–Meier estimates were computed using the survfit function and plotted using the ggsurvplot function (survminer package). Statistical significance of the difference between the survival curves was computed using the log-rank test (implemented in the function survdiff). Cox regression analysis and forest plots were performed and plotted using the same packages (coxph and ggforest functions).

To compute the differentially expressed genes between MGMT-low and MGMT-high pairs, we first computed the relative gene expression across time points in each group (that is, longitudinal expression difference), which is defined for each gene i as the average expression of the gene across all T2 samples in the group minus the average gene expression across all T1 samples in the group. Following, we computed the Euclidean distance between these two vectors. MGMT-low genes were defined as the top 100 genes with the largest distance between the groups and positive longitudinal expression difference in the MGMT-low group and negative longitudinal expression difference in the MGMT-high group. MGMT-high genes were defined as the top 100 genes with the largest distance between the groups and positive longitudinal expression difference in the MGMT-high group and negative longitudinal expression difference in the MGMT-low group.

Each point represents a sample. There are no statistically significant differences between the groups (tested with two-sided Kruskal–Wallis test, p = 0.27). c, Overview of SNV and CNA in the GBM cohort. Each column represents a single patient with longitudinal DNA data and a matched normal blood sample. The top panel indicates the total proportion of mutations that are either detected across both T1 and T2 (that is, shared), only in T1 or only in T2, which are sorted by decreasing shared mutation fraction. The middle panel represents the mutation variant status for driver genes in GBM, while the bottom panel presents the driver CNAs.

Two-sided Wilcoxon rank-sum test is shown. Box plots span from the first to third quartiles, median values are indicated by a horizontal line, whiskers show 1.5× interquartile range and outlier points are not shown. Continuous distributions of all values are shown to the right of each box plot. f, Proportion (%) of samples from ref. 14 assigned to each compositional group across the two time points (primary and recurrence). g, Kaplan–Meier curves depicting the survival time after 2nd resection according to the transcriptomic features at 2nd resection, which shows the statistical significance in the distribution between groups. Top panel is for composition group. Bottom panel is for malignant state groups. Statistical significance of survival difference between the groups in each panel was computed using the log-rank test. h, Forest plot reflects Cox proportional hazard model for time from 2nd resection to outcome, including relevant biological and clinical covariates in addition to composition group (top) and malignant state group (bottom). Each variable is presented along with its categorical possibilities and sample size on the left, while the boxes represent the hazard ratio and lines represent the 95 % confidence interval.

a,b, Malignant cell state abundance across time points. Dotted lines connect patient values. Unadjusted two-sided paired Wilcoxon rank-sum tests are shown. a, This study (n = 50 patients with at least 50 malignant cells in both time points). b, ref. 14 dataset. (n = 25 patients). c, Proportion (%) of tumors in each malignant group in the ref. 14 dataset. d, Box plots of the average BP scores per sample across the two time points. e, Interaction graph of associations between features conserved across time points. Edges represent statistically significant (p < 0.05) Pearson correlation in both time points. f, Heatmap of ligand–receptor cross-talks. Each row represents a ligand–receptor interaction, while each column represents a non-malignant cell type—malignant cell state pair, such that the ligand is expressed by the corresponding non-malignant cell type and the receptor by the malignant cell state. The colors represent the log(odds ratio) from the two-sided Fisher's exact test for checking whether the ligand–receptor interaction is significantly present in T2 (log(odds ratio >0), purple scale) or T1 (log(odds ratio <0), orange scale). Only significant interactions are reported in the heatmap (**p < 0.01, *p < 0.05).

a, Sankey plots depicting the transitions between time points across malignant states for ref. 14 dataset. b, Representative two pairs that showed opposite longitudinal transcriptomic changes in the two pairs profiled at two time points highlight unpredictable gene expression trajectories. Heatmap representing three transcriptomic layers between time points are shown.

a, Surgical interval for the patients included in this analysis stratified by the MGMT promoter methylation status. X axis reflects the time from 1st to 2nd resection. Statistical significance of survival difference between the groups in each panel was computed using the log-rank test. b, Surgical interval analysis for the IDH-wildtype patients in the GLASS cohort stratified by the MGMT promoter methylation status. X axis reflects the time from 1st to 2nd resection. Statistical significance of survival difference between the groups in each panel was computed using the log-rank test. c, Logistic regression model using the average of MGMT gene expression in primary samples to infer the MGMT methylation status in the ref. 14 dataset. d, Proportion (%) of each cell type across the two time points (primary and recurrence) stratified by MGMT expression level. For d–g, box plots represent the median value as a solid horizontal line, lower and upper edges correspond to the first and third quartiles (the 25th and 75th percentiles), and the whiskers represent plus and minus 1.5× the interquartile range. Individual sample values are shown as jittered points. e, Proportion (%) of each malignant cell state across the two time points (primary and recurrence) stratified by MGMT expression level. f, Difference within patients in proportion (% in R − % in P) of each cell type across MGMT expression levels. g, Difference within patients in BP scores (score in R − score in P) across MGMT expression levels. h, Differentially expressed genes between MGMT-low and high groups across the recurrence trajectories (Methods). Each dot represents a gene, and dots are colored according to the group of DE genes to which they belong. i, CONS-UP and CONS-DN signatures plotted for patients included in the analysis. Value represents the T2–T1 difference (log2(FC) of gene expression) for each patient. Patients are ordered according to the difference between signature scores. Genes are ordered according to their correlation (across patients) with the difference between signature scores.

a, Mutation burden at both time points for patients with matched normal blood DNA (n = 46 samples per time point, two-sided paired Wilcoxon test). b, COSMIC v3 mutational signature contribution for two patients with high mutation burden at both time points with minimal contribution from SBS11 (alkylating agent signature). c, Selected single base substitution (SBS) mutational signature proportions for GLASS IDH-wildtype cases for both time point 1 and time point 2. Dotted lines connect samples from the same patients. SBS1 (aging/clock-like etiology), SBS11 (alkylating agent) and SBS21 (defective mismatch repair). P values represent two-sided paired Wilcoxon rank-sum test. d, Longitudinal difference in small insertion burden between T1 and T2 with dotted lines connecting patient values. Analysis restricted to non-hypermutant cases. P-value reflects two-sided paired Wilcoxon rank-sum test. e, Longitudinal change (T2–T1) in the hypoxia cell state abundance is plotted on the y axis against the small deletion burden specific to the recurrent tumor with the linear regression line shown in blue. The Pearson correlation coefficient and P value are presented. f, Longitudinal change in the hypoxia and MES-like cell state relative abundances for patients that acquired SBS21 mutations but that did not acquire small deletion burden increase. g, Bulk RNA data from the GLASS consortium were scored for the MES-like snRNA malignant metaprogram signature, and the relative single-sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA) score is presented on the y axis. The panel shows the longitudinal change in the MES-like signature for those patients whose tumor had a small deletion increase. P value from paired Wilcoxon rank-sum test. h,i, Scatterplots that represent the scaled genetic distance for SNVs (proportions of private mutations) h, and CNAs (differences in copy-number altered regions, i, versus scaled transcriptional distance (snRNA). Shown is the Pearson's correlation coefficient, associated P value, with the linear regression line shown in blue for both h and i.

Most proteins imported into peroxisomes use a carboxy-terminal PTS1 signal, which is recognized by soluble receptors that transport the cargo through a nuclear pore-like conduit in the peroxisomal membrane formed by the tyrosine and glycine-rich YG domain of PEX13. The receptors then return to the cytosol through a separate retrotranslocon. Some peroxisomal proteins instead use an amino-terminal PTS2 signal that is recognized by an adaptor called PEX7, but how they are imported is poorly understood. Here we show that PTS2 cargo is moved through the YG phase by PEX7 bound to a receptor. After cargo release inside peroxisomes, PEX7 returns to the cytosol by moving back on its own through the YG phase. The chaperone PEX39 then extracts PEX7 from the phase on the cytosolic side and helps to reload PEX7 with a new receptor and cargo to start another import cycle. Our results provide a comprehensive model of PTS2 protein import.

Peroxisomes are conserved organelles essential for human health. They consist of a single membrane enclosing a luminal matrix1 and play crucial metabolic roles that include fatty-acid β-oxidation and ether-lipid biosynthesis2. Peroxisomal matrix proteins are made in the cytosol and then imported, remarkably, in a folded state and even as oligomers or preformed complexes3, in contrast to the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria that can only import unfolded polypeptides4,5.

Most peroxisomal matrix proteins contain a type 1 peroxisomal targeting signal (PTS1) that is located at their carboxy (C) terminus and comprises the amino-acid sequence SKL (or variants thereof)6. Some matrix proteins, however, use the more complex PTS2 signal located at their amino (N) terminus7. PTS2 proteins include the enzyme thiolase required for peroxisomal β-oxidation in nearly all eukaryotes8 as well as enzymes that detoxify branched-chain fatty acids and produce ether-lipid precursors essential for myelination2. Defective PTS2 protein import in humans causes Refsum disease9 and the life-threatening disorder rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctata10.

The import mechanism of PTS1 proteins is reasonably well understood11. Their PTS1 signal is recognized in the cytosol by the tetratricopeptide-repeat (TPR) domain of PEX5 (ref. 12) and related soluble receptors13,14. PEX5 then transports the cargo completely across the peroxisomal membrane15,16 through a conduit formed by the tyrosine and glycine-rich YG repeats of the PEX13 membrane protein17,18. The conduit resembles the selective phase formed by the phenylalanine and glycine-rich nucleoporin FG repeats in nuclear pores19 and can be reconstituted in vitro as a hydrogel into which PEX5 can drag folded cargo17. Passage through the phase requires conserved motifs in PEX5 comprising the amino-acid sequence WXXXF/Y (where ‘X' denotes any residue)17. PEX5 returns to the cytosol through a separate channel formed by a membrane-embedded ubiquitin ligase complex20. The receptor's flexible N terminus inserts into this retrotranslocon and gets mono-ubiquitinated on a conserved cysteine; ubiquitinated PEX5 is then pulled out of the organelle by a cytosolic AAA ATPase21. Pulling unfolds the TPR domain and thereby strips off the cargo15. In the cytosol, PEX5 is deubiquitinated22,23 and presumably also refolds before starting another import cycle.

PTS2 protein import is by contrast poorly understood. The PTS2 signal is recognized by an adaptor called PEX7 that anchors the cargo to a compatible receptor24. In humans and other animals, the receptor is a specific splice variant of PEX5 called the long isoform (PEX5L); a shorter isoform (PEX5S) lacks the PEX7-binding region25,26. In yeast, PEX7 associates instead with specialized receptors such as PEX18 and PEX21 that resemble PEX5L but lack a TPR domain27. PEX7 shuttles the bound cargo and receptor completely across the peroxisomal membrane28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35. The mechanism, however, remains to be established because PEX7 lacks the WXXXF/Y motifs required for traversing the YG phase; whether the receptors facilitate translocation or simply stabilize the interaction with cargo is not clear. How PEX7 returns from the matrix to the cytosol is also unknown. PEX7 consists of WD40 repeats that form a seven-bladed β-propeller24 and has neither a flexible N terminus for insertion into the retrotranslocon nor a conserved cysteine for mono-ubiquitination. PEX7 therefore cannot be recycled like PEX5 and other receptors.

To understand how PTS2 proteins are brought into peroxisomes, we reconstituted the process using a cytoplasmic extract from the eggs of the frog Xenopus laevis. As shown previously15,36,37, this cell-free system recapitulates the import of PTS1 cargo such as green fluorescent protein (GFP) fused to an SKL sequence: over time the cargo accumulates inside peroxisomes that then become visible as bright puncta under a microscope (Fig. 1a). To adapt this system for PTS2 cargo, we fused GFP to the import signal from different Xenopus PTS2 proteins (Extended Data Fig. 1a; purity of all recombinant proteins in Extended Data Fig. 1b). Each PTS2 cargo formed puncta in the extract (Extended Data Fig. 1a), demonstrating a functional PTS2 import pathway. The puncta were dimmer than those formed by PTS1 cargo, suggesting that PTS2 import is less efficient. As expected, PTS2 import was abolished following depletion of PEX5 from the extract (Extended Data Fig. 1a) and could be restored with purified recombinant PEX5L, the long isoform that can bind to PEX7 (schematic of the PEX5 variants used in Fig. 1b) but not with the short isoform PEX5S that cannot bind (Extended Data Fig. 1a). Either isoform could restore PTS1 import (Extended Data Fig. 1a). The PTS2 puncta result from multiple import cycles because they were not visible with a PEX5 mutant lacking the conserved cysteine (C11A), which cannot be mono-ubiquitinated and recycled (Extended Data Fig. 1a). Notably, both PTS2 and PTS1 import was abolished by a PEX5 mutant lacking the WXXXF/Y motifs (∆WF) that enable translocation through the YG phase (Extended Data Fig. 1a).

a, Xenopus egg extract was incubated with fluorescent cargo, mounted on a slide and imaged using a spinning-disk confocal microscope. Cargo consisted of GFP fused to the PTS1 signal SKL or the PTS2 signal from the yeast peroxisomal thiolase POT1 (residues 1–27).

Import was assessed using the fluorescent PTS1 and PTS2 cargos described in a. d, As in c except using the PEX5 variants shown. Scale bars, 5 µm.

We next assessed the importance of PEX7. Because frog PEX7 was unstable when produced recombinantly, we instead used yeast PEX7 and cargo consisting of GFP fused to the PTS2 signal from the yeast peroxisomal thiolase POT1 (Fig. 1a). Yeast PEX7 together with PEX5L (but not PEX5S) could restore import of the PTS2 cargo in PEX5-depleted extract (Fig. 1c), albeit inefficiently, probably reflecting the relatively weak interaction between PEX5L and yeast PEX7 (Extended Data Fig. 2a). To improve the affinity of the receptor for yeast PEX7, we replaced the PEX7-binding region in PEX5L with the homologous region from the yeast PTS2 receptor PEX21 (Fig. 1b). The resulting chimaeric receptor, PEX5-21, bound to yeast PEX7 more strongly (Extended Data Fig. 2a) and boosted import of the PTS2 cargo (Fig. 1d). Both the receptor and yeast PEX7 were necessary for import (Fig. 1d). The import rate of the PTS2 cargo was notably slower than that of PTS1 cargo (Extended Data Fig. 2b). A receptor mutant lacking the TPR domain could still bind to PEX7 and PTS2 cargo as expected (Extended Data Fig. 2c) as well as import the cargo into peroxisomes in egg extract (Fig. 1d). Importantly, PTS2 import by either PEX5L or PEX5-21 again depended on the WXXXF/Y motifs of the receptor (Fig. 1c,d), providing support for the hypothesis that PTS2 proteins are moved into peroxisomes through the YG conduit.

To test whether PTS2 proteins are shuttled through the YG phase, we reconstituted the phase as a hydrogel using a recombinant fragment of PEX13 comprising the YG domain and upstream unstructured region (Extended Data Fig. 3a). As shown previously17, entry of fluorescently labelled proteins into the phase can be visualized under a microscope as a bright zone expanding inwards from the gel edge (Fig. 2a). Consistent with the egg extract experiments, PTS2 cargo accumulated in the YG hydrogel in the presence of PEX7 and the long receptor isoform PEX5L, whereas no entry was observed with either component alone or with the short isoform (Fig. 2a). By contrast, either isoform could drag PTS1 cargo into the gel independently of PEX7 (Fig. 2a), as expected. PTS2 entry was enhanced by the chimaeric receptor PEX5-21, consistent with its increased affinity for PEX7, whereas the efficiency of PTS1 entry remained unchanged (Fig. 2b). PTS2 entry also did not depend on the receptor's TPR domain, whereas PTS1 entry did (Fig. 2b). Thus, PTS2 proteins are probably translocated into peroxisomes through the YG phase, and PEX5 and PEX7 are both critical for this process. Interestingly, PTS2 cargo was dragged through the YG hydrogel more slowly than PTS1 cargo (Fig. 2c), in agreement with the slower rate of PTS2 import measured in egg extract. In addition, the entry of PTS2 cargo into the gel was not greatly affected by ablation of the receptor's WXXXF/Y motifs (Fig. 2d), which are otherwise essential for moving PTS1 cargo through the YG phase17. The PTS2–cargo complex therefore probably interacts with the YG phase not just through the receptor.

a, YG hydrogels were incubated with the fluorescent cargo shown (described in Fig. 1a) with or without purified recombinant yeast PEX7 and the indicated recombinant PEX5 variants (described in Fig. 1b).

A possible additional interaction of the PTS2–cargo complex with the YG phase is suggested by the reported binding of PEX7 to the unstructured region of PEX13 preceding the YG domain38. We identified within this region a conserved motif characterized by the amino-acid sequence KPWE (Fig. 3a). Beads conjugated to a synthetic peptide containing this motif could recruit yeast PEX7 fused at the C terminus to GFP (PEX7–GFP), whereas a peptide with the motif scrambled could not (Fig. 3b). PEX7–GFP was also recruited to beads conjugated to a polypeptide encompassing the entire unstructured region and YG domain but only when the KPWE motif was intact (Extended Data Fig. 3b). The KPWE motif thus directly binds to PEX7 and is the only PEX7-binding site within the region of PEX13 that forms the YG phase.

The accumulation of each fluorescent protein inside the gel was visualized on a point-scanning confocal microscope after 1 h. The width of each image corresponds to 300 µm.

AlphaFold predicts that the KPWE motif binds specifically to the bottom of the PEX7 β-propeller (Fig. 3c and Extended Data Fig. 4 for the associated pLDDT confidence scores of all AlphaFold models). The interface is highly conserved (Fig. 3d) and shows that each of the amino acids comprising the KPWE motif engages in a unique interaction with PEX7: the lysine projects into the acidic core of the β-propeller, the proline is nestled in a hydrophobic pocket, the tryptophan is sandwiched between the aliphatic stem of a conserved lysine in PEX7 and the lysine from the KPWE motif, and the glutamate forms polar contacts with a conserved arginine in PEX7 (Extended Data Fig. 5). The interaction with the KPWE motif notably occurs on the side of the PEX7 β-propeller opposite to where the PTS2 signal and import receptors bind (Fig. 3e). The two interfaces are indeed independent, as beads conjugated to the KPWE peptide could recruit PTS2–GFP only when PEX7 and the receptor were both present (Extended Data Fig. 6a). No binding was seen in the absence of PEX7 or with beads harbouring the scrambled peptide. These results imply that PEX7 might enter the YG phase either by binding directly to the KPWE motif or by piggybacking on an import receptor in the presence of cargo.

Direct entry of PEX7 into the YG phase could be demonstrated with the hydrogel system. Using hydrogels prepared from a recombinant fragment of PEX13 consisting of the wild-type unstructured region and YG domain (Fig. 3f), we observed that PEX7–GFP readily entered the phase, whereas GFP alone did not (Fig. 3g). Ablation of the KPWE motif did not affect gelation (Fig. 3f) but it precluded the entry of PEX7–GFP (Fig. 3g). By contrast, PEX5 fused at the C terminus to GFP (PEX5–GFP) accumulated equally well in either wild-type or mutant hydrogels (Fig. 3g). Thus, PEX7 interacts with the YG phase through the KPWE motif instead of through the YG repeats to which import receptors bind.

We next examined how PEX7 interacts with the YG phase when bound to a receptor and cargo. We prepared a complex between PEX7–GFP and the chimaeric receptor PEX5-21 in the presence of a synthetic peptide comprising the PTS2 signal. Formation of the complex was verified using beads coated with the receptor, which could recruit PEX7–GFP only in the presence of the PTS2 peptide (Extended Data Fig. 6b). The complex could partition into the YG hydrogel even when the KPWE motif was absent (Fig. 3g), revealing that the receptor is sufficient to drag PEX7 and cargo into the YG phase. This result was recapitulated using a complex consisting of PEX7 bound to the receptor and PTS2–GFP cargo, which readily entered the gel regardless of the KPWE motif (Fig. 3g).

Together, the hydrogel experiments demonstrate that PEX7 and import receptors can partition into the YG phase independently of each other. When both components assemble with cargo into a complex, each of these interactions may be utilized to move the cargo through the phase into peroxisomes. Interestingly, PEX5–GFP permeated further into the wild-type hydrogel than either PEX7–GFP alone or PEX7–GFP in the cargo complex (Fig. 3g). Thus, PEX7 seems to traverse the YG phase more slowly, consistent with PTS2 cargo being moved through the phase slower than PTS1 cargo (Fig. 2c). Efficient translocation into peroxisomes might therefore primarily be driven by the receptor.

We wondered whether the interaction between PEX7 and the KPWE motif allows PEX7 to return to the cytosol after PEX7 has dissociated from the receptor and cargo inside the matrix. To test this hypothesis, we ablated the KPWE motif in PEX13 in yeast and investigated whether PEX7 would accumulate in peroxisomes. To enable detection of PEX7 by immunoblotting, we introduced a single FLAG tag at the C terminus of the protein (Extended Data Fig. 7a). The tagged form was expressed from the endogenous locus and was fully functional, as assessed in cells expressing fluorescently labelled PTS1 and PTS2 matrix proteins (Extended Data Fig. 7b). The corresponding strains were cultured in oleic acid to induce peroxisomes and the cells subsequently fractionated into a peroxisome-containing membrane pellet (Fig. 4a). PEX7–FLAG was indeed considerably enriched in the membrane fraction in the absence of the KPWE motif (Fig. 4b and Extended Data Fig. 7c). Given that PEX7 completely enters the peroxisomal matrix during import28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35, this observation suggests that PEX7 cannot return to the cytosol when its interaction with the YG phase is disrupted. Consistent with this assumption, PEX7–FLAG accumulation was abolished after deletion of the two yeast PTS2 receptors PEX18 and PEX21 (Fig. 4c). By contrast, deletion of the two PTS1 receptors PEX5 and PEX9 had only a small effect (Fig. 4c). All receptor-pair knockouts correctly precluded import of their respective cargo (Extended Data Fig. 7d).

a, PEX7 fused at the C terminus to a FLAG epitope tag (PEX7–FLAG) was expressed in yeast strains containing different PEX13 mutants. The cells were cultured in oleic acid to induce peroxisomes, lysed and then separated into a peroxisome-containing membrane fraction. PEX7–FLAG was immunoprecipitated (IP) from the lysate and the detergent-solubilized membranes, resolved by SDS–PAGE and detected by immunoblotting for the FLAG epitope. b, PEX7–FLAG was analysed as in a for cells lacking PEX13 (−), or cells containing either wild-type PEX13 (WT) or a PEX13 mutant lacking residues 2–13 (∆2–13) that encompass the KPWE motif, as shown (top).

Total lysates from cells expressing PEX7–FLAG with or without the riboswitch were analysed by immunoblotting as in a (bottom). e, Peroxisomes were induced in cells expressing PEX7 (with or without the riboswitch as indicated) as well as either wild-type PEX13 or PEX13 lacking the KPWE motif (∆2–13). Protein import was assessed by fluorescence microscopy using endogenously expressed FOX2 fused to RFP (PTS1) and POT1 fused to GFP (PTS2).

Experiments in Xenopus egg extract confirmed that PEX7–GFP enters peroxisomes only when it is assembled into a complex with PEX5 and cargo (Extended Data Fig. 7e). Interestingly, PEX7–GFP puncta were considerably brighter than those formed by PEX5–GFP (Extended Data Fig. 7e), consistent with the hypothesis that the two proteins are not recycled together. This conclusion agrees with a previous study35 showing that PEX7 is recycled more slowly than PEX5. Together, our results suggest that PEX7 enters peroxisomes along with cargo by piggybacking on an import receptor; PEX7 then returns to the cytosol by binding to the KPWE motif of PEX13 and thereby partitioning back into the YG phase from inside the matrix.

The proposed model implies that KPWE-motif deletion should inhibit PTS2 import because PEX7 should no longer be recycled. Surprisingly, however, cells lacking the KPWE motif showed no obvious PTS2 import defect (Extended Data Fig. 7d). We reasoned that in our assay, PEX7 might be sufficiently abundant to mask a recycling phenotype. We therefore inserted a tetracycline-responsive riboswitch39 upstream of the PEX7 open reading frame to reduce translation of the corresponding PEX7 messenger RNA. This strategy decreased the abundance of PEX7 by about an order of magnitude (Fig. 4d). Under these conditions, PTS2 import was still normal in cells that retained the KPWE motif, whereas cells that lacked the KPWE motif now had a pronounced import defect specific to PTS2 proteins (Fig. 4e). These results confirm the proposed role of the KPWE motif in PEX7 recycling and further demonstrate that PEX7 recycling is essential for protein import when PEX7 becomes limiting in cells.

Given the favourable interaction between PEX7 and the YG phase, we next investigated how PEX7 would be extracted from the phase and returned to the cytosol to start another import cycle. A possible mechanism was suggested by large-scale protein-interaction studies in yeast40,41 and mammalian cells42,43,44, which had identified an uncharacterized binding partner of PEX7 in the cytosol that has recently been named PEX39 (ref. 45). The protein is conserved throughout eukaryotes and contains an amino-acid sequence (RPWE in yeast) that resembles the KPWE motif of PEX13 (Fig. 5a). PEX39 also has a conserved amphipathic helix (APH) near its N terminus (Fig. 5a). AlphaFold predicts that PEX39 can bind to PEX7 using both of these features: the RPWE motif binds to the same site as the analogous motif of PEX13 and the APH binds to the opposite side, where the PTS2 signal and import receptors are recruited (Fig. 5b). Both interaction surfaces on PEX7 are conserved in addition to a groove that cradles the linker between the RPWE motif and the APH (Extended Data Fig. 8).

Scale bar, 100 µm. d, Glutathione-conjugated beads were incubated with 1 µM yeast PEX7 and varying concentrations of the indicated GST-tagged forms of yeast PEX39. The beads and any bound protein were sedimented after 1 h. Each supernatant fraction was resolved by SDS–PAGE and stained with Coomassie blue (representative images of the gels in Extended Data Fig. 9b). PEX7 remaining in the supernatant was quantified and used to calculate the bound fraction, which was plotted as a function of the PEX39 concentration. Lines represent fits, generated by least-squares regression, to the data from three independent experiments; the corresponding observed binding constants (Kobs) are indicated (right; mean ± s.e.m.). ND, binding not detectable. Source numerical data are provided.

The predicted interactions were validated by showing that beads coated with PEX7 could recruit PEX39 fused at the C terminus to GFP (PEX39–GFP; Extended Data Fig. 9a). Conversely, beads coated with PEX39 could recruit PEX7–GFP and the recruitment required the RPWE motif (Fig. 5c). Mutations in the APH resulted in marginally reduced binding. These results were quantitatively confirmed by incubating PEX7 with varying concentrations of PEX39 immobilized on beads (Extended Data Fig. 9b). Measurements of the amount of PEX7 remaining in solution revealed similar binding constants for wild-type PEX39 and the mutant lacking the APH, whereas the mutant lacking the RPWE motif bound considerably weaker (Fig. 5d). No binding was measurable in the absence of both the RPWE motif and the APH. Thus, PEX39 can directly bind to PEX7, with the RPWE motif driving the interaction.

Because PEX39 and PEX13 can each bind to PEX7 using similar motifs, we investigated whether PEX39 could extract PEX7 from the YG phase. We tested this hypothesis by preloading YG hydrogels with PEX7–GFP, then spiking the buffer with increasing concentrations of PEX39 and following the PEX7–GFP fluorescence in the gel over time (Fig. 6a). Addition of PEX39 rapidly depleted PEX7–GFP from the hydrogel in a dose-dependent manner, whereas PEX7–GFP continued to accumulate in the gel in the absence of PEX39 (Fig. 6b). The extraction of PEX7–GFP was abolished by mutating the RPWE motif in PEX39 (Fig. 6c), whereas mutating the APH had a much smaller effect, consistent with our binding experiments. Ablation of both motifs had no additional effect. PEX39 was notably unable to extract PEX5–GFP from the hydrogel (Fig. 6d). These results thus support the hypothesis that PEX39 can extract PEX7 from the YG phase during recycling, when PEX7 would no longer be bound to cargo and an import receptor.

a, YG hydrogels were prepared in a glass-bottomed dish and pre-equilibrated with PEX7–GFP.

The proposed role of PEX39 in PEX7 recycling implies that PEX39 should not extract PEX7 from the YG phase during translocation into peroxisomes when PEX7 would be loaded with cargo and an import receptor. PEX39 was indeed unable to efficiently extract PEX7–GFP from YG hydrogels in the presence of a PTS2 peptide and the chimaeric receptor PEX5-21, even when PEX39 and the receptor were both present in excess molar ratios relative to PEX7–GFP (Fig. 6e). By contrast, PEX7–GFP was readily extracted by PEX39 in the presence of the short receptor isoform PEX5S that cannot bind to PEX7 (Fig. 6e). Thus, PEX39 does not interfere with the translocation of the fully assembled PEX7–receptor–cargo complex into peroxisomes.

To confirm this conclusion, we monitored the influx of PEX7–GFP into the hydrogel in the presence of PEX39 (Fig. 6f). As expected, PEX39 blocked the influx of PEX7–GFP alone as well as PEX7–GFP in the presence of a PTS2 peptide and PEX5S (Fig. 6g). By contrast, PEX39 was much less inhibitory when PEX7–GFP was assembled into a complex with the PTS2 peptide and the chimaeric receptor PEX5-21 (Fig. 6g). Some inhibition was observed at high PEX39 concentrations, suggesting that PEX39 cannot be too abundant in vivo; PEX39 is indeed a few-fold less abundant than PEX7 in yeast (Extended Data Fig. 9c). Consistent with the hydrogel release experiments, PEX39 did not prevent the influx of PEX5–GFP (Fig. 6h), and the observed inhibition of PEX7–GFP influx depended on the RPWE motif and much less on the APH (Fig. 6i). PEX39–GFP did not by itself enter the YG hydrogel (Extended Data Fig. 9d) and was not imported into peroxisomes in Xenopus egg extract (Extended Data Fig. 7e).

Together, our results lead to a model in which import receptors move cargo-loaded PEX7 through the YG conduit into peroxisomes. After dissociating from the receptor and cargo inside the matrix, PEX7 moves back on its own through the YG conduit and is extracted out of the YG phase into the cytosol by PEX39.

To start another round of translocation, PEX7 has to be reloaded with cargo and a new receptor molecule. AlphaFold predicts that the APH of PEX39 can stabilize the interaction between PEX7 and the PTS2 signal (Fig. 7a), suggesting that PEX39 might promote cargo binding. PTS2–GFP cargo was indeed recruited to PEX7-coated beads in the presence of PEX39 (Fig. 7b) and conversely, PTS2–GFP was recruited to PEX39-coated beads in the presence of PEX7 (Fig. 7c). The cargo did not bind to either component alone. APH mutation abolished cargo binding to the PEX39–PEX7 complex (Fig. 7b,c), consistent with the APH stabilizing the interaction with the PTS2 signal. Notably, cargo binding was also reduced following mutation of the RPWE motif, as expected from the role of the motif in driving the interaction with PEX7. Thus, PEX39 not only extracts PEX7 from the YG phase but also enables PEX7 to rebind to cargo (Fig. 7e).

Note that PEX7 alone binds to both the APH and RPWE motif (top). The APH additionally stabilizes the interaction with the PTS2 signal (middle), whereas binding of the receptor displaces the APH (bottom). The RPWE motif remains bound in all cases. b, Glutathione-conjugated beads were incubated overnight with 5 µM GST-tagged yeast PEX7 (GST–PEX7) and 1 µM GFP fused at the N terminus to the PTS2 signal from yeast POT1 (PTS2–GFP). Where indicated, reactions included 5 µM wild-type (WT) yeast PEX39 or a mutant whose conserved hydrophobic residues in the APH were converted to alanine (∆APH). Recruitment of PTS2–GFP to the beads was visualized on a spinning-disk confocal microscope. c, As in b using GST-tagged wild-type yeast PEX39 (GST–PEX39) or the indicated GST-tagged mutants and yeast PEX7 at 5 µM. d, As in c with the additional presence of the chimaeric receptor PEX5-21 (5 µM). Contrast was adjusted as in b. e, Proposed steps for reloading of PEX7 with receptor and cargo. Scale bars, 100 µm.

Dissociation of PEX39 would have to occur in two steps. First, an import receptor would displace the APH of PEX39, as predicted by AlphaFold (Fig. 7a). The prediction is supported by experiments in which a complex between PEX7, the chimaeric receptor PEX5-21 and PTS2–GFP cargo could be recruited to beads coated with wild-type PEX39 (Fig. 7d). Recruitment was abolished by mutation of the PEX39 RPWE motif and completely unaffected by mutation of the APH (Fig. 7d). Thus, after receptor binding, PEX39 only interacts with PEX7 through its RPWE motif (Fig. 7e).

Finally, complete dissociation of PEX39 would occur following re-entry of the PEX7–receptor–cargo complex into the YG conduit, where the KPWE motif of PEX13 would displace the RPWE motif of PEX39. The PEX7–receptor–cargo complex was indeed no longer efficiently recruited to PEX39-coated beads in the presence of the KPWE peptide, whereas the scrambled peptide had no effect (Fig. 8a). Furthermore, the KPWE peptide could strip off PEX7 from PEX39 lacking the APH, whereas the scrambled peptide could not (Fig. 8b). Together, our results reveal that PEX39 not only extracts PEX7 from the YG conduit but also allows PEX7 to rebind to cargo. The subsequent recruitment of an import receptor partially displaces PEX39 and allows the cargo complex to partition back into the YG conduit. As the receptor drags the complex into the YG phase, the presence of multiple KPWE motifs of PEX13 effectively displaces the RPWE motif of PEX39, thereby releasing PEX39 into the cytosol (Fig. 7e).

a, Glutathione-conjugated beads were incubated overnight with 5 µM GST-tagged wild-type yeast PEX39 or the indicated mutants in the presence of 5 µM PEX5-21 and yeast PEX7 as well as 1 µM PTS2–GFP. Where indicated, reactions included 100 µM of a peptide comprising the KPWE motif of PEX13 or a scrambled version. Recruitment of PTS2–GFP to the beads was visualized on a spinning-disk confocal microscope. Scale bar, 100 µm. b, Glutathione-conjugated beads were first incubated with yeast PEX7 and the ∆APH mutant of GST-tagged PEX39 (each at 1 µM), and then with varying concentrations of the KPWE or scrambled peptide. The beads were sedimented and the supernatant fraction was resolved by SDS–PAGE, followed by Coomassie blue staining. Representative gels are shown (top), with relative sizes marked in kDa on the left. Fraction of PEX7 remaining on the beads in three independent experiments plotted against the peptide concentration and fitted to a competitive-binding isotherm (bottom). The mean ± s.e.m. observed binding constant (Kobs) for each peptide is shown; ND, binding not detectable. c, Model of PTS2 protein import into peroxisomes.

Source data

Using a combination of in vitro reconstituted systems and experiments in vivo, we have determined the mechanism by which PTS2 matrix proteins are imported into peroxisomes (Fig. 8c). Translocation is initiated by the assembly of PTS2 cargo into a complex with PEX7 and an import receptor in the cytosol (step 1). The receptor can either be the long isoform of PEX5 in higher organisms or one of its paralogues such as PEX18 or PEX21 in yeast. The cargo complex then partitions into a conduit that consists of a selective phase formed from the YG domain and the preceding unstructured region of PEX13 (step 2). Translocation through the phase is mediated by interactions between the WXXXF/Y motifs of the receptor and the YG repeats of PEX13 as well as by the interaction between PEX7 and the KPWE motif of PEX13. These interactions allow the cargo complex to move across the membrane into the organelle (step 3). Receptor recycling is initiated by the insertion of the receptor's flexible N terminus into the pore of the PEX2–PEX10–PEX12 ubiquitin ligase complex from within the matrix (step 4). Mono-ubiquitination of the receptor's N-terminal cysteine then recruits the PEX1–PEX6 ATPase, which pulls the receptor through the ligase pore and causes the cargo as well as PEX7 to be stripped off and left behind inside the matrix (step 5). After being released from the receptor, PEX7 repartitions into the YG phase via the interaction with the KPWE motif and thereby diffuses back across the membrane (step 6). PEX7 is extracted out of the phase on the cytosolic side by PEX39 (step 7), which can then facilitate the reloading of PEX7 with cargo and a new receptor molecule to start another import cycle (step 8). The subsequent re-entry of the cargo complex into the YG conduit releases PEX39 and leaves it behind in the cytosol.

During translocation into peroxisomes, both PEX7 and import receptors can interact with the YG phase independently of each other and probably cooperate to move cargo through the import conduit. However, receptors move through YG hydrogels faster than PEX7, suggesting that translocation is predominantly driven by the receptors. PEX7 instead seems to strengthen the interaction of the cargo complex with the YG phase, causing the PTS2–cargo complex to move through the phase more slowly. This observation probably explains why PTS2 import in Xenopus egg extract is slower than import of PTS1 cargo, which has also been reported in plants46.

Because diffusion through the YG phase is non-directional, translocation must be biased towards the peroxisomal matrix. Directionality is exclusively imposed by the receptors, which can bind with high affinity to the luminal domain of PEX14 (a membrane protein closely associated with PEX13) using their WXXXF/Y motifs47. This interaction would attract the cargo complex into the matrix and would explain why the WXXXF/Y motifs of the receptors are essential for PTS2 import in Xenopus egg extract but not for permeation of the PTS2–cargo complex through the YG hydrogel. This model also agrees with the observation that the recombinant luminal domain of PEX14 blocks PTS2 import in rat-liver extract35. Translocation could additionally be driven inwards if import were coupled to receptor export48. The N terminus of the receptor could insert into the pore of the ubiquitin ligase complex and recruit the PEX1–PEX6 ATPase before the remainder of the cargo complex has moved through the import conduit; the ATPase would then pull the receptor together with bound PEX7 and cargo through the YG phase into the organelle, as suggested previously49. Although this mechanism might not be needed for import in every case35,50, it might expedite the translocation of bulkier or more YG-phobic cargo whose passage through the YG phase might be unfavourable. Regardless of the mechanism, the biased movement of the receptors would result in import of both PTS1 and PTS2 cargo, and would also explain how PEX7 enters the matrix.

Our work reveals that import receptors and PEX7 return to the cytosol by distinct mechanisms. Import receptors are actively pulled out through a retrotranslocon (the ubiquitin ligase complex) by a process powered by nucleotide hydrolysis21. By contrast, PEX7 recycling is driven solely by protein interactions with the YG phase and PEX39. The existence of separate recycling pathways is supported by experiments in rat-liver extract, which have shown that PEX7 returns to the cytosol slower than import receptors35; this difference is likely to reflect the slow permeation of PEX7 through the YG phase revealed by our hydrogel system. Nonetheless, PEX7 recycling depends on the extraction of the receptor from the organelle35,51, consistent with our model that PEX7 must be stripped from the receptor before re-entering the YG conduit.

The role of PEX39 as a chaperone for PEX7 is supported by a recent preprint45. Although this study did not investigate PEX39 in the context of PEX7 recycling, it likewise reports that PEX39 functions in PTS2 import, stabilizes the interaction between PEX7 and cargo, and binds to PEX7 more strongly than PEX13. These observations are in accord with our model in which PEX39 extracts PEX7 from the YG phase and then enables PEX7 to rebind to cargo and re-enter the phase during the next import cycle. Our model implies that PEX39 functions near the membrane, which is consistent with the observation that the PEX39 homologue in plants is fused to the cytosolic C terminus of the PEX14 membrane protein45. The authors additionally report that PTS2 import is attenuated by both downregulation and overexpression of PEX39, which is again consistent with our model: some PEX39 is required to recycle PEX7 but excess PEX39 would prevent PEX7 from binding to cargo and receptors, and would also inhibit the entry of the cargo complex into the YG phase. PEX39 does not need to be very abundant because PEX7 recycling is required only when PEX7 becomes limiting; a basal recycling rate coupled with new protein synthesis is probably sufficient to maintain a stable cytosolic pool of PEX7 under physiological conditions. Recycling might be critical under disease conditions where PEX7 expression is attenuated by hypomorphic alleles or destabilizing mutations. Boosting this recycling pathway might be an attractive therapeutic strategy to restore PTS2 import in such contexts.

The bidirectional translocation of PEX7 through the YG phase resembles the passage of nuclear transport receptors into and out of the nucleus through nuclear pores. In fact, PEX7 is uncannily similar to the mRNA-export factor GLE2 (also known as RAE1 in mammals). Both proteins consist of WD40 repeats24,52 and bind to short linear motifs in phase-forming polypeptides: PEX7 to the KPWE sequence in the unstructured region of PEX13 and GLE2 to the GLE2-binding sequence (GLEBS) in the unstructured FG nucleoporin NUP116 (also known as NUP98 in mammals)53. Akin to nuclear transport receptors and their intrinsic affinity for the nucleoporin FG phase19, PEX7 also seems to have weak affinity for the peroxisomal YG phase because some entry of PEX7 into YG hydrogels was observed in the absence of the KPWE motif. The similarity between PEX7 and nuclear transport receptors therefore reinforces the analogy between peroxisomal matrix-protein import and nuclear-protein transport.

The analogy implies that the two protein-transport systems probably evolved from the same ancestral machinery, which might have utilized a selective phase to move folded proteins between compartments. The most primitive systems might have allowed bidirectional transport of receptor–cargo complexes through a conduit containing the phase without directional bias. In the case of peroxisomal-protein import, this system might have consisted of PEX7, a PTS2 signal and a PEX13-like pore. Some directionality might have been provided by the removal of the PTS2 signal by a matrix protease, which still occurs in some organisms7. PEX5 and the PTS1 signal would have evolved later to provide directional bias and enhance the efficiency of translocation. Supporting this theory, only a few PTS2 proteins occur in most contemporary organisms yet include some of the most conserved and arguably ancient peroxisomal enzymes such as thiolase; furthermore, in certain species, PTS2 import has been completely supplanted by the PTS1 system7.

Plasmids were derived from vector pET-28b(+) (Novagen) and are listed in Supplementary Table 1 along with details about their construction and relevant GenBank accession numbers. All constructs were codon-optimized for E. coli and verified by whole-plasmid sequencing. The construct for expressing the N-terminal unstructured region (including the YG domain) of PEX13 was described previously17. For constructs fused to GST, the GST coding sequence was first amplified by PCR from vector pGEX-6P-3 (Cytiva), incorporating at the 5′ end the nucleotide sequence CAT (which creates an NdeI restriction site in combination with the downstream start codon) and at the 3′ end the nucleotide sequence 5′-GGATCCGACTTGGAAGTACTGTTTCAGGGTCCCTAACTCGAG-3′ that encodes a short linker consisting of the amino acids GSD, a 3C protease-cleavage site (amino acids LEVLFQGP), a TAA stop codon and a XhoI restriction site. The complete backbone of vector pET-28b(+) was next amplified by PCR, starting with nucleotides 5′-GCTAACAAA-3′ downstream of the multiple-cloning site and proceeding through nucleotides 5′-GGAGATATA-3′ upstream of the multiple-cloning site. Both PCR amplicons were ligated by Gibson assembly (New England Biolabs). The coding sequence of individual constructs was then inserted immediately downstream of the 3C protease-cleavage site. Truncations and deletions were performed by site-directed mutagenesis (Agilent).

Plasmids were assembled in the integrating vector pPICZα-LINK20 and are listed in Supplementary Table 2 along with details about their construction and relevant GenBank accession numbers. The vector was first modified to include the coding sequence of GST, followed by a tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease-cleavage site exactly as described previously24. The coding sequence of individual constructs was then inserted immediately downstream of the TEV protease-cleavage site by Gibson assembly.

Plasmids are listed in Supplementary Table 3 along with details about their construction and relevant GenBank accession numbers.

To assemble plasmid MSV-262, the following components were amplified by PCR and ligated by Gibson assembly: a segment of plasmid pWCD1401 located between and including the two NotI restriction sites (containing a high-copy ColE1 origin of replication and bacterial kanamycin-resistance cassette)54; the yeast PEX7 coding sequence along with 80 bp of the 5′ untranslated region; the yeast ADH1 terminator (that is, the last 13 bp of the ADH1 reading frame along with 190 bp of the 3′ untranslated region) flanked at the 5′ end by the nucleotide sequence 5′-GGCGCGC-3′ (to introduce an AscI restriction site) and at the 3′ end by the nucleotide sequence 5′-GATCCGCTAGATCTCGAGC-3′ (to introduce BglII and XhoI restriction sites); a hygMX6 hygromycin-resistance cassette (Addgene, catalogue number 19342), followed by an MfeI restriction site; and 80 bp of the 3′ untranslated region immediately downstream of the PEX7 reading frame. Using site-directed mutagenesis, the nucleotide pair GC was next inserted immediately upstream of the PEX7 start codon to introduce an SphI restriction site, nucleotides 462 and 468 within the PEX7 coding sequence were mutated to T and C, respectively, to destroy two BamHI restriction sites and the last four nucleotides of the PEX7 coding sequence (TTGA) were converted to CTAGC to introduce an NheI restriction site.

To assemble plasmid MSV-269, the TAG stop codon in plasmid MSV-262 was replaced by the nucleotide sequence 5′-TCTGGTGATTACAAAGATGATGATGACAAGTAA-3′, which encodes a short linker comprising the amino acids SG, followed by a FLAG tag (amino acids DYKDDDDK) and a new stop codon.

To assemble plasmid MSV-322, the nucleotides GC immediately upstream of the PEX7 start codon were replaced by a tetracycline-responsive riboswitch (5′-GGCCTAAAACATACCAGATCGCCACCCGCGCTTTAATCTGGAGAGGTGAAGAATACGACCACCTAGGCC-3′)39 preceded by a short linker (5′-ATCGTACG-3′) and followed by a minimal Kozak sequence (AAA).

Plasmid MSV-282 was assembled like plasmid MSV-262, with the following modifications. Fragments containing the ColE1 origin of replication and kanamycin-resistance cassette, as well as the ADH1 terminator region, were amplified by PCR as described earlier. These were ligated by Gibson assembly to the yeast PEX13 coding sequence and 69 bp of the 5′ untranslated region, a natMX6 nourseothricin-resistance cassette (Addgene, catalogue number 19343) and 68 bp of the 3′ untranslated region downstream of the PEX13 reading frame. The nucleotide sequence 5′-AGCTCCGAGGATCTGTACTTTCAGAGCTATCCATATGATGTTCCAGATTACGCT-3′, which encodes a linker composed of the amino acids SS, followed by a TEV protease-cleavage site (amino acids EDLYFQS) and an haemagglutinin tag (amino acids YPYDVPDYA), was then inserted immediately upstream of the PEX13 stop codon. Modifications of the PEX13 coding sequence were performed by site-directed mutagenesis.

Plasmid MSV-324 was assembled like plasmid MSV-282, except using the coding sequence of yeast PEX39, 80 bp of the 5′ and 3′ untranslated regions, and the yeast LYS2 auxotrophic marker (Addgene, catalogue number 64188)55. The nucleotide sequence 5′-GGTTCTGGTGATTACAAAGATGATGATGATAAG-3′, which encodes a linker composed of the amino acids GSG, followed by a FLAG tag, was then inserted immediately upstream of the PEX39 stop codon.

Yeast strains were routinely cultivated on YPD medium (1% wt/vol yeast extract, 2% wt/vol peptone and 2% wt/vol dextrose) at 30 °C, unless stated otherwise; for plates, 2% wt/vol agar (Becton Dickinson, catalogue number 214010) was added to the medium.

P. pastoris strains were derived from the SMD1168 parental strain56 and are listed in Supplementary Table 4. Expression cassettes for PEX7 and PEX7–GFP were inserted at the AOX1 locus by homologous recombination using the integrating plasmids described earlier. Plasmids were linearized using the restriction enzyme PmeI (New England Biolabs) and delivered into the yeast cells by electroporation. Transformants were selected on YPD agar supplemented with 1 M sorbitol and 500 µg ml−1 zeocin (Thermo Fisher, R25001). Correct insertion was validated by PCR.

S. cerevisiae strains were derived from the BY4742 reference strain57 and are listed in Supplementary Table 5. Deletions and insertions were performed by homologous recombination in a BY4742 derivative (referred herein as strain MSB-462) that expresses the peroxisomal PTS1 enzyme FOX2 fused at the N terminus to red fluorescent protein (RFP–FOX2) as well as the peroxisomal PTS2 enzyme POT1 fused at the C terminus to green fluorescent protein (POT1–GFP)58. For gene deletions, the appropriate antibiotic-resistance cassette or auxotrophic marker was amplified by PCR from the plasmids listed in Supplementary Table 3 using primers that introduce 60-bp overhangs corresponding to the 5′ and 3′ untranslated regions immediately upstream and downstream of the target open reading frame, respectively. The resulting amplicon was delivered into the yeast cells by lithium acetate-based transformation59. Transformants were selected on YPD agar supplemented with 250 µg ml−1 hygromycin (Thermo Fisher, catalogue number 10687010), 500 µg ml−1 geneticin (Thermo Fisher, catalogue number 10131035) or 100 µg ml−1 nourseothricin (Jena Bioscience, AB-101), as appropriate, or on synthetic defined agar medium lacking the appropriate amino acid or nucleotide (Sunrise Science). For inserting mutant genes or epitope tags, the relevant reading frame was first knocked out and then replaced by the modified coding sequence using the integrating plasmids described earlier. The plasmids were linearized using the restriction enzyme NotI (New England Biolabs) before lithium acetate-based transformation. All deletions and insertions were validated by PCR.

PEX7 and PEX7–GFP were produced in P. pastoris as fusions to an N-terminal GST tag and a TEV protease-cleavage site, and purified by glutathione-affinity and size-exclusion chromatographies as described previously24 with the following modifications. Cells were cultured in 2-l baffled flasks for 36 h at 30 °C on an orbital shaker in BM medium (100 mM KH2PO4·KOH pH 6.0 at RT, 0.34% wt/vol yeast nitrogen base, 1% wt/vol ammonium sulfate and 4 × 10−5% wt/vol d-biotin) supplemented with 1% vol/vol glycerol. The cells were next sterilely resuspended in BM medium supplemented with 0.75% vol/vol methanol in clean 2-l baffled flasks and cultured for an additional 24 h at 28 °C. The final cell pellets were weighed and suspended (at a ratio of 1 ml g−1 wet cell weight) in lysis buffer (30 mM Tris–HCl pH 7.5 at RT, 500 mM NaCl, 5% wt/vol glycerol, 1 mM EDTA and 2 mM dithiothreitol (DTT)) supplemented with protease-inhibitor tablets (Roche, catalogue number 5056489001) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cell suspension was divided among 50-ml beadbeater canisters (BioSpec, catalogue number 110803-50SS), supplemented with 2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and the cells were lysed by beadbeating at 4 °C with 0.5-mm glass beads (BioSpec, catalogue number 11079105). The lysate was supplemented with 0.05% wt/vol Tween 20 and clarified by centrifugation at 40,000g and 4 °C for 40 min. The resulting supernatant was incubated overnight at 4 °C with glutathione agarose (Prometheus). The beads were washed with excess wash buffer (30 mM Tris–HCl pH 7.5 at RT, 300 mM NaCl and 1 mM DTT) and bound protein was eluted at RT with elution buffer (30 mM HEPES·KOH pH 7.8 at RT, 150 mM NaCl, 5% wt/vol glycerol, 1 mM DTT, 0.5 mM EDTA and 20 mM reduced glutathione). To remove the GST tag, the eluate was mixed with homemade His-tagged TEV protease60 and dialysed overnight at 4 °C against elution buffer lacking glutathione. The dialysed solution was incubated with glutathione agarose and Ni-NTA agarose (Thermo Fisher) to adsorb the GST tag and TEV protease. The resulting flow-through was gel-filtered into 30 mM HEPES·NaOH (pH 8), 300 mM NaCl, 5% wt/vol glycerol and 1 mM DTT (at 4 °C) either on a Cytiva HiLoad 16/600 Superdex 75 prep-grade (for PEX7) or a Cytiva HiLoad 16/600 Superdex 200 PG (for PEX7–GFP) column. Peak fractions were pooled and concentrated before being snap-frozen and stored as single-use aliquots at −80 °C.

The unstructured N-terminal region (including the YG domain) of A. thaliana PEX13 was produced in E. coli BL21 Rosetta 2(DE3) cells (Novagen) as a fusion to an N-terminal 14×His tag and a TEV protease-cleavage site, and purified under denaturing conditions in 8 M urea as previously described17.

Proteins were produced in E. coli BL21 Rosetta 2(DE3) cells as fusions containing an N-terminal GST tag and a 3C protease-cleavage site. The proteins were purified by glutathione-affinity and size-exclusion chromatographies as described previously15 with the exception that after proteolytic removal of the GST tag using 3C protease, the proteins were gel-filtered into 25 mM HEPES·NaOH pH 7.8 at RT, 150 mM NaCl, 5% wt/vol glycerol and 1 mM DTT before being snap-frozen as single-use aliquots.

Lyophilized peptides (Genscript) were dissolved in 1 M HEPES·NaOH pH 7.5 at RT, 10 mM tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP) and 1 mM EDTA to a final concentration of 10 mM, snap-frozen as single-use aliquots and stored at −80 °C. The KPWE peptide corresponds to the amino-acid sequence CSSTAVPRPKPWETSASLEE consisting of residues 2–20 of S. cerevisiae PEX13 and an additional N-terminal cysteine for coupling to thiol-reactive agarose beads. In the scrambled peptide, amino acids 8 and 10–13 were rearranged into the sequence CSSTAVPEPRWKPTSASLEE. The PTS2 peptide corresponds to the amino-acid sequence SQRLQSIKDHLVESRS consisting of residues 2–15 of the S. cerevisiae peroxisomal thiolase POT1, followed by the amino acids R and S to improve solubility.

Peroxisome biogenesis was induced in S. cerevisiae using an established procedure61. Briefly, cells were subcultured twice in YPD medium to mid-log phase (optical density at 600 nm (OD600) ≈ 2), harvested through centrifugation at 2,000g and 30 °C for 10 min, sterilely resuspended to an OD600 of 0.5 in YPGO medium (1% wt/vol yeast extract, 2% wt/vol peptone, 2% vol/vol glycerol, 0.1% wt/vol oleic acid and 0.25% vol/vol Tween 40) and cultured for an additional 16 h at 30 °C. For experiments involving PEX7 riboswitch constructs, cultures in YPGO were supplemented with 250 µM tetracycline (Millipore Sigma, T7660) as described previously62.

S. cerevisiae cells expressing RFP–FOX2 and POT1–GFP (MSB-462) were induced to form peroxisomes as described earlier. A 1-ml aliquot of each culture was sedimented by centrifugation for 30 s at 13,000g and RT, and the cells were resuspended in 7 µl of RT complete synthetic defined medium (Sunrise Science, catalogue number 1001) supplemented with 10 mM potassium phosphate pH 6 at RT, 4 mM magnesium sulfate, 25 mM ammonium sulfate and 2% wt/vol d-glucose. An aliquot of the resulting suspension was spotted on a clean glass slide (Thermo Fisher, 22-310397), covered by a 22 × 22 mm no. 1.5 square glass coverslip (VWR, 48366-227) and imaged immediately.

The cells were imaged on a spinning-disk confocal platform consisting of a Nikon Eclipse Ti inverted microscope, a Yokagawa CSU-X1 spinning-disk confocal scanner, a Hamamatsu ORCA-Fusion BT sCMOS camera and a Prior Proscan II motorized stage. Samples were illuminated sequentially by solid-state 65 mW 561-nm and 80 mW 488-nm lasers through a Di01-T405/488/568/647 dichroic (Semrock). Fluorescence was collected using a red-emission ET605/52 m (605 ± 26 nm) or a green-emission ET525/50 m (525 ± 25 nm) single-band bandpass filter (Chroma), respectively, through either a Nikon ×100 1.45 numerical aperture (NA) Plan Apo Lambda or Nikon ×40 0.95 NA Plan Apo Lambda air objective. Images were acquired using the Nikon NIS-Elements software with a 16-bit digitizer without binning. Multiple non-overlapping positions arrayed around the centre of the coverslip were imaged for each sample, with focus being maintained at a preset distance from the coverslip using the Nikon PFS. Imaging parameters were configured to maximize the signal-to-noise (SNR) ratio while avoiding saturation. All samples intended to be compared were imaged using identical acquisition settings.

Interphase-locked egg extract lacking filamentous actin was prepared exactly as described in a previously published protocol37 using adult female X. laevis wild-type pigmented African clawed frogs (aged 20–30 yr; Xenopus1). The frogs were handled strictly within the confines of the Amphibian/Aquatics facility of the Cell Biology Department at Harvard Medical School according to protocols fully approved by the Harvard Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (protocol number IS00000098-9).

Import reactions were performed exactly as described in a previously published protocol37. Briefly, extract was mixed with 500 nM of the indicated cargo and 100 nM of the indicated receptor variants with or without 100 nM PEX7, and incubated at 24 °C. Where stated, endogenous PEX5 was first depleted from the extract using agarose beads covalently conjugated to the high-affinity PEX5-binding domain from PEX14. Recombinant proteins were diluted in XBHS buffer (40 mM HEPES·KOH pH 7.7 at RT, 100 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM CaCl2 and 250 mM sucrose) before being added to the reactions. For imaging, an aliquot of each reaction was sandwiched between two 22 × 22 mm no. 1.5 square glass coverslips (VWR, 48366-227) that had been passivated with 20 kDa polyethylene glycol (JenKem, M-SLN-20K). The sandwich was mounted on a 25 × 75 mm aluminium slide and sealed with a mixture of Vaseline, lanoline and paraffin. The slides were imaged on a spinning-disk confocal platform consisting of an inverted Nikon Eclipse Ti2 microscope and a Yokagawa CSU-W1 spinning-disk confocal scanner. The samples were illuminated by an 80-mW solid-state 488-nm laser through a Di01-T405/488/568/647 dichroic (Semrock), and fluorescence was collected through a Nikon ×100 1.45 NA Plan Apo Lambda oil-immersion objective and a green-emission ET525/50 m (525 ± 25 nm) single-band bandpass filter (Chroma). Images were acquired using the Nikon NIS-Elements software with a Hamamatsu ORCA-Fusion BT CMOS camera with 2 × 2 binning and a 16-bit digitizer. For each sample, multiple non-overlapping positions arrayed around the centre of the coverslip were imaged using a Prior Proscan III motorized stage operating at 20% of the maximum speed (to avoid shaking the extract). Focus was maintained at a preset distance from the coverslip using the Nikon Perfect Focus System. Imaging parameters were configured to maximize the SNR ratio while avoiding saturation. All samples intended to be compared were imaged under identical acquisition settings.

Samples in Laemmli buffer (50 mM Tris–HCl pH 6.8 at RT, 10% vol/vol glycerol, 2% wt/vol SDS, 0.01% bromophenol blue and 700 mM β-mercaptoethanol) were heated for 5 min at 95 °C and then electrophoretically resolved under denaturing conditions on 4–20% TGX precast polyacrylamide gels (Bio-Rad, catalogue number 5671095). For immunoblotting, samples were transferred from the gels to Immun-Blot PVDF membranes (Bio-Rad, catalogue number 13709A06) for 12 h at 25 V and RT in 25 mM Tris, 192 mM glycine and 10% vol/vol methanol. The membranes were blotted in 20 mM Tris–HCl pH 7.5 at RT, 150 mM NaCl, 0.01% vol/vol Tween 20 and 3% wt/vol fat-free milk solids (Apex, catalogue number 20241) using antibodies to the FLAG epitope (Sigma, F7425) and compatible horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Cytiva, NA934). The blots were developed by chemiluminescence (Perkin Elmer, NEL103001EA) and scanned on an Amersham ImageQuant 800 imaging system. For staining with Coomassie blue, gels were fixed in 50% vol/vol methanol and 10% vol/vol acetic acid for 30 min at RT, incubated for 30 min in 50% vol/vol methanol, 10% vol/vol acetic acid and 0.001% wt/vol Coomassie brilliant blue R-250 (Bio-Rad), and destained overnight in 10% vol/vol acetic acid before washing into water. The stained gels were digitized on an Epson Perfection V700 scanner using the Epson Scan 2 software.

Cells cultured in YPGO medium (200 ml) were collected by centrifugation at 2,000g and 4 °C for 5 min, resuspended in an equivalent volume of water and re-pelleted. The final cell pellet was suspended in 3 ml chilled lysis buffer (20 mM HEPES·KOH pH 6.8 at RT, 150 mM potassium acetate, 5 mM magnesium acetate, 250 mM sorbitol and 1 mM EDTA) supplemented with protease-inhibitor tablets. The cell suspension was divided among three 2-ml screw-cap tubes on ice, supplemented with 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and lysed by beadbeating with 0.5 mm glass beads on a mini-beadbeater (BioSpec). The cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 2,000g and 4 °C for 10 min, and the resulting lysate (2 ml) was further fractionated into a soluble supernatant and a membrane pellet by centrifugation at 20,000g and 4 °C for 30 min. A 1-ml aliquot of the supernatant fraction was supplemented with 1% wt/vol highly pure Triton X-100 (Thermo Fisher, catalogue number 85111) and incubated with anti-FLAG agarose beads (Millipore Sigma, A2220) for 1 h at 4 °C. The pellet fraction was gently washed with lysis buffer, resuspended in 2 ml lysis buffer supplemented with 1% Triton X-100, solubilized for 15 min on ice and clarified by centrifugation at 20,000g and 4 °C for 10 min. A 1-ml aliquot of the resulting solubilisate was incubated with anti-FLAG beads as described earlier. The beads were washed several times with lysis buffer supplemented with 0.01% Triton X-100 and finally boiled in an equivalent volume of 2×Laemmli buffer.

A solution of the purified wild-type YG-domain polypeptide (or the variant lacking the KPWE motif) was concentrated to 2 mM in 50 mM HEPES·NaOH pH 7.8 at RT, 2 M urea and 2 mM TCEP. Aliquots of 2 µl were then spotted on the bottom of multiple wells of a 96-well glass-bottomed plate (Cellvis, P96-1.5H-N), which was then sealed with a gas-impermeable AlumaSeal II film (Hampton Research, HR8-069) to prevent desiccation and incubated at RT for 24 h. Before each assay, the resulting gels were equilibrated overnight at RT in a 100-fold excess of Assay Buffer (25 mM HEPES·NaOH pH 7.8 at RT, 150 mM NaCl and 1 mM TCEP). A 0.5 µM solution of fluorescently labelled protein in Assay Buffer was then added to the samples, with or without additional components at the concentrations indicated in the text, and incubated at RT. Gels were imaged at the times indicated in the text using a Nikon A1R point-scanning confocal system consisting of an inverted Nikon Eclipse Ti microscope and a Nikon ×20 0.75 NA Plan Apo air objective. The objective was centred on the gel edge and focus was maintained 5 µm above the glass surface using the Nikon Perfect Focus System. Fluorescence was excited through a 405/488/561/647 quad-band dichroic (Chroma), using a 488-nm solid-state laser (Coherent) and a galvano scanner. A 50-nm emission band was collected on a gallium arsenide phosphide detector, using an ET525/50m (525 ± 25 nm) single-band bandpass filter (Chroma) and a pinhole dilated to 0.9 Airy units. Images were acquired using the Nikon NIS-Elements software with a pixel size of 1 µm and a 12-bit digitizer. Imaging parameters were configured to maximize the SNR while avoiding saturation. All samples intended to be compared were imaged using identical acquisition settings.

YG hydrogels were prepared in a glass-bottomed plate as described earlier and equilibrated for 3 h at RT in Assay Buffer containing 0.5 µM PEX7–GFP or PEX5–GFP with or without PTS2 peptide and receptor at the concentrations specified in the text. Following the initial incubation, the hydrogels were imaged on a Nikon A1R point-scanning confocal system, as described earlier, with a Nikon ×10 0.45 NA Plan Apo air objective, a pinhole dilated to 1.4 Airy units and a pixel size of 2 µm. A solution of purified PEX39 was then spiked into each reaction and the hydrogels imaged every 2 min for an additional 1 h at RT.

Cysteine-containing peptides were covalently conjugated to thiol-reactive SulfoLink coupling resin (Thermo Fisher, catalogue number 20401) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The prepared beads were then mixed with Assay Buffer containing the fluorescently labelled protein as well as additional components indicated in the text, and the resulting bead suspensions were transferred to a 384-well glass-bottomed plate (Cellvis, P384-1.5H-N). GST-fusion proteins were instead mixed with glutathione agarose 4B (Prometheus, 20-543) in Assay Buffer containing the fluorescently labelled protein and additional components indicated in the text; the resulting bead suspensions were then transferred to a glass-bottomed plate as above. The plates were incubated at RT for the durations specified in the text and directly imaged on the spinning-disk confocal platform described earlier for peroxisomal import reactions in Xenopus egg extract. Note that imaging the beads directly in the binding reaction preserves the equilibrium and thereby allows even weak interactions to be detected. Fluorescence was collected through a Nikon ×10 0.45 NA Plan Apo air objective, and images were acquired using the Nikon NIS-Elements software and a 16-bit digitizer without binning. Imaging parameters were configured to maximize the SNR while avoiding saturation. Samples intended to be compared were imaged using identical acquisition settings.

For the assay shown in Fig. 5d, 15 µl glutathione agarose 4B (Prometheus, 20-543) was mixed with 1 µM purified recombinant yeast PEX7 and varying concentrations of the GST-tagged variants of yeast PEX39, as indicated in the text, in a final volume of 50 µl. Reactions were prepared in Assay Buffer in low protein-binding tubes (Eppendorf, catalogue number 022431081) to minimize sample adhesion to the tube walls. The reactions were incubated at 25 °C for 1 h with agitation. The beads were then quickly sedimented for 30 s at 16,000g and RT, and 20 µl of each supernatant fraction was boiled in reducing Laemmli buffer. The samples were resolved by SDS–PAGE and stained with Coomassie blue as described earlier.

For the assay shown in Fig. 8b, the beads were first incubated with yeast PEX7 and the GST-tagged ∆APH variant of yeast PEX39 (each at 1 µM) for 30 min at 25 °C with agitation. Varying concentrations of the peptides, as indicated in the text, were then added and the reactions were incubated for a further 1 h under the same conditions. The beads were finally sedimented and the resulting supernatant fractions resolved by SDS–PAGE as above.

All experiments were repeated independently at least three times. No data were excluded from the analyses. Mathematical fitting was performed in GraphPad Prism using least-squares regression.

Proteins containing KPWE motifs (or conservative variants) were identified in different species using the MOTIF Search tool at GenomeNet (https://www.genome.jp). Amino-acid sequences were aligned using Clustal Omega63. Secondary structure predictions were performed with AlphaFold 3 (ref. 64). Amino-acid conservation was calculated using ConSurf65. Helical-wheel diagrams were prepared using HeliQuest66.

All analyses were performed on the original unmodified images using routine functions in ImageJ67. Fluorescence images were first background-subtracted before further analysis.

For the YG hydrogel permeation assay, images were first oriented such that each gel edge faced the same direction. Fluorescence profiles across the buffer–gel interface were then generated by centering a 60 × 300 µm rectangular area on the gel edge and then measuring the mean fluorescence at each position within this selection. To express the resulting values in terms of fold enrichment, the fluorescence at each position along the selection was normalized to the average fluorescence in the buffer and plotted in terms of the distance from the gel edge.

For the PEX7-release assay from YG hydrogels, the total fluorescence within a 30-µm-wide band in the gel extending for 150 µm from the gel edge into the gel was measured at each time point. This distance was sufficient to fully encompass the permeation front of each fluorescent species. The resulting values were then normalized to the total fluorescence inside the gel at the start of the experiment and plotted as a function of time.

To calculate permeation rates through the YG hydrogel, a 60 × 300 µm rectangular area was first centred on the gel edge. The resulting region was then thresholded to demarcate the permeation zone (that is, the distance traversed by the fluorescent species) from the buffer and non-permeated part of the gel. The width of the area above the threshold was then measured and plotted as a function of time. A linear fit to the data yielded the permeation rate.

To calculate import rates in Xenopus egg extract, images were first thresholded to identify peroxisomes that were within the focal plane. A circular area with a diameter of 3 pixels was then centred on each local maximum and the mean fluorescence within this area was measured; the average fluorescence in the cytosol was then subtracted from the measured values. The resulting difference (that is, the peroxisome-associated fluorescence) was subsequently converted into a GFP concentration using a calibration curve of GFP fluorescence in the egg extract measured at different concentrations. The peroxisome-associated GFP concentrations were finally plotted as a function of time; linear fits to the data yielded the import rate.

To calculate the fraction bound in the quantitative binding assay, digitized images of Coomassie-stained gels were first converted into 16-bit grayscale and their pixel intensities inverted. The mean pixel intensity was then measured within a rectangular selection encompassing each PEX7 protein band and the mean intensity of the background was subtracted from the measured values. The background-corrected intensities (corresponding to unbound PEX7 remaining in solution) were in turn subtracted from the intensity of the PEX7 band in a sample without PEX39 (that is, total PEX7). The resulting difference (corresponding to PEX7 that had bound to the beads) was finally divided by the total PEX7 intensity to yield the fraction bound. The data were fitted either to a standard binding isotherm or a competitive-binding isotherm, as appropriate, to estimate the observed binding constants.

All images intended to be compared were processed identically. Fluorescence micrographs were normalized to the background before being linearly contrast-stretched in ImageJ to the same bit range. Digitized images of immunoblots and Coomassie-stained gels were linearly contrast-stretched in ImageJ to reveal relevant bands but avoid clipping of the background, whereas photographs of YG hydrogels were processed using Adobe Photoshop. Structural models of proteins were rendered using the PyMOL Molecular Graphics System (Schrödinger). Figures were assembled for publication in Adobe Illustrator.

a, Xenopus egg extract was depleted or not (mock) of endogenous PEX5 using beads conjugated to the PEX5-binding domain from PEX14, then supplemented with buffer or the indicated purified recombinant PEX5 variants (described in Fig. 1b). Import was assessed by imaging the indicated fluorescent cargo on a spinning-disk confocal microscope. The cargo, shown on the left, consisted of GFP fused to the SKL peroxisome targeting signal (PTS1) or to the signal from the indicated Xenopus PTS2 peroxisomal matrix enzymes (PTS2). Repeated rounds of cargo import into peroxisomes produce bright puncta. Scale bars equal 5 µm. b, The indicated recombinant proteins were produced and purified as described in the Methods, then resolved by SDS–PAGE and stained by Coomassie Blue. Molecular weights (in kD) are marked on the left; images of the unprocessed gels are provided.

Source data

a, Glutathione-conjugated beads were bound to 1 µM GST alone or to the purified recombinant GST-tagged PEX5 variants shown (described in Fig. 1b), and incubated in the presence of 1 µM purified recombinant yeast PEX7 and 1 µM GFP fused at the N terminus to the import signal (residues 1–27) from yeast POT1 (PTS2). Recruitment of the fluorescent cargo to the beads was visualized after 1 h on a spinning-disk confocal microscope as a bright ring around the bead perimeter. Scale bar equals 100 µm. b, Xenopus egg extract was depleted of endogenous PEX5 using beads conjugated to the PEX5-binding domain from PEX14, then supplemented with the chimeric receptor PEX5-21 (described in Fig. 1b) and purified recombinant yeast PEX7. Import was assessed using fluorescent PTS1 and PTS2 cargo: the PTS2 cargo is described in panel a, whereas the PTS1 cargo consisted of GFP fused at the C terminus to the SKL peroxisome targeting signal. Reactions were imaged at the indicated times on a spinning-disk confocal microscope. The fluorescence intensity of the resulting puncta (corresponding to imported cargo) was then measured, converted into GFP concentrations as described in the Methods, and plotted as a function of time. Error bars span the range of at least 30 imaged fields; lines represent linear fits to the data generated by least-squares regression. The corresponding import rates (±the standard error) are specified beside the graph. Scale bars equal 5 µm. c, As in panel a, using GST alone or the indicated GST-tagged PEX5 variants (described in Fig. 1b), in the presence or absence of purified recombinant yeast PEX7 and the fluorescent cargo described in panels a and b. Source numerical data are provided.

Source data

a, Left, scheme depicting the domain organization of PEX13 from Arabidopsis thaliana. Note that A. thaliana PEX13 lacks the transmembrane segment and SH3 domain found in metazoan PEX13. Relevant residue numbers are specified on top, and the region that was produced recombinantly to prepare YG hydrogels is underlined beneath. The recombinant fragment was fused at the N terminus to a tetradecahistidine (14×His) tag and a TEV protease-cleavage site, and at the C terminus to a cysteine (Cys) residue. Right, purification of the wild-type fragment (WT) and the version lacking the KPWE motif (∆KPWE). Lanes 1 and 5 show each His-tagged precursor purified by nickel-affinity chromatography in the presence of urea (as described in the Methods), resolved by SDS–PAGE and stained by Coomassie blue. Lanes 2 and 6 show each fragment after cleavage with TEV protease to release the His tag. Lanes 3 and 7 show the soluble fraction (sup) of each TEV-cleavage reaction, demonstrating that each fragment remains soluble in urea in the absence of the tag. The cleaved tag was removed from the reactions by a subsequent nickel-affinity step, and the resulting flow-through containing each final purified fragment is shown in lanes 4 and 8. Molecular weights (in kD) are marked on the side; an image of the unprocessed gel is available in source data. b, Thiol-reactive beads were conjugated to the purified wild-type (WT) YG-domain polypeptide or the version lacking the KPWE motif (∆KPWE) described in panel a. The beads were then incubated with PEX7 fused at the C terminus to GFP (PEX7–GFP) or with GFP alone, and binding of each fluorescent protein to the immobilized fragments was visualized on a spinning-disk confocal microscope. Scale bar equals 100 µm.

Source data

a, Top, AlphaFold model from Fig. 3c of the complex between yeast PEX7 and the N-terminal segment of yeast PEX13 (residues 1–27) containing the KPWE motif. Below, the model coloured according to the predicted local distance difference test (pLDDT) score computed by AlphaFold for each residue, with a score of 100 reflecting the highest confidence. b, As in panel a, showing the AlphaFold model from Fig. 5b of the complex between yeast PEX7 and the region of yeast PEX39 that contains the APH and RPWE motif. c, As in panel a, showing the AlphaFold model from Fig. 7a of the complex between yeast PEX7 and the region of yeast PEX39 that contains the APH and RPWE motif, in the presence of a PTS2 peptide. d, As in panel a, showing the AlphaFold model from Fig. 7a of the complex between yeast PEX7 and the region of yeast PEX39 that contains the APH and RPWE motif, in the presence of a PTS2 peptide and the yeast receptor PEX21.

a, Interaction between full-length yeast PEX7 and residues 1–27 (including the KPWE motif) of yeast PEX13, predicted by AlphaFold. PEX7 is shown as a space-filling model in the same orientation as in Fig. 3c, coloured by surface electrostatic potential according to the scale on the right. The PEX13 fragment is depicted as a ribbon, with the side chain of lysine 10 (K10) of the KPWE motif shown. The region outlined by a dashed black line is magnified on the right. b, As above, with PEX7 coloured by surface hydrophobicity according to the scale on the right, and showing the side chain of proline 11 (P11) of the KPWE motif. c, As above, with PEX7 coloured yellow and showing the side chain of glutamate 13 (E13) of the KPWE motif. E13 is predicted to contact arginine 117 (R117) within the loop of one of the WD40 blades of the PEX7 β-propeller (overlaid on top as a cartoon representation). A sequence alignment of this loop from the indicated organisms is shown on the right, illustrating the conservation of the arginine residue. d, As in panel c, with the model rotated as indicated and showing the side chain of tryptophan 12 (W12) of the KPWE motif. W12 is predicted to contact the aliphatic stem of lysine 230 (K230) within the loop of one of the WD40 blades of the PEX7 β-propeller (overlaid on top as a cartoon representation). A sequence alignment of this loop from the indicated organisms is shown on the right, illustrating the conservation of the lysine residue.

a, Thiol-reactive beads were conjugated to a cysteine-containing synthetic peptide comprising the region of yeast PEX13 that contains the KPWE motif, or a peptide in which the motif was scrambled (both described in Fig. 3b). The beads were then incubated with or without 1 µM yeast PEX7, in the presence of 1 µM cargo consisting of GFP fused at the N terminus to the import signal (residues 1–27) from yeast POT1 (PTS2). Where indicated, reactions included 1 µM of either the chimeric receptor PEX5-21 (described in Fig. 1b) that can bind to PEX7, or the short receptor isoform PEX5S that cannot bind. Recruitment of the cargo to the beads after 1 h was visualized on a spinning-disk confocal microscope. Scale bar equals 100 µm. b, Glutathione-conjugated beads were bound to the purified recombinant GST-tagged chimeric receptor PEX5-21 (described in Fig. 1b) or to GST alone. The beads were then incubated with 1 µM PEX7–GFP in the absence or presence of a synthetic peptide comprising the PTS2 signal (residues 2–15) from yeast POT1; the fold excess of the peptide relative to PEX7–GFP is indicated above. Recruitment of PEX7–GFP to the beads was visualized on a spinning-disk confocal microscope. Note that the beads are less porous than those in panel a, so binding appears as a bright ring around the bead perimeter. Scale bar equals 100 µm.

a, PEX7 was fused at the C terminus to a FLAG tag (PEX7–FLAG) and expressed at endogenous levels in yeast. Shown is a FLAG immunoblot of the total lysate from cells expressing wild-type (WT) untagged PEX7 or two clones expressing PEX7–FLAG. Asterisk indicates non-specific bands; molecular weights (in kD) are marked on the left. b, Yeast cells lacking PEX7 (pex7∆), or expressing PEX7–FLAG, were grown in oleic acid to induce peroxisomes. Peroxisomal protein import was assessed by imaging the endogenous matrix proteins FOX2 fused to RFP (PTS1) and POT1 fused to GFP (PTS2). Note that bright puncta indicate successful import; in the absence of import, the cargo is diffusely distributed throughout the cytosol. Scale bar equals 5 µm. c, PEX7–FLAG was expressed in cells lacking PEX13 (pex13∆), or cells containing wild-type (WT) PEX13 or a mutant lacking the KPWE motif (∆KPWE). Cells were grown in oleic acid to induce peroxisomes, then lysed and separated into a peroxisome-containing membrane fraction. PEX7–FLAG was immunoprecipitated from the total lysate and the corresponding detergent-solubilized membranes, resolved by SDS–PAGE, and detected by immunoblotting for the FLAG epitope. Asterisk marks non-specific bands; molecular weights (in kD) are marked on the left. d, Yeast cells devoid of PEX13 (pex13∆), or expressing PEX13 lacking residues 2–13 that encompass the KPWE motif, were grown in oleic acid to induce peroxisomes. Where indicated, the cells additionally lacked the two PTS2 receptors PEX18 and PEX21 (pex18∆ pex21∆) or the two PTS1 receptors PEX5 and PEX9 (pex5∆ pex9∆). Peroxisomal protein import was assessed as in panel b. Scale bar equals 5 µm. e, Xenopus egg extract was incubated for 1 h with 0.5 µM GFP alone or GFP fused to the C terminus of the indicated proteins, then imaged on a spinning-disk confocal microscope. Where indicated, reactions additionally included the chimeric receptor PEX5-21 (described in Fig. 1b) at 0.5 µM and a synthetic peptide comprising the PTS2 signal from yeast POT1. Note that puncta reveal entry of the fluorescent species into peroxisomes. Scale bar equals 5 µm. Unprocessed blots are available.

Source data

a, The leftmost panel shows an AlphaFold model of the complex between yeast PEX7 and the indicated region of yeast PEX39 containing the APH and the RPWE motif. The N terminus of PEX39 is marked for reference. The next panel on the right shows the same complex but with PEX7 represented as a surface and coloured according to the amino-acid conservation scale underneath. A conserved groove along the side of PEX7 is framed by dashed black lines. The four rightmost panels show the same complex but rotated as indicated. Note the extensive amino-acid conservation around the binding sites for the APH and the RPWE motif. b, As in panel a, showing the crystal structure (PDB: 3W15) of the complex between yeast PEX7, a PTS2 peptide, and the yeast PTS2 receptor PEX21. The complex is overlaid on the AlphaFold model of yeast PEX7 shown in panel a (with PEX7 from the crystal structure not visible). Note that a portion of the receptor snakes along the same conserved groove (framed by dashed black lines) on the side of PEX7 to which PEX39 is predicted to bind. Furthermore, the receptor and PTS2 peptide are cradled by the same conserved surface on top of PEX7 that also binds to the APH of PEX39.

a, Glutathione-conjugated beads were bound to 1 µM purified recombinant GST-tagged yeast PEX7 or GST alone, and incubated with 1 µM purified recombinant yeast PEX39 fused at the C terminus to GFP (PEX39–GFP) or with GFP alone. Recruitment of each fluorescent protein to the beads was visualized after 1 h on a spinning-disk confocal microscope. Scale bar equals 100 µm. b, Representative Coomassie-stained SDS–PAGE gels corresponding to the binding experiment in Fig. 5d. Briefly, yeast PEX7 was incubated with beads coated with GST-tagged wild-type yeast PEX39 or the indicated mutants; after sedimenting the beads, each supernatant fraction was resolved by SDS–PAGE and stained by Coomassie Blue. Molecular weights (in kD) are marked on the left. c, PEX7 and PEX39 were fused at their C terminus to a FLAG tag (PEX7–FLAG and PEX39–FLAG) and expressed from their respective endogenous promoters in yeast. Shown is a FLAG immunoblot of the total lysate from two different clones (lanes 3 and 4) following growth in oleic acid, compared to cells expressing PEX7–FLAG and untagged PEX39 (lane 2), and cells expressing untagged versions of both proteins (lane 1). Asterisk indicates non-specific bands; molecular weights (in kD) are marked on the left. d, YG hydrogels were incubated with GFP alone or with GFP fused to the C terminus of the indicated proteins. The accumulation of each fluorescent protein inside the gel after 30 min was visualized on a point-scanning confocal microscope. Representative images are shown; the fold enrichment of each protein relative to buffer, across the imaged field, is plotted above (mean ± range of 3 experiments). The width of each image corresponds to 300 µm. Source numerical data and unprocessed blots are provided.

Among the conference abstracts deleted from a planetary science archive site recently is work involving chemistry measurements made by NASA's Mars Curiosity rover (pictured, on Mars). Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech/MSSS via Getty

Over the past several weeks, hundreds of meeting abstracts have quietly vanished from the websites of research conferences organized by the Lunar and Planetary Institute (LPI) in Houston, Texas — a NASA-funded research institution that maintains key archives and information about US planetary science. The abstracts have a common theme: diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI). These topics were banned from receiving government funding by a 20 January executive order from US President Donald Trump, who called them “illegal and immoral discrimination programs”. The LPI did not seek permission from the abstract authors to remove the material.

Many researchers are fuming about the deletions from the archives of a research institute that is managed independently from the federal government. “This is just egregious censorship of science,” says Ingrid Daubar, a planetary scientist at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island, who co-authored several of the deleted abstracts.

Many of the abstracts are pages-long developments of preliminary ideas that are important to the planetary-science literature. Their removals are an “Orwellian rewriting of history”, says a researcher who asked to remain anonymous because of the sensitivity of the situation. Mark Sykes, a senior scientist at the Planetary Science Institute in Tucson, Arizona, called the decision “a profound ethical failure”.

Several scientists told Nature that they think the LPI and its parent organization, the Universities Space Research Association (USRA) in Washington DC, have over-interpreted the Trump executive order as retroactively applying to independently performed work in public archives.

In a statement provided to Nature, the USRA said it “believes that compliance with Administration directives requires DEI content to be out of public view”, unless it is “advised by an authoritative federal body that we can restore that content”.

“Waiting for some ‘authoritative federal body' to tell them to undo the harm they've done is just deflecting accountability,” Daubar says. NASA declined to comment on the basis that it does not run the websites.

A group of researchers is now leading a data-rescue effort to locate and rehouse the deleted material on a privately run website.

Many federal agencies, including NASA, have removed DEI-related content from their websites in response to the executive order. But the LPI is not a government institution; it was set up in 1968, during the Apollo era, primarily to foster relationships between university scientists and NASA. For decades, it has organized planetary-science conferences, trained researchers and maintained documents and databases on topics such as lunar impact craters.

The missing meeting abstracts include research on workforce issues, such as how to build the most effective team of scientists for a mission. One of Daubar's deleted abstracts described a programme to involve early-career scientists in NASA's InSight mission to Mars. David Trang, a planetary scientist at the Space Science Institute who is based in Honolulu, Hawaii, had his work on improving mental health among planetary scientists deleted. Removing these abstracts “takes away our culture”, he says. “That's the saddest part.”

The end is nigh—at least, it is for Windows 10. Microsoft will stop supporting the decade-old operating system on October 14, 2025.

There's one hiccup, though: Even though Windows 11 is a free update, more people still use Windows 10 than Windows 11, according to statcounter.com, a site that tracks operating system usage worldwide.

Plenty of people, it seems, either don't want to upgrade to Windows 11 or are using devices that aren't supported. This means millions of people could be using an operating system that's no longer receiving security updates.

If you're one of them, it makes sense to learn what happens to your computer in October—and what you should do about it. Here's a summary of what's happening with Windows 10 and four options you have to replace it.

Nothing in particular is going to happen on October 14, the day updates stop. Your computer will keep working the way it has, and you're unlikely to run into issues. That doesn't mean it's a great idea to keep using Windows 10, though.

That's because the system will no longer receive security updates or patches from Microsoft. This won't matter much until a new Windows exploit is discovered. After that, though, your device will have vulnerabilities that will never be patched. At that point, you will be at increased risk of attacks like ransomware, where a virus encrypts all of your files and scammers demand a payment in order to decrypt them. Continuing to use Windows 10 long-term dramatically increases the odds of these and other attacks.

There are other potential annoyances. Third-party developers, meaning the companies that make the software you use and the games you play, tend to stop providing updates for operating systems that are no longer officially supported. So, if a game adds new features in an update, you might not be able to install it. The same goes for the software you rely on to do your work: Over time, the latest versions of your desktop apps won't run on Windows 10, meaning you'll miss out on features. There's also a security angle. In addition to no longer receiving security updates for your operating system, you'll also eventually stop getting security updates for the tools you use.

None of this will happen right away on October 14. But you can expect to start hearing about software makers dropping support for Windows 10 later this year. It's a good idea, then, to be prepared.

Microsoft has two official recommendations: updating your computer to Windows 11, which is free provided your computer supports it. The other recommendation is to buy a new device, presumably one already running Windows 11. Those aren't your only choices, though. You could replace Windows with another operating system entirely, like ChromeOS or Linux. Let's talk through all four options.

The simplest thing, for most people, is to upgrade to Windows 11. Yes, this is annoying if you prefer Windows 10, but the good news is that Windows 11 is free, and the irritating AI features are easy to turn off.

Find out whether your computer supports Windows 11 by opening Settings. Head to Settings > Privacy and Security > Windows Update. If your computer is compatible you should see an Upgrade to Windows 11 option. From there, you can click it to start the update procedure. Note that it's generally a good idea to back up your computer before upgrading your operating system.

If you don't see the option to update, it's likely that your computer doesn't support Windows 11. Microsoft makes an app you can download to check and to get specific recommendations. In some cases you might be able to upgrade a component instead of your whole computer to make it compatible with Windows 11. But what if that's not the case?

Microsoft has only one piece of advice to give people whose computer can't run Windows 11: buy a new one. On one hand this isn't unreasonable. The Windows 11 system requirements aren't too onerous. You need 4 GB of memory, 64 GB of storage, a 720p display or higher, and a 1-gigahertz (GHz) processor or faster. Most computers sold in the past decade should hit those marks.

On the other hand, there's a good chance the global economy is entering a recession and computer prices in particular are likely to go up in the United States because of certain political decisions.

So you might not have the money to buy a new computer at the moment. What can you do instead? Replace Windows with another operating system, and ideally one that will keep getting security updates. This is going to require some tech skills on your part, but don't worry: It's mostly a matter of following instructions.

Have you ever used a Chromebook? It's just a laptop that can only run Google's Chrome browser. Such devices tend to run well despite typically having substandard components, so it's particularly useful for an older laptop. In the past few years Google launched ChromeOS Flex, which allows you to install ChromeOS on your own device. There's a good chance it can run on your old computer.

There are downsides here. If you rely on a particular piece of Windows software, you won't be able to use it in ChromeOS. You will only be able to run web apps that load in the browser. If you mostly just use the Chrome web browser, though, there's a good chance you won't miss Windows at all.

If you're curious, Google offers a guide for home installation. Basically you need to check if your laptop is supported, put the operating system on a flash drive, and then boot from the flash drive. Note that installing a new operating system deletes everything on your computer, so make sure to back up any photos or documents before doing this.

ChromeOS is easy to use but not everyone can live their entire life in a browser window. If you want to replace Windows with a more feature-filled operating system, it's time to look into Linux. This is a completely free alternative to Windows, and it tends to run better on older devices than Windows.

Linux has a reputation for being difficult, and depending on which version of Linux you decide to use it really can be. But there are versions of Linux that treat ease of use as a marquee feature. Linux Mint is a solid starting point for most people, and it offers great step-by-step instructions for getting started. As with ChromeOS, you will need to download the operating system, load it to a flash drive, then boot from the flash drive, and finally install the operating system.

If any of this is too much for you to figure out, there's an easier way: Ask all of your friends if any of them are Linux users. If they are, offer to buy them a 12-pack in exchange for helping you set up Linux—I promise you it will get done. They can also teach you the basics and show you how to navigate around your new system.

Because there will be an adjustment. We're talking about a brand-new operating system. If you want to get a few more years out of your computer, though, Linux is probably your best choice, even if it means a bit of a learning curve.

After testing so many models, the Litter-Robot 4 is still my favorite automatic litter box. Like many other models, it separates dirty litter using grates, dispensing clumps in the concealed bag below, returning clean litter back to the drum. Sensors detect and weigh the cat, and the box connects to Wi-Fi so you can track usage and program the box via Litter-Robot's Whisker app. Through the app, you can monitor: litter and waste levels, cats' recorded weight, and usage throughout the day and historically. This is an expensive upgrade, but this complete bundle has all of the essentials you'll need, like a mat, an odor trap, and waste bags. I anticipate the price dropping even more on the actual sale days, so check back often.

The Petkit PuraMax 2 is what I recommend for most people. It's a more affordable price point, easy to use, compact, and actually smells great. It cleans via vertical rotation, using a grate system to separate the waste from the clean litter, and best of all, when it's time to refill with clean litter, the box rotates so the hole is on top for easier filling. This box has triple odor control, a sealed waste bin, an odor eliminator attachment that sits in the waste bin, and a citrusy deodorizing spray that goes off after every cleaning and randomly throughout the day to ensure the litter box stays fresh. When the cat enters the box, their weight is displayed on the front, and the app logs every time it was used, for how long, when the cleaning cycle begins, ends, and when the deodorizing spray was emitted. I anticipate that the price will drop again on the actual sale days, and I'll keep updating.

This automatic litter box (8/10 WIRED Recommends) uses a camera and AI technology to monitor litter box usage, and actually lets you see your cat's stool to help more closely monitor their health. It has a camera on an arm in front of the opening, which swivels and follows your cat when it senses motion and records inside the litter box (it also has night vision). It has auto-bagging and -sealing features, so you never have to deal with the stool. The app logs and monitors usage, including the number of times used and the average duration. The automatic litter box with a camera has 180-degree viewing, two-way audio, and 24/7 streaming, and uses AI to identify which cat used the box. This pricey upgrade is made a little more accessible for $250 off, the biggest discount on this model I've seen so far this year.

The Neakasa M1 Self-Cleaning Litter Box (7/10, WIRED Recommends) is a good automatic option for cats who prefer using a more traditional litter box with an open-top design. It has sensors in case a fast cat tries to get their paws in there, and the waste is collected in a bag inside the drawer below. With a connected app to monitor cats' usage, it's easy to identify if changes occur and alert to potential health issues. It's an upper-to-midrange price for automatic litter boxes before discount, and with over $100 off, it's a steal. If you've been thinking about switching to an auto box, now's the time.

This automatic litter box is around half the price but has a similar design to more expensive models. This futuristic-looking pod on legs has a rubbery bottom for litter, a weight detector that sets off the cleaning cycle a few minutes after your cat has done its business, and a slide-out tray in the bottom. You can connect it to Wi-Fi and review your cat's toilet visits in the app on your phone, where each entry displays the time they went, their weight, and toilet trip duration. At $360 right now, it's one of the lowest prices we've seen this year and I anticipate it'll get even more discounted in the coming days.

If you don't want to spend the big bucks on a more high-tech automatic litter box, this smart litter box system sits under your existing litter box. It identifies any changes in usage that may indicate health problems like a UTI, kidney disease, and more. The app logs usage and alerts you to usage changes, and uses AI to develop a profile for each cat so you know who's using it and when. At less than $100, this is a small fraction of the cost of other automatic litter boxes and can help to know when problems begin, rather than a costly and stressful vet visit.

The Petlibro Polar Wet Food Feeder solves pretty much every gripe I had with other automatic feeders aimed at storing wet food—it's essentially a mini-fridge guaranteed to keep food fresh, and it's connected to an app where you can schedule and customize feedings while a log tells you how long a cat was at the bowl and when the feeding time finished. The refrigeration uses thermoelectric cooling and stays at 50 degrees Fahrenheit or below, and cooling is paused 30 minutes before scheduled feeding time to make sure it's at an ideal temperature when feeding begins. At $100, I'd highly recommend this for any cat owner who wants a little extra peace of mind while they're away—or if you don't want to get screamed at in the wee early morning hours for wet food.

Note: Despite having a 4.2/5 rating on Amazon, this feeder is marked as a “Frequently Returned Item.” I haven't experienced any issues with reliability or performance, and it's worked well for the past six-plus months of testing.

This has been my top pick for automatic feeders because it's (comparatively) affordable, reliable, tech-savvy, and highly customizable. It's controlled via an app and dispenses food from its 5-liter capacity based on the feeding schedule you create. It has a 1080p HD camera with night vision so you can watch and hear your pet eat even when far away, and you can communicate with them via speaker. Through the Petlibro app (for Android and iOs), you set up a feeding schedule (up to six meals a day) or feed snacks with your desired amount, and has extremely customizable feeding plans with meals that you label individually. Because of the camera feature, it essentially doubles as a pet camera, and I love that I can monitor my cats (and their food levels) while I'm away.

For this feeder, the pet wears a collar with a tag—the feeder's lid opens only with that tag. There's a cover that retracts automatically when the pet with the collar approaches the stainless steel food bowl, and everything can be controlled and monitored through the app. I think this is a nearly perfect device for a particular kind of pet owner. I think it works best for a cat in a dog home where the owner doesn't want the dog getting into the cat's food, if each pet in the home has a One RFID feeder, if one particular cat has special dietary needs, or if you have a multi-cat home with an aggressive eater. In these cases, I truly think this product would be a life-changer. I have a sneaking suspicion this will become even more discounted in coming days, so check back often.

I absolutely love this affordable automatic feeder—made even more affordable with this discount at less than 100 bucks. It has a scale in the bottom of the stainless steel bowl, which makes sure your pet is getting the exact right amount of food. It'll even alter how much it dispenses based on how much is left in the bowl, ensuring your pet isn't overeating. From the app, you can schedule and alter feedings with an optional meal call recording, and it logs when and how much your pet has eaten. This feeder has been super helpful to better track and understand my cats' eating habits.

I think the Petlibro fountain is the best automatic cat fountain for most people. Both this and the original Dockstream fountain ($80) are essentially the same, except the cordless model sits on a charging dock and can be moved around the house. The fountains have a low-water detection system, meaning that the fountains will automatically stop if water levels get too low, and they are connected to an app that records when your cat drank from it, how much they drank, and for how long. It also sends alerts of low water levels, when to change the filter, and when to clean. Both models have been solid over the months I've used them, but I'd check back to see if there are any additional discounts on May 13 and 14.

The RFID Smart Fountain uses a collar tag to monitor which cat is drinking and for how long, so you can compare and track health data. The Petlibro app alerts you when your pet's consumption is down or up, and you can set hydration goals, which the app will let you know have been met or not. This fountain is nearly identical in design to Petlibro's Dockstream Fountain, but has a small hood to better track each pet. This fountain would be especially useful for pet parents of elderly male cats or those who have had health issues or UTIs to more easily monitor and track changes. At less than $100, this is a great deal and costs a lot less than a trip to the vet.

These mats are a lifesaver, especially for dog owners or any pets who are messy eaters. Whether it's spilled water or crumbles of kibble, this mat catches any debris for easy cleanup, and the grippy silicone helps food bowls stay in place to prevent spilling. Normally $20, it's a little pricey for a food mat, but this sale makes it affordable.

This camera is my favorite Pet Camera I've tested. It uses pan rotation for a 360-degree viewing angle, a crystal-clear, 2K HD live video feed, and intelligent infrared night vision. Through the app, you can pan the camera, take photos and record video, talk and listen to your pet through the microphone, schedule repeated regular feedings, or toss them a snack. This camera has motion, bark, and voice detection, and AI auto tracking—meaning when something out of the norm is detected, the app sends you a notification. The Amazon Pet Day deal slashes the price, and our special discount code WIREDMOLLY saves you $74. This is probably the lowest price we'll ever see.

Both the dog and cat version ($149) of this treat-dispensing camera have been a top pick in our pet cam guide for years. It has a clear 1080p and color night vision camera, two-way communication, noise notifications, 360-degree pan abilities, and treat-dispensing. It also has Auto Tracking, which follows your pet to make it easier to find them without having to search your phone screen. The video clips are stored in the cloud so you can review the footage at any time. Both of these cameras are heavily discounted now, but we expect to see prices fall even more on the actual sale days.

I have a fluffy, beautiful (but dumb) cat named Clover whom I've long suspected has some Maine Coon or Norwegian Forest cat in her. I've started testing and am now (eagerly) awaiting the results to see how exactly this purrfect kitty came to be. Testing was easy—all you have to do is register your kit online, swab the cat's mouth with a Q-tip-like instrument, seal it back up, and send it back to the lab in the package, and wait a few weeks for results. It tests for 64 genetic health markers and screens for key dental conditions and analyzes DNA across more than 21 breed types and 4 breed regions. Plus, the report evolves as new research becomes available, so you can always keep an eye on your pet's ever-changing health. I've been wanting to spring for this for a while now, but it's a little pricey—now over $50 off, it's a great time to buy.

This DNA test from Basepaws uses the same methodology as above, but focuses on dogs. You'll just need to swab Fido's mouth, send back results, and wait. It's more comprehensive than the cat test; Basepaws claims it provides more health markers than any other dog DNA test on the market. The tests have health screenings for over 280 genetic markers, trait insights from over 30 physical markers, and a living report with ongoing updates to any health changes. Now under $100, this is a more affordable way to get health insights than a costly trip to the vet.

I swiped my cat, sent the sample back, and got the results delivered straight to my inbox in just a few weeks. With this kit, your cat is compared against over 70 breeds and tested against 45 genetic health tests. Get insights as to their physical features with over 25 trait tests, and blood type identification in case of emergency. Getting insight into my cats' genetic makeup and blood type was not only interesting, but can help me if there's ever an emergency.

Like other DNA tests, Wisdom Panel uses an at-home swab kit where you ship the kit to a lab, where they test and give results online in a few weeks. Wisdom Panel tests for over 265 genetic health conditions, screens for over 365 breeds for an accurate breed report, screens for 51 traits to better understand your dog's appearance, and meet their relatives, where you can see photos, compare DNA results, and send messages.

An attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) who's overseeing a high-profile deportation case in Louisiana says she was stripped of her electronics moments before a pivotal hearing, preventing her from accessing evidence and court records that remained available to the three US government attorneys in the room, each of whom were allowed use of a laptop by the court.

Louisiana immigration judge Jamee Comans ruled late last month that Columbia graduate student Mahmoud Khalil was eligible for deportation. During that hearing, however, Khalil's attorney Nora Ahmed says she was barred from bringing her laptop into the courtroom, despite having filed the proper paperwork in advance and being a frequent visitor to the immigration facility.

“There should not be an advantage, no matter how small or how large, provided to a particular party over the other,” says Ahmed. “Because that starts to infect the proceedings themselves and the notion of fundamental fairness that we all uphold in courtroom proceedings.”

The Justice Department did not respond to a request for comment. Attempts to reach Comans through the Executive Office of Immigration Review (EOIR) were unsuccessful.

The son of Palestinian refugees, Khalil,—a US green card holder—became a key figure last year in the Columbia University protests against the war in Gaza, joining a coalition of student organizations espousing outrage and calling for divestment over the Israeli military's bombings of hospitals, schools, and homes in the wake of the surprise attacks by Hamas-led militants in October 2023. Khalil remains one of the most high-profile targets of the Trump administration's ongoing push to expel foreign students protesting Israel's actions.

The US government has not accused Khalil, whose wife and newborn son were born in the US, of committing any crime. The government acknowledged last month that Khalil had been detained without a warrant due to “exigent circumstances,” claiming the 30-year-old graduate student, whose wife was eight months pregnant at the time, was a “flight risk.”

Following his arrest at his university-owned apartment complex in New York on March 8, Khalil was transported to the Central Louisiana ICE Processing Center, a for-profit prison overseen by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), where he is now subject to a tribunal system that bears little resemblance to the US courts that hear citizens' cases. A majority of people fighting deportation cannot afford—nor do they have any recognized right—to legal representation. (This includes, most glaringly, the tens of thousands of unaccompanied children who enter the US each year.) Political influence weighs heavily on the system, which, nestled under the Justice Department, is invariably subject to the whims of the current occupant of the White House, with its judges serving by appointment of the US attorney general.

In an unusual move, on April 8, Comans booted nearly 600 people attempting to observe one of Khalil's hearings over the court's videoconferencing software, declaring that, going forward, only his attorneys or wife would be permitted to view the proceedings online. Ahmed, legal director of the ACLU of Louisiana, appeared to argue against the enhanced secrecy on April 11.

Electronics in the detention area are strictly forbidden, but Ahmed had filed paperwork the previous night to ensure that when the hearing began, she'd be allowed, as Khalil's legal representative, to enter the courtroom with her laptop in line with EOIR policy. Nevertheless, in a sworn declaration, Ahmed says that minutes before the hearing began she was informed by the detention center staff that, on Comans' instructions, she was forbidden from bringing her devices inside, forcing her to turn over her laptop to the faculty and enter the courtroom empty-handed. Once the hearing began, Khalil says, she sat opposite three Homeland Security attorneys, with each their own laptop.

The Hollywood image of attorneys wheeling stacks of bankers' boxes into court is mostly antiquated, says Ahmed, whose gigabytes worth of trial data are digitally stored. “You effectively are using the technology that you have to be able to respond in real time, or inquire in real time, or to show your client in real time, what evidence the government may be talking about or responding to,” she tells WIRED. “That's always very critical, because you want to make sure that any representation that's being made by the other side is factual.”

Michelle Méndez, an attorney at the National Immigration Project, says the asymmetry in access to technology and resources between the government and non-citizens in court is a reflection of who controls it.

“As long as immigration courts are under the direction of the executive branch, non-citizens are never going to receive a fundamentally fair proceeding,"" she says.

Méndez notes that, since February 2022, the Justice Department has required all immigration attorneys to file documents with the courts electronically, effectively establishing the expectation that attorneys should rely on digital access for court filings, case citations, and other subject matter, rather than risk expensive continuances in notoriously backlogged courts.

""The image of somebody coming in with boxes is definitely apt in those circumstances,"" she says, of the sheer volume of material attorneys would be required to lug around without electronic access. “The worst-case scenario is that the attorney misses out on being able to offer the court whatever it is that the court seeks from them. They don't have it.”

According to Ahmed, both the ICE center's warden, Shad Rice, and Khalil's judge denied ordering the ban, which Ahmed says she received word of only minutes before the hearing began. “When I inquired as to why, I was told that it was the immigration judge that had made the determination,” she tells WIRED. She requested to speak with the judge privately before the hearing, she says, but her request was denied.

Ahmed says Comans eventually informed her that the electronics ban had come at the request of the ICE facility. But when pressed to allow Ahmed to confer with the warden, who was also in the room at the time, the request was denied. “It seemed particularly unjust to Mr. Khalil,” she says, “as he looked at the Department of Homeland Security attorneys who had three laptops at their table.” During the hearing, she adds, the government lawyers were conducting Google searches, writing emails, and reading from papers as the proceedings took place.

In a declaration filed with the court, Ahmed states that she spoke to Warden Rice after the hearing had concluded and that the warden indicated that the judge ""appeared to contradict herself"" when she blamed the faculty at the detention center for denying Amhed access to her devices. Ahmed corresponded with Rice over the following week, working to ensure that the computer ban would not remain in effect.

The warden eventually responded on April 25, saying they'd met with the EOIR, which oversees removal proceedings on behalf of the DOJ. Ahmed was informed there'd be no attempt from the facility to strip her of her devices going forward, but that the judge ultimately held the authority to remove any electronics deemed “a distraction” or inessential to “representing the client.”

In a subsequent motion, Ahmed wrote that the courts had long recognized the obligation of prison officials to refrain from “placing obstacles in the way” of an attorney communicating with a prisoner, adding that the denial of her electronics during the hearing not only contradicted DOJ policy, but “greater notions of fundamental fairness that animate our legal system.”

ICE declined to comment. Warden Rice could not be reached for comment. Christopher Ferreira, a spokesperson for GEO Group, which runs the ICE detention center, says the for-profit prison company follows the guidance handed to it by its government partners: ""Decisions related to access to courtrooms and legal visitation areas at the ICE Processing Centers, where GEO provides support services, are made in consultation with ICE and EOIR.”

Anthony Enriquez, an attorney with RFK Human Rights, says much of what's happening in the Khalil case is emblematic of larger structural issues in the immigration system. “We talk a lot about due process, about how it applies to everyone in the country, whether or not you're a citizen or a non-citizen,” he says. ""But the very procedures and the courts that we use to determine whether or not people do have a right to stay in the United States, there's a fundamental flaw in them where both the prosecutor and the adjudicator are part of the same prosecutorial branch, the executive branch.""

""The judges that are presiding over immigration cases; they're called immigration judges in name,"" he adds. ""But in actual form, they're really just employees of the Department of Justice.""

Second only to Texas in number of detainees, Louisiana's nine immigration detention centers have faced allegations of human rights abuses in recent years, from physical and sexual assaults to medical neglect and bug-infested food. In an August 2024 report, compiled in part by the ACLU itself, the system was described by a coalition of civil rights organizations as an “inhumane” corporate “profit machine,” where “basic human rights are systematically ignored.”

Khalil's case in Louisiana is effectively on hold for much of this month following a ruling by a US District Court judge in New Jersey, who last week shot down the Trump administration effort to stop Khalil from suing the government. In a 108-page ruling, New Jersey District Judge Michael Farbiarz said the government had no authority to prevent the court from reviewing Khalil's claims. Khalil has accused the US government of unlawfully detaining him for political views in violation of the First Amendment.

In a statement, Khalil's wife, Noor Abdalla, a Michigan-born dentist, said the New Jersey ruling had come to her as a relief. “This is an important step toward securing Mahmoud's freedom. But there is still more work to be done,” she says. “I will continue to strongly advocate for my husband, so he can come home to our family and feel the pure joy all parents know of holding your first-born child in your arms.”

My favorite place to wake up is in a sleeping bag, which is good because I tend to wake up a lot when sleeping in a sleeping bag. It's not the bag, it's the pad underneath me. I've tried them all (it's part of my job), and while some are definitely better than others, I've never found one that quite fulfilled every backpacker's dream—a lightweight, packable sleeping pad that feels just like the bed you left at home.

Until now, that is. The Therm-a-Rest NeoLoft sleeping pad isn't the lightest at 25 ounces—goodbye, ultralight readers—but the 4.6-inch cushion is a true luxury, and it offers a great night's rest, which can be more valuable than shedding a few ounces.

There are two problems with carrying a big sleeping pad in the backcountry. First, there's the weight you have to carry, and then there's the amount of room it takes up in your pack. The ultralight community online will try to convince you that camp comfort—that is, your shelter and your sleeping set up—aren't as important as keeping weight down, so you can move fast.

Depending on your goals in the backcountry, that may indeed be true. But after trying it for quite a few trips, I've found it's not the case for me. For me, carrying a little more weight in the form of a heavier tent and sleeping pad affords me a better night's sleep, which helps me (on average) to hike further than I do with less weight but poorer sleep.

Therm-a-Rest's new NeoLoft pad steps into this weight/size/comfort debate by leaning heavily on the side of comfort. It is undeniably big, relative to something like Therm-a-Rest's XLite pads or Sea to Summit's Ether Light series (our two favorite ultralight sleeping pads). For all that, though, the Neoloft isn't that big when packed down, especially considering how big it is when you inflate it.

The NeoLoft reliably packs down to a size that's just larger than a Nalgene water bottle—about an inch bigger around and an inch taller for the regular wide size pad that I tested. It's a tight squeeze fitting the NeoLoft in my Hyperlite Junction 40 with the rest of my gear, but it works for shorter trips where I'm not carrying a ton of food. For trips longer than three or four nights, I'd want a 55L pack. (Naturally, this will depend a lot on the size of the rest of your gear. You can see what I carry at LighterPack.)

I'll confess that I was dreading testing this pad. I didn't want to lug it with me, but when I actually loaded it up … I didn't really notice the extra 8 ounces over the Nemo Tensor I usually carry. Again though, I am not trying to win any ultralight prizes. Rather, I'm looking for the right balance between weight and comfort.

I test organic mattresses for WIRED, and I use roughly the same criteria to judge sleeping pads. Comfort while sleeping comes down to how well your pad keeps you warm, how well it relieves pressure, how well it provides support, and how stable it is to sleep on.

Therm-a-Rest NeoLoft Sleeping Pad

Warmth is regrettably subjective. I sleep hot, so I am generally fine with an R-7 pad even in the depths of Wisconsin winters. I normally carry a Nemo Tensor Trail with an R-value of 3 in summer and fall and am plenty warm with that down to freezing. Unsurprisingly, I was never cold on the NeoLoft even down to one night that hit 15 degrees Fahrenheit on my thermometer.

Internally, Therm-a-Rest has filled the NeoLoft with a trademark word salad of features dubbed ContourCore Matrix, ThermaCapture, and 3D Construction. The 3D construction is what makes the NeoLoft look like a plush car camping pad. It refers to the squared-off edges that come from having vertical sidewalls. This makes for a larger sleeping area, compared to a similar pad where the edges taper off. The NeoLoft gives you full height and excellent firmness all the way to the edge, much like our favorite car camping pad, the Therm-a-Rest MondoKing. There is also a side rail baffle all the way around the pad which acts as a kind of small barrier, helping to keep you on the pad.

ContourCore Matrix is Therm-a-Rest's name for the triangular horizontal baffles running through out the pad. There's two layers of baffles, with the top layer being of a stretchier fabric that helps provide pressure relief, especially for side sleepers. The baffles, combined with the stretch knit top fabric, make this pad so comfortable. The knit top is also excellent for pressure relief and the side baffles also help provide support. I never had this pad “taco” on me.

The ThermaCapture is a reflective coating inside the pad designed to radiate your body heat back up and keep you warmer. Pretty much every pad on the market uses some kind of reflective internal material, with all of them adding to the noise level of the pad. Thankfully, there's enough space here that the NeoLoft is quite quiet. The stretch knit top also helps cut down on that swishy nylon sound. It also makes sleeping on the pad with a quilt much more comfortable. It's not quite Zenbivy-sheet-level comfortable, but it's much better than the awful feeling of sleeping on plasticky nylon. It also does a much better job of keeping you from sliding off in the night.

Therm-a-Rest uses its twin-valve inflation system on the NeoLoft—one valve to inflate, one to deflate, which I happen to like because it saves fiddling with double-function valves. The Neoloft comes with the biggest pump sack I've ever used (54L). It took about 2 minutes to inflate the NeoLoft, about six to seven fills of the pump sack depending on how full you want the pad. It works, but I've long since gone to the motorized side, using a Flextail pump most of the time. The extra size of the NeoLoft does reduce the number of times the Flextail can fill it, though. In my testing, I could only fill the reliably NeoLoft 9 times with the Flextail, compared to 11 for my Nemo pad.

However you inflate the NeoLoft, my one tip would be to experiment with how full you fill it. With 4.6 inches of loft, there's quite a bit of room to remove air and find the most comfortable spot for your body and sleep habits. For me that was around 85 percent full, but even down to about 60 percent I didn't bottom out, which is unheard of in a backpacking pad. Keep in mind that the R-value is for a fully inflated pad. When you don't fill it up all the way, you lose some insulation, so you have to balance that with comfort and support.

Finally, one cautionary note: This is a big pad when inflated. Two would not fit side by side in many of the two-person ultralight tents I've tested, and fully inflated I can't quite sit up in the Hilleberg Akto. At 85 percent inflated, I can sit up in the Akto, so it's not a huge issue. It's just worth making sure that it will fit in your tent before you buy (especially if you're camping with a partner who will also have one).

The Therm-a-Rest NeoLoft is the most comfortable sleeping pad I've ever used. The nearest competition is the Big Agnes Rapide SL Insulated pad, which weights a bit less (17 ounces) with an R-value of 4.8 and thickness of 4.25. It's close on paper. While the Rapide SL is a very nice pad worth considering if you're really counting ounces, the NeoLoft wins when it comes to comfort. I think the NeoLoft is worth the space and weight for those who value a good night's sleep. It's a wonderfully comfortable pad that will have you forgetting that you're sleeping on the ground.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","Influencer Burnout Is on the Rise. A New Mental Health Service Wants to Help","https://www.wired.com/story/influencer-burnout-mental-health-service-creativecare/","Fri, 09 May 2025 10:00:00 GMT","

Jayde Powell doesn't plan on being an influencer forever. In fact, the 32-year-old's goal is to get off social media by the time she's 40.

Powell is also a social media marketing strategist and content creator who posts around one video per day, primarily on LinkedIn. She attends events by brands like Uber and Delta Airlines and advises others on how to land brand partnerships. A few weeks ago, she posted that she'd made over $50,000 in the first quarter of the year.

Despite her success, Powell says she has already suffered the negative effects of being chronically online.

“I just do not think it's OK to be waking up and looking at my phone every morning,” she says, noting she started wearing glasses that filter blue light in 2021 in an effort to relieve the migraines she has suffered from constantly staring at a screen. She admits she's addicted to social media and the dopamine that comes with the highs of engagement.

“It's embarrassing to say, but also it's true.”

Powell sees a therapist about once a month and says the “majority” of her sessions are spent talking about career-related issues, including burnout, the constant pressure to stay relevant in her field, and harassment from the public. While she says most of her creator friends want a therapist, due to the instability of their income “it's almost seen as a luxury.”

CreatorCare, a newly launched telehealth therapy service, aims to bridge that gap by providing sliding-scale therapy that's specifically tailored to people working in the creator economy. The venture—a joint initiative between the telehealth company Revive Health Therapy and the community group Creators 4 Mental Health—will provide people with access to human therapists, with virtual sessions ranging from $60 to $180.

The launch comes as more creators are speaking out about the industry's grind. In February, YouTuber Mr. Beast told host Steven Bartlett on the Diary of a CEO podcast, “If my mental health was a priority, I wouldn't be as successful as I am.” There have also been wider pushes to regulate how these workers are treated by the platforms they populate—and create profit for. A research study on influencers published in the journal Digital Health in 2024 found a “significant association” between extended social media use and heightened negative emotions, with those making less than $10,000 from their posting likely to feel worse.

CreatorCare cofounder Shira Lazar, 42, says although she loves the creativity and community that comes with working in the field, the “fear of disappearing fuels burnout in a system that constantly demands you feed the feeds.” Creators struggle with anxiety, depression, disordered eating, and income that can fluctuate wildly from month to month, she says. Creators can also struggle to form a strong sense of identity outside of who they present as on social media, Lazar says.

At the same time, she points out, it's a highly sought-after career choice, with 57 percent of Gen Z respondents saying they want to become an influencer, according to a 2023 survey by research firm Morning Consult.

Amy Kelly, cofounder of Revive Health Therapy, is a licensed family therapist who sees many creators. She is familiar with many of these issues, likening the growth of the industry to “a machine that's been built with zero maintenance.”

She says influencers and creators can also lose their sense of perspective, due to the constant synthetic connections they're forming online.

“When we are getting these likes and hearts and messages, we get these dopamine responses … It mocks and mimics in real-life interaction,” she says.

But on the flip side, when those comments aren't flattering, it can feel disproportionately bad. “My reaction is going to be heightened versus like a random person on the street shouting some bad words to me,” she says.

It's a problem Powell can relate to. She says she recently was called fat online simply for praising a performance by Beyoncé's daughter, Blue Ivy. When she helped launch a cannabis community for Black women in the industry, she says she was subjected to harassment on X—mostly by other Black people—and was accused of “trying to plant ideas about drug use and the Black community.”

When she's talking to executives, Powell sometimes emphasizes her marketing background rather than her status as an influencer. She says there's “definitely some stigma” around the latter, where it's perceived as “not a real job.”

But that perception is one that's changing, according to Danial Abas, president of the Creators Guild of America. The guild, which formed in 2023, is a nonprofit organization aimed at protecting and advocating for creators and influencers. It is not a union.

“I think that people and businesses don't quite recognize what influence means,” Abas says. “Attention is commerce, and every business requires attention … Creators are ahead of the curve in that they are creating attention for themselves.”

The guild, which says it represents more than 1,000 creators (Abas would not provide an exact number), recently released a “rider,” a set of standards that companies working with creators can adapt and legally comply with. One of the key principles is agreeing to pay creators within 90 days. Abas says lack of payment is a major stressor on creators.

“At a fundamental level, not knowing whether or not you're going to pay rent or your mortgage for work you've already done isn't right,” Abas says, noting that creators are often “not treated as professionals.” In terms of creating legitimacy for the profession, the guild is also looking at establishing accreditation for certain creators and establishing a database called Hue, similar to IMDB, to display their work.

The rider also stipulates that creators own the content they make. Abas says the rider has already been adopted by brands like Whalar and Linktree.

Abas says the guild is not a union because it wouldn't have the leverage of being able to strike, and “requiring payment terms can actually stifle creativity.” Likewise, he says the guild can't yet provide medical benefits to members, who pay $99 a year.

Lazar says she's been in talks with multiple associations to assess how creators might be able to qualify for health benefits, but it's still a work in progress. She's also hoping that others are inspired to follow CreatorCare's suit.

Unlike Powell, she doesn't see an off-ramp for herself and the pull of being a creator—so she wants to improve the conditions for everyone.

“I'm like Joan Rivers; I'll be creating until I die,” she says, “which is why I want to make sure I can thrive.”

Google and nuclear site developer Elementl Power announced this week that they will work together on three sites for advanced nuclear reactors.

The tech company has been rushing to lock up energy sources as its AI ambitions drive growing power demands at its data centers. This year alone, Google plans to spend $75 billion building data center capacity.

With the new deal, Google is promising to add at least 600 megawatts of generating capacity at each of the three sites. Elementl said the reactors will be connected to the grid “with the option for commercial off-take,” meaning that Google can buy power directly. 

Elementl has been operating stealthily until this announcement. The team has experience in the nuclear industry, though it hasn't developed any power plants yet. The company was started by Breakwater North and is backed by Energy Impact Partners.

Elementl is taking a “technology agnostic” approach, meaning that it hasn't decided on which small modular reactor (SMR) company it will work with to develop the projects. There are a number of possibilities, though Kairos Power is a likely frontrunner given its existing deal with Google.

Kairos says its demo plant will generate 50 megawatts of electricity, with an eventual commercial plant producing 150 megawatts split between two reactors.

There's no universally accepted definition, but SMRs tend to top out at 300 megawatts or so. By comparison, the most recently completed nuclear power plant in the U.S., Vogtle Unit 4 in Georgia, generates over 1.1 gigawatts of electricity, nearly four times the size of a large SMR.

Silicon Valley has been smitten by SMRs. Startups have been rushing into the space, promising to slash reactor costs through mass manufacturing enabled by SMRs' smaller size. That, coupled with the promise of 24/7 power that could be sited close to data centers, has pushed them to sign a number of deals with SMR startups, including Oklo, X-Energy, and the aforementioned Kairos.

Yet no SMR has been built outside of China. One startup, NuScale, has gotten close to building one, but it suffered a setback in 2023 when its utility partner canceled its contract after the estimated cost of the project more than doubled — even as the plans were downsized in an effort to contain costs.

Data center operator CoreWeave is reportedly seeking a $1.5 billion debt deal after a disappointing IPO. 

According to the Financial Times, CoreWeave is holding a roadshow this week with bankers at JPMorgan for debt options. The company's executives intend to use the meetings to gauge investor interest.

New Jersey-based CoreWeave listed its shares in March, initially targeting a $2.7 billion fundraise. The company was forced to slash that total to $1.5 billion following investor concern about its large debt burden and a weakening market for AI infrastructure.  

CoreWeave, which has customers including Microsoft, raised $12.9 billion of debt in the past two years to build data centers. The company had about $8 billion of total debt on its balance sheet as of December 2024, and is facing debt and interest payments of $7.5 billion by the end of 2026, the Financial Times previously reported.

TechCrunch has contacted CoreWeave for comment.

Apple is reportedly developing new chips to drive smart glasses similar to Meta's Ray-Ban Meta as well as more powerful Macs and AI servers.

Bloomberg's Mark Gurman notes that one of the chips is inspired by the Apple Watch's low-power processors. Apple aims to put these chips into mass production with TSMC by the end of next year or 2027, according to the report.

Glasses are a big focus. Bloomberg has previously reported that Apple CEO Tim Cook is determined to beat Meta in the glasses market, where the latter has seen success in recent years. Since 2023, Meta has sold around 2 million pairs of Ray-Ban Metas.

According to Bloomberg, Apple is currently exploring non-AR glasses that use cameras to scan the surrounding environment and rely on AI to assist users. One of the processors under development will be able to control these cameras and other components without draining too much battery, per the report.

Updated 7:50 a.m. Pacific: About an hour after this article was published, notifications began working for me again. Your mileage may vary. The original story follows:

Sometime Thursday night, timelines stopped updating for a number of users on X, the social network owned by billionaire Elon Musk.

Many users report that their notifications stopped working yesterday, meaning they aren't being alerted to new posts by the people they follow on X. This reporter is experiencing the issue, as well. My X timeline hasn't updated in 15 hours, since around 6 p.m. Eastern on May 8.

It appears to be a server-side bug. Users affected say that their timelines aren't updating in the X mobile apps or on the web. That's what this reporter is seeing, as well. Switching devices and browsers appears to make no difference, nor does signing up for X's subscription service, X Premium.

Downdetector, a website that provides real-time information about the status of various applications and services, shows a spike in reports of X outages over the last 24 hours. Meanwhile, on Reddit, several threads about the X notifications issue popped up overnight.

“No notifications since about 10 p.m. last night here in Germany!” wrote one user in a thread on X's unofficial subreddit. Another user in the same thread wrote, “I thought that uninstalling and reinstalling the app would work (it didn't).”

X didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.

The last major outage X suffered was in March, when users worldwide were abruptly disconnected from the social network and subsequently had trouble accessing their feeds, sending messages, and engaging with content. Musk, without evidence, blamed the disruption on a cyberattack.

Prior to that outage, X experienced large-scale connectivity issues in December 2022 and July 2023. 

After Musk acquired X, formerly known as Twitter, for $44 billion in 2022, he promptly slashed the company's workforce by about 80%, from 7,500 employees to 1,300 workers. X had just 550 full-time engineers as of January 2023, according to CNBC. A new wave of layoffs hit the company in November 2024, primarily affecting X's engineering department.

A Florida bill, which would have required social media companies to provide an encryption backdoor for allowing police to access user accounts and private messages, has failed to pass into law.

The Social Media Use by Minors bill was “indefinitely postponed” and “withdrawn from consideration” in the Florida House of Representatives earlier this week. Lawmakers in the Florida Senate had already voted to advance the legislation, but a bill requires both legislative chambers to pass before it can become law.

The bill would have required social media firms to “provide a mechanism to decrypt end-to-end encryption when law enforcement obtains a subpoena,” which are typically issued by law enforcement agencies and without judicial oversight.

Digital rights group the Electronic Frontier Foundation called the bill “dangerous and dumb.” Security professionals have long argued that it is impossible to create a secure backdoor that cannot also be maliciously abused, and encryption backdoors put user data at risk of data breaches.

Theta is building self-learning and real-time adaptation for AI agents.

We're starting with an intelligent memory layer so agents can remember and learn from previous interactions. With a simple four-line addition to your existing code, our memory layer uses real-time RL to analyze every run for mistakes and optimizations. The relevant insights are then passed on to your agent during future runs.

We've already improved the accuracy of OpenAI Operator by 43% with 7x fewer steps taken. If you're building AI agents where reliability and speed are priorities, book a meeting here or contact us at founders@thetasoftware.ai.


https://youtu.be/TRNWfhyUI4E







Agents struggle to adapt to complex, real-world workflows. Workflows are dynamic, but agents remain static.

Learning is fundamentally iterative, but agents can't learn because they have no memory across runs.

Theta is building the infrastructure for agents to self-learn and adapt in real-time. The first component is an intelligent memory layer that learns from your agent's previous runs. Just add four lines of code to your agent stack to get started:

Using this memory layer, we were able to improve the accuracy of OpenAI Operator by 43%. With optimized trajectories, Operator also took 7x fewer steps, resulting in better speed and cost.

If you're building agents that need to perform dynamic, real-world workflows at the highest accuracy and speed, reach out to founders@thetasoftware.ai or book some time here.

Additionally, they've failed to make some architectural and delivery decisions which would protect users from various attacks like a server compromise (for example, a server seized by an adversary may send malicious client code that conducts a document exfiltration), as well as document exfiltration via a malicious browser extension. Both of these can be mitigated somewhat by delivering the frontend as a desktop app or signed browser extension, and setting reasonable CSPs in the decryption modules. This is exactly the reason Signal doesn't offer a web app.Cryptpad does offer the ability to additionally encrypt documents with shared passwords, and this offers a fair modicum of greater protection against document interception. But this isn't the default document mode, so I doubt most documents are password-protected in practice.I did share all of the above with the Cryptpad team, and was told they don't intend to address the above issues, so I'd recommend against putting to much faith in them for the time being.

There's another way of sharing in cryptpad though, which is for each user to create an identity/account.
Once those you're collaborating with have accounts, documents and folders can be shared by granting access within cryptpad's UI. No secrets have to be circulated.

Using a browser without extensions installed would prevent against extension-based exfiltration.The only way to prevent against a malicious server would probably be to build the frontend yourself and use it with the server (I haven't tried doing this)

Is “My microbes made me do it” a valid legal defense?

A few years ago, a Belgian man in his 30s drove into a lamppost. Twice. Local authorities found that his blood alcohol level was four times the legal limit. Over the space of a few years, the man was apprehended for drunk driving three times. And on all three occasions, he insisted he hadn't been drinking.

He was telling the truth. A doctor later diagnosed auto-brewery syndrome—a rare condition in which the body makes its own alcohol. Microbes living inside the man's body were fermenting the carbohydrates in his diet to create ethanol. Last year, he was acquitted of drunk driving.

Scientists have been looking for health-promoting microbes in the feces of people from traditional communities—some of whom feel exploited.

His case, along with several other scientific studies, raises a fascinating question for microbiology, neuroscience, and the law: How much of our behavior can we blame on our microbes?

Each of us hosts vast communities of tiny bacteria, archaea (which are a bit like bacteria), fungi, and even viruses all over our bodies. The largest collection resides in our guts, which play home to trillions of them. You have more microbial cells than human cells in your body. In some ways, we're more microbe than human.

Microbiologists are still getting to grips with what all these microbes do. Some seem to help us break down food. Others produce chemicals that are important for our health in some way. But the picture is extremely complicated, partly because of the myriad ways microbes can interact with each other.

But they also interact with the human nervous system. Microbes can produce compounds that affect the way neurons work. They also influence the functioning of the immune system, which can have knock-on effects on the brain. And they seem to be able to communicate with the brain via the vagus nerve.

If microbes can influence our brains, could they also explain some of our behavior, including the criminal sort? Some microbiologists think so, at least in theory. “Microbes control us more than we think they do,” says Emma Allen-Vercoe, a microbiologist at the University of Guelph in Canada.

Researchers have come up with a name for applications of microbiology to criminal law: the legalome. A better understanding of how microbes influence our behavior could not only affect legal proceedings but also shape crime prevention and rehabilitation efforts, argue Susan Prescott, a pediatrician and immunologist at the University of Western Australia, and her colleagues.

“For the person unaware that they have auto-brewery syndrome, we can argue that microbes are like a marionettist pulling the strings in what would otherwise be labeled as criminal behavior,” says Prescott.

Auto-brewery syndrome is a fairly straightforward example (it has been involved in the acquittal of at least two people so far), but other brain-microbe relationships are likely to be more complicated. We do know a little about one microbe that seems to influence behavior: Toxoplasmosis gondii, a parasite that reproduces in cats and spreads to other animals via cat feces.

The oral microbiome is being linked to everything from metabolic disease to Alzheimer's.

The parasite is best known for changing the behavior of rodents in ways that make them easier prey—an infection seems to make mice permanently lose their fear of cats. Research in humans is nowhere near conclusive, but some studies have linked infections with the parasite to personality changes, increased aggression, and impulsivity.

“That's an example of microbiology that we know affects the brain and could potentially affect the legal standpoint of someone who's being tried for a crime,” says Allen-Vercoe. “They might say ‘My microbes made me do it,' and I might believe them.”

There's more evidence linking gut microbes to behavior in mice, which are some of the most well-studied creatures. One study involved fecal transplants—a procedure that involves inserting fecal matter from one animal into the intestines of another. Because feces contain so much gut bacteria, fecal transplants can go some way to swap out a gut microbiome. (Humans are doing this too—and it seems to be a remarkably effective way to treat persistent C. difficile infections in people.)

Back in 2013, scientists at McMaster University in Canada performed fecal transplants between two strains of mice, one that is known for being timid and another that tends to be rather gregarious. This swapping of gut microbes also seemed to swap their behavior—the timid mice became more gregarious, and vice versa.

Microbiologists have since held up this study as one of the clearest demonstrations of how changing gut microbes can change behavior—at least in mice. “But the question is: How much do they control you, and how much is the human part of you able to overcome that control?” says Allen-Vercoe. “And that's a really tough question to answer.”

After all, our gut microbiomes, though relatively stable, can change. Your diet, exercise routine, environment, and even the people you live with can shape the communities of microbes that live on and in you. And the ways these communities shift and influence behavior might be slightly different for everyone. Pinning down precise links between certain microbes and criminal behaviors will be extremely difficult, if not impossible. 

“I don't think you're going to be able to take someone's microbiome and say ‘Oh, look—you've got bug X, and that means you're a serial killer,” says Allen-Vercoe.

Spatial Speech Translation addresses one of automatic translation's biggest challenges: lots of people speaking at the same time.

Imagine going for dinner with a group of friends who switch in and out of different languages you don't speak, but still being able to understand what they're saying. This scenario is the inspiration for a new AI headphone system that translates the speech of multiple speakers simultaneously, in real time.

The system, called Spatial Speech Translation, tracks the direction and vocal characteristics of each speaker, helping the person wearing the headphones to identify who is saying what in a group setting. 

“There are so many smart people across the world, and the language barrier prevents them from having the confidence to communicate,” says Shyam Gollakota, a professor at the University of Washington, who worked on the project. “My mom has such incredible ideas when she's speaking in Telugu, but it's so hard for her to communicate with people in the US when she visits from India. We think this kind of system could be transformative for people like her.”

While there are plenty of other live AI translation systems out there, such as the one running on Meta's Ray-Ban smart glasses, they focus on a single speaker, not multiple people speaking at once, and deliver robotic-sounding automated translations. The new system is designed to work with existing, off-the shelf noise-canceling headphones that have microphones, plugged into a laptop powered by Apple's M2 silicon chip, which can support neural networks. The same chip is also present in the Apple Vision Pro headset. The research was presented at the ACM CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems in Yokohama, Japan, this month.

Over the past few years, large language models have driven big improvements in speech translation. As a result, translation between languages for which lots of training data is available (such as the four languages used in this study) is close to perfect on apps like Google Translate or in ChatGPT. But it's still not seamless and instant across many languages. That's a goal a lot of companies are working toward, says Alina Karakanta, an assistant professor at Leiden University in the Netherlands, who studies computational linguistics and was not involved in the project. “I feel that this is a useful application. It can help people,” she says. 

They could help wearers focus on specific voices in noisy environments, such as a friend in a crowd or a tour guide amid the urban hubbub.

Spatial Speech Translation consists of two AI models, the first of which divides the space surrounding the person wearing the headphones into small regions and uses a neural network to search for potential speakers and pinpoint their direction. 

The second model then translates the speakers' words from French, German, or Spanish into English text using publicly available data sets. The same model extracts the unique characteristics and emotional tone of each speaker's voice, such as the pitch and the amplitude, and applies those properties to the text, essentially creating a “cloned” voice. This means that when the translated version of a speaker's words is relayed to the headphone wearer a few seconds later, it sounds as if it's coming from the speaker's direction and the voice sounds a lot like the speaker's own, not a robotic-sounding computer.

Given that separating out human voices is hard enough for AI systems, being able to incorporate that ability into a real-time translation system, map the distance between the wearer and the speaker, and achieve decent latency on a real device is impressive, says Samuele Cornell, a postdoc researcher at Carnegie Mellon University's Language Technologies Institute, who did not work on the project.

“Real-time speech-to-speech translation is incredibly hard,” he says. “Their results are very good in the limited testing settings. But for a real product, one would need much more training data—possibly with noise and real-world recordings from the headset, rather than purely relying on synthetic data.”

Gollakota's team is now focusing on reducing the amount of time it takes for the AI translation to kick in after a speaker says something, which will accommodate more natural-sounding conversations between people speaking different languages. “We want to really get down that latency significantly to less than a second, so that you can still have the conversational vibe,” Gollakota says.

This remains a major challenge, because the speed at which an AI system can translate one language into another depends on the languages' structure. Of the three languages Spatial Speech Translation was trained on, the system was quickest to translate French into English, followed by Spanish and then German—reflecting how German, unlike the other languages, places a sentence's verbs and much of its meaning at the end and not at the beginning, says Claudio Fantinuoli, a researcher at the Johannes Gutenberg University of Mainz in Germany, who did not work on the project. 

Reducing the latency could make the translations less accurate, he warns: “The longer you wait [before translating], the more context you have, and the better the translation will be. It's a balancing act.” 

The new general AI agent from China had some system crashes and server overload—but it's highly intuitive and shows real promise for the future of AI helpers.

What the firm found challenges some basic assumptions about how this technology really works.

The country poured billions into AI infrastructure, but the data center gold rush is unraveling as speculative investments collide with weak demand and DeepSeek shifts AI trends.

We're starting to get a better sense of how chatbots are affecting us—but there's still a lot we don't know.

In another unhinged social media rant, President Donald Trump once again demonstrated that words really don't mean anything anymore. This time, Trump directed his ire at a Biden-era program intended to bridge the digital divide. On Truth Social, Trump announced his intention to end the Digital Equity Act while labeling it as “racist” and “unconstitutional”.

In 2021, former president Joe Biden passed the Digital Equity Act as part of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. It provided $2.75 billion to establish three federal grant programs administered by the National Telecommunications and Information Administration. Per the agency, DEA's aim is to ensure that everyone “[has] the skills, technology, and capacity needed to reap the full benefits of our digital economy.” Think digital skills and workforce training,  promoting high-speed internet access in rural and tribal areas, and improving accessibility for disabled people.

Per the New York Times, $60 million went to funding states' and territories' programs, including in rural areas like Indiana, Alabama, Arkansas, Iowa, and Kansas. But of course, anything from Biden's administration can't continue. On Thursday, Trump wrote that he and Secretary of Commerce, Howard Lutnick, were in agreement about the DEA. He wrote, “No more woke handouts based on race! The Digital Equity Program is a RACIST and ILLEGAL $2.5 BILLION DOLLAR giveaway.” He added that he plans to end it “IMMEDIATELY”.

There's no need to give Trump an ounce of credence anytime he calls something racist. You wouldn't entertain a member of the National Socialist German Workers' Party telling you what constitutes anti-semitism, right? Or, to echo the words of Sen. Patty Murray (D-WA), who authored the bill: “As usual, the President has no idea what he's talking about.” That being said, it's still important to note that the DEA only mentions race once when saying that the program can cover racial or ethnic minorities. The law also has a general nondiscrimination clause that mentions race, but that's taken from the Civil Rights Act of 1964 so… Go beef with that.

In her statement, Murray added, “It's absolutely insane that resources meant to help red and blue communities — everyone from local school districts and libraries to workforce training programs and Tribes — close the digital divide will be illegally blocked because the President doesn't like the word equity. Americans are sick and tired of extremist right-wing culture wars being forced down our throats.”

The digital divide includes not only the ability to access devices or the internet but also a lack of skills to navigate them, poor infrastructure, etc. As more of our world moves online with tele-health appointments, digital applications for jobs or benefits, online schooling like during the pandemic, and etc, it's a pressing issue. But since DEA is so young, it hasn't had a chance to do much of anything yet. In fact, a chunk of funding announced on Jan. 6 and Jan. 17 of this year has yet to be distributed, and the Trump administration froze funding in April.

The National Digital Inclusion Alliance was one group impacted by the freeze. In a statement, NDIA said that out of its subgrantees' 13 programs waiting for funding, one would have served over 30,000 in the next five years alone. It added, “Now, a Truth Social post has put ours and 65+ other community-based digital trust inclusion programs at risk, and real people are about to pay the price.”

“This decision has no policy rationale and makes no economic sense,” the NDIA continued. “Cutting this funding will deepen the divide and force greater costs down the road.”

It's not clear if Trump has taken any concrete steps to end the DEA outside of posting on social media. But as with his administration's many other attempts to freeze federal funding, Trump's decision could be taken up in court if he makes any further moves.

Radar screens that monitor Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey went completely black for about 90 seconds early Friday morning, according to a new report from ABC News. The outage comes after an identical problem last week when air traffic control screens for the same airport went dark for about 60-90 seconds.

The radar outage for Newark on Friday happened at 3:55 a.m., the FAA told Gizmodo over email. Air traffic control for Newark is handled in Philadelphia, where the actual screen outage occurred.

“There was a telecommunications outage that impacted communications and radar display at Philadelphia TRACON Area C, which guides aircraft in and out of Newark Liberty International Airport airspace,” the FAA said in a statement. A private plane was reportedly told to stay at or above 3,000 feet during the incident to avoid any possible collisions, according to ABC.

Newark has been plagued with problems recently, including delays and terrifying outages. When screens went black on April 28 the scene was so harrowing that at least half a dozen air traffic controllers have requested mental health support. Their “trauma leave” will allow them to take a break from work for up to 45 days.

Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy held a press conference on Thursday, warning that air traffic control systems need to be upgraded. And he recognized that Newark was a bad case, just a day before this morning's outage. “If we don't actually accomplish the mission that we're announcing today, you will see Newarks, not just in Newark, you'll see Newarks in other parts of the country because it's an aging system,” Duffy said on Thursday.

Duffy's press conference was extremely odd and opened with the Transportation Secretary calling President Donald Trump, putting him on speakerphone, and holding the phone up to the microphone. Duffy said he wants to build six new air traffic control centers and replace old equipment, noting that his systems still use copper wire rather than “We use radar from the 1970s. Some of them are from the '80s, but most of them are from the '70s,” Duffy stressed.

Duffy noted that there has been “decades of neglect” to America's air traffic infrastructure, with a “patchwork of fixes” and “partial funding.” And while that's true, it costs real money to upgrade entire systems, something the former reality TV show host didn't provide specifics about, only noting it will cost “billions.” Duffy will need to ask Congress for money to invest in air traffic control systems, something that might be difficult in a political landscape where Republicans only want to cut funding for essential services.

Duffy himself was in Congress as a representative from Wisconsin during those “decades of neglect,” and at least seemed to accept some of the blame with a smirk on his face. “You can blame me for that, I was in Congress as well.”

Turns out, it's a lot easier to obstruct funding of important infrastructure for America than to rally spending on it. So we'll see if Duffy and his buddy Trump can get some serious money allocated.

Americans have quickly learned that tariffs—”the most beautiful word in the dictionary,” according to Trump—are not, in fact, “going to make us rich as hell.”

As we watched the POTUS slap higher and higher tariffs on imported goods—especially from China, which faces tariffs as high as 145%—consumers are the ones hurting the most. Almost everything is now more expensive than it was a month ago—tech, in particular. For example, DJI increased the price of its popular Osmo Pocket 3 vlogging camera by over 50%, from $519 to $799, and Microsoft raised Xbox Series S and X consoles by $100 and jacked up game prices to $80. Naturally, people are freaking out and panic buying not just essentials like pantry staples or toilet paper, but anything and everything that will get pricier soon.

Gizmodo staff aren't immune to impending price hikes. Here's what some of us have panic-bought recently.

Kyle Barr, Consumer Tech Reporter:

Back in early April, I told anybody who would listen that they should buy their gadgets ASAP before they became too expensive. I took my own advice and jumped on two retro handhelds, a TrimUI Brick and a BatlEXP G350. Both individually cost under $50 when I ordered through the dropshipping site AliExpress. With the end of de minimis exemptions on low-value imports from China and lingering 145% tariffs on Chinese goods, those devices will necessarily cost far more when you try to order some of the latest emulation-focused devices. I'm heartbroken by the impacts tariffs have had on the board game industry, and I've been trying to support my favorite creators by running my local brick-and-mortar shop to buy Arcs: The Blighted Reach from Leder Games and Stonemaier Games' Fishspan. There's a little voice in my head whispering I shouldn't be spending this kind of money when we're facing an impending recession, but tariffs were a big reason I spent half the morning on April 24 refreshing GameStop's store page just to preorder a $500 Switch 2 bundle.

Rose Pastore, Gizmodo Editor-in-Chief:

Japan's sunscreen technology is light-years ahead of what's FDA-approved in the U.S., and my sensitive-skin family has been using Japanese spf for years. I can usually find my favorite sunscreens (Biore UV Aqua Rich Watery Essence and Skin Aqua UV Super Moisture Gel) for around $12 a tube at local Japanese markets. I have no idea how tariffs will affect their price—or the ability to easily find them at all—so earlier this week I hurried over to Teso Life to stock up. I also bought several of my favorite ultra-soft Japanese toothbrushes (Lion Systema), which are adult-sized but have bristles that feel like the baby toothbrushes you find in the U.S.

Sabina Graves, io9 Staff Reporter:

After finding out that tariffs would impact party supplies right after the closure of Party City locations, I decided to preemptively buy as much as I could for my daughter's first birthday in August. So I went to Shein for their Strawberry Shortcake collaboration for party favors, and a few other retailers with options in theme for decor. Seeing all the back and forth with online shops right now with raised taxes due to tariffs made me glad I planned early, but the uncertainty of where resources will come from is stressful.

Raymond Wong, Gizmodo Senior Editor, Consumer Tech:

Unlike my colleagues, I haven't jumped the gun and panic-purchased anything yet. But I'm very close to pulling the trigger on a few Game Boy modding kits from FunnyPlaying. The boutique modding shop hasn't announced any price increases (only that shipping times may take longer) for its popular DIY component swaps (IPS displays, lithium-ion batteries, shell and button replacements). But the fact these parts ship directly from China means they could be subject to up to 145% tariffs. Trump's administration is reportedly hoping to lower tariffs on Chinese imports to “below 60%,” according to Bloomberg, but who can be sure if and when that might happen? It's not just third-party Game Boy parts that I fear may become too costly because of tariffs, but any niche DIY hobby, like mechanical keyboard customizations, where it's often a small operation (if not a single-person one) selling very specific small-batch products, may become too expensive to partake in. The worst-case scenario is that these small businesses become unsustainable and they're forced to quit altogether, and the products simply disappear overnight—and the vibrant online communities of tinkers with them.

What about you, loyal Gizmodo reader? Have you panic-purchased anything, and why? More than any year, because of the uncertainty of tariffs, it feels like doing your birthday, anniversary, or holiday shopping early is a good idea, and could save you a ton of money.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:gizmodo.com","The Internet's Funniest Jokes About the Chicago Pope","https://gizmodo.com/the-internets-funniest-jokes-about-the-chicago-pope-2000599904","Fri, 09 May 2025 12:20:24 GMT","

The new Pope was announced at the Vatican on Thursday as Robert Prevost, a Chicago-born missionary who will be the first American pope in the Catholic Church's history. The 69-year-old Prevost will take the name Leo XIV, and the internet at large responded with basically two types of reactions: 1) the far-right conservatives who whined that Leo was a “woke Marxist,” and 2) all the other normal people who were just making jokes about the Pope being from Chicago.

Pope Leo has been on Twitter since 2011 and has a history of tweets that are now being dissected by online sleuths and political operatives to determine if he's a Good Pope or a Bad Pope. And while trying to map a Catholic leader's politics to fit an American understanding of the political landscape is silly on many levels, that hasn't stopped people from trying, especially since Leo has tweeted criticism of Vice President JD Vance's views on Catholicism and retweeted criticism of President Donald Trump's views on immigrants.

Those tweets have caused people like conspiracy theorist Laura Loomer to melt down, writing “WOKE MARXIST POPE” in response to one of Leo's old tweets from 2015 about Trump's anti-immigrant rhetoric. Mike Cernovich, a far-right Pizzagate conspiracy theorist who was invited to the White House after Trump took office, called the new pope, “a shitlib who was given a title by the Lavender Mafia to sow division in my country.”

But that's enough about whiners on Twitter. What about the jokes? The good, old-fashioned American tradition of making jokes about the Second City—whether it's deep dish pizza, hot dogs, or the Bears? Well, there's been plenty of that too. And below we've got some of our favorites.

 

“Chicago Pope” is like a 1994 SNL sketch. Airs at 12:20am, the only gag is that Chris Farley has a mustache and is doing a big accent. David Spade and the guest host (Joe Mantegna) keep breaking during it.

Folks who sport bald heads—like me—know that finding a truly comfortable gaming headset can be an expensive struggle. I have had to eschew a number of what would be high-quality earphones from companies like SteelSeries and Corsair just because they chafe against my scalp's bare skin. As a possible remedy, Razer promises its Clio audio-blasting head cushion will keep my noggin free of a headband and still give me access to high-quality, headset-level audio.

Razer has a running obsession with both immersive audio and gaming chair accessories. Combining both into the $230 Clio is supposed to create a personalized audio experience when you're sitting by your lonesome self in your favorite gaming chair. The device includes near-field dual speakers that should direct audio directly to your ears. It should be available starting May 16.

The device has twin 43mm drivers with support for THX Spatial Audio and supports three EQ modes for gaming, movies, or music. You can also set it as either the primary speaker or rear speaker for a 7.1 setup. Razer suggests combining the Clio with other surround sound speaker systems, like Razer's own Nommo line, to make you feel like you're being blasted on all sides with your game's audio.

The Clio wraps around your gaming chair's headrest and connects via Razer's 2.4 GHz Hyperspeed Wireless—which means dealing with the brand's obtuse and intrusive Synapse 4 software—or over Bluetooth. The cushion itself is made from memory foam, and it should fit onto most high-back gaming chairs with a single strap.

Battery life is rated at up to 14 hours of battery, though you could have it plugged in continuously via USB-C. At CES 2025, I suggested to Razer it should consider adding power passthrough to its gaming chairs, such as with its Arielle concept cooling and heating gaming chair. That way, players could have one cable running from their seat with the ability to plug in all the accessories Razer wants to stick behind players. There's the Razer Freyja haptic cushion that requires its own separate plug, and now with Clio, players shouldn't need to keep remembering to plug in their seats alongside all their other expensive peripherals.

It isn't the first time Razer has positioned itself as the king of headset-less 3D audio. Razer promoted 2023's Leviathan V2 Pro soundbar with built-in headtracking as the best way to get spatial sound from the front.  There were even those age-old Mako speakers that sought to hit you with strong sound from all sides. The deciding factor with Clio will be how well it sounds when you dare to reposition your head away from the headrest. A quality pair of headphones like Razer's own $180 Kraken V4 don't have that problem, and after using them for a while, they still seem like the better option for most people without sensitive scalps. I have found other headsets like the Alienware Pro Wireless remain comfortable enough for long periods of play.

I find the gaming chair to be a very lonely place. Even when I'm playing online with friends, I can't sit still in one anymore. I end up with my legs curled underneath me like a dying spider, and my head is stretched a distance away from the neck rest. Maybe Razer's audio cushion can make my gaming chair a place I'll enjoy lounging in again.

America's biggest cities are slowly sinking—and not just the ones near the ocean, according to a study published today in the journal Nature Cities. The satellite-based study shows that all 28 U.S. cities with over 600,000 people are subsiding, putting infrastructure in fast-growing urban areas increasingly at risk.

Researchers used satellite data to investigate the vertical land movements in large U.S. cities, finding that all of them are sinking to some extent. Groundwater extraction seems to be the most common culprit, and its impact on land movement has direct implications for the infrastructure in the country's most populated neighborhoods.

“As cities continue to grow, we will see more cities expand into subsiding regions,” Leonard Ohenhen, lead author of the study and a postdoctoral researcher at Columbia Climate School's Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, said in a university statement. “Over time, this subsidence can produce stresses on infrastructure that will go past their safety limit.”

Ohenhen and his colleagues used recent satellite data to map vertical land movement in the U.S.'s most populated cities, analyzing it in systematic 90-square-foot (28-square-meter) grids. While many people have heard that large coastal cities such as New Orleans are sinking, the study reveals that even municipalities far inland—including Denver, Oklahoma City, and Fort Worth—are subsiding.

Overall, the results show that in 25 of the 28 cities analyzed, at least two-thirds of the land is sinking. Houston is the fastest sinking metropolis, with over 40% of its land dropping more than 0.20 inches (5 millimeters) every year—and 12% subsiding at twice that speed. Cities including New York, Las Vegas, Washington D.C., and San Francisco also have relatively small but fast-sinking zones.

This contributes to differential motion: regions sinking at different speeds, or some regions subsiding while others uplift. This uneven movement can endanger infrastructure by causing buildings to tilt.

While only around 1% of the documented areas are experiencing strong enough differential motion to impact infrastructure, these regions tend to be the most urbanized, accounting for around 29,000 buildings. According to the study, one in 45 buildings in San Antonio are at high risk, as are one in 71 in Austin, one in 143 in Fort Worth, and one in 167 in Memphis. An even more detailed study would be needed to assess the specific risk for individual buildings, Ohenhen said in the statement.

“Unlike flood-related subsidence hazards, where risks manifest only when high rates of subsidence lower the land elevation below a critical threshold, subsidence-induced infrastructure damage can occur even with minor changes in land motion,” the authors wrote in the study. Nevertheless, sinking land is generally more vulnerable to floods.

By analyzing groundwater extraction alongside vertical land movements, the researchers determined that this activity is responsible for 80% of the documented subsiding. That's because when humans remove water from aquifers—layers of porous rock that hold groundwater—the pores can collapse, lowering the land surface above it. The researchers argue that this phenomenon will only worsen in some areas because of elements such as population growth (meaning increasing water needs) and climate-driven droughts.

There are also other forces at play, however. Some sinking areas are still recovering from the bulging caused by long-gone ice age glaciers in North America's interior. The monumental weight of buildings might also impact some cities' land movement (cough cough, New York).

Ultimately, the researchers hope their study will inspire a push for mitigation efforts, which could include land raising, building retrofitting, and updated construction codes.

“As opposed to just saying it's a problem, we can respond, address, mitigate, adapt,” Ohenhen concluded. “We have to move to solutions.”

A bug, or a feature?

The first benchmark results of Nvidia's GB10 Superchip for compact AI workstations in Geekbench 6 have been published. While the processor promises serious performance for AI applications, its compute capabilities seem relatively modest. The CPU trails behind Apple's entry-level M3 and Qualcomm's higher-end Snapdragon X Elite system-on-chip (SoC), and we are not even talking about high-end offerings. It should be noted that we are talking about a pre-release product running on Windows 11 Enterprise Insider Preview.

Nvidia's GB10 Superchip system-in-package (SiP) comprises a Grace CPU packing 10 high-performance Arm Cortex-X925 cores (at up to 3.90 GHz) and 10 energy-efficient Cortex-A725 cores, as well as a Blackwell GPU that can deliver 1 PetaFLOPS of FP4 compute performance for AI applications. The SiP has a 256-bit memory interface for 128 GB of unified LPDDR5X memory with an up to 273 GB/s bandwidth (so, the memory capabilities of the SiP are the same as in the case of Apple's M4 Pro).

Arm's Cortex-X925 core, clocked at 3.90 GHz, delivers fairly strong single-threaded performance, achieving a Geekbench 6 single-thread score of 2,960. This puts GB10 nearly on par with Qualcomm's Snapdragon X Elite and close to Apple's M3, which were launched in 2024 and 2023, respectively. Both processors are known for their high IPC performance, and since we are talking about a processor for an AI workstation here, single-thread performance matters.

However, by today's standards, roughly 3000 points in Geekbench 6 single-thread benchmark is a good, but hardly an outstanding result. Apple's M4, AMD's Ryzen 9950X, and Intel's Core Ultra 9 285K offer considerably higher single-thread performance despite having a significantly slower memory subsystem. Unlike Apple's M4 Pro, which has a 256-bit LPDDR5X memory subsystem with a massive 273 GB/s bandwidth, Nvidia's GB10 is 33%, or 1,000 points behind.

Of course, a 20-core configuration implies strong multi-thread performance. However, GB10's score of 10,682 points in Geekbench 6 is modest at best. The unit is behind Apple's M3 (which has eight cores) and is 39% behind Apple's M4 (which has 10 cores). Nvidia's GB10 also falls short of Qualcomm's 12-core Snapdragon X Elite's score of 15,654 and is dramatically behind Apple's M4 Max or AMD's Ryzen 9 9950X CPUs, all of which score above 20,000.

Such a poor result of Nvidia's GB10 may indicate that its Cortex-A725 efficiency cores contribute less to the overall score, or do not work at all due to issues with scheduling, which could be solved by Windows 11 or Nvidia microcode update. Alternatively, this may mean that GB10, in its current form, is not optimized for CPU-heavy workloads and is not delivering maximum performance in AI applications under strict power envelopes and thermal budgets of compact platforms like Nvidia's DGX Spark.



This assumption makes sense when considering GB10's general role as a solution for compact AI workstations. In AI workloads, the CPU is often relegated to scheduling, data staging, and light preprocessing tasks rather than being the primary computational driver. Hence, the CPU design prioritizes good-enough general-purpose performance while minimizing power draw and die area.

However, if we look more broadly, the situation seems mixed. Nvidia officially outlined its client PC processor ambitions by announcing its GB10 Superchip for compact AI workstations earlier this year at CES. However, a rumor is that the company will formally announce its N1 and N1X processors for desktop and laptop PCs at Computex later this month. The CPU configuration of N1 and N1X SoCs is expected to resemble that of GB10, so their compute capabilities will be close to GB10's. However, for now, GB10 does not impress in Geekbench 6 under Windows 11.

In summary, while Nvidia's GB10 CPU delivers modest single-thread performance that is compatible with Apple's M3, Qualcomm's Snapdragon X Elite X1E-100, and Intel's Core Ultra 5 235, it shows clear limits in multi-core scalability. This trade-off may either result from using a pre-release Windows 11 Enterprise Insider Preview or may even be intentional, given GB10's role in AI-centric workstations. Also, remember that Geekbench is an artificial benchmark, and the real-world performance of Nvidia's GB10 may be far more competitive.

When it comes to password hacking, the RTX 5090 is anywhere between 33% and twice as fast as the RTX 4090.

The RTX 5090 is not only good for gaming and AI — it also excels at password cracking. Hive Systems updated its password cracking benchmark suite with 12 RTX 5090 graphics cards — Nvidia's fastest and best graphics card for gaming currently, and found all twelve cards working together can break simple eight-character passwords in under 15 minutes.

Hive Systems is in its 5th year of benchmarking password cracking times on GPUs; the last update they made was in 2024, featuring the RTX 4090. Rather than cracking an actual password itself, the outlet cracks hashes, which are scrambled versions of reproducible text generated by software.

Hashes are a popular method for securing customer passwords against hackers by storing customer passwords as hashes on servers. When hackers go to steal a password database from a company's server that is secured with hashing, all they will see are hashes of the passwords they represent rather than the actual passwords themselves.



Cracking passwords with this method involves making a list of all possible combinations of characters to make a password, then matching them to a stolen database featuring password hashes. Graphics cards are particularly good at this methodology due to highly parallelized computing capabilities.

With 12 RTX 5090s, Hive Systems found Nvidia's latest flagship can crack the hash equivalent of eight-character passwords featuring numbers only in just 15 minutes. Passwords comprised of eight lower-case letters, the dozen RTX 5090s were able to crack in 3 weeks.

On the other end of the spectrum, passwords taking advantage of numbers, upper and lowercase letters would take 12 RTX 5090s 62 years to crack, and 164 years to crack with symbols added into the mix.

For a generation-on-generation perspective, a single RTX 5090 can crack a numerical-only password hash with eight characters in three hours. A single RTX 4090 can accomplish the same task in four hours, representing a 33% performance improvement for the RTX 5090 over the RTX 4090 in this specific scenario.

However, as the password complexity increases, the RTX 5090 becomes faster and faster in comparison. Moving up to a hash representing an eight-character password made up of numbers, upper and lowercase letters combined with symbols, the RTX 5090 is allegedly twice as fast as the RTX 4090. But cracking a password that complex would take the RTX 5090 a millennium to accomplish.

Hive Systems' research demonstrates the dangers of low complexity passwords and how adding just a bit of complexity in the form of symbols, capitalized letters, and numbers can make a huge difference for security. The good news is that cracking hashes in the way Hive Systems demonstrates requires hackers to have a stolen database of password hashes in the first place. Without this, hackers can't brute-force hack password hashes.

This LLM will unlock the possibilities with your LEGO bricks.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


A research team from Carnegie Mellon University built an AI model called LegoGPT that outputs valid LEGO designs from text inputs. According to the team's research paper that's posted on GitHub, they trained “an autoregressive large language model to predict the next brick to add via next-token prediction,” but the key takeway is that the AI LLM creates LEGO designs from scratch.

The AI was trained on a dataset with more than 47,000 LEGO structures that build over 28,000 unique 3D objects, including bookshelves, tables, chairs, cars, ships, guitars, and more. This was then used to train the AI model, allowing it to create unique and original designs solely from text inputs.

The tool is available for free on GitHub, and you can pair this with a computer vision model or image processing AI. For example, you can take a photo of your available LEGO bricks and let the AI give you a multitude of unique options for building with what you already have.

The team added a validity check and physics-aware rollback during autoregressive inference, ensuring that the final output will always be valid (i.e., no overlapping bricks) and stable (i.e., no floating bricks). Furthermore, LegoGPT's final output can be built by both humans and robots.

This is how the team created the dataset — StableText2Lego — used to train LegoGPT: a text prompt input is first converted into a ShapeNetCore mesh. This is then plugged into a 20 x 20 x 20 voxel grid from which the initial LEGO brick layout is determined.

This layout is then varied while still keeping the overall shape, and then unstable designs are filtered out from the final output. Those left are then rendered in 24 different viewpoints, and then GPT-4o is used to generate descriptions for the final output.



This is how it creates a new design through text: LegoGPT converts the text into a LEGO design, which is then converted into text tokens ordered from bottom to top. Instructions are then created to pair the structured LEGO bricks with annotations explaining the design, so that the AI will understand the relationships between the text prompt and the physical bricks.

From there, LegoGPT predicts the next brick needed to build the design using an autoregressive model. That means it will verify a brick's validity at each step, checking if it is well-formatted, exists in the library, and does not overlap with existing bricks. This will continue until the design is completed, after which its stability is tested.

If the AI determines that the output is unstable, it will roll back to the last stable state and continue generating from that point. Once it gets a stable final output, then the design is complete.



If you want to play with the AI yourself, the team released its dataset, code, and models, making it easier for anyone to fork the team's work. One development we can see is if someone converts this into a downloadable AI app with a customizable brick library.

All the fun of RISC-V packaged up for AI-powered edge computing.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Fans of RISC-V, the open source ISA, can finally get their hands on DeepComputing's DC ROMA RISC-V AI PC. The release also includes an option to buy the DC-ROMA RISC-V Mainboard II as a replacement for the Framework Laptop 13. As of writing, the PC is listed for $399 and is currently sold out. However, the mainboard replacement option is still in stock and listed for $359.

This PC is intended for those who want more customization potential, which perfectly suits this modular AI PC. Even at its core, it relies on a RISC-V AI SoC with SiFive P550 CPU cores. It can produce up to 50 TOPS for AI edge computing with 40 TOPS coming from its integrated NPU. The DC-ROMA RISC-V Mainboard II replacement is $50 more expensive than anticipated, but its release date is also much earlier.

This RISC-V-based CPU is a 64-bit processor with a total of 8 cores. It's hardly the fastest on the market, reaching up to 2.0 GHz, but it's plenty for handling various edge AI applications. There are a few options available to customize the storage options, with the cheapest being no storage at all and ranging in capacity from 256GB to 1TB.

As far as graphics are concerned, it features an integrated Imagination GPU which outputs to a 13.5-inch monitor, although a sold-out 14-inch option is available on the product page.

Less memory, less problems with regulators?

Nvidia plans to introduce a cut-down version of its HGX H20 AI processor in China by July, aiming to retain access to the market after U.S. officials effectively barred the original version through updated export regulations, Reuters reports. According to preliminary information, the revised AI GPU will feature less onboard HBM memory to comply with newly imposed technical limits and replace the previously approved model.

Among the changes of the new AI GPU is reduced memory capacity, which will affect the ability of the processor to train large language models with tens and hundreds of billions of parameters, one Reuters source noted. In addition, the final performance characteristics may be adjustable depending on how end customers configure the HGX GPU modules, potentially enabling minor flexibility despite the overall downgrade.

In April, U.S. authorities restricted sales of AMD's Instinct MI308, Nvidia's HGX 20, and some other AI processors to China (including Hong Kong and Macau) due to unpublished export regulations. As a result, AMD and Nvidia had to write down inventory worth billions of dollars ($5.5 billion for Nvidia, $800 million for AMD) as export licenses for goods bound for China are reviewed with a presumption of denial.

However, to sustain access to the critical market, Nvidia is now incorporating a set of downgrades to ensure it stays within the permissible thresholds set by the U.S. government. Nvidia has already communicated these plans to major customers in China's cloud computing sector.

If the information about the downgraded HGX H20 processor is correct, it will be Nvidia's third Hopper-based GPU designed specifically for China that relies on cut-down H100 silicon. It is noteworthy that there is no word on Blackwell-based AI products for China.

After the U.S. government imposed its first set of restrictions on AI and HPC GPUs exported to China in 2022, Nvidia built its H800 processor with reduced networking capabilities. The H800 only represented a minor performance downgrade compared to the original H100. After the U.S. administration imposed new export rules that restricted the performance of processors shipped to China, Nvidia developed its HGX H20 based on the H100 for AI training as well as L20 PCIe and L2 PCIe cards based on the AD104 GPUs for AI inference.

The decision-making process is a fundamental activity in the medical field. It translates into diagnosis, treatment selection, examination choices, provision of relevant information, follow-up scheduling, or the decision not to intervene.

In recent years, decision-making processes in medicine have faced increasing pressure to comply with regulatory standards such as evidence-based medicine, patient-centered care, and patient safety. This context has made medical decision-making cognitively more intense, with internists making an average of 15.7 decisionsduring each patient visit. Consequently, for physicians operating in high-complexity clinical settings with heavy workloads and significant cognitive demands, the quality of their decisions may be compromised owing to fatigue resulting from repeated decision-making processes.

Decision fatigue (DF) refers to the concept that making decisions is mentally taxing and impairs the quality of subsequent decisions. It is hypothesized that humans have a finite cognitive reserve for decision-making, and as this reserve depletes, executive function and self-control diminish, ultimately affecting the decisions that follow.

DF is of particular concern in medicine because of the critical nature of the decisions made by physicians and the potential consequences of suboptimal decision-making. In clinical practice, decision fatigue has been linked to various outcomes related to sequential decision-making processes, often concerning the timing or order of appointments.

Notable examples include increased rates of antibiotic prescriptions later in the day, more conservative surgical recommendations with increased case prescriptions just before lunch, and a higher likelihood of physicians prescribing painkillers, such as opioids, later in the workday.

However, most studies available to date have utilized retrospective observational designs, lacking preregistration or external validation. Additionally, the definitions of DF are often vague or inconsistent, resulting in weak cumulative evidence despite numerous reports on its effects. 

A systematic review and meta-synthesis summarized the existing literature on DF in medicine, focusing on its definitions, determinants, and implications for clinical practice while attempting to address some unresolved questions.

DF has been broadly defined as a reduced capacity to make decisions and regulate behavior following repetitive decision-making tasks. Although qualitative studies have not directly investigated DF, many have indirectly explored its impact on physician performance or patient outcomes.

DF has been described as a consequence of cognitive overload, time pressure, acts of omission, and interprofessional disagreements.

No qualitative study has analyzed DF by asking participants to define it or by observing its cognitive, emotional, or behavioral components. Nonempirical articles have examined the concept of DF more directly than empirical studies, describing its possible determinants and associated outcomes. 

These studies have shown that DF includes ego depletion, physical fatigue, burnout, and repeated or difficult decision-making. Other contributing factors include workload, dysfunctional work environment; implementation of new procedures; and pressure from colleagues, patients, and their families.

At the individual level, risk factors include ego depletion or willpower exhaustion, where repeated DF depletes mental resources; self-perceived medical errors, which can increase stress and anxiety; uncertainty and inherent risks in medical practice; ethical challenges requiring careful reflection; and emotional challenges such as dealing with patient suffering or death. Female sex and residency status were notable sociodemographic risk factors. At the contextual level, the healthcare environment plays a crucial role, with high patient volumes, time pressure, inadequate support, and organizational culture exacerbating the pressure on healthcare professionals, making them more prone to DF.

Protective factors against DF include various individual, sociodemographic, and contextual elements. At the individual level, effective communication skills, effective coping strategies, empathy and compassion, trust in one's instincts, motivation, a strong professional identity, the ability to seek advice, self-control and awareness in DF, high self-esteem, and tolerance for ambiguity contribute to greater resilience. At the sociodemographic level, being male, maintaining good mental health, a good quality of life, and good sleep quality were protective factors. At the system level, communication and ethics training, collaborative work environments, decision-making support tools, autonomy, professional experience, and a safe work culture provided resilience against DF.

Clinical DF is a complex and multifaceted phenomenon with significant implications for clinical practice and patient outcomes. No current study has comprehensively defined clinical DF within a theoretical framework supporting hypotheses or research questions or provided a definition that could be used systematically. 

The analysis of risk and protective factors for clinical DF has identified contextual and individual factors with interrelated psychological dimensions. Given the results of this review, it is plausible to assert that clinical DF is a multifaceted cognitive and motivational process that influences a physician's decision-making capacity, driven by contextual and individual factors. These, in turn, are closely linked to psychological distress and an increased risk for errors in healthcare.

SAN DIEGO — In treating pancreas divisum, the common use of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) with minor papilla endoscopic sphincterotomy showed no significant benefit over a sham procedure, suggesting that patients can be spared the intervention, which can carry risks of its own.

“This is a topic that has been debated for decades,” said first author Gregory A. Coté, MD, Division Head, professor of medicine, Division of Gastroenterology & Hepatology, Oregon Health & Science University, in Portland, Oregon.

“Many doctors believe the procedure helps and offer it because we have limited options to help our patients, whereas others believe the procedure is harmful and doesn't help,” he explained in a press briefing for the late-breaking study, presented at Digestive Disease Week (DDW) 2025.

The study's findings supported the latter argument.

“Patients who underwent ERCP with sphincterotomy were just as likely as those who did not have this procedure to develop acute pancreatitis again,” Coté reported.

While clinical guidelines currently recommend ERCP as treatment for pancreas divisum, “these guidelines are likely to change based on this study,” he said.

Pancreas divisum, occurring in about 7%-10% of people, is an anatomic variation that can represent an obstructive risk factor for acute recurrent pancreatitis.

The common use of ERCP with minor papilla endoscopic sphincterotomy to treat the condition is based on prior retrospective studies showing that in patients who did develop acute pancreatitis, up to 70% with the treatment never developed acute pancreatitis again. However, there have been no studies comparing the use of the treatment with a control group.

Coté and colleagues conducted the multicenter SHARP trial, in which 148 patients with pancreas divisum were enrolled between September 2018 and August 2024 and randomized to receive either ERCP with minor papilla endoscopic sphincterotomy (n = 75) or a sham treatment (n = 73).

The patients, who had a median age of 51 years, had a median of 3 acute pancreatitis episodes prior to randomization.

With a median follow-up of 33.5 months (range, 6-48 months), 34.7% of patients in the ERCP arm experienced an acute pancreatitis incident compared with 43.8% in the sham arm, for a hazard ratio of 0.83 after adjusting for duct size and the number of episodes, which was not a statistically significant difference (P = .27).

A subgroup analysis further showed no indication of a treatment effect based on factors including age, diabetes status, sex, alcohol or tobacco use, or other factors.

“Compared with a sham ERCP group, we found that minor papillotomy did not reduce the risk of acute pancreatitis, incident chronic pancreatitis, endocrine pancreatic insufficiency or diabetes, or pancreas-related pain events,” Coté said.

The findings are particularly important because the treatment itself is associated with some risks, he added.

“Ironically, the problem with this procedure is that it can cause acute pancreatitis in 10%-20% of patients and may instigate other issues later,” such as the development of scarring of the pancreas related to incisions in the procedure.

“No one wants to offer an expensive procedure that has its own risks if it doesn't help,” Coté said.

Based on the findings, “pancreas divisum anatomy should no longer be considered an indication for ERCP, even for idiopathic acute pancreatitis,” he concluded.

AMSTERDAM — A once daily, 50 mg dose of efruxifermin reduced fibrosis at 96 weeks in patients with compensated cirrhosis due to metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) compared with placebo, but it did not significantly reduce fibrosis at 36 weeks (primary endpoint), according to results from the phase 2b SYMMETRY trial.

Efruxifermin is a long-acting, bivalent fibroblast growth factor 21 analogue. At 96 weeks of treatment, a statistically significant 29% of patients had at least one stage of fibrosis improvement without MASH worsening (secondary outcome) compared with 11% on placebo. 

Results also suggested improvements in MASH-related histologic findings, non-invasive markers of liver injury and fibrosis, as well as markers of glucose and lipid metabolism at 96 weeks. Now the 50 mg dose of efruxifermin is being investigated in phase 3 development. 

Academic-clinician Mazen Noureddin, MD, MHSc, of the Sherrie and Alan Conover Center for Liver Disease and Transplantation at Houston Methodist Hospital, Texas, presented the findings here at the at the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) Congress 2025. The work was published simultaneously in The New England Journal of Medicine.

Noureddin said that, for the first time, they showed “significant, unprecedented improvement in fibrosis” on the regimen. He added that the “histologic improvement in fibrosis corroborated with non-invasive tests, presenting an overall picture of liver injury and function that suggests liver health is maintained or slightly improved by efruxifermin compared to placebo.”

Despite being a major cause of liver failure and transplantation, there are currently no approved therapies that reverse fibrosis in MASH-related cirrhosis. Efruxifermin has shown antifibrotic effects in earlier studies of patients with less advanced disease (F2-F3 fibrosis). Now, this phase 2b, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial, shows efficacy and safety with efruxifermin in patients with MASH who had biopsy-confirmed compensated cirrhosis at stage 4 fibrosis. 

SYMMETRY was conducted across 45 sites in the US, Mexico, and Puerto Rico. It enrolled 181 adults with biopsy-confirmed compensated cirrhosis due to MASH (Child-Pugh A), 80% of whom had diabetes and obesity. Patients were at high risk for hepatic decompensation.

Participants were 18-75 years of age, had liver histologic features consistent with MASH, and had compensated cirrhosis (stage 4 fibrosis with a Child-Pugh score of 5 or 6). They also had type 2 diabetes or two components of metabolic syndrome comprising obesity, dyslipidemia, elevated blood pressure, and elevated fasting glucose level. Approximately 80% of the patients had biopsy-confirmed MASH.

Patients received weekly subcutaneous efruxifermin (28 mg or 50 mg) or placebo in a 1:1:1 ratio. Liver biopsies were obtained at weeks 36 and 96 and were included in the intention-to-treat and safety analyses. Overall, liver biopsy data were available for 154 patients at week 36 and for 134 patients at week 96.

The primary endpoint comprised a reduction of at least one stage of fibrosis without worsening of MASH at week 36, while the same measure comprised the secondary outcome at week 96. 

At 36 weeks, in the intent-to-treat analysis, a reduction in fibrosis without worsening of MASH was seen in 8/61 patients (13%) in the placebo group, 10/57 patients (18%) in the 28 mg efruxifermin group (95% CI, -11 to 17; P = .62), and 12/63 patients (19%) in the 50 mg efruxifermin group (95% CI, -10 to 18; P = .52). 

Referring to the 36-week completer analysis, Noureddin reported, “We see here, 24% in the 50 mg group compared with 14% in those on placebo [and 22% on the 28-mg dose]. When they continue treatment up to 96 weeks, we saw up to 39% improvement [50-mg dose] in fibrosis by one stage without worsening of MASH compared to 15% placebo [and 29% with 28 mg]. This is a difference of 24% [between placebo and 50 mg] that was statistically significant [P < .01],” he reported. 

In the intent-to-treat analysis, at week 96, a reduction in fibrosis without worsening of MASH occurred in 7/61 patients (11%) in the placebo group, in 12/57 patients (21%) in the 28 mg efruxifermin group (95% CI, -4 to 24), and in 18/63 patients (29%) in the 50 mg efruxifermin group (95% CI, 2-30). “It was up to 29% in the 50 mg compared with 11%, and that's an 18% statistically significant difference [P < .05].”

The proportion of week 36 responders who sustained response to week 96 were 50% (n = 4), 67% (n = 6), and 75% (n = 9), in the placebo, 28 mg, and 50 mg groups, respectively. Expanded response (non-response at week 36 but response at week 96) was 8% (n = 3), 19% (n = 6), and 26% (n = 9) respectively.

“This emphasizes the role of ongoing treatment in cirrhotic patients,” said Noureddin. He also added that they saw “consistent responses across multiple baseline subgroups for the primary histological endpoint and at week 96 with the 50 mg.”

Nearly all participants (99% on efruxifermin and 97% on placebo) reported adverse events. Any serious adverse events were reported in 26%, 24%, and 18% in the 28 mg, 50 mg, and placebo groups, respectively. Gastrointestinal side effects were most common: diarrhea (42%, 54%, and 30% on 28 mg, 50 mg, and placebo, respectively), nausea (30%, 46%, 30%, respectively), and increased appetite (16%, 40%, 7%, respectively) and mostly of mild-to-moderate nature. Administration-site reactions (erythema) were also more common with efruxifermin (13%, 16%, and 6%, respectively). After week 36 and prior to week 96, discontinuations due to adverse events were 0%, 2%, and 3% in the placebo, 28 mg, and 50 mg, respectively. “After week 36, there were very few discontinuations due to side effects,” reported Noureddin. 

Poor bone health is a common complication of cirrhosis, and across all treatment groups, 43% of participants had osteopenia at baseline, but only 4% were treated with bisphosphonates. Placebo-adjusted, significant relative reductions in bone mineral density (-5%) for spine and hip were observed for both treatment groups at week 96 or about 2%-3% per year. The number of participants experiencing fractures was equal across all treatment groups, added Noureddin.

Commenting on the study, delegate and chairman of the Global NASH Council, Zobair M Younossi, MD, professor and chairman of the department of medicine at Inova Fairfax Medical Campus, Fairfax County, Virgina, told Medscape Medical News, “The key to this whole area is that there are treatments that have been developed for non-cirrhotic MASH, F2 and F3, but there is currently nothing that is positive for people with cirrhosis and MASH. This study shows there is improvement in all categories even in those with diabetes and even when they are controlled for some alcohol consumption.” He added, “I think that the best aspect of this is that it gives us a potential treatment for those patients who are at highest risk for bad outcomes in MASLD, which are those with cirrhosis.” 

The study was supported by Akero Therapeutics. Noureddin declared grants, consultant roles, and stock options from many pharmaceutical companies, including Akero. Younossi reported no relevant financial relationships. 

The findings were presented during a dedicated session on AI and hepatology, May 8, 2025, at the EASL Congress 2025.

 May 09, 2025  

The annual switch to daylight saving time (DST) in many parts of the world is detrimental to public health and should be abolished in favor of permanent standard time (ST), Canadian researchers wrote in a recent editorial.

The policy of turning clocks forward by an hour in the spring causes “discrepancies between the circadian biological clock and the environmental light-dark cycle,” leading to “social jet lag,” noted lead author David Dongkyung Kim, MD, assistant professor of geriatric psychiatry at the University of Toronto, Toronto, and colleagues.

The Viewpoint was published on April 29 in JAMA.

“DST is a policy that affects the lives of millions of people, but the potential benefits do not seem to outweigh the potential harms to public health,” Kim told Medscape Medical News.

“Clear evidence in the medical literature as well as widespread expert consensus [shows] the acute transition of the clock time in the spring has been associated with increased myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, and atrial fibrillation admissions,” he added. “But it is not only the sudden change in the clock that is the issue. ST is more aligned with our natural circadian rhythms, and chronic misalignment has been associated with many negative health effects.”

Canada first initiated DST during World War I. The rationale was to add more light to waking hours, thus saving energy. Today, only Saskatchewan and Yukon have abolished the time change, staying on permanent ST. Ontario passed legislation in 2020 to change to permanent DST, but it was contingent on Quebec and New York doing likewise, said Kim.

“Many studies seem to show an acute worsening of health with the spring transition, but not the fall transition, suggesting the health issues are due not only to acute changes in clock time but also to the discrepancy between clock time and circadian rhythm,” the authors noted. “Although many studies suggest increased traffic crashes due to DST transition, others do not show this connection,” they added. And findings on DST transition and mental health risks such as unipolar depression, manic episodes, and suicide are also mixed.

“The main argument I hear for establishing permanent DST is that it is nicer to see the sun set later in the day,” said Kim. “To that, I respond that you can use your own volition to wake up an hour earlier without forcing permanent DST on the entire population.”

Late evening light, which DST makes possible, disrupts the natural seasonal adjustment of circadian rhythms. The misalignment between one's personal schedule and the circadian rhythm, which is called social jet lag, is well understood. It is associated with negative outcomes such as obesity, heart disease, metabolic syndrome, and depression.

In a position statement, the Canadian Sleep Society called for abandoning DST, and there is “global consensus from sleep and chronobiology experts on this matter,” said Rébecca Robillard, PhD, a clinical neuropsychologist and associate professor of psychology at the University of Ottawa, Ottawa. Robillard, who did not contribute to the editorial, also leads clinical sleep research at the University of Ottawa Institute of Mental Health Research at the Royal Ottawa Mental Health Centre and is co-chair of the Canadian Sleep Research Consortium.

“Considering the impacts that this practice has on a large range of health and safety issues, we should abolish DST and stick to ST all year around,” she told Medscape Medical News. “Time change goes beyond gaining or losing an hour of sleep; it perturbs our biological clock, which results in population-wide increases in heart attacks, strokes, infections and immune diseases, digestive problems, pregnancy and childbirth complications, and a deterioration in mental health. It's not a question of opinion or personal preference, but of public health and scientific evidence.”

Kim and Robillard reported having no relevant financial relationships.

 May 09, 2025  

Ever since The Pitt debuted on MAX earlier this year, emergency room (ER) personnel across the country, from registered nurses to residents to doctors, are talking about this hit medical show starring ER's Noah Wyle.

The realism of The Pitt — the first episode begins in the 7:00 AM hour and the next 14 shows are an hour-by-hour day in the life of a chaotic ER at the fictional Pittsburgh Trauma Medical Hospital — is what has rung the truest.

This is especially evident in the topics the show has covered, from fentanyl overdoses and teen abortion to the emergency department (ED)'s response to an active shooter situation, which occurs during the 6:00 PM episode.

“What really struck a chord of what it means to work in an ER department is that all of us have had a case like one on the show, a similar conversation with a patient, and had to blow off some steam,” Matthew Harris, MD, a pediatric ER doctor at Cohen Children's Medical Center, Northwell Health, Queens, New York, told Medscape Medical News. “The medicine resonates, but the moments resonate even more so.”

That's the exact reaction Joe Sachs, MD, The Pitt's executive producer, was hoping for when he signed on to work on the streaming series.

Medscape continually surveys physicians and other medical professionals about key practice challenges and current issues, creating high-impact analyses. For example, the Medscape Emergency Medicine Physician Mental Health & Well-Being Report 2025 found that

“The reason I love emergency medicine is that you have to think quickly when you're presented with a new problem,” said Sachs, who went to film school during medical school before working on ER first as a technical advisor, later writing 35 episodes, and eventually becoming a producer of the long-running TV drama. “It's cognitively challenging, and you have to have amazing humanistic skills — you have to establish immediate rapport with a stranger.”

To ensure the accuracy of The Pitt, Sachs has a team of seven doctors on hand (and on set) to make sure every procedure and protocol is depicted as realistically as possible. In addition, the show differs from others in its unvarnished look at such issues as boarding, long wait times, and what it's like to be uninsured and unhoused.

“In the first 5 minutes of the show, you see this crazy waiting room and all of the challenges that exist to provide good care even when healthcare providers are motivated, compassionate, and want to provide the best care,” Sachs said. “We also wanted to show how the system can work against you.”

For some ED doctors, however, the show initially hit a little too close to home.

“When I was halfway through the first episode, I was like why am I watching this. I feel like I'm at work,” Solomon Knicely, DO, medical director and division head of the Emergency Medicine at the Henry Ford Health in Sterling Heights, Michigan, said. “My colleagues had the same impression. It was painful to watch.”

Still, Knicely said he was compelled to keep watching and eventually got “hooked” on the show.

“I hate medical shows in general, but what the characters said, did, and talked about on The Pitt made it less annoying,” he added. “You can tell they have doctors writing for the show. The situations are pretty close to spot on.”

The one thing he questioned was the sheer volume of chaos in each episode. While that might make for good TV, this didn't quite reflect his day-to-day experiences, he said.

“We've all had days where it's insane and ridiculous, but to have every shift be that hectic — it felt like I was watching a board review show,” Knicely said. “A lot of the cases on The Pitt happen once, twice, or never in your career, and on the show, they all came in in one day.”

The inclusion of these many storylines was deliberate, Sachs said.

“I've joked with my colleagues that in 15 episodes, we've done every procedure in Roberts & Hedges, the gold standard text for emergency medicine,” he said. “That's not quite true, but we've certainly showcased a very large part of the emergency medicine curriculum you'd get over 4 years.”

For Sachs, it has been very satisfying getting feedback about the show via social media. Many of the comments he's read have touched him, too.

“Emergency healthcare workers are writing to us telling us that they're finally able to explain what they do to their friends and family,” he said. “They also say they've been in denial about how much PTSD [posttraumatic stress disorder] they have since COVID, and that because of the show, they're seeking help.”

Others have written to the team to thank them for drawing attention to certain diseases.

“I just got an email yesterday about the first measles case that was identified in Hawaii a few weeks ago,” he said. “I was told that the medical personnel recognized it because they saw it on The Pitt.”

With season 2 currently in the works, Sachs hopes the show continues to be a realistic portrayal of how incredibly versatile and experienced emergency healthcare workers are.

“Emergency departments are open 24/7 for anyone regardless of their ability to pay, and it's really important to know that the ER is the safety net, especially with talk of cuts to Medicare and Medicaid,” Sachs said.

The goal, too, is to tell good stories and continue shining a spotlight on how committed ER physicians and staff are to their work.

“We want to keep showing the humanity of healthcare providers,” Sachs said. “They may not be perfect, but they care deeply about the lives of their patients.”

 May 09, 2025  

For some patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), summer can be one of the most stressful times of the year. Not only is allergy season in full swing, but rising temperatures and humidity can prompt COPD flare-ups. 

Major changes in humidity levels can lead to worsening symptoms for those with COPD. While winter weather tends to trigger coughing and phlegm, during the summer, patients with COPD generally experience increased fatigue and shortness of breath. This is because humid air is dense and contains a higher concentration of water vapor, which, in turn, makes it more challenging to breathe.

According to a 2023 survey of 36 patients, there was a significant connection between temperature and humidity and patients with COPD; high humidity contributed to worsening COPD symptoms.

The connection between rising temperatures and increased shortness of breath for patients with COPD stems from the fact that hot temperatures require the body to work harder to stay cool. For example, when inhaling hot air, airways can become inflamed. This increased workload on the lungs and heart makes it difficult for patients to breathe efficiently.

Heat can also contribute to dehydration, which often thickens mucus, making it more challenging for airways in the lungs to remain clear. In addition, many patients have COPD alongside asthma, both of which can be exacerbated by an increase in allergens in the air.

“As the weather gets warmer, pollen increases, too, so this makes breathing worse for COPD patients,” said Norman Edelman, MD, pulmonologist at Stony Brook University Hospital in Stony Brook, New York.

Cold and flu can trigger COPD symptoms, and there is sizable evidence indicating that environmental pollution — such as smog — can irritate the lungs. 

“During the summer months, there's often an increase in air pollution,” said Daniel R. Ouellette, MD, chief of pulmonary and critical care medicine at Henry Ford Health in Detroit. “With more particulates in the air, COPD patients will experience worsening symptoms.”

There can also be greater risk for heart failure among patients with COPD as higher temperatures soar.

“If your COPD is severe to begin with, and it gets worse due to some sort of offending agent, this puts a burden on the heart, and some patients can experience heart failure when their COPD is exacerbated,” Edelman said.

However, the specific reason for the link between COPD flare-ups and heart failure remains unclear.

“We have seen some evidence that during heat waves, there's increased mortality among COPD patients who also have cardiovascular disease,” Ouellette said. “This may relate to stress on the heart, and we know that respiratory issues can lead to increased mortality, but the reason why this occurs isn't completely clear.”

To avoid exacerbating warm weather symptoms, patients with COPD should spend as little time outside as possible during the hottest times of the day. Patients should also routinely check the heat index — including humidity and ozone levels — before venturing outdoors. When outside, extreme exertion should be avoided. 

When indoors, consider advising patients to keep their homes air-conditioned and mold- and dust mite–free, since these allergens can further irritate the lungs and worsen COPD symptoms.

“Air conditioning does two things: It ensures that you're not getting overheated, and it keeps outdoor pollutants from taxing your lungs,” Edelman said.

While no studies have definitively linked improved symptoms with the use of humidifiers or air purifiers, there's no downside to using these devices if either improves airway breathing, according to Ouellette. Patients should be sure to clean and maintain these products regularly.

It's also essential to drink plenty of water during the hotter months. The hotter it is outside, the more taxing temperatures are on the body, which responds by sweating and losing fluids.

Finally, patients should be sure to keep track of any respiratory symptoms and utilize inhaled medications as directed by their pulmonologist.

“[Patients should] always stay in touch with [their] healthcare providers,” Ouellette said. “This is especially critical if we need to make changes to [their] medication to better handle seasonal changes.”

Prenatal cannabis use was associated with 75% higher odds of low birth weight, 52% increased odds of preterm birth, and 57% greater odds of small for gestational age births.

“Our results may help guide patient counseling and harm reduction strategies and shape future public health policies focused on prenatal cannabis use,” the authors wrote.

This study was led by Jamie O. Lo, MD, from the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at the Oregon Health and Science University in Portland, Oregon. It was published online on May 5 in JAMA Pediatrics.

This study did not include information on the mode of delivery, time of day, frequency, dosing strength, or duration of cannabis use during pregnancy. The researchers also could not account for severe nausea and vomiting during pregnancy, which can also increase the risk for low birth weight, preterm birth, and restriction of fetal growth.

Cataract surgery was not associated with an increased risk for postoperative endophthalmitis or serious systemic adverse events in patients with diabetes, even when preoperative A1c levels were poorly controlled and exceeded 11.3%.

“Our findings suggest that preoperative A1c alone should not be a reason to cancel cataract surgery,” the authors wrote.

“A1c should be utilized as measure to inform wider control of hyperglycemia- and diabetes-related systemic comorbidities and that delaying cataract surgery on the numerical basis of elevated A1c is not necessary,” they added.

This study was led by Zain S. Hussain, MD, and Ahmed F. Shakarchi, MD, MPH, from the Harvey and Bernice Jones Eye Institute at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences in Little Rock, Arkansas. It was published online on May 3, 2025, in American Journal of Ophthalmology.

The retrospective design limited the ability of this study to infer causality. Small sample sizes in certain subgroups of A1c resulted in wide CIs for some outcomes, potentially limiting the precision of findings. The control group of patients with diabetes who did not have a diagnosis of cataract may have been healthier, introducing selection bias.

No funding was reported by this study. The authors reported having no relevant conflicts of interest.

 May 09, 2025  

The European Medicines Agency (EMA) has confirmed that suicidal ideation is a potential side effect of finasteride and urged healthcare professionals to advise patients to stop treatment and seek medical advice if they experience depressed mood, depression, or suicidal thoughts.

The advice follows an EU-wide review launched in February of available data on finasteride and dutasteride by the EMA's Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee (PRAC). The review of the benefit-risk balance was undertaken following notification by France of a referral under Article 31 of Directive 2001/83/EC, based on pharmacovigilance data. It followed a warning by the UK's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency in April 2024 that a comprehensive safety review prompted by patient concerns had revealed possible psychiatric and sexual side effects.

PRAC said that it had assessed data from clinical trials, EudraVigilance (the European side effects database), and studies and case reports in the scientific literature, as well as information from patients, relatives, healthcare professionals, academics, and patient and consumer organizations. 

EudraVigilance revealed 325 relevant cases of suicidal ideation (313 for finasteride and 13 for dutasteride) considered either probably or possibly related to treatment, most of which related to patients treated for alopecia. However, PRAC pointed out that this was in the context of an estimated exposure of around 270 million patient-years for finasteride and around 82 million patient-years for dutasteride.

In conclusion, the committee confirmed suicidal ideation as a side effect of finasteride 1 mg and 5 mg tablets, although it said that the frequency was unknown. A link between suicidal ideation and dutasteride was not established on the basis of the reviewed data, but because dutasteride works in the same way, information about the mood changes seen with finasteride would be added to dutasteride's product information as a precautionary measure, as it already is for finasteride. 

However, the committee concluded that the benefits of both finasteride and dutasteride continued to outweigh their risks for all approved uses.

Finasteride is an androgen blocker that acts as a competitive inhibitor of human 5-alpha reductase, an intracellular enzyme that metabolizes testosterone into the more potent androgen dihydrotestosterone. It is used to treat androgenic alopecia in males via 1 mg tablets and cutaneous spray, whereas finasteride 5 mg tablets and dutasteride 0.5 mg capsules are used to treat benign prostatic hyperplasia. 

The EMA said that most cases of suicidal ideation were reported in people using 1 mg finasteride to treat male hair loss, and patients should be advised that they should stop treatment and seek medical advice if they experience mood changes. The product information for the 1-mg oral dose will now also alert patients to the need to seek medical advice if they experience problems with sexual function (such as decreased sex drive or erectile dysfunction) that have been reported to contribute to mood alterations and suicidal ideation in some patients. A patient card will be included in the 1-mg finasteride package to remind patients of these risks and to advise them about the appropriate course of action. 

The review found no evidence linking suicidal ideation to finasteride skin sprays, and no new information is being included in their product information.

In the EU, finasteride- and dutasteride-containing medicines are available under various trade names, including Adadut, Androfin, Andropecia, Avodart, Capila, Combodart, Duodart, Dupro, Duster, Dutaglandin, Dutalosin, Dutascar, Finahair, Finapil, Finapuren, Finaristo, Finpros, Finural, Fynzur, Gefina, Propecia, Proscar, Prosmin, Prosterid, and Tadusta.

 May 09, 2025  

In the 11 years since it was approved for the treatment of melanoma, pembrolizumab (Keytruda) has become the go-to for adjuvant or neoadjuvant therapy for advanced melanoma, despite the potential for side effects, which can be severe and occur in more than half of all patients. Oncologists need to weigh the risk of those side effects against the strong evidence supporting the effectiveness of pembrolizumab to improve survival. More often than not, those scales tip toward using the drug to treat advanced melanoma, experts say.

Evidence has accumulated about which types of patients may be more susceptible to drug-related toxicities, how oncologists and other providers in the multidisciplinary team can manage those toxicities, and which treatment protocols may be most effective.

Today, pembrolizumab is indicated for the treatment of about 20 types of cancer, but the first indication for which the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved it was advanced or unresectable melanoma in people who had already tried ipilimumab and a BRAF inhibitor if their tumors had a BRAF mutation. It was the first immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) targeting programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) approved by the FDA.

While it has been shown to extend life expectancy in melanoma and other types of cancers compared with ipilimumab, an anti–cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4), and other older treatments, the side effects of pembrolizumab have been well-documented, particularly higher-grade toxicities (grades 3-5).

Researchers who have studied the drug told Medscape Medical News that years of experience have demonstrated pembrolizumab is safe to use in just about any patient with advanced melanoma.

The approval for pembrolizumab for advanced melanoma was based on the phase 3 KEYNOTE-006 trial, which found that the overall survival rate at 33 months was 50% vs 39% in patients on pembrolizumab vs ipilimumab. The rate of grade 3-5 adverse events (AEs) in the trial was 13%-16% for those on pembrolizumab and 20% for those on ipilimumab. A 10-year follow-up of the KEYNOTE-006 trial reported an overall survival rate of 34% for those on pembrolizumab and 23.6% for those on ipilimumab.

“I think you can consider trying it in any patient,” Omid Hamid, MD, chief of Research and IM/Oncology at Cedars-Sinai The Angeles Clinic and Research Institute, Los Angeles, and co-author of a safety evaluation published last year of almost 9000 patients in 31 clinical trials of pembrolizumab, said.

Exceptions may be reinitiating pembrolizumab in a patient who had to halt treatment after a life-threatening AE or any patient with connective tissue disease or who has had a transplant, Hamid said.

The 2024 safety evaluation included patients with advanced melanoma in the pivotal phase 3 KEYNOTE-006 trial. The study also identified other patient conditions that may give oncologists pause before using pembrolizumab: Anemia, pneumonia, hematologic malignancies, myocarditis, and gastric bleeding and myositis.

“The myocarditis, the myositis that comes with the myasthenia has a significant mortality associated with it, about 20%, so we need to understand that,” Hamid said.

Sapna Patel, MD, a professor of oncology at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus in Aurora, Colorado, led a phase 2 trial, known as SWOG S1801, that randomly assigned patients with surgically resectable stage IIIB-IVC melanoma to two pembrolizumab regimens: One with three doses of neoadjuvant pembrolizumab, surgery, and 15 doses of adjuvant pembrolizumab (neoadjuvant-adjuvant group) and the second with surgery followed by 200 mg pembrolizumab every 3 weeks for 18 doses for about 1 year or until disease recurrence or unacceptable toxic events developed (adjuvant-only group). Event-free survival at 2 years was 72% in the former group vs 49% in the latter.

Neoadjuvant-adjuvant pembrolizumab is indicated for patients with melanoma involving lymph nodes, particularly when the lymph nodes are readily measured on cross-sectional imaging or palpable on clinical exam, Patel said.

“We're currently investigating whether this can be expanded to other stages of melanoma,” she said. “It is also approved to be given entirely postoperatively in the adjuvant setting, as well as for metastatic melanoma that has spread to distant parts of the body.”

Patel called SWOG S1801 “a practice-changing trial” that showed that using the standard regimen of 18 doses of pembrolizumab before and after the surgery instead of giving all the doses after surgery can yield superior results, Patel told Medscape Medical News.

Patients with concurrent autoimmune conditions and those of advanced age who may not derive a long-term benefit in reducing recurrence risk may not be good candidates for adjuvant pembrolizumab, said Jason Luke, MD, director of the Immunotherapy and Drug Development Center at the University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh. Luke led the long-term follow-up of the pivotal KEYNOTE-716 trial of patients on adjuvant pembrolizumab with resected stage IIB/IIC melanoma, which found that recurrence-free survival at 48 months was 71.3% for pembrolizumab and 58.3% for placebo. The trial did not reveal any new safety signals.

“Patients with active autoimmune disease requiring treatment or organ transplant recipients may not be optimal candidates for this type of treatment,” Patel added. Similarly, she said, patients on chronic immune suppression would not likely benefit from treatment with an ICI.

Even when side effects occur, oncologists should consider whether to discontinue pembrolizumab treatment carefully, Hamid said. “There are times where you might think to discontinue it, but in scenarios where this is a life-threatening disease or you have other options that limit their lifespan and there may be an imminent cause of mortality, pembrolizumab would be indicated despite the potential side effects,” he said.

The safety evaluation Hamid co-authored found that more than half of all patients had an any-cause grade 3-5 AE, and about 1 in 8 discontinued treatment. However, 6% of toxicities were immune-mediated, which he described as “very low.”

This year a real-world study from Northern Ireland found that even low-grade immune-related AE (irAE) toxicities in patients on adjuvant pembrolizumab for stage III melanoma could have a significant impact. Up to one third of them had to stop treatment. In this study, 70% of patients had a treatment-related toxicity, with 51% of all patients having a grade 1-2 toxicity.

Among patients with only low-grade toxicity, 15% required hospitalized and 33% required immunosuppression with oral corticosteroids treatment. But steroid treatment comes with its own challenges, the study authors noted.

“Steroid tapering should be gradual as premature discontinuation may lead to relapse,” they wrote. However, long-term steroid use carries a risk for bone loss, particularly in patients aged 50 years or older. “The risk of bone loss may be observed even at low doses and within the first month of treatment,” they wrote.

Some patients may not respond to steroids for irAEs as shown in a different study, where 6.2% of patients with melanoma treated with checkpoint inhibitors did not respond to steroids.

In patients with grade 2 toxicities who discontinue therapy, the Northern Ireland researchers wrote, “these real-world data suggest that clinicians may be cautious” when resuming therapy.

An analysis of the FDA AE database focused on cardiac AEs linked to pembrolizumab. The study looked at 6719 ICI-related cardiac AEs, more than one third (34.3%) of which were fatal. The analysis found that 17.3% of all pembrolizumab-associated AEs were cardiac in nature. Pembrolizumab was found to be more often reported with myocarditis, pericardial disease, heart failure, and atrial fibrillation than other drugs in the FDA database, with myocarditis being the most significant. However, the study did not specify cancer types or stages.

In melanoma, the safety profile of pembrolizumab is comparable to that of other checkpoint inhibitors. The pivotal CheckMate 067 trial, which evaluated the combination of nivolumab, an anti–PD-1 agent like pembrolizumab, and ipilimumab against either drug alone in patients with melanoma, reported grade 3 or higher treatment-related AEs in approximately 59% of patients on combination therapy, with nearly 10% having to stop treatment.

In the phase 2 SWOG S1801 trial, the incidence of AEs of grade 3 or higher was similar in both neoadjuvant-adjuvant and adjuvant-only treatment groups (12% and 14%, respectively), and significantly lower than other studies have found, study leader Patel said. The study did not specify irAEs.

Hamid said that most pembrolizumab-related AEs “are manageable and can get back to baseline.” Symptoms of irAEs can occur at 10 weeks into therapy or later, he said. Adrenal insufficiency, for example, occurred within about 6 months. The most commonly reported irAEs were hypothyroidism, pneumonitis, hyperthyroidism, colitis, and severe skin reactions, Hamid said.

“Any symptom needs to be looked at and considered in the setting of an immune-mediated toxicity,” Hamid said.

When pembrolizumab may not be optimal for treating melanoma, the use of first-line immunotherapy with alternative treatments and regimens might be. Hamid noted the phase 2 SECOMBIT trial showed that first-line immunotherapy followed by combination BRAF and MEK inhibition provided a survival benefit in patients with untreated BRAFV600-metastatic melanoma.

SECOMBIT included a treatment arm in which patients received 8 weeks of the BRAF inhibitor encorafenib with the MEK inhibitor binimetinib, followed by the combination of nivolumab with ipilimumab until PD — a regimen the study termed the “sandwich” arm. That arm had a 4-year total progression survival rate of 54% vs 29% for the arm taking encorafenib plus binimetinib until PD followed by ipilimumab and nivolumab, and 55% for the arm that started with ipilimumab and nivolumab until PD then switched to encorafenib and binimetinib.

“It's the fact that immunotherapy takes time to work, so patients with aggressive high-tumor fraction growth may want to initially involve some form of priming dose,” Hamid said. “For those who are BRAF-mutated, a lead-in with BRAF inhibition, with BRAF and MEK combination therapy as per the SECOMBIT trial, may be indicated.”

Another option is what Patel called “flipped dosing,” which involves nivolumab plus ipilimumab for two doses. Another alternative to pembrolizumab in advanced melanoma is nivolumab plus relatlimab, a checkpoint inhibitor that targets the lymphocyte-activation gene 3, Patel said.

“Treatment for melanoma has dramatically changed over the past 10-15 years, moving from a general lack of treatment options to now a plethora of options,” Luke said. He noted the multitude of options, besides the ICIs such as pembrolizumab and nivolumab, include combinations of anti–PD-1 with anti-CTLA4 and anti-LAG3 agents, BRAF and MEK inhibition as targeted therapy, adoptive cell transfer of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, oncolytic viruses, and CD3-bispecific therapies.

The choices can be “daunting” for patients, according to Luke.

While there are several treatment options, overall, there is strong evidence supporting the life-extending effects of pembrolizumab despite the drug's potential side effects.

 May 09, 2025  

Living within a mile of a golf course is associated with a 126% increased risk for Parkinson's disease (PD), possibly due to increased pesticide exposure, results of a population-based case-control study suggest.

Results also showed drinking water from groundwater service areas with a golf course was associated with almost a twofold increased risk for the disease.

The study results imply that both vulnerable drinking water and airborne pollutant exposure may contribute to the risk of developing PD near golf courses, study investigator Brittany Krzyzanowski, PhD, assistant professor, Barrow Neurological Institute, Phoenix, told Medscape Medical News.

However, she cautioned that because the study is observational it cannot establish causality, so it is too early to recommend that individuals move away from golf courses.

Nevertheless, she added, the results suggest individuals should be aware of the potential risk and take steps to minimize their exposure.

The study was published online on May 8 in JAMA Network Open.

PD is likely caused by a complex interaction between genetic predisposition and environmental factors, including pesticide exposure. Previous research showed pesticides such as paraquat and rotenone induce Parkinson-like neurodegeneration in the substantia nigra, primarily through mechanisms involving oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and dopaminergic neuron apoptosis.

Golf courses are frequently treated with pesticides to uphold the visual and maintenance standards of putting greens and fairways. In the United States, the amount of pesticide used on golf courses can be up to 15 times greater than that in European countries.

One anecdotal report has suggested that living near golf courses may increase the risk for PD. However, few studies have explored the role of pesticide exposure from golf courses on PD risk, said Krzyzanowski.

Using the Rochester Epidemiology Project (REP) medical records linkage system, researchers identified patients with PD in Olmstead County, Minnesota, from 1991 to 2015. From medical records, a movement disorder specialist confirmed the PD diagnosis as well as the date of onset.

Investigators used home addresses 2 or 3 years prior to PD symptom onset to allow for a delay between potential environmental exposure and development of PD. Address-level data provide the most accurate distance-to-exposure values.

The study included 419 individuals with PD, median age of 73 years at diagnosis and 61% men, who were compared with 5113 age- and sex-matched control individuals without the disease.

Researchers collected data on 139 golf courses in the 27-county study region. Using satellite imagery, they manually digitized golf course data to confirm the correct placement of golf course boundaries in 2013, the earliest year relevant data were available.

After adjusting for age, sex, race and ethnicity, index year (date of PD symptom onset for cases), household income, and urban or rural category, the study found living within one mile of a golf course was associated with 126% increased odds of PD (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 2.26; 95% CI, 1.09- 4.70; P = .03) compared with those living more than 6 miles from a golf course.

The analysis uncovered a modest dose response. The odds of PD increased by 198% at 1-2 miles (aOR, 2.98; 95% CI, 1.46-6.06; P = .003), 121% at 2-3 miles (aOR, 2.21; 95% CI, 1.06-4.59; P = .03), and 92% at 3-6 miles (aOR, 1.92; 95% CI, 0.91-4.04; P = .09) compared with those living more than 6 miles away.

A sensitivity analysis showed the link between proximity to golf course and PD was stronger in urban areas. The authors speculate that greater density surrounding golf courses in urban areas may lead to higher levels of airborne pollutant exposure to nearby residents.

Researchers also assessed whether individuals received their drinking water from groundwater sources located either with, or without, a golf course or from private wells. Overall, 77.3% of the study population lived in areas served by groundwater-based water systems. They noted that pesticides used on golf courses can seep into groundwater, potentially contaminating drinking water supplies.

Results showed that individuals receiving tap water from groundwater service areas with a golf course had nearly a twofold increased risk for PD compared with those in groundwater areas without golf courses (aOR, 1.96; 95% CI, 1.20-3.23). They also had a 49% higher risk for PD than those using private wells as a drinking water source (aOR, 1.49; 95% CI, 1.05-2.13).

The researchers acknowledged the water distribution process is complex and varies from city to city, so it's possible not everyone within the same water service area shared the same water source.

The investigators also determined whether water services areas were within a vulnerable groundwater region, defined as those with coarse texture soils, shallow bedrock, or karst geology.

Krzyzanowski explained that karst topography describes a region with limestone bedrock that slowly dissolves over time, creating underground voids that allow water from the surface to move more rapidly through it.

“This means that pesticides applied to grass or crops can more readily move into the groundwater supply after a rain,” the investigators noted.

The analysis showed that individuals whose tap water was from service areas with a golf course located in vulnerable groundwater regions were 82% more likely to have PD compared with those in similar areas with a golf course but nonvulnerable groundwater (aOR, 1.82; 95% CI, 1.09-3.03).

Study limitations included the restricted geographic scope of the population-based dataset and the predominantly White study population. In addition, the lack of occupational history data may have led to exposure misclassification, as some individuals may have spent significant time away from their home address. The study also did not account for other relevant risk factors for PD, such as head trauma or genetic predisposition.

Commenting on the findings, David Dexter, PhD, director of Research, Parkinson's United Kingdom, raised a number of other potential limitations of the study.

In a statement from the Science Media Center, which features expert comment on science news, Dexter noted the study didn't restrict participants to those who lived permanently in the area, an important consideration as PD starts in the brain 10-15 years before diagnosis.

“This would not only affect participants' exposure but also suggests their Parkinson's could have started before they moved around a golf course,” he said.

Dexter also noted that 80% of individuals with PD lived in urban areas compared with only 30% of control individuals, so other factors such as air pollution from motor vehicles could have accounted for some of the increased incidence of the disease. He also noted that the drinking water wasn't analyzed for pesticide levels.

Commenting on the research for Medscape Medical News, Michael S. Okun, MD, Adelaide Lackner professor of Neurology, University of Florida, and executive director, Norman Fixel Institute for Neurological Diseases, both in Gainesville, Florida, said the study's findings “highlight a clear and urgent need to re-evaluate pesticide use on golf courses.”

Okun, who is also medial advisor for the Parkinson's Foundation said the link between proximity to golf courses and increased PD risk is “striking.” 

“These results raise concerns about how chemicals applied for aesthetics may silently shape neurological health,” he said. The fact that pesticides used to keep golf courses pristine may be seeping into local water supplies and increasing PD risk “is a hidden hazard we can no longer ignore,” said Okun.

Germany, Hungary, and Slovakia reported cases of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) in livestock in early 2025, prompting Medscape Medical News to ask if healthcare practitioners need to be alert to the human consequences of the disease.

In addition to the potentially devastating economic impacts of control measures on farmers and those living and working in rural areas, there can also be mental health consequences for the wider community. Patients may need reassurance about their personal risk for disease, the safety of food supplies, and potential contamination of crops and water from disinfection measures and enforced culling disposals.

For example, villagers living near mass graves of culled cattle in Hungary have expressed concerns about their water supply, as well as the smell as the bodies decompose.

Physicians may need to offer psychologic support and promote community initiatives to mitigate the socioeconomic impacts of an outbreak.

Patients who work in rural or agricultural settings or animal processing facilities should avoid direct contact with potentially susceptible animals unless necessary, said Sonja Hartnack, who has an MD in veterinary medicine and is a scientific collaborator with the Veterinary Epidemiology Group at the University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland. She told Medscape Medical News that it's vital that occupational groups are made aware of biosafety measures. They should be advised to disinfect, shower, and change clothes and footwear before leaving the site. Decontamination measures are also needed for potentially contaminated vehicles and equipment.

Although FMD does not directly infect people, it is devastating to cloven-hoofed animals, including cattle, pigs, sheep, and goats. Morbidity, including blisters, fever, anorexia, lameness, and reduced milk yield, can reach 100%. Mortality is usually less than 5% in adult animals but may reach 20% or more in young animals.

As FMD is highly transmissible and infected animals secrete virus particles before clinical signs appear, precautions to prevent spread may be draconian, including culling of healthy animals, protection zones, animal movement restrictions, closures of zoos and wildlife parks, and trade bans.

Moving infected animals may bring them into contact with virus-naive animals or contaminate land and roads, and people may transmit the virus via contaminated food, clothing, shoes, tools, and vehicles. There is no risk to the human food chain, but inadvertent animal consumption of infected meat could lead to an outbreak.

A 2019 review published in Frontiers in Veterinary Science showed transmission risks associated with hunting, shooting, stalking, and equestrian activities, especially those involving large groups of people, vehicles, dogs, horses, or susceptible wildlife.

Potential fomites also include boats, bicycles, riding gear, fishing tackle, and guns. The virus can also be carried on wind, with airborne transmission possible up to 60 km.

FMD first appeared in Asian buffalo in Germany in January. Hungary reported affected livestock in March, and by April, neighboring Slovakia was facing a significant outbreak. Last month, Austria closed dozens of border crossings and imposed disinfection for cars and pedestrians at others in an attempt to stop the spread. The Czech Republic, although so far unaffected, introduced disinfection measures at border crossings used by freight trucks.

Thousands of animals have been culled in central Europe, and the authorities face twin challenges from the disposal of tons of potentially infectious carcasses and locals anxious about disease spread and contamination. There have been public protests about the enforced slaughter of healthy animals and pleas for quarantine and testing rather than the culling of healthy animals.

Control measures have devastating economic impacts, including direct financial losses due to herd culls and shortfalls in livestock sales and meat and dairy production, which may cause shortages or price gouging. The costs can ripple through the economy; trade and export bans lead to loss of access to foreign markets, and restrictions on movement in rural areas may have dire consequences for tourism.

The potential fallout was highlighted last month when the United Kingdom followed Germany, Hungary, Slovakia, and Austria in prohibiting food imports, banning travelers from bringing cheese and meat products back from the European Union.

A study of people affected by the 2001 UK FMD outbreak, in which authorities mandated culling millions of animals, found “profound psychosocial effects,” describing it as “a human tragedy, not just an animal one.”

Respondents reported tensions and conflict within communities; deteriorating health; and feelings of distress, bereavement, fear, social isolation, and loss of trust in authority, as well as sleep disruption, flashbacks, nightmares, and loss of concentration more than a year later. Pyres of culled animals caused headaches, nausea, and respiratory problems.

Researchers said that the event affected many rural health practitioners' work for years, with distress experienced “well beyond the farming community.” They noted that those affected need “careful and appropriate support to rebuild lives and regain confidence.”

Hartnack said that healthcare practitioners could do much to foster resilience in the current outbreak. “Communication and empathy with farmers and [understanding] their activities is key,” she said.

Non-invasive biomarkers and scoring systems demonstrated effectiveness in differentiating chronic liver disease (CLD) from cirrhosis; non-invasive fibrosis scores such as the Lok index, King's score, fibrosis index, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease fibrosis score (NFS) showed strong capability.

""[The study] findings have important clinical implications, particularly in tailoring non-invasive diagnostic strategies to specific patient populations,"" the authors wrote. ""Collectively, these findings may support a more nuanced, etiology-aware application of non-invasive fibrosis scores and inflammatory indices in clinical hepatology,"" they added.

This study was led by Abdulrahman Ismaiel, 2nd Department of Internal Medicine, ""Iuliu Haţieganu"" University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Cluj-Napoca, Romania. It was published online on April 29, 2025, in the Journal of Clinical Medicine.

The study's retrospective design limited causal inferences, and its single-centre nature may have affected generalisability. The lack of long-term follow-up data prevented the assessment of clinical outcomes like decompensation and mortality. Additionally, imaging techniques for the evaluation of liver fibrosis were not incorporated.

This research was partially funded by an internal grant from the ""Iuliu Haţieganu"" University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Cluj-Napoca, Romania. The authors reported having no conflicts of interest.

Lingering post-COVID symptoms are more than a nuisance, they're independently linked to poorer physical, mental, and daily functioning across all U.S. states, highlighting urgent needs for targeted care and recovery strategies.

Study: The health-related quality of life among survivors with post-COVID conditions in the United States. Image Credit: p.ill.i / Shutterstock

In a recent study published in the journal PLoS One, a group of researchers evaluated how post-Coronavirus Disease (COVID) conditions (PCCs) affect health-related quality of life (HRQL) among COVID-19 survivors in the United States.

For millions of Americans, recovering from COVID-19 is only the beginning. Nearly one in four survivors experience lingering symptoms like fatigue, brain fog, dizziness, and pain that persist for months and interfere with daily life. These lasting effects, known as PCCs, often go unnoticed as public attention shifts to infection control. While early studies have hinted at the burden PCCs place on individuals, their full impact on health-related quality of life remains poorly understood. To guide effective treatment and policy, there is an urgent need to identify who is most at risk and how best to support them.

Researchers analyzed data from the 2022 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), a national survey led by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which gathers health information via telephone from United States (U.S.) adults. They focused on individuals who had previously tested positive for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), excluding those with only at-home diagnoses or incomplete responses. Participants were divided into two groups: those reporting PCCs, defined as symptoms persisting at least three months after acute COVID-19, and those without.

The primary outcome was health-related quality of life (HRQL), assessed through four self-reported measures: general health, mental health, physical health, and daily functional ability. Sociodemographic characteristics, comorbidities, and behavioral habits (such as physical activity, smoking, and sleep patterns) were also recorded. Advanced statistical techniques, including multivariate logistic regression and data imputation via random forest modeling, were used to adjust for missing data and confounding factors. Survey weights and design adjustments were applied to reflect the U.S. adult population. The association between PCCs and unfavorable self-reported general health (SRGH) was analyzed after accounting for all relevant variables.

The researchers noted that the BRFSS relies on self-reported data, which may be subject to recall bias or reporting inaccuracies. Additionally, some variables that could influence PCC risk and outcomes, such as vaccination status, medications, or the timing and severity of initial COVID-19 infection, were not available in the dataset. Institutionalized individuals were not included in the survey, and the HRQL questions were not based on a standardized questionnaire. These limitations should be considered when interpreting the study's results.

The study included 108,237 adults with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, representing over 70 million Americans. Among them, 22.7% experienced PCCs. Individuals with PCCs were more likely to be female, middle-aged, obese, physically inactive, and report lower income and poor sleep habits.

Overall, 25.7% of those with PCCs rated their general health as “fair” or “poor,” compared to 15.5% of those without PCCs. These individuals also reported more days of poor mental and physical health, as well as greater disruption in daily activities. In adjusted regression models, having PCCs was independently associated with a 39% higher likelihood of unfavorable general health (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 1.39, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.28–1.52, p < 0.001).

When examining symptoms, dizziness on standing (38%), mood disorders (36.3%), and musculoskeletal pain (34.1%) were most strongly linked with poor health ratings. Conversely, symptoms like loss of taste or smell were less likely to impair overall well-being. Notably, the association between PCCs and lower HRQL remained significant across all age groups and states, suggesting a widespread and systemic burden.

Among those with PCCs, further analysis revealed that certain factors increased the risk of poor general health. These included being in late middle age (45–64 years old; aOR = 1.47), having obesity (aOR = 1.27), being physically inactive (aOR = 1.94), or sleeping too little or too much (aOR = 1.55 and 2.15, respectively). Chronic conditions such as diabetes (aOR = 2.29), heart disease (aOR = 2.01), and pulmonary diseases (aOR = 1.98) also significantly raised the odds of unfavorable health. Socioeconomic factors, including lower education and income, single marital status, and Hispanic ethnicity, were independently associated with worse outcomes.

Interestingly, while women with PCCs were more likely to report poor health, gender was not a significant factor after statistical adjustment. State-level analysis showed that regions like West Virginia, Kentucky, and Oregon reported the highest rates of impaired general health, underscoring geographic disparities in long COVID impact.

The study also emphasized that while PCCs were more prevalent among younger adults, the association between PCCs and impaired quality of life was particularly strong among those in their late middle age (45–64 years old). This highlights the complex relationship between age, risk of PCCs, and their impact on daily functioning.

To summarize, post-COVID conditions are linked to significantly reduced health-related quality of life across the U.S., affecting physical, mental, and daily functioning. Individuals with chronic illnesses, obesity, lower socioeconomic status, or unhealthy lifestyle habits are particularly vulnerable. These findings emphasize the need for multidisciplinary care models, long-term monitoring, and targeted rehabilitation strategies for COVID-19 survivors. The authors also call for further research to better understand and address the limitations of current data sources and to optimize support for those living with PCCs. As the pandemic's acute phase recedes, addressing the hidden burden of PCCs becomes essential for national health planning.

In a global trial of over 2,500 patients, obicetrapib dramatically reduced LDL cholesterol levels when added to standard lipid-lowering therapy, offering new hope for those at highest cardiovascular risk.

Study: Safety and Efficacy of Obicetrapib in Patients at High Cardiovascular Risk. Image Credit: Explode / Shutterstock

A recent New England Journal of Medicine study investigated the efficacy and safety of obicetrapib among patients at high risk of cardiovascular events.

Multiple clinical trials have shown that lowering LDL cholesterol levels decreases the risk of cardiovascular events. The class of drugs known as cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) inhibitors, to which obicetrapib belongs, has been explored for its potential to modify cholesterol levels. However, the development of CETP inhibitors has faced significant challenges; for instance, torcetrapib was associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and other agents like dalcetrapib and evacetrapib were discontinued due to a lack of efficacy in improving cardiovascular outcomes.

These past experiences have guided the development of newer agents like obicetrapib, which has a hydrophilic design intended to avoid some off-target effects and focuses on robust LDL cholesterol reduction in addition to raising HDL cholesterol. Low-intensity or high-intensity statin therapy focuses on lowering LDL cholesterol.

Combination therapy can help lower LDL cholesterol levels in patients at very high risk of cardiovascular events. However, the usage of combination lipid-lowering therapy is low, as evidenced by observational studies, which implies that more high-risk patients will receive inadequate treatment and potentially experience adverse cardiovascular outcomes.

Early trials have shown that obicetrapib lowers LDL cholesterol levels and raises high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels. When added to a maximum tolerated dose of lipid-lowering therapy, it can also help high-risk patients achieve LDL cholesterol treatment goals. Besides studying the effect of obicetrapib on lipid levels, examining its side effects and safety profile among patients at high risk of cardiovascular events is essential.

This study conducted a randomized, multinational, placebo-controlled trial with individuals aged 18 years or above. Participants had to have a history of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease or heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia and be on maximum tolerated doses of lipid-lowering therapy. Genotyping or clinical criteria were used to diagnose heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia.

Patients were eligible if they had an LDL cholesterol level of 100 mg per deciliter or higher or a non-high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol level of 130 mg per deciliter or higher. Alternatively, individuals with an LDL cholesterol level of 55 to 100 mg per deciliter or a non-HDL cholesterol level of 85 to 130 mg per deciliter were also eligible if they had at least one additional cardiovascular risk factor.

Two groups were created, and participants were assigned to them randomly in a 2:1 ratio. The groups received either 10 mg of obicetrapib once daily or a matching placebo for 365 days. The percentage change in LDL from baseline to day 84 formed the primary endpoint. There were secondary endpoints as well, namely, the levels of non-HDL cholesterol, apolipoprotein B, triglycerides, and total cholesterol at days 84, 180, and 365, the percent change in LDL levels at days 30, 180, 270, and 365, and levels of apolipoprotein A1 and lipoprotein(a) at day 84.

From December 2021 through August 2023, across multiple sites in China, Europe, Japan, and the United States, 2530 patients were randomly assigned to receive obicetrapib or placebo, of which 292 discontinued prematurely. The average age was 65 years, the average body mass index (BMI) was 29, and 34% were women. A total of 89% had atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, 38% had diabetes, and 17% reported heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia. Seventy percent were receiving high-intensity statins, while 27% were on ezetimibe. PCSK9 inhibitors were being administered to 4% of patients. At baseline, the average LDL and HDL levels were 98 mg per decilitre and 49 mg per decilitre, respectively.

The primary endpoints for patients receiving obicetrapib and placebo were estimated at −29.9% and 2.7%, respectively. A difference between groups of −32.6 percentage points was observed. At day 84, approximately 27.9% and 1.1% of patients in the obicetrapib and placebo groups exhibited LDL cholesterol levels below 40 mg per decilitre. Similarly, 51.0% and 8.0% of patients in the obicetrapib and placebo groups exhibited LDL cholesterol levels less than 55 mg per decilitre. The percentage of patients with LDL cholesterol levels below 70 mg per deciliter was 68.4% and 27.5% in the obicetrapib and placebo groups, respectively.

A secondary endpoint favored obicetrapib over placebo. A between-group difference at day 30 reduced the LDL cholesterol level by 36.6%, day 180 by 32.7%, day 270 by 30.2%, and day 365 by 24.0%. The study noted that the LDL cholesterol-lowering effect appeared to diminish somewhat by day 365, which the authors suggested might be partly due to discontinuation of the drug. The current study also estimated between-group differences in the apolipoprotein B level to be −18.9 percentage points at day 84, −18.3 percentage points at day 180, and −13.8 percentage points at day 365. A similar trend of reduction in between-group differences was observed in the non-HDL cholesterol level (−29.4 percentage points at day 84), lipoprotein(a) level (−33.5 percentage points at day 84), and triglyceride level (−7.8 percentage points at day 84). Conversely, obicetrapib led to significant increases in HDL cholesterol level (136.3 percentage points difference at day 84) and total cholesterol level (17.7 percentage points difference at day 84).

During the trial period, adverse events were observed in 59.7% of the obicetrapib patients and 60.8% of candidates in the placebo group. However, there were no apparent differences in the rates or severity of adverse events between the groups.

The paper also reported on 'adverse events of special interest.' Liver-enzyme abnormalities (alanine or aspartate aminotransferase levels >3 times the upper limit of normal) occurred in 0.6% of obicetrapib patients versus 0.9% in placebo patients, and muscle enzyme abnormalities (creatine kinase >5 times the upper limit of normal) occurred in 0.3% versus 0.4%, respectively. Worsening kidney function (defined as a decrease from baseline of more than 25% in the estimated glomerular filtration rate) was noted in 6.8% of obicetrapib patients compared to 8.3% in the placebo group. New-onset diabetes or worsening of glycemic control occurred in 35.1% of patients in the obicetrapib group and in 40.0% in the placebo group. The most frequently reported adverse events overall included COVID-19, hypertension, and upper respiratory tract infections, with similar incidences between groups. In 4.2% and 5.2% of patients belonging to the obicetrapib and placebo groups, respectively, experienced cardiovascular events, such as deaths from coronary heart disease, nonfatal myocardial infarction, coronary revascularization, or stroke. No significant changes in ambulatory blood pressure measurements at baseline and at day 270 were observed.

The current study revealed that obicetrapib treatment could effectively reduce LDL cholesterol levels by a placebo-adjusted 32.6 percentage points at day 84, among patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia or atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease who are at high risk of cardiovascular events. In the future, more clinical studies are required to determine the efficacy of this agent in preventing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, and the paper notes that a large, long-term cardiovascular outcomes trial is currently underway.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","AI tool uses facial images to predict biological age and cancer survival","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250508/AI-tool-uses-facial-images-to-predict-biological-age-and-cancer-survival.aspx","Fri, 09 May 2025 02:01:00 GMT","

Eyes may be the window to the soul, but a person's biological age could be reflected in their facial characteristics. Investigators from Mass General Brigham developed a deep learning algorithm called FaceAge that uses a photo of a person's face to predict biological age and survival outcomes for patients with cancer. They found that patients with cancer, on average, had a higher FaceAge than those without and appeared about five years older than their chronological age. Older FaceAge predictions were associated with worse overall survival outcomes across multiple cancer types. They also found that FaceAge outperformed clinicians in predicting short-term life expectancies of patients receiving palliative radiotherapy. Their results are published in The Lancet Digital Health.

We can use artificial intelligence (AI) to estimate a person's biological age from face pictures, and our study shows that information can be clinically meaningful. This work demonstrates that a photo like a simple selfie contains important information that could help to inform clinical decision-making and care plans for patients and clinicians. How old someone looks compared to their chronological age really matters-individuals with FaceAges that are younger than their chronological ages do significantly better after cancer therapy.""

Hugo Aerts, PhD, co-senior and corresponding author, director of the Artificial Intelligence in Medicine (AIM) program at Mass General Brigham

When patients walk into exam rooms, their appearance may give physicians clues about their overall health and vitality. Those intuitive assessments combined with a patient's chronological age, in addition to many other biological measures, may help determine the best course of treatment. However, like anyone, physicians may have biases about a person's age that may influence them, fueling a need for more objective, predictive measures to inform care decisions.

With that goal in mind, Mass General Brigham investigators leveraged deep learning and facial recognition technologies to train FaceAge. The tool was trained on 58,851 photos of presumed healthy individuals from public datasets. The team tested the algorithm in a cohort of 6,196 cancer patients from two centers, using photographs routinely taken at the start of radiotherapy treatment.

Results showed that cancer patients appear significantly older than those without cancer, and their FaceAge, on average, was about five years older than their chronological age. In the cancer patient cohort, older FaceAge was associated with worse survival outcomes, especially in individuals who appeared older than 85, even after adjusting for chronological age, sex, and cancer type.

Estimated survival time at the end of life is difficult to pin down but has important treatment implications in cancer care. The team asked 10 clinicians and researchers to predict short-term life expectancy from 100 photos of patients receiving palliative radiotherapy. While there was a wide range in their performance, overall, the clinicians' predictions were only slightly better than a coin flip, even after they were given clinical context, such as the patient's chronological age and cancer status. Yet when clinicians were also provided with the patient's FaceAge information, their predictions improved significantly.

Further research is needed before this technology could be considered for use in a real-world clinical setting. The research team is testing this technology to predict diseases, general health status, and lifespan. Follow-up studies include expanding this work across different hospitals, looking at patients in different stages of cancer, tracking FaceAge estimates over time, and testing its accuracy against plastic surgery and makeup data sets.

""This opens the door to a whole new realm of biomarker discovery from photographs, and its potential goes far beyond cancer care or predicting age,"" said co-senior author Ray Mak, MD, a faculty member in the AIM program at Mass General Brigham. ""As we increasingly think of different chronic diseases as diseases of aging, it becomes even more important to be able to accurately predict an individual's aging trajectory. I hope we can ultimately use this technology as an early detection system in a variety of applications, within a strong regulatory and ethical framework, to help save lives.""

A landmark study shows that when babies start walking isn't just developmental, it's in their DNA. Genetic variants not only shape motor timing but also link to cognitive traits and brain structure.

Thresholding t-statistic image at t > 0.95 (two-sided statistical test). Significant voxels were overlaid on the 40-week neonatal brain template in sagittal, coronal and axial planes. White arrows indicate significant brain structures involved in motor control. N = 264. Study: Genome-wide association meta-analysis of age at onset of walking in over 70,000 infants of European ancestry

A recent study published in the journal Nature Human Behavior performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) meta-analysis of age at onset of walking (AOW).

The onset of walking in early childhood is a robust clinical marker of brain and behavioral development. Moreover, walking is an exclusive, informative milestone for atypical and typical development. The inability to walk independently by 18 months is a screening criterion to refer to a pediatrician for further assessment because delayed walking might indicate a motor-specific or generalized issue.

However, historical data suggest that only a minority of late walkers may have an underlying developmental disorder or neurological abnormality. As such, late walkers may reflect an extreme of typical variation or a clinically meaningful condition with a later onset age. AOW is a complex trait shaped by various factors, such as body dimensions, gestational age, neural maturation, year of birth, nutrition, opportunity to practice, and cultural context.

Many of these factors influence the function and structure of brain areas implicated in motor control, including the basal ganglia, cerebellum, and cortex. Dysfunctions in these regions result in movement disorders. Nevertheless, it remains unclear what the causal influences underlying AOW variability are and whether they are associated with later health, cognitive, and neurodevelopmental outcomes.

In the present study, researchers performed a GWAS meta-analysis of AOW in 70,560 infants from four European-ancestry cohorts: the United Kingdom Medical Research Council National Study for Health and Development (NSHD), the Lifelines Multigenerational Prospective Population-based Birth Cohort study, the Netherlands Twin Register (NTR), and the Norwegian Mother, Father, and Child Cohort Study (MoBa).

This revealed 2,525 genome-wide significant single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Of these, 11 were independent loci with one lead variant per locus, which remained significant after conditioning on other significant SNPs within the same chromosome. The most strongly associated SNPs, rs7956202 and rs16952251, were located on chromosomes 12 and 16, respectively. SNP-based heritability of AOW was 24.13%.

The study found that approximately 11,900 SNPs account for about 90% of the SNP-based heritability for AOW, highlighting the trait's high polygenicity.

No significant genome-wide heterogeneity was observed between cohorts. Further, the genome-wide SNPs were mapped to 233 genes based on expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs), chromatin interaction information, and genomic position. The team also evaluated whether these prioritized genes had differential expression in the brain across BrainSpan developmental stages and Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) tissues.

As such, they noted a significant downregulation of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in various tissues, including the brain and the heart, and DEG upregulation in fibroblasts. However, the enrichment of upregulated or downregulated DEGs across BrainSpan developmental stages was not significant. AOW-related gene sets were enriched in gene ontology (GO) generation of neurons and neurogenesis pathways. The Multi-marker Analysis of GenoMic Annotation (MAGMA) gene-based test performed on meta-GWAS summary statistics revealed that 50 genes were associated with AOW.

Thirteen of these genes were associated with intellectual disability, and seven were associated with autism. The team also found that the expression of AOW-associated genes was significantly enriched in 19–24 post-conceptional weeks. Next, the researchers tested the enrichment of the AOW meta-GWAS signal by functional genomic annotation.

This revealed significant enrichment of AOW heritability in genomic regions conserved in mammals, primates, and vertebrates. Additionally, the team assessed whether AOW heritability was enriched in specific cell types and noted significant enrichment in the brain, especially in the cortex, cerebellum, basal ganglia, and amygdala. A polygenic score (PGS) was calculated based on meta-analyses of all samples, leaving out either NTR, Lifelines, or NSHD cohorts.

In the Lifelines cohort, the PGS from the meta-GWAS of other cohorts was significantly associated with AOW. Likewise, the PGS was significantly associated with AOW in the NSHD and NTR cohorts. Within the largest cohort, MoBa, cross-validation was used to assess the predictive value of the PGS.

Next, the team examined genetic correlations between AOW and select neurodevelopmental, physical health, cortical, psychiatric, and cognitive phenotypes.

AOW exhibited a negative genetic correlation with childhood and adult body mass index (BMI) and attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The negative genetic correlation between AOW and ADHD may reflect that children with higher ADHD genetic liability exhibit higher early motor activity or shorter attention spans, which could facilitate earlier walking. Besides, it showed a positive genetic correlation with cognitive phenotypes and folding index. While AOW showed a genetic correlation with self-reported walking pace in adults, it was no longer significant after multiple testing. Further, the team explored whether the PGS for AOW was associated with differences in brain volume and gyrification at birth.

They found a significant positive correlation between the PGS for AOW and regional brain volume in the right posterior thalamus, right basal ganglia, superior temporal sulcus, bilateral anterior thalami, pons, primary visual cortex, medulla, and bilateral cerebellum and cerebellar peduncles in neonatal brains. Moreover, the AOW PGS was significantly positively associated with the gyrification index in both hemispheres in neonatal brains.

The study also demonstrated, using within-family (twin) analyses, that the polygenic score effect on AOW is largely a direct genetic effect rather than due to confounding from population stratification, assortative mating, or passive gene–environment correlation.

Notably, one of the loci identified (in the gene RBL2) is also associated with a rare neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by delayed or absent walking, providing further biological plausibility to the findings.

The researchers also found substantial genetic overlap between AOW and traits such as cognitive performance and educational attainment, with more than half of shared genetic variants showing concordant effects (i.e., influencing both traits in the same direction), though nearly half had discordant effects. This highlights the complexity of genetic relationships between early motor milestones and later cognitive abilities.

The study illustrated that AOW is a heritable polygenic trait with significant etiological links to later health outcomes. Eleven genome-wide significant loci associated with AOW were identified, one of which colocalized with an eQTL. Besides, the high variability in AOW is partly due to common genetic variation, with nearly one-fourth of the variability explained by common genetic variants. The identified genetic variants plausibly contribute to individual variability in motor behavior.

The authors note that their study was limited to cohorts of European ancestry, and some measurements of AOW relied on parent recall several years after infancy, which could introduce measurement error. Future research in more diverse populations and with more precise phenotyping is needed.

Announcing a new publication for Acta Materia Medica journal. A preclinical study has developed a precision nano-intervention strategy targeting tumor-associated nerves to destroy nerve-fueled tumor growth in pancreatic cancer.

In this strategy, Escherichia coli Nissle 1917-derived outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) are decorated with nerve-binding peptide for targeted delivery of co-loaded tropomyosin receptor kinase (Trk) inhibitors to tumor-associated nerves, thus precisely inhibiting nerve activity through the neurotrophin/Trk signaling pathway. Furthermore, the OMVs trigger M2-M1 switching, thus accelerating nerve injury.

This nano-intervention strategy significantly enhances chemotherapy efficacy in pancreatic cancer.

Acetaminophen is the most frequently taken fever and pain medication worldwide, but overdosing can be toxic to liver cells. In the United States, about 1,600 cases of acute liver failure and 500 deaths occur each year due to acetaminophen overuse and liver failure. Although the liver has a remarkable potential to regenerate and recover from injury, scientists are seeking to better understand how this happens after acetaminophen toxicity.

Liver regeneration has been studied for decades, primarily through removing sections of the organ, yet there is still controversy among researchers regarding the source of new liver cells, and whether they originate from stem cells in the liver or from pre-existing mature liver cells which start multiplying after injury. A deeper understanding of mechanisms at play is essential to come up with strategies to boost liver regeneration in patients.

Towards this goal, Tomomi Aoyagi and colleagues from Kyushu University, Japan, studied the behavior of single cells in the mouse liver after acetaminophen injury and noticed that regeneration likely originated from a specific type of cell. The work was recently published in Stem Cell Reports. In their experiments, mature liver cells which were in direct contact with injured or dying cells transitioned to a more immature state and started to divide rapidly. Direct contact to damaged tissue was crucial for this transition, suggesting that signals from dead or dying cells instructs neighboring cells to start a regenerative program. Importantly, the researchers found a similar population of immature, dividing liver cells adjacent to injured tissue in biopsies from patients with drug-induced liver injury, suggesting that liver regeneration in humans follows similar principles.

Understanding how injured tissues instructs the neighboring cells to start a repair program may lead to more effective treatments for drug-induced liver injury and insights into strategies to treat liver failure, which can only be cured by transplantation.

Mor than 800 million people worldwide are living with diabetes, according to World Health Organization (WHO) estimates, with numbers steadily increasing. Diabetic patients experience abnormally high levels of blood sugar, which can, over the long-term, damage organs and decrease the quality of life and life expectancy of patients.

Blood sugar levels are controlled by cells in the pancreas called beta-cells which secrete insulin to lower blood glucose levels. Another cell type in the pancreas called alpha-cells are the natural counterpart of beta-cells as they act to increase blood sugar levels by secreting the hormone glucagon. A precisely tuned secretion of insulin versus glucagon is required to keep blood sugar at the right level.

While much research has focused on understanding beta-cell dysfunction in diabetic patients, it has become clear that alpha-cells are also affected in diabetes. Lab-based models of human alpha cells are crucial for understanding alpha-cell (dys)function and blood sugar regulation. Recently, Quinn Peterson and colleagues from Mayo Clinic, USA, discovered a method for making human alpha cells from cultures of immature stem cells. This work was recently published in Stem Cell Reports.

These stem cell-derived alpha cells very closely resembled pancreas-derived alpha cells and secreted comparable levels of glucagon. Importantly, like alpha cells in diabetic patients, the stem cell-derived alpha cells responded to culture conditions mimicking a diabetic environment with elevated glucagon secretion and dysregulation of alpha cell gene expression and physiology. Encouragingly, abnormal glucagon secretion of these cells was reversed by a drug called Sunitinib (a clinically approved anti-cancer drug). The human alpha cells described in this research will be a useful model to understand diabetic alpha cell dysfunction and to screen for new therapeutics.

Editor's Note: USWNT Footnotes takes you inside the major talking points around the U.S. women's national team, the NWSL, European leagues, and all across American women's soccer.

The biggest news of the week is that Mallory Swanson announced on social media that she and her husband, Chicago Cubs shortstop Dansby Swanson, are expecting their first child.

Swanson's absence from both the U.S. women's national team and the Chicago Stars this calendar year now makes perfect sense. Both teams had said that the star forward was dealing with a ""personal matter"" without further explanation. Now we all know the good news.

Swanson signed a contract extension with the Stars ahead of last season through 2028. And while that's an important long-term move for the club, it is currently going through a rebuilding phase, having recently fired head coach Lorne Donaldson (who coached Swanson's youth team back in Colorado). The Stars currently sit in last place in the NWSL with a 1-5-1 record.

As for the USWNT, Emma Hayes has already been trying out new faces on the front line as she builds out the player pool ahead of the 2027 World Cup in Brazil. And Swanson hasn't been the only member of the ""Triple Espresso"" that's been unavailable for selection. Sophia Wilson is also pregnant and expecting her first child this year, while Trinity Rodman looked fit and in form last camp before re-aggravating a back injury and is now out until further notice.

Carli Lloyd inducted into National Soccer Hall of Fame

USWNT legend Carli Lloyd was inducted into the National Soccer Hall of Fame earlier this week. In her speech, the two-time World Cup champion and Olympic gold medalist apologized to her teammates for being an ""emotionless machine.""

""I wasn't there to make friends or follow the crowd,"" Lloyd said. ""I was there to push myself to the very top while helping my team win championships. That drive often meant keeping people at a distance. 

""I avoided drama. I rarely showed weakness, and vulnerability wasn't something I allowed myself to express. I wouldn't say I have regrets, but if there is one thing I do wish, I wish I had let more people understand me over the years.

""... I was intense and I truly believed that the only way for me to survive in such a cutthroat environment was to be that way. So to my teammates, I want to say this: I'm sorry I wasn't always able to give you all of me.""

Lloyd, who retired in 2021 and has been a FOX Sports analyst for several years, reflected on her career accomplishments and regrets. She noted that above all else, her ""greatest joy"" has been becoming a mom to six-month-old daughter Harper.

""I always knew I wanted a child, but I had no idea how this little baby could completely change me as a person,"" Lloyd said. ""Unlike during my playing career, I have been present. I have allowed myself to be vulnerable, emotional and fully engaged in every moment I get to spend with her.""

Sister-Sister goal

Over the weekend, Alyssa and Gisele Thompson became the first sister duo to combine for a goal in NWSL history as they helped Angel City defeat the Washington Spirit 4-3.

In the 22nd minute, with Angel City already leading 1-0, Alyssa Thompson streaked down the left side and sent a pinpoint left-footed cross into the box, where her younger sibling was waiting. Gisele, a defender, only needed one touch to net her first career NWSL goal.

""We've always dreamed about this, especially in this high level of football,"" Gisele said after the match. ""Doing it together is amazing. Getting my first goal is so incredible. Dream come true.""

This isn't the first time Alyssa, 20, and Gisele, 19, have made soccer history though. They both started for the USWNT during the SheBelieves Cup earlier this year, becoming just the third sister pair ever to start in a senior national team together.

Mikaela Shiffrin invests in women's soccer

Mikaela Shiffrin, the most decorated Alpine skier in history, has joined the ownership group for Denver's NWSL expansion team. The Colorado native is a two-time gold medalist, eight-time World Champion and has 101 World Cup victories among other achievements. Now she can add NWSL investor to her glowing resume.

The Denver team, which has yet to be named, will begin play in 2026 along with Boston Legacy FC, bringing the league up to 16 teams. The ownership group is also planning to build a 14,500-seat stadium in Denver that is expected to open in 2028.

Shiffrin joins a growing list of celebrity athlete NWSL investors, which includes Patrick and Brittany Mahomes (Kansas City Current), Lindsey Vonn (Utah Royals and Angel City), Naomi Osaka (North Carolina Courage), Billie Jean King and Mia Hamm (Angel City), James Harden (Houston Dash) and many more.

There have been plenty of bad omens for the U.S. men's national team of late but on Thursday, the team's luck may have just turned around.

The election of Chicago native Robert Prevost to become Pope Leo XIV is (at least according to some denizens of the internet) a surefire sign that the USMNT is destined for big things at the World Cup next summer.

A curious pattern has emerged over the past several decades: Popes' teams tend to experience big success on the biggest stage in men's soccer.

Pope Francis saw his native Argentina win the last World Cup in 2022. Eight years before that, Pope Benedict XVI (at the time, Pope emeritus) watched Germany lift the 2014 World Cup.

Sure, but that's Argentina and Germany, right? They tend to do well no matter who is sitting on the throne in the Vatican.

But consider Benedict's predecessor John Paul II, who saw his Poland side achieve a third-place finish in the 1982 World Cup. If Poland can do it, why not the USMNT?

Sure, this line of justification is admittedly thin, but after the Concacaf Nations League, USMNT fans will take any hope they can get.","{'href': 'https://prosoccerwire.usatoday.com', 'title': 'Pro Soccer Wire'}","soccer"

All of the 63 games from the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup will be shown live through this agreement.

EverPass Media, the platform dedicated to commercial businesses, has struck a distribution deal in the US with sports streaming heavyweight DAZN, covering men's soccer's upcoming FIFA Club World Cup (CWC) tournament.

Through a commercial agreement unveiled today, EverPass will act as the exclusive rights-holder for CWC action across bars, restaurants, and other commercial venues, with the deal covering all 63 games between the 32 teams taking part in this year's expanded CWC (which will from now on be held as a quadrennial tournament, featuring a much larger number of sides than previous editions).

It represents the first such tie-up between DAZN, which holds global rights to the tournament through a deal with FIFA worth $1 billion – announced late last year, and EverPass.

It also adds to the existing distribution deals DAZN has struck in the US for the CWC, including with media heavyweight Warner Bros. Discovery, and with Mexican-language TelevisaUnivision. The tournament will run between June 14 and July 13.

In terms of recent EverPass activity, meanwhile, in mid-February, US media giant Paramount announced a multi-year agreement with the platform, around coverage of matches from European soccer's UEFA Champions League.

Launched in April 2023 as a joint venture between the investment arm of American football's NFL and RedBird Capital Partners, EverPass is a content distribution service aimed at bringing live sports and entertainment content to commercial establishments, such as bars, restaurants, hotels, and gyms, in the US.

Don't let policy changes catch you off guard. Stay proactive with real-time data and expert analysis.

The firm's chief executive, Alex Kaplan, said: ""We're excited to partner with DAZN to deliver the FIFA Club World Cup to the commercial market, further cementing EverPass' leadership position in bringing the world's most popular sport to bars and restaurants across the US.

""This agreement underscores our commitment to closing the gap between rightsholders and commercial venues by offering seamless access to premium live global sports content.""

EverPass' stable of rights includes top-tier English soccer, American football's NFL Sunday Ticket, Big Ten college football, and basketball, as well as the UCL.

Pete Oliver, CEO of the DAZN Growth Markets division, added: ""It [this deal] reinforces our commitment to making the tournament the most accessible in the history of football. With 63 matches featuring the biggest clubs from every continent, this tournament is built for shared moments, and commercial venues are a key part of that experience.""

In terms of other recent deals DAZN has put in place for the CWC, in late April, Russian sports streaming service Okko secured exclusive rights to the tournament.

The original deal between DAZN and soccer's global governing body FIFA was unveiled in advance of Saudi Arabia's Surj Sports Investments announcing last month that it had taken a minority stake in the streaming service, also for $1 billion. That figure is also the total prize and appearance fund available from the event.

A Saudi Arabian side are ready to sign Darwin Nunez as soon as the summer transfer window opens, according to a report.

The striker has made just eight starts in the Premier League in 2024-25 and just one in 2025, as it appears he is at the bottom of Arne Slot's pecking order when it comes to Liverpool's attacking weapons.

Nunez's future on Merseyside has been the subject of heavy speculation, with the club previously rejecting an approach from Al-Nassr to sign him in January.

Now, Al-Hilal are plotting a move for the Urguayan on June 1 - the first day of the transfer window - in order to have him available for the Club World Cup, according to Liverpool Echo.

FIFA's annual competition begins in mid-June, with clubs expected to field stronger sides for the tournament this year. 

The number of teams competing has increased from seven to 32, and the prize money has rised concurrently - now at £30million for the winners.

When clubs came knocking for Nunez in January, Slot was hesitant to see his squad break apart as he bid to win silverware in his first season.

However, Liverpool are expected to be more willing to listen to offers for their No 9 this summer. 

Liverpool splashed out £85m on Nunez to snap him up from Benfica in 2022 but he has struggled since his arrival.

The frontman has scored 40 goals in 140 appearances since landing in England.

In his two full seasons at Liverpool, he has ranked in the top three for big chances missed in the Premier League, with 21 in 2022-23 and 27 the year after.

Nunez has scored only one goal in his last 19 appearances and has made seven big chances in the league in 2024-25.

This season, he has netted just seven goals and registered four assists in his 42 appearances across all competitions.

The report continued to state that Al-Hilal are also interested in Luis Diaz, whose future is unknown as he enters the last two years of his current deal.  

Diaz arrived from Porto midway through the 2021-22 season, and won the Carabao Cup and FA Cup in his first four months at Anfield.

He has since won the Carabao Cup again and has starred under Slot this season to lead Liverpool to their 20th league title.

Mail Sport understands the Colombian winger is due to sit down with Liverpool chiefs to make a decision on his future this summer.

He has become a major asset under Slot due to his versatility, with the Dutch head coach happy to play him on the left wing or up front. ","{'href': 'https://www.dailymail.co.uk', 'title': 'Daily Mail'}","soccer"

The 2025 Europa League Final will be contested between two Premier League teams after Manchester United and Tottenham both booked their place on Thursday night. 

In a season that has seen both teams fall woefully short in the league, where they sit in 15th and 16th place, for one of them, the campaign could end with qualification for the Champions League. 

United came through 4-1 on the night to beat Athletic Bilbao 7-1 over the two ties, while Spurs 2-0 win in Norway meant they overcame Bodo/Glimt 5-1 across the two legs. 

They will now meet in Bilbao at the end of the month, but speaking exclusively to DAZN News, thanks to talkSPORT BET, Ally McCoist thinks it's difficult to pick a winner from the inconsistent pair. 

""For me, that's the flip of the coin. It really is,"" McCoist said. 

""I couldn't split them. Maddison would be a massive miss for Tottenham. There's no doubt about it. Bruno (Fernandes) turns up on the big occasions. So my first thought would be there would be a slight favouritism towards Manchester United because they're key players playing.

""But I probably think Spurs for no other reason than sometimes that's football, especially when big Ange is convinced he can win things in the second year.

""I actually said, believe it or not, I said about six, seven weeks ago that it wouldn't surprise me if they did win that tournament. So I would stick with that hunch, and it's nothing more than a hunch.

""Because of the form of both sides, you could argue United's form in Europe has been slightly better than Spurs, even though the last two results for Tottenham have been very, very good.

There are four clubs from Africa among the 32 teams that have qualified for the FIFA Club World Cup, which will kick off on June 15.

World football's governing body FIFA are hoping the new-look Club World Cup, which will be hosted in the United States next month, will mark a new era for the game and develop a four-yearly competition that has as much relevance and reverence as the World Cup for national teams.

Africa will play a part in the new vision: there are four clubs from the continent among the 32 teams that have qualified for the tournament, which will kick off on June 15.

It includes Mamelodi Sundowns, who are through to this season's African Champions League final later in May and will be hoping to make some impact on the new-look Club World Cup.

It is a momentous opportunity for a South African side, rubbing shoulders with the most successful club sides from across the globe over the last years.

Egypt's Al Ahly, Wydad Casablanca from Morocco and Esperance of Tunisia are the other three African clubs who have qualified on the basis of their performances in the last four years of the African Champions League competition.

In their group, Sundowns have been drawn against Borussia Dortmund, who were runners-up in the UEFA Champions League last season; Rio de Janeiro giants Fluminense and Ulsan from South Korea.

It will be something of an upset if the Pretoria club progress past the first stage but even if they return home without a win, the tournament promises to be a massive learning curve and its financial spin off means Sundowns are set to continue their long-standing hegemony on the local scene.

They will reportedly receive a minimum of $9-million for participating in the tournament, with more money on offer for any victories they might achieve; $2 million is paid for winning group stage games, $7.5 million for playing in the round of 16 and $40 million to the team that wins the final at MetLife Stadium near New York on July 13.

FIFA aims to share $250 million among clubs worldwide who did not qualify for the tournament. But it is not yet clear how many clubs will be paid, or how much they will get.

The $1 billion Club World Cup prize pot is more than double the $440 million that FIFA shared among the 32 federations whose teams played at the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, further proof of their desire to make this new project work.

It is massive money for Sundowns to continue to buy the best players and extend their record-breaking run of championship success in South Africa's Premier Soccer League.

Smirnoff maker Diageo has been named the official tournament supporter of next year's Fifa World Cup.

As for what this entails, the London-headquartered company will be able to leverage its big spirits brands – Tequila brands Casamigos and Don Julio, Scotch whiskies Buchanan's and Johnnie Walker, and Smirnoff vodka – through activations, on-the-ground initiatives and retail campaigns at next summer's tournament.

The international football tournament, also the world's most viewed sporting event, will take place across Canada, Mexico and the US from 11 June to 19 July 2026, with games held across host 16 cities.

Diageo's presence at the World Cup will highlight responsible drinking and community celebration, with its activations being ‘fan-focused'.

Chief marketing officer at Diageo, Cristina Diezhandino, said: “We are proud to deepen our partnership with sports by bringing our unmatched portfolio to toast the Fifa World Cup '26.

“Football is the world's biggest sport and with this tournament set to be the biggest in its history, we see this as a unique opportunity to celebrate with fans in new and meaningful ways.”

Chief business officer at Fifa, Romy Gai, added: “We are delighted to welcome Diageo as an official tournament supporter to the Fifa World Cup '26 commercial programme.

“It's great to be teaming up with the global leader in spirits for the biggest celebration of football ever. Through this agreement, Diageo will create unparalleled experiences for the fans that promote responsible celebration on the world's biggest stage.”

Away from sport, Diageo has recently come under fire with its Tequila brands.

Consumers Avi Pusateri and Chaim Mishulovin, and Japanese-inspired restaurant Sushi Tokyo, filed a lawsuit against Diageo North America this week, alleging the company falsely marketed its Tequila brands as ‘100% agave'.

Just over one year out from the FIFA World Cup 2026, United States President Donald Trump says there are no tensions between the co-hosting nations of the U.S., Canada and Mexico, which could pose issues to the tournament. 

Speaking alongside FIFA President Gianni Infantino while officially launching the FIFA World Cup Task Force, Trump insisted that there were no issues, despite an ongoing trade war and suggestions towards their northern neighbours that he would like to make Canada the “51st state.”

“I don't see any tension here, we get along very well with both,” he said, having met with newly-elected Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney earlier in the day. 

“We had a great meeting today,” he added. “It went very well. We had a very great meeting and no tension. We want to do what's right for respective peoples, and that's what's going to happen.”

The U.S. will have 11 cities hosting the tournament, accounting for 74 of the World Cup's 104 matches. Canada will host 13 games in Toronto and Vancouver, and Mexico the same number, shared between Mexico City, Monterrey and Guadalajara. 

It's the first time the tournament will be hosted in North America since the U.S. last hosted in 1994. 

Trump said that he and Carney spoke about the tournament during their meeting, the first between the two leaders since Carney's election on April 28, which reportedly focused primarily on international trade and Canada's sovereignty.

The President's tone with Carney, Canada's 24th Prime Minister, is a noted shift from his previous relationship with Canada's last Prime Minister, Justin Trudeau, whom Trump regularly called “Governor” before Trudeau resigned. 

In their Oval Office media availability earlier in the day, Carney diplomatically insisted to Trump in front of the cameras that Canada was “not for sale,” adding that it would “never” be the 51st state. Trump responded with “never say never,” while calling Carney –a former central banker– ""a very talented, very good person.”

Carney's statements, echoed largely by the Canadian public, are also shared by Canada men's national team head coach Jesse Marsch, who spoke about Trump's treatment of Canada ahead of March's Concacaf Nations League Finals.

“If I have one message to our president, it's lay off the ridiculous rhetoric about Canada being the 51st state,” Marsch said in February. “As an American, I'm ashamed of the arrogance and disregard that we've shown one of our historically oldest, strongest and most loyal allies.”

The primary message from Tuesday's meetings was that the U.S. would go to great lengths to ensure the tournament's success. 

Trump stated that the cooperation between the three nations is “total, complete...[The World Cup is] going to be perfect, it's going to be beautiful,” and that the U.S. is prepared to “not hold back” on security costs. 

However, cooperation between the three nations was far from the only topic discussed by the Task Force. The administration and Task Force were clear on the other priority: People and fans are welcome, but they must go home after the tournament. 

“We want everyone to come to America. We want everyone to spend a lot of money in America,” said Trump's Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy. “And so, if you're coming to see some soccer … go on a road trip, see America. Don't overstay your visa. Don't stay too long.”

With the World Cup set to kick off on June 11, 2026, all eyes will be on the organizers and governments putting the tournament together, as well as the national teams of all three nations, which aim to make deep runs as co-hosts.

Fabio Fognini was the Italian number one for several years, leading the way for his country on the world's stage.

Italian tennis is in as good a place as ever, as the nation prepares to welcome back Jannik Sinner, who will return from suspension in Rome.

Sinner isn't the only Italian star ranked in the top ten, with Lorenzo Musetti reaching a career-high rank of ninth following his run to the last four of the Madrid Open.

However, before Sinner and Musetti rose to the top, it was Fognini flying the flag for Italy, producing several stand-out performances on clay.

The world number 107 is set to retire from tennis at some point in 2025 and has just played his final match at the Italian Open.

Speaking after Fognini's defeat to Jacob Fearnley, one ATP Tour legend revealed what the 37-year-old was really like behind the scenes.

On the Tennis Channel Live Podcast, 2003 US Open champion Andy Roddick gave his verdict on Fognini.

“He was the last guy I beat,” said Roddick.

“It's funny, you have some people who how they are on court does not really tell the entire story.

“I do not know if I ever saw a bad moment with Fabio [Fognini] when he wasn't between the lines

“He had a lot of disagreements with a lot of players. We both got along famously. 

“We both had a little edge to us when we played.”

Roddick beat Fognini in both of their two ATP Tour meetings, the last of which was the American's final victory before retiring at Flushing Meadows 13 years ago.

The former world number one went on to explain how well the pair got on off the court.

“Off the court, easy to talk to, always up for a joke, willing to laugh at himself if he had done something crazy a couple of days earlier,” said Roddick.

“He was always in on the joke with himself. I always really got along and had a lot of respect for Fognini.”

Prior to 2019, Fognini had won eight tour-level titles, (seven ATP 250s), (one ATP 500).

Using all of his clay court experience, Fognini broke through at the Masters 1000 level six years ago, to win title number nine.

Traveling to the principality as the 13th seed, everything fell into place as the Italian stormed into the semi-finals of the Monte-Carlo Masters.

Andrey Rublev, Alexander Zverev, and Borna Coric were all no match for Fognini as he booked his place in the last four, where he faced off against the tournament's greatest ever player, and three-time defending champion.

When Fognini took to the court against Rafael Nadal he did so against an 11-time champion and someone who hadn't lost in Monaco for 1,463 days.

Never one to shy away from the big occasion, Fognini produced arguably the greatest performance of his tennis career.

Dismantling the Spaniard in straight sets, Fognini shocked the tennis world by qualifying for his first Masters 1000 final.

In one of the most unlikely finals in recent memory, Fognini came face to face with unseeded Serb, Dusan Lajovic, who himself had shocked both Dominic Thiem and Daniil Medvedev in Monte-Carlo.

Producing another vintage display, Fognini won in straight sets, 6-3, 6-4, to lift his one and only Masters 1000 title.

The 37-year-old hasn't returned to an ATP final since, but will never forget what happened six years ago at the Monte-Carlo Masters.

After losing his opening match in Rome, Fognini is next scheduled to appear at a Challenger Tour event in Turin, Italy, which begins on May 12.

DID YOU KNOW❓By reaching the final of the ATP 500 event in Munich today, 🇺🇸 @BenShelton has become the first American man to make a clay court final above ATP 250 level since Andre Agassi at Rome in 2002. 💥That was 5 months before Shelton was born:https://t.co/vXKNPOToUJ

Ben Shelton, United States (world No. 13)The 22-year-old American's biggest results have come on hard courts—both of his Grand Slam semifinals (one at the US Open and one at the Australian Open), his other Grand Slam quarterfinal (at the Australian Open), all three of his Masters 1000 quarterfinals, and his biggest career title at the ATP 500 event in Tokyo two years ago.But like Paul, Shelton has been getting more and more dangerous on clay, winning the title in Houston last year and, just a few weeks ago, reaching the final of the ATP 500 clay-court event in Munich—that was the biggest clay-court final an American man has reached since before he was even born, since Andre Agassi won Rome in 2002.If it doesn't happen for him during the rest of the clay-court season or the grass-court season, he'll definitely be one to watch in the summer.

Arthur Fils, France (world No. 14)The only other man in the Top 15 without a big title is Arthur Fils, but if his trajectory keeps going the way it is, that could change at any time.At just 20 years old, and having only played his first full year on the tour in 2023, he's already captured three career titles, including two ATP 500s at Hamburg and Tokyo last year—one on clay, one on hard. He reached his first second week at a major last year too, at Wimbledon.But it's his results at Masters 1000s this year that have propelled him into the Top 15 for the first time—he reached the quarterfinals of Indian Wells, Miami and Monte Carlo, which actually made him the youngest player to reach the quarterfinals of the first three Masters 1000 events of the year since Masters 1000 tournaments began in 1990.The question for Fils isn't if he'll win a big title, it's just how soon.Honorable MentionsOutside the Top 15, there are plenty of active players who've reached big finals before but who are still seeking their first big title.Some have even reached multiple big finals: Matteo Berrettini with two (Madrid, Wimbledon); David Goffin with two (ATP Finals, Cincinnati); Nick Kyrgios also with two (Cincinnati, Wimbledon); Gael Monfils with three (Paris, Paris and Monte Carlo); Kei Nishikori with five (Madrid, US Open, Miami, Canada and Monte Carlo); and Milos Raonic also with five (Canada, Paris, Indian Wells, Wimbledon, Cincinnati).There's also Richard Gasquet, a three-time Masters 1000 finalist with 16 career titles all at the ATP 250 level. The Frenchman doesn't have much time left, though—he's set to retire at Roland Garros in a few weeks.And finally, a trio of current Top 30 players—Frances Tiafoe, Felix Auger-Aliassime and Denis Shapovalov—all former Top 10 players who've been to a Masters 1000 final before. The two Canadians have also both won ATP 500s—Shapovalov one, Auger-Aliassime three.

Carlos Alcaraz recorded a Tour-leading 25th win of the season on Friday at the Internazionali BNL d'Italia in Rome, where he returned from injury with a 6-3, 6-3 victory against Dusan Lajovic.

The Spaniard missed the ATP Masters 1000 event in Madrid last month due to an adductor injury and played with a precautionary knee wrap during his opening match in Rome against Lajovic. However, the 22-year-old moved freely on Campo Centrale and outclassed his Serbian opponent with his combination of power and touch.

""The body is feeling great,"" said Alcaraz, who celebrated his birthday on Monday. ""I moved well and made a few good sprints today without any pain and that is great. It was a test for me and I think I passed the test. I tried to feel more comfortable on the court. Moving and not thinking about the injury.""

Alcaraz struck 20 winners in his 82-minute win and now leads Lajovic 5-0 in the pair's Lexus ATP Head2Head series. He will next meet Laslo Djere after the Serbian beat Estoril champion Alex Michelsen 6-0, 6-3.

The third seed is chasing his third trophy of the year and second at Masters 1000 level, having triumphed on clay in Monte-Carlo.

Alcaraz, who did not compete in Rome last year due to injury, is first in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin and will aim to maintain his advantage over second-placed Jack Draper and third-placed Alexander Zverev with a deep run in Italy.







Lorenzo Musetti continued his impressive form by downing qualifier Otto Virtanen 6-3, 6-2 in 86 minutes.
Musetti delighted the home crowd with his stunning passes and now holds a 18-4 record on clay since the Paris Olympics last July, when he won the bronze medal. A finalist in Monte-Carlo and a semi-finalist in Madrid, the Italian has produced his best level at the clay-court ATP Masters 1000 events this season. The World No. 9 will next take on American Brandon Nakashima.
Earlier, Italian Francesco Passaro continued his unbeaten record against Top 30 opponents with a 7-5, 6-3 victory against Grigor Dimitrov.
The wild card was impressive behind his first serve, winning 83 per cent of points according to Infosys ATP Stats, while he rallied from a break down in the first set to the delight of the home crowd. After improving to 4-0 against Top 30 players, Passaro will next play Karen Khachanov, who beat Roman Andres Burruchaga 6-4, 5-7, 6-1.

Arthur Fils had few issues in his Rome opener, dispatching Tallon Griekspoor 6-2, 6-2 to reach the third round in Rome for the first time. The Frenchman, who leads Griekspoor 3-1 in the pair's Lexus ATP Head2Head series, will next face Stefanos Tsitsipas.
Tsitsipas downed Alexandre Muller 6-2, 7-6(3) to reach the third round. The Greek, who has reached the quarter-finals in five of his past seven Rome appearances, has won 14 of his past 15 matches against players outside the Top 20 in the PIF ATP Rankings.
Daniil Medvedev, a champion in Rome in 2023, beat Cameron Norrie 6-4, 6-2. Medvedev will play Alexei Popyrin in the third round after the Aussie beat Spaniard Carlos Taberner 6-1, 7-6(4).

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=roland+garros+tennis","Novak Djokovic takes Geneva Open wildcard as part of French Open preparations","https://www.bbc.com/sport/tennis/articles/cvg75vpn7gro","Fri, 09 May 2025 12:58:46 GMT","

Djokovic has lost three matches in a row after early exits in Monte Carlo and Madrid

Novak Djokovic has taken a wildcard to play the upcoming Geneva Open as he looks to find form and match fitness before the French Open.

Djokovic, who is aiming for a standalone record 25th Grand Slam title in Paris, pulled out of this week's Italian Open.

The 37-year-old Serb has lost his past three matches after early exits at clay-court events in Monte Carlo and Madrid last month.

Djokovic did not give a reason for missing the ATP Masters tournament in Rome - where he is a six-time champion.

Now the three-time French Open champion has decided to return to Geneva in an effort to spend more time on the red dirt before heading to Roland Garros.

Briton Fearnley reaches Italian Open second round

It has been a patchy season by Djokovic's high standards. 

A positive start saw him reach the Australian Open semi-finals, although he had to pull out injured against Germany's Alexander Zverev after losing the first set.

The world number six, who turns 38 this month, lost three matches in a row on his comeback before rediscovering form at the Miami Open.

However, he was overwhelmed by powerful Czech teenager Jakub Mensik in the final, costing him another chance to win his 100th ATP title.

Overall, he has won 12 of his 19 matches this season and hopes to improve that record in Geneva.

Last year, Djokovic reached the semi-finals on his first appearance in the Swiss city.

He went on to reach the Roland Garros quarter-finals, but had to withdraw from his last-eight match against Casper Ruud with a knee injury picked up in the previous round.

Norway's Ruud, who beat Britain's Jack Draper in the Madrid final on Sunday, is also in this year's Geneva field, along with American world number four Taylor Fritz.

The ATP 250 event begins on 18 May, with the French Open starting a week later on 25 May.

Italian feeling like he belongs as makes top-10 debut

Four years ago, a teenaged Lorenzo Musetti enjoyed an impressive Grand Slam main draw debut at Roland-Garros.

The then 19-year-old Italian stormed to the fourth round in Paris, and led a top-ranked Novak Djokovic by two sets to love before he eventually retired late in the fifth.

Ahead of the start of that 2021 tournament, Musetti got a chance to hit with Spanish legend Rafael Nadal on the practice courts at the nearby Jean Bouin facility, just down the road from Roland-Garros.

“I remember I lost, like, 6-1 against him. And I was a little bit scared, playing against him,” Musetti recalls.

That feeling, and those days, must feel like a lifetime ago for Musetti, who this week has entered the top-10 in the world rankings for the first time, landing at No.9.

Over the past couple of seasons, Musetti strengthened his belief that he belonged amongst the world's best.

Last year, he had an excellent grass-court campaign, reaching the semi-finals in Stuttgart, the final at Queens, and his first Grand Slam semi-final at Wimbledon.

“Honestly, it was a little bit of a surprise, I would say, because I didn't experience so much grass. But when I started playing on grass, I always fell in love with it,” Musetti told rolandgarros.com in a recent interview.

“And I see some similarities on grass with clay, I would say, because now grass is not like 30 years ago that was so fast that you cannot have a rally. Of course, serve and return are really important, much more than on the clay. But I think with the slice, with all the variations that I have in my background, I can really use it as a weapon. So I really love to play on both, honestly.”

This spring, Musetti is perhaps putting together a similarly impressive run, but on clay – the surface he grew up on – with a final at the Masters 1000 in Monte-Carlo and semis at the Madrid Open under his belt heading into his home tournament in Rome.

Those results have helped the 23-year-old lock down his place in the top 10, a career milestone he always dreamed of.

“I think the level that I'm showing this year and I would say also the last year, it confirmed my level and the consistency that I showed, especially last year. It probably gave me that extra motivation and confidence of deserving where I am today,” said the talented Tuscan.

Musetti told reporters in Rome he will try to “keep the momentum alive” starting with his opener against Finnish qualifier Otto Virtanen.

While he feels not much will change now that he is a top-10 player, he knows that mentally, things might be a bit different.

“Making final of a Masters 1000, like in Monte-Carlo, with a lot of ups and down during my matches, then stopped one week, almost two because I played in the weekend of the second week. Going through the Madrid Open to the semi-finals without losing a set, it's a confirmation of my level, of my mentality I would say, because the top 10 mentality is of course, you try not to lose with somebody who is lower than you, you know?” he explained.

“It was something that I was feeling when I was outside, when I was 50 or whatever. Playing against a top 10 is something different. Is something different even if you win against top 10. Now I feel the opposite, of course.”

As a crafty player with lots of variety in his game, Musetti feels he has fully grasped the true identity of his playing style, and steps on court with a purpose.

He hopes march to the final four at Wimbledon last year will help him have a successful Roland-Garros, a place where he has already made the second week twice.

“My best results in Paris were the two times fourth round. And honestly, my goal this year and my expectations are to set the goal a little bit higher. But I just don't want to think too much in the future,” he says.

“I had the experience in Wimbledon and the positive thing that I had in Wimbledon was the mentality that I was playing match by match and I was not looking too much forward. So definitely I will try to experience the same.”

Wimbledon 2024 isn't the only positive experience Musetti can draw on when it comes to Roland-Garros.

On Parisian clay later in the summer, the Italian secured a bronze medal at the Olympics, becoming the first from his country to make the podium in tennis in the history of the Games. His compatriots Sara Errani and Jasmine Paolini went two steps better and clinched gold in women's doubles a day later.

“I always felt great in the conditions of Roland-Garros. And even if it was like two months later, I definitely felt great also at the Olympics,” he said.

“It was probably my best achievement so far in my career. Probably the most emotional, I would say. So, having great memories, I think it's not bad to have that in mind when you play.”

Halfway through his fifth year on tour, Musetti is feeling like a seasoned player.

“I remember when I was really, really fresh on tour and when it was my first year or the first two years, where every tournament that you play is new. You've never been there. You don't know the people, the condition, the hotels, the city,” he recalls.

“Now, I don't want to say that I'm a veteran, but I saw a lot of things and, of course, a lot of things changed. I became a father. I have a family to handle. So a lot more responsibility, even on the human side. But they brought me a better version, I think, of myself also into the court.”

Musetti and his partner Veronica Confalonieri welcomed their first child, Ludovico a little over a year ago.

He says being a father has inspired him to embrace the idea of being a role model to others. 

“Probably having more responsibilities and becoming a sort of example, not just for my kid, but also for all the kids that watch tennis and they dream about becoming a professional tennis player or they love the sport,” he says when asked how fatherhood has changed him.

“Try to be an example also on the court, on the court and off the court. That's my main goal, I would say.”

Given that's his goal, it's no surprise that what Musetti was proud of the most about his runner-up showing in Monte-Carlo was his attitude; more than anything else.

“It's easy. The spirit that I showed on the court, I think. The fighter that I showed up in Monte-Carlo was really surprising also for me. And I would say that I need to be more like that during my career, during hopefully all my seasons,” he concludes.","{'href': 'https://www.rolandgarros.com', 'title': 'Roland-Garros'}","tennis"

Clay is typically a surface that is an Achilles heel for American tennis players, but not for Coco Gauff. 

The 21-year-old has enjoyed success on the red courts with the French Open looming, she wants to go a step further on a surface she feels 'comfortable on.'

When it comes to Grand Slam singles finals, Gauff is split between hard and clay courts, having finished runner-up at the 2022 French Open and won the US Open in 2023.

Iga Swiatek triumphed at Roland Garos three years ago -- one of four titles in Paris. But having now demolished the Pole at the Madrid Open, Gauff will feel every bit confident she can go even further this year.

Especially while playing the best she ever has on clay.

“When I was younger, I always thought my best surface was hard, and then I got on tour, and I thought my best surface was on clay, and then the US Open, and I was like maybe it is hard!” Gauff told Tennis Channel.

“But I don't know, there's something about clay that I have always felt comfortable on. I feel like this year, more than ever, I am moving the best that I have, especially so early in the clay season.""

Gauff is in somewhat of a slump by her own very high standards after failing to win a title and suffering multiple early exits in tournaments this year.

Off the back of losing in the quarter-finals to Padula Badosa at the Australian Open in January, Gauff lost back-to-back first-round matches at the Qatar Open and Dubai Championships.

The sunshine double saw a slight improvement, but she wasn't able to get past the third round at Indian Wells and the Miami Open. 

So the clay swing has come at the perfect time as the American bids to win her first title in 2025, and she has settled in straight away,

The 21-year-old reached the quarterfinals in Stuttgart before reaching the Madrid Open final, where she fought a spirited match but ultimately lost to Aryna Sabalenka. 

Gauff has admitted that she's found her groove on clay and is happy to be producing results ahead of the French Open.

""I usually really don't find it [movement] until Roland Garros, but I feel like I have found it here [Madrid],"" Gauff added. 

“It's a really physical surface and I think if you are not physically ready it kind of exposes you and I think it rewards me because I am a physical player and I do like to move and I can be aggressive, but also sit there and grind if I have to.”

Clay has often been a burial for American stars, but Gauff has reversed the trend with her results at the French Open. 

Two semi-finals and a final in Paris, along with a doubles title in 2024, is success she can be proud of at the age of 21. 

Only three of Serena Williams' 23 majors came at the French Open, and she is still the last American to win the title in Paris since 2015.

While an American man hasn't won a French Open singles title since 1999, when Andre Agassi beat Andrei Medvedev. 

Players from the USA tend to struggle on the surface as a result of the lack of opportunities to play on the red clay used in European tournaments like the French Open at a grassroots level.

Many of the already limited number of clay courts in the United States are fast, low-bounce versions -- the polar opposite of those from across the pond.

Nonetheless, there is every bit of chance that Gauff could be the one to end the decade-long wait for an American champion at the French Open this year.

During the 2025 edition of the Parisian Grand Slam, We Are Tennis by BNP Paribas is shining the spotlight on the ball kids and their adventures with a brand-new online reality show!

The official sponsor of Roland-Garros' ball kids for over 50 years*, BNP Paribas, via its We Are Tennis platform, is inviting viewers to follow the daily lives of these young tennis fans in the “Ball Kids Academy” programme. Their back story, their missions, their emotions: dive into the heart of this special tribe and step behind the scenes of this unique experience!

Every year, 300 young tennis fans (chosen from 6,000 candidates!) experience a unique three-week adventure at the Porte d'Auteuil. Essential to the smooth running of the tournament, the ball kids experience some outstanding moments, both on and off the clay courts.  

In addition to showcasing their remarkable performances on court, Ball Kids Academy immerses viewers in the life of a ball kid, as six representatives from the class of 2025 (Antoine, Artemis, Constance, Lola, Louis and Sacha) share their daily antics on Instagram, TikTok and YouTube, from 15th May to 8th June. In honest, no-filter daily interviews, they talk about their happy and sadder moments, their stories and even their hopes and fears throughout the duration of the competition. 

Whether it is their first time or they have already taken part – like Louis, who is a ball kid for the third year in a row, and was even on duty for the 2023 women's final and the 2024 men's final – this event already promises to be unforgettable!

This new programme – which will be broadcast every day and is presented by the creators of the “Mayadorable et Jules” content, nicknamed “Les Pachas” – will also be an opportunity to learn more about the staff who look after the ball kids, particularly Arthur Bongrand, their manager. 

Players and celebrities will also make an appearance in the show, including the patron of this year's team, none other than three-time Grand Slam winner Stan Wawrinka. “I'm delighted to be the patron of Ball Kids Academy and I'm proud to be part of this venture,” said the winner of Roland-Garros 2015. “This initiative, launched by BNP Paribas, highlights the passion of these 300 youngsters, and I think it's nice to show that because they deserve it. Having seen them in action every year at Roland-Garros, I can assure you they do an incredible job!”

Finally, Elise Hermant (Communications Manager for the BNP Paribas Group) will be Programme Director and will provide the young cast of the show with all the support they need.

Head to the We Are Tennis by BNP Paribas networks on 15th May to watch the exciting story of our ball kids!

Tennis legend Kim Clijsters has spoken out in admiration of Serena Williams, highlighting what she sees as an underappreciated chapter in the 23-time Grand Slam champion's storied career—her remarkable return to tennis after giving birth. Reflecting on her own career and the era she played in, Clijsters expressed deep pride in sharing the court with some of the sport's most iconic names.

“When you think back about it now it's amazing and the women that we had growing up too - Steffi Graf, Monica Seles, Lindsay Davenport I mean she was so important for me also,” said Kim Clijsters in a recent podcast.

However, one name stood out for Clijsters and that was Serena Williams. Clijsters even recalled the first match she ever played against Serena, which she ended up losing and Serena went on to win her first US open.

“My first US open I qualified and played against Serena in the second round and that was her first US open title and she ended up being the GOAT in our sport right?” said Clijsters.

Clijsters also mentioned how Serena's achievements after she came back from child birth, were underappreciated. Clijsters as we all know is the only WTA player in the open era to win a grand slam as a mother. Many expected Serena would be the one to extend that list to two. However, she failed to do so, falling short of just one match multiple times. She made it to four grand slam finals- twice at US open and Wimbledon, falling short all 4 times.

“I feel very fortunate that we had great rivalries and seeing Venus and Serena develop into just multiple Grand Slam champions, especially Serena being what she did after she you know had her daughter and coming back and being so close to winning more titles was, I feel like doesn't get enough recognition, but yeah, I'm very very proud to be part of that generation,” stated Clijsters.

With multiple mothers competing in the top 50 of the current WTA roster, it remains to be seen if anyone joins Kim Clijsters on the elite list.","{'href': 'https://sports.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Sports'}","tennis"

Brad Gilbert is one of the sport's most legendary tennis coaches, leading several players to Grand Slam glory.

The American began his coaching career in 1994, working alongside Andre Agassi for eight years, helping him achieve great success.

Moving on in 2002, Gilbert joined Andy Roddick's team as he rose to number one in the world rankings.

A short stint working with Andy Murray followed, with Gilbert guiding the Scot into the top ten back in 2007.

During the late 2000s and 2010s, the 63-year-old helped several players, including Alex Bogdanovic, Kei Nishikori, and Sam Querrey, before returning to full-time coaching in 2023.

Gilbert coached American star Coco Gauff for over a year, helping her win the biggest titles of her young career.

Now working in the media following Gilbert's departure from Gauff's team, he has highlighted the key differences between coaching Agassi, Roddick, and Murray.

Appearing as a guest on the Tennis Channel, Gilbert reflected on the time he spent coaching Roddick and Agassi, explaining how the reverse psychology he used on the former would've had the latter ban him from the courts.

“Andy [Roddick] is a unique character. Especially going from Andre [Agassi] to coaching Andy,” he said.

“Andy is like the Metallica song Fuel to the Fire. That's Andy. Whatever you say, he is going to say the opposite. That is his bravado and how you would pump him up.

“Andre, you could talk for three hours the night before. With Andy, you might get 10 seconds, like Mission Impossible, this message is going to implode. He is just how he is.

“Quite a few times with him, I would do my best coaching when literally I wanted him to play the forehand. I would tell him to play the backhand. Then he would look up at me in the stands and tell me how wrong I was when the guy was missing forehands.

“But if I did that with Andre, he would be like don't come to the courts. That is the nuance that you have to learn in coaching every player that you coach.”

Gilbert went on to explain what it was like coaching Murray and highlighted just how detail-oriented the three-time Major champion was.

“Andy Murray, I would give him the game plan, and he would always, no matter what, ask why? How did you come to this conclusion?, Where are your 1000 words? Where is your data?” he said.

“I am like, I just think of this s— and give it to you! I am not going to get into too much detail.

“But no matter what, he would ask why, how did you come to this, what about if you're wrong?”

As one of the sport's most experienced coaches, Gilbert knows all too well how every player is different in how they approach the game.

“Part of being a coach is that you set a game plan, and sometimes it doesn't work. Sometimes your opponent has the answer,” said Gilbert.

“But you have to be willing to make changes and find things.

“It's the communication that is really important, but I found with all the different players that I have worked with that the communication lines can be completely different with each player that you coach.”

Three players won Grand Slam titles with Gilbert as their coach, as the American guided many to the top of the game.

Gilbert enjoyed the majority of his coaching success working with Agassi between 1994 and 2002.

Agassi won six Major titles during this period, enjoying multiple stints as world number one.

The eight-time Major champion once described Gilbert as the ‘Greatest coach of all time'.

Joining Roddick's team in 2003, the pair quickly found success together, as the big-serving star won his sole Major title in New York a few months later.

Roddick beat Juan Carlos Ferrero to win the 2003 US Open title, ascending to number one in the world rankings shortly after.

They qualified for one further Grand Slam final together at Wimbledon in 2004, before parting ways later that same year.

Gilbert ended his 20-year wait for an eighth Grand Slam title as a coach when Gauff beat Aryna Sabalenka in the final of the 2023 US Open.

The WTA star had enjoyed a fantastic summer on North American hard courts since Gilbert joined her team, winning in Washington and Cincinnati prior to her maiden Major victory at Flushing Meadows.

Failing to defend her title in 2024, Gilbert and Gauff parted ways, with the 63-year-old now enjoying time away from the sport.

It remains to be seen if Gilbert chooses to return to coaching, but he certainly won't be short of suitors, should he decide to do so.","{'href': 'https://www.thetennisgazette.com', 'title': 'The Tennis Gazette'}","tennis"

Emma Raducanu to face world No 50 and former finalist Veronika Kudermetova in third round of Italian Open in Rome; watch all the action from the ATP and WTA Tours on Sky Sports Tennis and Sky Sports+, NOW and the Sky Sports app

Emma Raducanu produced an impressive 6-2 6-2 victory over lucky loser Jil Teichmann to reach the third round of the Italian Open in Rome.

Raducanu originally was scheduled to play Ekaterina Alexandrova but the 21st seed pulled out before the match with a right shoulder injury, replaced by Switzerland's Teichmann, who lost in the last round of qualifying to Hailey Baptiste.

The former US Open champion served well, hitting six aces and facing only one break point.

""To be honest it was pretty mental, as I was warming up for my match against Alexandrova and, all of a sudden, I get told I'm playing Jil,"" Raducanu told Sky Sports Tennis.

""On top of that she's a left, so a completely different challenge. Honestly, I haven't practised with a lefty and haven't played one since February.

""I'm really proud of myself for how I fought through. This is her favourite surface.""

""The first few games I was adjusting to the way the ball curls, but I'm really proud of myself. I fought through and I'm really proud of how I came through that.""

Raducanu turned in a thoroughly accomplished performance to cruise past the Swiss. Although ranked 94th in the world she has been as high as 21 in the past but could not match Raducanu's power and tempo in a one-sided contest that saw the 22-year-old break twice in each set and hold her own increasingly impressive serve throughout.

Raducanu defended resolutely from the baseline, hit a handful of line-hugging forehand winners and racked up six aces, including a fiery effort down the middle to seal the match in one hour and 22 minutes to set up a clash against world No 50 Veronika Kudermetova.

With her latest coach Mark Petchey watching on alongside mentor Jane Donoghue, she grew effortlessly into her work.

Discussing how she has changed her service action, Raducanu said: ""If you look at my serve now compared to Australia, compared to the Middle East, even Miami, I changed it after Miami with some tweaks and it's a completely different motion. I'm trying to make it a bit more fluid, a bit longer, so it's hopefully more robust under pressure, but it's by no means a finished product.

""I feel there's so much more room to grow it. I think this way I can maximise the potential.""

As for how she feels on the clay, Raducanu admitted she was slowly warming to it.

""I still don't really feel comfortable on clay but in a way it helps me because I have to be super focused on every single point, just getting my feet right and to try and not fall over, so it is a big challenge,"" she said.

""The points are long, the balls do get heavier, and when I was serving it out, it was getting slower and slower, so it is physical but I'm slowly finding my feet.""

It was just Raducanu's third match of the season on clay - and only the 20th of her entire career.

Russian Kudermetova defeated American Amanda Anisimova, the No 15 seed, 7-6 (7-5) 7-5 to move through to a meeting with Raducanu this weekend.

Miles Maclagan speaking on Sky Sports Tennis:

""It really was [an impressive performance]. Without getting carried away it's a player just inside the top 100 who has already lost this week but Raducanu answered every question that was asked of her. A really positive performance.

""She was aggressive, kept her foot on the pedal throughout on a day when things could have got tricky.

""She'll take some stopping if she continues that kind of form.""

Marion Bartoli speaking on Sky Sports Tennis:

""I think she's moving better which is crucial on clay. The surface is lively and you're sliding all over the place so you need to get your legs extremely strong. You need to feel the ground really well and when I look at her muscle from the lower body she has been really putting in the work in the gym, which is probably why she decided to take a break after Miami to get those hours in the gym to make sure she was physically ready for the clay and grass too.""

On her coaching set up, the former Wimbledon champion said: ""Emma is probably looking for a coach who is not too technical. She will really need someone on the court with her every day if she wants to work on her technique. She's probably wanting someone to explain to her how the tactics work for that specific opponent.

""They had to reposition her around the court because she had to cover the left side of the court [against Teichmann] so when you have the experience of someone as Mark, you can bring that on the table very quickly and sometimes that takes away the stress from the player.

""I think that's what she's looking for in that dynamic. She's going to her box quite often with eye contact which means she trusts the people inside that box.""

Cameron Norrie had no answers for 10th seed Daniil Medvedev as he was knocked out in the second round in Rome.

Norrie was handed a lucky loser lifeline after failing to make it through qualification and took his chance with a straight-sets victory over Christopher O'Connell in the opening round.

But he was unable to keep pace with the 2023 champion on Friday afternoon, succumbing 6-4 6-2. The Russian broke his British opponent four times and wrapped up a clinical victory with back-to-back aces.

He will now move on to face Australia's Alexei Popyrin in the last 32.

In the women's draw, Sonay Kartal was also ousted in the second round. Having come from behind to beat Kimberly Birrell in her previous match, she fell 6-4 6-2 at the hands of 30th seed Linda Noskova.

Kartal struggled consistently to hold serve, being broken five times across the two sets and clawing two back in response.

Tiger Woods' teenage son Charlie fell at the first hurdle in his bid to qualify for next month's US Open.

The 16-year-old was one of 10,202 golfers who entered the 125th US Open and Woods Jr. this week began the long road to Oakmont in Pennsylvania.

He took part in one of the regional qualifying events, teeing it up at Wellington Golf Club in Florida. But Woods' score of three-over-par was not good enough to progress.

Only a handful of players from each event make it through to final qualifying and Woods finished seven shots off the four-under-par cutoff.

It nevertheless marked a huge improvement on last year, when Woods finished nine-over-par in his bid to reach the 2024 tournament.

Charlie did qualify for his first US Junior Amateur Championship last year but failed to reach the match play knockout stages.

Back in March, meanwhile, he joined Donald Trump's granddaughter Kai in the field at the Sage Valley Junior Invitational. Woods finished 20 shots off the eventual winner.

Charlie is the eldest son of Tiger Woods, a three-time US Open champion who is recovering from surgery on a ruptured Achilles. 

Tiger and Charlie have teamed up for several events in recent years but neither will be in the field at Oakmont next month. 

Charlie was not the only big name who entered one of the 100-plus qualifying events around the country.

Former NFL quarterback Tony Romo, ex-tennis star Mardy Fish and New York Rangers player J.T. Miller are also among those hoping to reach Oakmont.

...

Following a clinical first-round victory (6-3,6-3) at the Rome Open, Carlos Alcaraz shared heartfelt praise for fellow rising star Jannik Sinner, highlighting the Italian's return to the tour as a major boost not just for him personally, but for the sport of tennis as a whole.

“It is great, honestly, to have him around for me, for me, it's great to have him back,” he said in an interview with Tennis Channel. “Honestly, I'm going to say I need him, you know, on the tour, because, I mean, he forces me to be a better player, to give 100% of me every day, just to be better,” he added.

Alcaraz said that, other than personal favoritism, he was also an advocate for growing tennis and that Sinner's absence was hurting tennis as a sport.

“And, of course, I defend always tennis, and I think tennis needs him as well,” he said. “You know, to bring, to bring new fans. You know, he's his tennis is huge. He's insane. I love watching him play. So having the chance to see him and watch his tennis again, it is great so I'm just, that really happy, but it's not a different feeling. Just, that it's great for me, for tennis and I'm sure for the fans here in Rome, it's a special thing,” he added.

Alcaraz said he was happy after his first match and that he exceeded his own expectations for the first round in Rome. “I'm happy with this first match. The most important thing was to test myself be able to play the way I want and that was what happened. I was able to sprint left and right and feel good. I'm confident for the rest of the week,” said Alcaraz during his post-match press conference.

For Mariano Navone, Saturday's second-round clash at the Internazionali BNL d'Italia in Rome represents more than just a match. He will step onto court against the World No. 1 Jannik Sinner.

The 24-year-old Argentine brushed aside #NextGenATP wild card Federico Cina on Thursday to seal his spot as Sinner's first opponent since the Italian completed a three-month period of ineligibility in a case resolution with WADA. It's a high-stakes opportunity, and Navone knows what's on offer.

“It's a big opportunity for me,” Navone told ATPTour.com in Rome. “To see how I can compare to him. It's not every day you can play against the best player in the world. I will have to play well from everywhere on the court, he hits good shots from anywhere: backhand, forehand…

“He has been out for three months, and is still No. 1 in the world. But this is why we play tennis, to play in the biggest stadiums in the world. It's not fun when you are playing in a small place, with just you and your coach.”



The No. 99 in the PIF ATP Rankings, Navone, who arrived in Rome with a 10-13 record in 2025, has endured a difficult start to the season by the high standards he set last year. He reached his first two ATP Tour finals in Rio and Bucharest before climbing to a career-high World No. 29 in 2024.

Despite being unable to defend those ranking points, Navone has been putting in the work and hopes to spring a surprise against Sinner, who will need to be alert early against the clay-court specialist.

Navone will undeniably be met with a boisterous Roman crowd, vying for his downfall. But it won't be the first time this year that he has played in such an electric atmosphere. The Argentine alluded to his clash with rising star Joao Fonseca in Buenos Aires in February, when he let slip two match points amid a raucous crowd in the capital.

“I don't remember that match too much, because I lost,” Navone said with a smile. “But the atmosphere was crazy. Argentine fans love this atmosphere, with lots of shouting… It's very good.

“I have been working hard. Last year, I had good results but it's difficult to defend the ranking points. I am No. 99, which is not the best, but it's good to be in the Top 100. I will continue to work hard, continue improving.”







Navone has been on a steady path over the past few years, and his quality was on full display on Thursday in Rome, where he dispatched Cina 6-3, 6-3 in their maiden Lexus ATP Head2Head clash. But the Argentine was full of praise for his 18-year-old opponent.
“When I looked at the draw, I checked Cina's results, because I saw him in Madrid, and not before,” said Navone. “But then if I can beat him, I play against Sinner, which is a very special match for me.
“He [Cina] is a guy that is going to have a good career and do good results.”

Arzel Mevellec: Challenger Tennis in AfricaCoulibaly's breakthrough comes at a pivotal moment for tennis in Africa, as the ATP Challenger Tour returned to sub-Saharan Africa after more than three decades. His title in Abidjan follows the establishment of new Challenger tournaments in Kigali, Rwanda and Brazzaville, Republic of Congo, driven by French tournament director Arzel Mevellec and his team.“I have my tournament in Quimper, a city situated on the west coast of France in Brittany,” Mevellec explained during the second edition of the Rwanda Challenger earlier this season. “One of my best friends went to Roland Garros and met a businessman from Rwanda. He asked if he knew someone who would be crazy enough to come to Kigali and think about organizing a professional tennis tournament. I directly called the ATP, and the director called me back after two minutes just to say: ‘If you go there, we will provide you with all the prize money and you will not pay a fee to organize a tournament.' The ATP has spent more than $500,000 in the last two years.”Mevellec described Africa as “a great subject of development for tennis,” noting that since 1990, there had been no Challenger tournaments in sub-Saharan Africa. “North African countries like Tunisia and Morocco are well connected to Europe. They have a couple of tournaments and many players. But in sub-Saharan Africa? Nothing.”

Small challenges – Big impactOrganizing professional tennis in the region brings unique challenges. “You are able to organize tournaments in France totally disconnected from the clubs. In Africa, you need to be connected to the local clubs. I think it's just a matter of culture,” Mevellec said. “We want to organize something like we did in Quimper, where the tournament has grown over the past years. We also want to support the locals, but we need to respect all the standards and ATP rules.”Sometimes, small details pose unexpected obstacles. “We struggle with details, for example food. For the locals it's often not that important but we need to provide special things for the players. Sometimes it's difficult to obtain what we want. We need to wait too long,” he explained.Every day I go to the players' restaurant and explain that the pasta is overcooked. That's something quite easy to obtain in Europe but they have to learn, and they want to learn. That's very important.

A symbol for the futureCoulibaly's triumph in Abidjan is more than a personal milestone - it's a symbol of the opportunities now opening for tennis players and fans across Africa. As the Challenger Tour plants roots in new regions, players like Coulibaly are showing what's possible.“I use the support from the ATP for my income, which means that I spent money in all of the countries but never received money from them,” Mevellec reflected. “I think we're on the right path. The players are happy. The fans are happy. And we're proving it can be done.”

Big titles—everyone wants them, but not everyone has them.For the men, “big titles” are the three highest levels of title: Grand Slams, the ATP Finals and Masters 1000s. The Olympic gold medal, which only comes around once every four years, also counts.They're not easy to come by, even for the best players in the world. For instance, until his triumph in Madrid last weekend, Casper Ruud was objectively the most accomplished active men's player without a big title, with a resume that included six previous big finals (including three Grand Slam finals), 12 career titles and a career-high ranking of No. 2.But with Ruud now removing himself from the list of best active men's players yet to win a big title, who are the new frontrunners?Here are the five biggest suspects at the moment—the five highest-ranked players on the ATP rankings seeking their first big title.

Alex de Minaur, Australia (world No. 8)Ruud bounced back into the Top 10—to No. 7—after winning Madrid, and you only have to go down one spot to find the new highest-ranked player seeking his first big title in No. 8-ranked De Minaur.De Minaur has firmly established himself as a top player over the last few years, reaching his first big final in Canada in 2023, falling to Jannik Sinner—he was two points away from another big final just a few weeks ago in Monte Carlo, falling to Lorenzo Musetti in a third set tie-break in the semifinals. He also has nine career titles, including two ATP 500s, and has reached the quarterfinals at the last four Grand Slams in a row—the only man other than Sinner to achieve that feat.Having gone deep at big events on every surface in the last few years, it's only a matter of time before he goes all the way at one of them.

Lorenzo Musetti, Italy (world No. 9)De Minaur isn't the only member of the Top 10 chasing his first big title—Musetti, who just made his Top 10 debut at No. 9, is on the hunt too.The Italian rising star has come close over the last month—he made his first big final in Monte Carlo, falling to Carlos Alcaraz in three sets, and another semifinal in Madrid last week, falling to Jack Draper. He has two career titles, including an ATP 500, and—like De Minaur—he's shown he's more than capable of doing it on any surface, having reached his first Grand Slam semifinal at Wimbledon last year.Having won 18 of his last 22 matches on clay, Musetti might take his name off this list sooner than we think, in Rome or even in Paris...

Tommy Paul reaches the fourth round for the first time in Madrid 🏄#MMOpen pic.twitter.com/mwP7a1mMCq

Tommy Paul, United States (world No. 12)The American may not have been to a big final yet, but he's come close several times in the last few years, reaching two big semifinals in 2023 (Australian Open and Canada) and another two in 2024 (Indian Wells and Rome). He's been to another five big quarterfinals, too.There's no reason he can't win his first big title in the next few months, either, having had lots of success on every surface—in addition to reaching the semifinals in Rome last year, he's a former junior champion at Roland Garros, and he won the biggest of his four career titles at Queen's Club—an ATP 500 event on grass—just before Wimbledon last year (where he reached the quarterfinals).

DID YOU KNOW❓By reaching the final of the ATP 500 event in Munich today, 🇺🇸 @BenShelton has become the first American man to make a clay court final above ATP 250 level since Andre Agassi at Rome in 2002. 💥That was 5 months before Shelton was born:https://t.co/vXKNPOToUJ

Ben Shelton, United States (world No. 13)The 22-year-old American's biggest results have come on hard courts—both of his Grand Slam semifinals (one at the US Open and one at the Australian Open), his other Grand Slam quarterfinal (at the Australian Open), all three of his Masters 1000 quarterfinals, and his biggest career title at the ATP 500 event in Tokyo two years ago.But like Paul, Shelton has been getting more and more dangerous on clay, winning the title in Houston last year and, just a few weeks ago, reaching the final of the ATP 500 clay-court event in Munich—that was the biggest clay-court final an American man has reached since before he was even born, since Andre Agassi won Rome in 2002.If it doesn't happen for him during the rest of the clay-court season or the grass-court season, he'll definitely be one to watch in the summer.

Arthur Fils, France (world No. 14)The only other man in the Top 15 without a big title is Arthur Fils, but if his trajectory keeps going the way it is, that could change at any time.At just 20 years old, and having only played his first full year on the tour in 2023, he's already captured three career titles, including two ATP 500s at Hamburg and Tokyo last year—one on clay, one on hard. He reached his first second week at a major last year too, at Wimbledon.But it's his results at Masters 1000s this year that have propelled him into the Top 15 for the first time—he reached the quarterfinals of Indian Wells, Miami and Monte Carlo, which actually made him the youngest player to reach the quarterfinals of the first three Masters 1000 events of the year since Masters 1000 tournaments began in 1990.The question for Fils isn't if he'll win a big title, it's just how soon.Honorable MentionsOutside the Top 15, there are plenty of active players who've reached big finals before but who are still seeking their first big title.Some have even reached multiple big finals: Matteo Berrettini with two (Madrid, Wimbledon); David Goffin with two (ATP Finals, Cincinnati); Nick Kyrgios also with two (Cincinnati, Wimbledon); Gael Monfils with three (Paris, Paris and Monte Carlo); Kei Nishikori with five (Madrid, US Open, Miami, Canada and Monte Carlo); and Milos Raonic also with five (Canada, Paris, Indian Wells, Wimbledon, Cincinnati).There's also Richard Gasquet, a three-time Masters 1000 finalist with 16 career titles all at the ATP 250 level. The Frenchman doesn't have much time left, though—he's set to retire at Roland Garros in a few weeks.And finally, a trio of current Top 30 players—Frances Tiafoe, Felix Auger-Aliassime and Denis Shapovalov—all former Top 10 players who've been to a Masters 1000 final before. The two Canadians have also both won ATP 500s—Shapovalov one, Auger-Aliassime three.

Mariano Navone already beat one Italian in Rome; can he beat the world No. 1?ByDavid KanePublished May 09, 2025 copy_link

Published May 09, 2025

ROME, Italy—The atmosphere for Jannik Sinner's return from a three-month suspension is likely to be the highlight of the week at the Internazionali BNL d'Italia.Can No. 99-ranked Mariano Navone crash the party?The 24-year-old Argentine got some practice against a partisan crowd on Thursday when he defeated Italian wild card Federico Cina, 6-3, 6-3 on Grand Stand Arena to book the meeting with Sinner.“It's always special when you play like this,” a smiling Navone told me after the match. “It's like an NBA, home-away match! Of course, it was tough because Federico was such a good player and also many are in the crowd who want to see him and want him to win. There are many things under you, but it was a really special match because I've played at Grand Slams but this is one of the biggest stages outside that, making it a very special tournament for us.”

Navone's match against Cina was his 20th of the season on clay; for Sinner, it will not only be his first on the surface since playing the semifinals of Roland Garros in June, it will also be his first since February, when he won the Australian Open.Read more: A complete timeline of Jannik Sinner's doping caseSinner's suspension stemmed from two positive tests for the banned substance Clostebol last spring. Though the International Tennis Integrity Association (ITIA) initially declined to suspend the three-time Grand Slam champion, the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) appealed the ruling and Sinner ultimately accepted a settlement that required him to sit out the last three months—and miss four Masters 1000 tournaments.“For me, look, last year was very difficult,” Sinner said in his pre-tournament press conference. “I had a lot of personal pressure, holding everything. I couldn't talk with many people about what happened. I was in a tough situation at the beginning of the Australian Open. I struggled a lot, so it was nice to take a small break. Three months…but it is what it is. A small break was good. I could feel that I'm not playing for quite a long time.”

He stopped three months ago and this is his first match, so it's not easy for him either. Mariano Navone on Jannik Sinner

Sinner described having low expectations in his return to the Foro Italico, mainly eager for the feedback opponents like Navone will give him on the court.A two-time ATP finalist, Navone will be playing only his third match against a Top 10 player—he's 2-9 vs. the Top 20—but has risen to the occasion in the past, pushing Rafael Nadal to a 7-5 third set last summer in Bastad.“It's like a challenge,” Navone told me. “It's not often you have the chance to play against the No. 1 player in the world. So, it's special for me. It would be the biggest victory of my career. But for sure, it's challenge and I have to take it like that for me and my game.“He stopped three months ago and this is his first match, so it's not easy for him either.”

But for sure, it's challenge and I have to take it like that for me and my game.“He stopped three months ago and this is his first match, so it's not easy for him either.”

Navone called Sinner's suspension “not my problem,” and described zero animosity towards the top seed in the locker room.“Now he's a normal player,” said Navone, who peaked at No. 29 in the ATP rankings in 2024.“He stopped, he completed his suspension, and it's really safe. He took some time. Three months is time. It's tough to be out for three months, but he completed his suspension and that's it.”Navone will next look to have the last word on Saturday, in front of the biggest crowd of his young career.

Alcaraz and Lajovic have played four times, and the Serb has yet to win a set.Maybe that shouldn't be a surprise, considering that Lajovic is now 34, ranked 131st, and had to win two close matches in qualifying to make the main draw in Rome. Yet I still think of him as the young guy among the classic Serbian contingent—younger than Novak Djokovic, at least—and the one with the world-class one-handed backhand. I would have thought that, with Alcaraz's propensity for rough patches of play, Lajovic would have snuck in at least one winning set against him.

Maybe this is his moment to make Alcaraz sweat a little. Lajovic likes clay—his only two career titles came on the surface—and he has already won three matches in Rome. Alcaraz, meanwhile, is returning after more than two weeks away, and recovering from a hamstring injury that kept him out of Madrid. Winner: Alcaraz

Fils is a 20-year-old, 14th-ranked Frenchman who plays with an extroverted gusto, and who has designs on Slam titles in the future. Griekspoor is a 28-year-old, 35th-ranked Dutchman who mostly gets on with his low-key business, and who has never, as far as I know, been touted as a future Top Tenner.Yet the two have shared a strong start to 2025. Fils is 17-9; Griekspoor 18-10. Fils made the final in Monte Carlo and semis in Barcelona; Griekspoor made the final in Marrakech, semis in Dubai, and quarters in Indian Wells and Munich. Their paths have crossed once so far this year, in Monte Carlo, where Fils won a tough three-setter.Both guys play the modern power-baseline game at a high level. They have heavy topspin forehands and two-handed backhands, and they look for the first strike. Fils is bouncier at 20, while Griekspoor may play a little more safely. I'd expect something good, and close, to come out of it. This time it may be Griekspoor, who looked sharp in his last match, who has the edge. Winner: Griekspoor

The celebration of independent film has been held in a tent alongside the Santa Monica pier since 1993.


							By 

	Scott Feinberg


Executive Editor of Awards


	Film Independent's Spirit Awards, the industry's highest-profile celebration of independent film, is leaving the beach in Santa Monica, where it has been held for decades, and relocating to the heart of Hollywood, specifically the Hollywood Palladium, for its 41st edition on Sunday, Feb. 15, 2026.


	The Spirit Awards have been held in a tent alongside the Santa Monica Pier since its eighth edition in 1993, with the exception of its 9th edition, which, too, was held at the Hollywood Palladium.




	It is unclear if the just-announced move is temporary or permanent, though it reportedly was triggered by the city of Los Angeles' preparations for the 2028 Summer Olympics.

	











	“Following the celebration of 40 years of the Spirit Awards earlier this year, we are excited to have the opportunity to reimagine the Spirit Awards experience during a moment of tremendous growth and transformation for our organization,” Brenda Robinson, Film Independent's acting president said in a statement. “We are proud to continue to be a beacon for the bold and resilient independent storytelling community and to honor excellence in storytelling in all its forms.”


	Added Shawn Davis, executive producer of the Spirit Awards: “We're thrilled to bring the Spirit Awards to the historic Hollywood Palladium. This move represents our continued evolution while staying true to our roots of celebrating fearless independent voices of film and television.”

""Enter Sandman"" has been the home team's pump-up tune for 25 years.


													By
												

	Gil Kaufman



	It's one thing for the Virginia Tech Hokies to blast Metallica‘s “Enter Sandman” as the football team's game-day hype song when they take the field at Lane Stadium for home games. It's quite another thing for the band to play the song on the team's home field for the first time in front of a sold-out crowd primed to set things off.


	In fact, on Wednesday night (May 7) during Metallica's first-ever appearance at Lane Stadium on their M72 world tour, Hokie fans got so hyped that the Virginia Tech Seismological Observatory said the jumping up and down set off the Richter scale. For the past 25 years, the team's entrance soundtrack has become legendary in college sports, a moment of collective joy when 60,000 fans jump up and down to the metal anthem to welcome their team onto the field.

	











	In fact, according to Hokie Sports, Wednesday night was not even the first time a seismograph was set off thanks to the reaction to the lead single from Metallica's 1991 self-titled fifth album, which topped out at Nov. 16 on the Billboard Hot 100. Back in 2011, in a game against ACC rival Miami (FL), a seismograph detected seismic activity when the team entered the stadium, then again in 2015 during a game against Ohio State and one more time in 2021 during their home opener against North Carolina.


	Though playing the song has long been a tradition, one fan told ABC 13 News that watching the band open with a snippet of the instrumental intro — while flashing the team's logo on the big screen — and then close out the show with the anthem was something else entirely. “The fact that we're here, Metallica is playing ‘Enter Sandman' – they started with it; this stadium's been asking for it, we all need it,” VT junior Wesley Metcalf said. “We're getting it; it's a great night tonight, and I can't believe it's happening.” VT junior Luke Dalton added, “Experiencing that live; the actual band playing it rather than the games because we already get hyped from the games themselves, but hearing Metallica playing in the stadium live, it's awesome, man.”


	The band got all into it as well, meeting up with VT football coach Brent Pry before the show, where he presented them with No. 25 Hokies jerseys and a No. 72 jersey commemorating their ongoing M72 world tour. The tour marches on Friday night (May 9) when Metallica play the first of two takeover events at the Sonic Temple Festival in Columbus, OH.

The case claims the superstar and his team have ""turned a blind eye"" to copyright infringement and left a lesser-known artist with ""no choice but to file this lawsuit.""


													By
												

	Bill Donahue



Bad Bunny is facing a lawsuit over allegations that a track from his chart-topping Un Verano Sin Ti featured an unlicensed sample from a Nigerian artist – and that the superstar's reps later “stonewalled” efforts to resolve the problem.


	In a copyright case filed May 2 in Los Angeles federal court, attorneys for the artist Dera (Ezeani Chidera Godfrey) claim that Bad Bunny's “Enséñame a Bailar” illegally sampled from a 2019 track called “Empty My Pocket.”


	Dera's lawyers say they've raised the issue with reps for Bad Bunny and others behind the song, but that they've “turned a blind eye” and left him with “no choice but to file this lawsuit.”


	“It is not very often that a musical artist of Bad Bunny's caliber and sophistication uses someone else's music without permission, and then ignores the person's efforts to resolve the problem,” writes Dera's attorney Robert A. Jacobs, a litigator at the top music law firm Manatt Phelps & Phillips. “Such a response is especially surprising when the unauthorized use pervades the entirety of the musical artist's work. Unfortunately, these are the circumstances here.”


	The lawsuit also names as defendants The Orchard, which distributed the album, and Bad Bunny's Rimas Entertainment, among others. Representatives for both Bad Bunny and The Orchard did not immediately return requests for comment.


	Released in 2022, Un Verano Sin Ti was a mega-hit – spending 13 weeks atop the Billboard 200 and more than 150 weeks total on the album chart. “Enséñame a Bailar” was a hit in its own right, charting on the Hot 100 for two weeks and earning 72 million views on YouTube.


	In his lawsuit, Dera says Bad Bunny's song was essentially built on top of his “Empty My Pocket” – that the usage is so “extensive” that the sampling itself is “beyond question.”


	“Plaintiffs' works comprise virtually the entirety of the musical bed and a portion of the lyrics in the infringing recording and infringing composition, and, as such, account for a significant portion of the appeal of the infringing works,” his lawyers write.


	They claim access to Dera's song was provided by a producer named Lakizo (Lekan Adesina), but that he had no authority to clear the use of the sample: “Lakizo … is not an author of ‘Empty My Pocket' … and does not have – and never had – the right to prepare or authorize others to prepare derivative works.”


	According to the lawsuit, when Dera discovered the unauthorized sample he tried to negotiate a good-faith resolution with Bad Bunny's team, saying he wanted to “address past unauthorized uses” but also “allow future uses.” He says he also “unconditionally complied” with requests to substantiate his claim, including sharing documents showing that Lakizo had not been authorized to clear the sample.


	“Despite plaintiffs' cooperation, these defendants stonewalled plaintiffs after receiving the requested information, making clear that plaintiffs' only option for obtaining redress for the violation of their rights would be through the courts,” Dera's lawyers write.

	Lainey Wilson, Reba McEntire & Miranda Lambert sit down ahead of the ACM's and share how they came together to create their new collab, “Trailblazer.” They share how Brandy Clark, Dolly Parton and more influenced the song, producing and recording together and more!


	Are you excited for “Trailblazer?” Let us know in the comments!


Melinda Newman:


I wanna start by just asking how the song came together.


	Miranda Lambert:


	The first conversation was an idea that we could write a song for all of us to sing together, right? 


	And you brought up Brandy because we all love her so much.


	Reba McEntire:


	Love Brandy Clark. 


	Miranda Lambert:


	Yes. 


	Reba McEntire:


	Her writing, her singing, everything about her. 


	Miranda Lambert:


	Yeah, so we went to my back porch and- 


	Lainey Wilson:


	Yeah, we were like, okay, we're gonna get to do a song with Reba. So what kind of song do you think that like, what do we write, you know? 


	Miranda Lambert:


	And she was on set, so we were calling her and trying to FaceTime and figure out, like, what's the right message for this, this trio, like, what do we really want to say in a three minute song? Because it felt really important to all of us, I think. 


	Reba McEntire:


	And I had texted with Brandy the day before, giving her some ideas, and then when I finally got to hear it, I was ecstatic. Thrilled to pieces, and Brandy said that was the fastest she's ever written a song because they gelled so well together. 


	Lainey Wilson:


	We were just having a conversation about how both of y'all have influenced me, and how it's just it's kind of like passing the torch and blazing trails for each other. And so it's just like, you know, generation after generation it's going to continue. Well, we got to keep blazing those trails for the next ones.

	One of the new pope's brothers has given an interview to a Chicago TV station, shedding light on how Cardinal Robert Prevost prepared for the Vatican conclave that elected him pontiff. Turns out the prelate boned up with help from an Oscar-nominated film.


	John Prevost, the middle of three Prevost brothers (Louis is the eldest and Robert – now Pope Leo XIV — is the youngest) told Chicago's NBC affiliate WMAQ-TV that he talked with Robert a day before the conclave began.


	“I said, ‘Are you ready for this? Did you watch the movie Conclave, so you know how to behave?' And he had just finished watching the movie,” Prevost laughed, “so he knew how to behave.”

	Prevost explained, “I wanted to take his mind off of it [the real conclave], you know, laugh about something because this is now an awesome responsibility.”

	The drama-thriller directed by Edward Berger and starring Ralph Fiennes, John Lithgow, Stanley Tucci, Isabella Rossellini, and Carlos Diehz, presents a fictional story of intrigue over the selection of a new pope to lead the Roman Catholic Church. After numerous ballots, a surprise candidate becomes the Vicar of Christ.


	In the real conclave that ended Thursday, Cardinal Prevost was also considered by many observers to be an unlikely choice given that no American had ever been named pope. Even the Chicago-native Prevost apparently doubted his odds of being chosen.


	“He didn't think so,” John Prevost said. “I didn't believe it and Rob didn't believe it – I should say Pope Leo didn't believe it at all, because there's not going to be an American pope was the attitude.”


	On the other hand, Prevost did think his brother was under serious consideration. “What I was reading and what I was hearing was that there were three outstanding candidates that were in first, second and third place,” he noted, “the cardinal from the Philippines, the [Vatican] secretary of state, and him [Robert].”


	Pope Leo XIV, who succeeds Pope Francis after the previous pontiff's death at the age of 88, may not have a lot of time to watch movies now that he will be shepherding the world's 1.4 billion Catholics. However, John Prevost offered some insight into how his younger likes to take a break from weighty ecclesiastical issues when the two get a chance to talk.

	











	“First we do Wordle, because this is a regular thing, okay,” he explained. “We do Words with Friends. It's something to keep his mind off life in the real world.”


	On a somewhat more sober note, Prevost talked about the family reaction to the stunning news of Cardinal Prevost's elevation to become only the 267th pope in history. 


	“It's totally unreal, it's totally surreal,” he said. “It's a tremendous thing to take in, but it's something to be very proud of.”

Senior Film Reporter


	Writer-director Jane Schoenbrun (I Saw the TV Glow) has set Hannah Einbinder (Hacks) and Gillian Anderson (Sex Education) to lead Teenage Sex and Death at Camp Miasma, their next film for Mubi, which will go into production in British Columbia this summer.


	In Teenage Sex and Death at Camp Miasma, the infamous Camp Miasma slasher franchise is getting rebooted yet again. But when the latest movie's director becomes obsessed with the mysterious, reclusive actress who played the “final girl” in the original film, a whole new kind of slasher emerges from the bottom of the lake.

	“I make movies I wish existed when I was a kid,” Schoenbrun said, “and Teenage Sex and Death at Camp Miasma is my best attempt at the ‘sleepover classic:' an insane yet cozy midnight odyssey that beckons to unsuspecting viewers from the horror section at the local video store. I couldn't be more excited to be heading to sleepaway camp this summer with the mad comic genius Hannah Einbinder, the legendary Gillian Anderson, and the daring folks at MUBI and Plan B, who by greenlighting this movie have summoned a plague-like flood of blood, guts, and various other fluids to rain down on us all.”


	Best known for starring on Max's hit comedy Hacks, Einbinder is an actor and comedian who released her debut stand-up special, Everything Must Go, on Max last year. She's repped by CAA, Cary Dobkin and David Krintzman at Yorn, Levine, Barnes.


	Recently starring in Netflix's Sex Education, as well as projects like Scoop, White Bird, and The Pale Blue Eye, Anderson is also in Disney's Tron: Ares, which releases October 10. She is repped by UTA and Independent Talent.


	Schoenbrun's most recent film, A24's I Saw the TV Glow, was nominated for six Independent Spirit Awards, including Best Picture, Screenplay and Director, as well as three Gotham Awards. Their earlier films include We're All Going to the World's Fair and A Self-Induced Hallucination. Their first novel, Public Access Afterworld, will be published by Hogarth in 2026. The filmmaker is repped by CAA, Entertainment 360, and Kimberly Jaime at Jackoway Austen.

	











	Recent and upcoming Mubi Productions include Kelly Reichardt's The Mastermind, which is premiering at Cannes, as well as Karim Aïnouz's Rosebush Pruning, and Jim Jarmusch's Father Mother Sister Brother.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Leonardo DiCaprio Quietly Debuts at Met Gala With Girlfriend Vittoria Ceretti","https://entertainmentnow.com/news/leonardo-dicaprio-met-gala-vittoria-ceretti/","Fri, 09 May 2025 02:51:01 GMT","

Leonardo DiCaprio made a discreet entrance at his first-ever Met Gala. The “Titanic” superstar low-key attended the iconic fashion event and opted not to walk the blue carpet.

DiCaprio, 50, quietly joined his 26-year-old girlfriend, Vittoria Ceretti, inside the  Metropolitan Museum of Art. Vogue's photographer, Andre D. Wagner, captured the couple inside the venue, with the actor shielding his face from the camera.

A post shared by Vogue (@voguemagazine)

For his Met Gala debut, DiCaprio wore a sleek tuxedo and bowtie to match this year's theme, “Superfine: Tailoring Black Style.”

The magazine shared the black-and-white snap on Instagram, which already gained over 100,000 likes.

When it comes to fashion, Leonardo DiCaprio's on-screen looks are the stuff of legend. Fitting then that for the 2025 #MetGala—the actor's first ever!—DiCaprio didn't hold back. The star, joined by his supermodel girlfriend Vittoria Ceretti, wore a sleek tuxedo—just the thing to complement the night's “Tailored For You” dress code.

While DiCaprio stayed behind the scenes, Ceretti confidently walked the steps and posed for the cameras at the 2025 Met Gala. The model donned a Moncler pin-striped minidress with a head-turning oversized hood. She matched the look with full-length gloves and a diamond necklace.

DiCaprio's stealthy Met Gala debut quickly sparked buzz online. While some were happy to see the actor at the event, others were more critical of his sneaky moves.

One commenter wrote, “Omg they went TOGETHER?! FINALLY,” while another commented in disbelief, “Wait…he was there..?”

Others noted that the actor appeared to keep his distance from the model, with one asking, ‘Why is he always running away from her?' Meanwhile, another commenter chimed in, “Why did he come there if he doesn't want to be photographed?”

A post shared by Vittoria Ceretti (@vittoria)

Meanwhile, Ceretti shared some rare insight into her relationship with DiCaprio. In an interview with Vogue France published on March 24, the model said she learned to focus on her experiences with the actor instead of his high-profile romances in the past.

Ceretti is also aware of the scrutiny that comes with dating a superstar like DiCaprio. In the same interview, she finds it annoying that people label someone depending on who's more popular.

As soon as you're in a relationship with someone who has a larger following than you, you become ‘girlfriend of'—or ‘boyfriend of,' for that matter. And that can be extremely annoying.

DiCaprio and Ceretti first started dating rumors in August 2023.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","NBC Renews Two of it's Biggest TV Shows","https://entertainmentnow.com/news/nbc-renews-two-big-shows/","Fri, 09 May 2025 02:51:01 GMT","

The streets of New York City will keep hearing the iconic “dun-dun” as NBC delivers thrilling news. Both “Law & Order” and “Law & Order: Special Victims Unit” have been renewed for the 2025-26 season, securing their 25th and 27th season. Announced on May 8, 2025, the renewals cement the Dick Wolf franchise's grip on primetime, delighting fans who've followed the gritty crimes and courtroom dramas for decades. From budget talks to fan eagerness on X, here's how the renewals unfolded and what's next for these TV juggernauts.

The announcement hit like a gavel in a Manhattan courtroom. After months of speculation, NBC confirmed the renewals just before its upfront presentation, with Variety reporting that “Law & Order” and “SVU” would return to tackle more ripped-from-the-headlines cases. The news wasn't a total shock, both shows are pillars of NBC's lineup, with “SVU” leading the network's linear scripted ratings and topping Peacock's viewership charts alongside the “One Chicago” trio. “Law & Order”, while not as dominant on streaming, remains a linear powerhouse, The Hollywood Reporter noted. X erupted with joy, one fan posting, “SVU and Law & Order renewed? My Thursdays are SAFE!”. Yet, behind the scenes, budget talks with Universal Television stirred tension, as Deadline hinted at cost-cutting measures to keep the shows viable.

Getting the green light wasn't a simple slam dunk. NBC and Universal Television hashed out financial details, with “Law & Order's” revival status—technically younger than its spinoffs—making it a cost-effective bet, per Variety. “SVU”, led by Mariska Hargitay's indomitable Captain Olivia Benson, faced its own hurdles, with two cast exits looming: Juliana Martinez and Octavio Pisano won't return for Season 27, NBC Insider confirmed. But the show's new showrunner, Michele Fazekas, the first woman in the role, is set to bring fresh energy, promising bold storytelling for Benson's unit. “Law & Order” showrunner Rick Eid, now focused solely on the mothership after stepping back from “FBI”, teased deeper character arcs, like exploring Detective Vincent Riley's shady brother, Matt, played by Ryan Eggold.

The renewals sparked a love fest between the shows' casts and their loyal viewers. Mariska Hargitay, the heart of “SVU”, shared her gratitude, saying, “I love this team—it's sacred to me,” per NBC Insider. Reid Scott, “Law & Order's” Detective Vincent Riley, echoed the sentiment, saying he and co-star Mehcad Brooks have a blast bringing sarcasm and heart to the 27th Precinct. The shows' ratings are great, “SVU” consistently in Peacock's Top 5 and “Law & Order” holding strong on Thursdays proved fans aren't ready to let go. The renewals follow NBC's earlier pickup of the “One Chicago” trio, ensuring Wolf Entertainment's dominance, The Hollywood Reporter noted.

With “Law & Order” hitting its milestone 25th season and “SVU” pushing toward a record-breaking 27th, the 2025-26 season promises high stakes. “Law & Order's” Season 24 finale, airing May 15, 2025, sets up a crossover with “SVU”, teasing a brutal murder case that'll test both squads, written about by NBC Insider. “SVU's” Season 26 finale, “Post-Rage,” directed by Norberto Barba, will wrap storylines before Fazekas takes the helm. Fans are excited and already speculating about Benson's next arc. As NBC gears up for its fall 2025 schedule, with “The Voice” and “Happy's Place” also renewed, the “Law & Order” franchise remains the network's backbone. Tune in Thursdays at 8 p.m. ET to catch the action. Brace yourself for more justice, drama, and that signature “dun-dun.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Ellen DeGeneres Hair Transformation Glimpse","https://entertainmentnow.com/news/ellen-degeneres-new-hair/","Fri, 09 May 2025 13:31:57 GMT","

Ellen DeGeneres has left her bleach blonde locks behind and embraced a bold new look which she flashed to fans in early May 2025. The former talk show host has been a brunette for the last few months, and gave a glimpse of her switched-up style!

A post shared by Ellen DeGeneres (@ellendegeneres)

The formerly platinum entertainer revealed her new brunette color as she drove a lawn mower through a field in what appeared to be the English countryside. Only the back and side profile of her head could be seen in the video clip, which she captioned, “Portia thought it would be fun to film my first time on a lawn mower. She was right.”

DeGeneres humorously overlaid the footage with the words “How it started” and “How it ended.” The video finished with the comedian being pushed on the mower.

 She complemented her new hairstyle with a practical, low key ensemble to work her land, pairing slim fit jeans with a gray sweater and olive green waterproof boots.

Degeneres, who the Independent says relocated from Los Angeles to the area of the U.K. countryside known as the Cotswolds in late 2024, wasn't done working on her new property after the lawn mowing episode. A few days later, she shared a clip of herself outdoors in the sun clipping flowery bushes, before trimming grass with a handheld tool.

The 67-year-old joked in the caption, “Some people have a dream of becoming a farmer,” before adding, “Clearly our dream was to become a landscape maintenance crew with a little farming on the side.” 

A post shared by Ellen DeGeneres (@ellendegeneres)

With a reported net worth of around $450 million, according to People, DeGeneres can surely afford to hire a landscaping team, but she seems to have made a hobby of transforming her farmland.

In the same video, the famous former vegan threw grain to a group of five chickens. 

Fans hoping to follow DeGeneres' new life in England with her wife, Portia DeRossi, won't get any help from the retired actress known for appearing in “Ally McBeal.” DeRossi hasn't posted anything on Instagram since sharing a clip of her wife doing an arm workout in January 2024.

A post shared by Portia de Rossi (@portiaderossi)

DeRossi took the moment to wish the comedian a happy 66th birthday. “This is what your 66 looks like,” she declared as DeGeneres showed off impressive gym moves.

She doesn't appear to be currently active on any social media platforms.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","‘American Idol' Producers Eye Judging Panel Shakeup: Report","https://entertainmentnow.com/american-idol/new-judge-carrie-underwood-simon-cowell/","Fri, 09 May 2025 15:05:59 GMT","

Although the judging panel on “American Idol” changed in season 23 with the addition of Carrie Underwood, who replaced Katy Perry after seven seasons, producers are seriously considering a more significant shakeup to the judging panel, according to the U.S. Sun. 

On May 6, 2025, the outlet published insights from a show “insider” who said producers are “desperate to find their next Simon,” referring to original judge Simon Cowell, whose harsh critiques were infamous from 2002 to 2010. 

Producers think a more opinionated judge could give the show “a fresh face lift,” the insider told the Sun, but multiple celebrities who've been approached about joining the series have turned them down because “no one wants to be the ‘bad guy.'”

During the early years of “American Idol,” Cowell never held back with his critiques, unafraid to admonish contestants for their performances, while Paula Abdul and Randy Jackson typically delivered much kinder feedback.

After the original trio went their separate ways, FOX tried for several years to find good chemistry with different celebrity judges, including Jennifer Lopez, Keith Urban, Steven Tyler, Mariah Carey, and more. When ABC took over the show in 2018, it found great chemistry with Perry, Luke Bryan and Lionel Richie  who intentionally aimed to lift up the contestants rather than tear them down. 

But after eight years of niceties, the U.S. Sun said producers think hiring someone like Cowell “would bring back the spark the show needs to boost ratings.” The insider did not provide any specific names of stars being considered, but said those who've been approached have turned down the opportunity, not wanting to get “canceled” for their negative takes on contestants. 

Although “American Idol” is not nearly as popular as it was in its early years, ratings were significantly up in April during the live shows, beating NBC's “The Voice” by 25%, according to Deadline. 

Season 23 of “American Idol” kicked off on March 2 with a half-hour preview after the Academy Awards, which resulted in the show's biggest launch in three years, according to ABC, drawing 5.93 million total viewers. Ratings began to slip after that, according to the U.S. Sun, and routinely lagged behind “The Voice” in March.

However, “Idol” began attracting a crowd in early April as the competition heated up during Hollywood Week, pushing it ahead of “The Voice,” Deadline reported. When Jelly Roll joined on April 7 as the show's first-ever artist-in-residence, “Idol” beat out “The Voice” by 690,000 viewers, per Deadline, which was the “largest margin of victory head-to-head with the NBC competition series in over seven years.”

Although ABC has not officially announced its renewal, “American Idol” is expected to return for season 24, given that virtual auditions for the next season opened in early May, with current contestants filming promos to encourage singers across the U.S. to try out.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Backstreet Boys' Brian Littrell Tears Up at ACMs Over Son's ‘American Idol' Journey","https://entertainmentnow.com/american-idol/brian-littrell-cries-son-baylee-music/","Fri, 09 May 2025 15:17:32 GMT","

All of the Backstreet Boys voted for Baylee Littrell when he competed on season 23 of “American Idol,” but it wasn't enough to keep member Brian Littrell's son from going home. 

During a red carpet appearance at the ACMs on May 8, 2025, the iconic boy band told “Entertainment Tonight” they “all voted for him” as Brian got choked up talking about his son's journey on the show. The 22-year-old, who made it to the top 20, was widely criticized online by viewers who labeled him a “nepo baby” who was riding on the coattails of his famous dad. 

Baylee auditioned with his parents in tow and made it to the top 20 of “American Idol.” He was sent home on April 21 after viewer votes weren't enough to get him through to the top 14 and judges Luke Bryan, Carrie Underwood, and Lionel Richie opted not to save him. 

When ET correspondent Cassie DiLaura asked Brian about how proud he was of his son's journey on May 8, he immediately got choked up, telling her, “I mean, you can't really put it in words. But, I mean, he's just living the dream. He's a talented young man so, you know, we'll see — the sky's the limit.” 

“You know, it's tough,” Brian continued. “This business isn't easy, it'll chew you up and spit you out. But, uh, I think he's in good hands.” 

BSB member Kevin Richardson chimed in, “He's a talented young man. He's just beginning his journey.”

On May 2, Baylee told CCM Magazine that “American Idol” producers had encouraged him to audition for four years before he finally said yes. 

“I've been doing music on my own for really the past, like six years, seven years, mostly spending my time in Nashville and touring,” Baylee said. “But it just never was really working out like I had hoped. I was never getting the big break that I needed or the exposure.” 

“People barely know my name,” the college student acknowledged. “They just know my background or where I come from. It's definitely hard. During my time in the industry, people would try to sign me, then find out where I come from, and never talk to me again.” 

But Baylee was nervous about auditioning for a TV show, telling CCM, “I didn't want to be a viral bad moment on American Idol. I didn't want to not get the golden ticket. I was terrified to be vulnerable.”

Brian told ET that Baylee will soon release “Hey Jesus” as a single, a faith-driven song he wrote at age 19 and performed during Hollywood Week. 

“This song truly, like I wrote it in a very dark time in my life,” Baylee told CCM. “It's more about the struggle with faith, the struggle with finding your way. A big common misconception is that God won't let us fall down. But falling is part of the journey.”

While Meghan Markle rarely posts pictures or videos of her two children with Prince Harry, we occasionally get a peek at Archie and his little sister Lilibet, 3.

Typically, the kids are only shown from behind, but that shows off the glorious red hair they inherited from their dad.

Lili's long hair is a lighter shade, but Archie's locks are dark Auburn.

They would also come with my husband and visit me on-set, and I loved that my children were able to watch me working and see the balance of that and understand what Mama does and is working to create and share. It was really special because up until then, they hadn't seen me at work,” Meghan told PEOPLE.

While speaking to a crowd about balancing work and motherhood at the TIME100 Summit, Markle admitted she's “made a very, very conscious effort to create boundaries for myself and for my mental health, for my well-being and certainly to role model that as well for my children.”

“I'm conscious of not just raising very strong and confident young woman, but also having a son,” she went on. “I think it's just as paramount of importance for young men to be raised with a confidence and sense of self that is going to empower the women around them too.”

“It starts with whatever is going on internally,” she added. “When I am able to not even just tune out whatever that noise is, [but] to really not give it any credence, that has become so much a part of my day-to-day life.”

It's a strategy that seems to be working. 

“I'm the happiest I've ever been,” she told the crowd. “And that part, to have a partner and a husband who's just so supportive… and to have healthy kids that are so joyful in the freeness of their life and the safety of their life that we create for them… of all the things that have happened in my life, I never would have imagined getting here at this point that I would feel just so happy and grateful, and I really do.”

Charlize Theron is back in action at Netflix with the long-awaited graphic novel adaptation sequel “The Old Guard 2.” And this time? She's joined by “Kill Bill” action star alum Uma Thurman.

“The Old Guard 2,” which will be released five years after the first film, has been in the throes of production delays at the streamer. Lead star Theron, who also produces the feature, told Variety in 2024 that it was due to the “changeover” at Netflix that in part led to the film‘s post-production being shut down; the feature wrapped filming in 2022. 

 










Now, “The Old Guard” is new again.

Victoria Mahoney directs from a script by Greg Rucka and Sarah L. Walker. The film is based on the 2017 graphic novel from Rucka, which is illustrated by Leandro Fernandez. Gina Prince-Bythewood previously helmed the first installment that became a hit on the platform.

“The Old Guard 2” brings back Andy (Theron) and her team of immortal warriors. Booker (Matthias Schoenaerts) is still in exile, while Quynh (Veronica Ngô) is out for revenge after escaping an underwater prison. The film's official synopsis reads: “Andy grapples with her newfound mortality as a mysterious threat emerges that could jeopardize everything she's worked towards for thousands of years. Andy, Nile (KiKi Layne), Joe (Marwan Kenzari), Nicky (Luca Marinelli), and James Copley (Chiwetel Ejiofor) enlist the help of Tuah (Henry Golding), an old friend who may provide the key to unlocking the mystery behind immortal existence.” Thurman's role is currently undisclosed.

The feature is produced by Theron, AJ Dix, Beth Kono, Marc Evans, David Ellison, Dana Goldberg, and Don Granger of Skydance. 

IndieWire's Kate Erbland previously deemed the first “Old Guard” film to be Netflix's best action movie of 2020, writing in her review, “It's a movie that wants its audience to think and if that sounds like a weird fit for the genre, you've surely never pondered what it would mean to be all-powerful in a world that only wants to see things go boom.” The feature was a “deep-thinking” rife on the superhero genre, while the first film “also sets up plenty of ideas worth exploring in its inevitable sequel (which, yes, we can only hope will sport even more nutso action).”

Netflix will release “The Old Guard 2” on its streaming platform on Wednesday, July 2. Check out the film's first trailer below.

Carrie Coon has found her next project post-“The White Lotus.” The acclaimed actress, who also recently starred in “His Three Daughters” and soon returns for “The Gilded Age” Season 3, has joined Guy Nattiv‘s cult thriller “Harmonia” alongside Lily James.

Nattiv reunites with Bleecker Street after the company distributed his 2023 film “Golda.” Bleecker Street acquired the U.S. rights to “Harmonia” and plans to release the film in theaters nationwide in 2026.

As previously announced, “Harmonia” will also star Bella Ramsey and “My First Film” breakout star Odessa Young. Nattiv co-wrote “Harmonia” with Noa Berman-Herzberg; the film is inspired by Nattiv's family's real-life story. Production is set to begin this summer.

The official synopsis reads: “Set in the 1980s, the film is based on Nattiv's grandmother's experience with an insidious cult. Rita (Coon), unraveling from past wounds, meets a radiant young spiritual leader (James) after a chance encounter. Following her into the all-female commune known as Harmonia, Rita leaves her life and family behind until her daughters, Ella (Ramsey), and Jo (Young), embark on a dangerous journey to rescue their mother. Once immersed in the commune, they find themselves inexorably drawn into the leader's labyrinthine web of pseudo-spiritual and psychological manipulation.”

Nattiv, whose 2023 film “Tatami” also recently received distribution from Westend Films, said in a press statement, “‘Harmonia' is born from the true story of my grandmother — a woman whose quiet strength and unspoken pain left an indelible mark on our family. For years, her story lived in the shadows, and now, at last, I'm giving it voice. I couldn't ask for more soulful collaborators than Carrie, Lily, Bella, and Odessa. Each of them brings a deep, intuitive grace to these layered characters, and their commitment to tell my story is tremendously moving.” 

Julia Lebedev and Eddie Vaisman produce the film for Sight Unseen, with Jaime Ray Newman and Nattiv producing for New Native Pictures, along with Oren Moverman. Leonid Lebedev will serve as an executive producer.  

Embankment Films represents international rights. CAA Media Finance and Range Select brokered the deal with Miranda King, Kent Sanderson, and Avy Eschenasy of Bleecker Street, while CAA and Range Media Partners represent the filmmakers.

 










Coon is represented by United Talent Agency, Foundation Talent Management, and attorney Peikoff Mahan. James is repped by UTA, Tavistock Wood, Sloane Weber Offer Dern, and Narrative PR.

Bleecker Street additionally recently acquired “Bone Lake,” set to release in October, as well as the re-release of the 1984 cult classic “This Is Spinal Tap” and its upcoming sequel, “Spinal Tap II: The End Continues,” both directed by Rob Reiner. Christopher Guest, Michael McKean, and Harry Shearer reprise their iconic roles for the sequel, which also brings real-life rockers Paul McCartney, Elton John, and Questlove into the mix.

Other 2025 Bleecker Street releases include “Relay,” starring Riz Ahmed, “Harmonia” star James, and Sam Worthington; the feature will be released on August 22 after its U.S. premiere at Tribeca this year. Max Walker-Silverman's “Rebuilding,” starring Josh O'Connor, will also be in theaters after its Sundance premiere. Walker-Silverman previously helmed “A Love Song” for Bleecker Street, too.

Jane Schoenbrun‘s latest feature film “Teenage Sex and Death at Camp Miasma” has been boarded by MUBI, which will finance and distribute the film in select territories. 

Newly announced by MUBI on Friday, “Camp Miasma” will star “Hacks” star Hannah Einbinder and “X-Files” star Gillian Anderson, and it will go into production this summer in British Columbia. 

Schoenbrun wrote and will direct the film about a director hired to yet again reboot a slasher horror franchise called “Camp Miasma.” But when the latest movie's director becomes obsessed with the mysterious, reclusive actress who played the “final girl” in the original film, a whole new kind of slasher emerges from the bottom of the lake.

Brad Pitt's Plan B has also boarded the film and is producing. Daniel Bekerman, who is executive producing, will provide local production services via his Scythia Films. MUBI is financing the film and will distribute in select territories, including North America, Latin America, UK, Ireland, Germany, Austria, Benelux, Turkey, India, Australia, and New Zealand, with The Match Factory handling remaining worldwide sales.

“I make movies I wish existed when I was a kid,” said Schoenbrun, “and ‘Teenage Sex and Death at Camp Miasma' is my best attempt at the ‘sleepover classic:' an insane yet cozy midnight odyssey that beckons to unsuspecting viewers from the horror section at the local video store. I couldn't be more excited to be heading to sleepaway camp this summer with the mad comic genius Hannah Einbinder, the legendary Gillian Anderson, and the daring folks at MUBI and Plan B, who by greenlighting this movie have summoned a plague-like flood of blood, guts, and various other fluids to rain down on us all.”

Schoenbrun's most recent film “I Saw the TV Glow” premiered at Sundance in 2024 and was released by A24, becoming an instant critical darling and one of the best reviewed films of the year. It was also nominated for six Independent Spirit Awards and three Gotham Awards. Their prior films include “We're All Going to the World's Fair” and “A Self-Induced Hallucination,” and Schoenbrun is also working on a novel set to be published by Hogarth in 2026 called “Public Access Afterworld.” 

Einbinder currently stars in Max's hit comedy series “Hacks,” now in its fourth season, and she just released her first stand-up special “Everything Must Go” on Max last year. Anderson is a two-time Emmy winner known for “The X-Files,” “The Crown,” “The First Lady,” “The Great,” and the recent “Scoop.” She'll next be seen in “Tron: Ares” this fall.

 










MUBI has several films premiering at Cannes next week, including Kelly Reichardt's “The Mastermind” and Oliver Hermanus' “The History of Sound,” and it will also soon be releasing Karim Aïnouz's “Rosebush Pruning,” and Jim Jarmusch's “Father Mother Sister Brother.”

Jane Schoenbrun is represented by CAA, Entertainment 360, and Kimberly Jaime at Jackoway Austen. Hannah Einbinder is represented by CAA, The Lede Company, Cary Dobkin and David Krintzman at Yorn, Levine, Barnes, Krintzman, Rubenstein, Kohner, Endlich, Goodell & Gellman. Gillian Anderson is represented by UTA, Independent Talent, and Premier Communications.

With the election of President Trump, the word “tariff” hasn't seen this much action since the Boston Tea Party. On May 4 it became more personal, and more confusing, when he announced a “100 percent tariff on any and all movies coming into our country that are produced in foreign lands.” Um, OK. What the hell does that mean? 

A tariff is a tax imposed by a governing body on imported goods. However, films aren't a physical good like Parmesan, catalytic converters, or Temu hauls. A performance, recorded or otherwise, qualifies as an intangible service. Another way to look at it: Trump can place a tariff on a pair of scissors, but he can't touch the haircut. 

 








Related Stories Everyone Hated Todd Solondz's Debut Feature — Including Solondz Himself — but It Deserves Another Look Questlove Had to Ask Artists ‘Probably the Most Frightening Question They've Ever Been Asked' to Make ‘Sly Lives!' 

Still, let's play along. As IndieWire's Brian Welk noted, this is a “strategy” with more questions than answers, like:




			Popular on IndieWire		






The first test of Trump's idea, however far-fetched, will be at the Cannes film market that starts next week. We'll be watching to see if international buyers become wary of U.S. projects, which would/could have a seismic effect on small-to-mid-budget films.

Oddly enough, tariffs play only a minor role in the plan pitched to Trump by the group led by Jon Voight, his “Special Ambassador to Hollywood.” In a copy of the plan shared by Deadline, tariffs would be reserved for those productions that “could have been produced in the U.S,” with exemptions for projects made under “production treaties.” The plan also recommends a federal tax credit of up to 20 percent. 

Meanwhile, California legislature will vote this summer on Governor Gavin Newsom‘s proposal to raise the state's tax program to at least $750 million. Some lawmakers are even pushing for no annual cap, as is the case in Georgia and elsewhere. As America's entertainment hub, this single-state strategy could provide a massive correction and a template for other states to follow.

However inadvertently, Trump did all of us a huge favor in elevating this conflict. To get California to pull off this major reallocation, we need to be loud and relentless. If you're ready to roll up your sleeves and get your hands dirty, there are plenty of organizations working on lobbying California representatives to support this budget raise.

 










Organized by the Entertainment Union Coalition — made up of the WGAW, DGA, SAG-AFTRA, Teamster Local 399, AFM, California IATSE Council, American Federation of Musicians, and LIUNA Local 724 — the “Keep California Rolling” initiative is picking up steam and creating templates for others to become engaged with suggestions for online posts and a social strategy detailed below.

Other groups like “Stay in LA,” formed by writers Julie Plec and Sarah Adina Smith, have organized petitions and are gathering funds for lobbying efforts in Sacramento this summer. They're also highlighting the state's recent wildfires as reason that bringing production back to Los Angeles requires emergency measures. They clearly lay out the production decline and the fixes necessary (like uncapping credits and rebates) to ensuring a thriving economy in Hollywood.

It may seem like we have little control over the levers of power, but if you're a worker in entertainment or hoping one day to be, the future of our profession depends on you. Rather than panic over Trump's latest shenanigans, let's get to work.

Are the guys OK? So rarely do we get smart, subversive screen comedies about male friendship these days, and writer/director Andrew DeYoung's feature directing debut “Friendship” turns the genre inside out. 

Casting Paul Rudd as forlorn weatherman Austin Carmichael, neighbor to Tim Robinson's anxiously neurotic Craig Waterman, in his A24 movie will immediately bring to mind another male friendship comedy, “I Love You, Man.” “Friendship” is like the dark mirror of John Hamburg's 2009 cult classic, as the desperately friendless Craig strikes up (or even forces) a bond with the charismatic man across the street who keeps getting his packages. It proves ruinous for all, including Craig's wife Tami (played by Kate Mara), who is obsessed with an ex and oh-so eager to get Craig out of the house.

The Los Angeles-based DeYoung, who has directed episodes of you-name-it every beloved single-camera streaming comedy series from “PEN15” to “Dave” and “Our Flag Means Death,” was inspired by his own brush with a male companionship that wasn't gelling.




			Popular on IndieWire		






“It was less of an established friendship and more of a wanting,” he told IndieWire. “I thought there was a friendship blossoming, and that person didn't seem to be as interested as I thought. And I'm like, wow, you see the romance version of it constantly. I've never seen the middle-aged version between two straight men. That's happening all the time. Men have friendships, and they have issues with their friends, and I know it's most predominantly portrayed in ‘I Love You, Man,' but what's my version of that that's closer to my reality? And so that's where it started from.”

The arthouse-cringe, let's call it, comedy of “Friendship” is filled with the familiar and not-so-familiar iconography of male buddy comedies: Craig is trying to bond with his son Steven (Jack Dylan Grazer) over the latest “Marvel,” Craig and his corporate co-workers at a company that makes their clients' products more addictive hang out in the garage over beers, and Craig and Austin seek bond-forming adventure in the most unlikely of places (here, a sewer system, for one). But Craig's agonized fixation on finding a new friend only turns alienating for Austin, who has it all figured out, unlike his neighbor, who's no longer having sex with his wife since she had cancer.

 










“Tim's a friend, and as I wrote, I was imagining him and I never told him about it until I finished it and sent it to him,” said DeYoung, who next directs “I Think You Should Leave” star Robinson in HBO's half-hour comedy pilot “The Chair Company.” “The Austin character was kind of an amalgamation of all kinds of different archetypes and people in my head, so I never knew who that quite would be, but when Paul's name came up, I was like, that guy is perfect.”

DeYoung said that Rudd “asked to be in the movie more” and “it really made the movie even better. I imagined in my head I was going to get someone totally on the drama side. [Paul] has a little bit or a lot of everything he could do. He's this handsome guy who's really funny, but also such a good actor and will be able to play off Tim in such an incredible way and knows the comedy moves without winking at it.”

DeYoung shot “Friendship” in Yonkers, giving his A24 buddy comedy a wintry, folksy twinge that wouldn't have been possible had he shot the film in California, where he's from.

“I grew up in Fresno, California. It was a gift to have to shoot in Yonkers during the dead of winter because I'm a California boy — it just sounds like pure pain, but it added all these gifts with the coats and the snow. There's an underlying sadness and grief to it, and the weather really helps set that tone in place. Split-level homes were a new thing that I didn't know, and I just had to embrace that.”

 










“Friendship” is unusual for a studio-adjacent comedy in that it's rife with moments of portentous dread, cinematographer Andy Rydzewski's camera slowly zooming at times like a horror movie. In one sequence of the film, Craig takes a strange drug trip after licking an amphibian, which sends him into a hallucinated Subway franchise brick-and-mortar. Meanwhile, there's Tami, lost for half the movie in the sewers underground after Craig leads her down there trying to spice things up (whoever thought that would end well?). There's even some straight-up horror violence toward the film's end that feels ripped out of A24's arsenal of chillers.

With Rudd and Robinson on board, DeYoung said he had the “leverage” in terms of pitching the movie, and at a moment where he was “so kind of disappointed by the overall state of cinema that I'm like, ‘I'm not going to make anything that's not exactly what I'm going to make,'” he said. “We're going to shoot it with these high-arthouse aesthetics.” He pitched the film as in a vein more like “The Master,” “The King of Comedy,” “Toni Erdmann,” or “Force Majeure” than “I Love You, Man,” “all movies that are successful and work. So I'm not pointing to things that are shaky.” (“Friendship” was produced by Fifth Season and BoulderLight Pictures, with A24 acquiring it out of the 2024 Toronto International Film Festival, where the film premiered.)

 










DeYoung added, “Paul and Tim have massive cult followings, and to me it [felt] so safe. I never tried to soften the movie. I only tried to make it feel scarier to financiers, to be honest, to see who is actually down to get in the mud with me and try something different.”

I asked why DeYoung is “disappointed by the overall state of cinema,” and he said, “I just feel like there are a lot of safe choices that don't respect the audience. It's so nice to feel respected by a filmmaker, even if I don't like the movie or agree with what it's trying to do. If it feels like it's trying to do something and treat us as the intelligent people that I like to imagine we are, I'll respect it. A lot of films really sell out the audience and treat us dumber than we are.”

DeYoung pointed to Sean Baker as one such filmmaker whose smart work “sneaks through” and doesn't pander to audiences. Beyond his work, the Oscar-winning director's recent comments about the financial headwinds faced by indie filmmakers resonated with the “Friendship” director, too.

“If I didn't have TV, I would be trying to slum it in the commercial world or flipping houses, I don't know,” DeYoung said. “Some working at the highest levels [are] still getting fucked over financially. People project onto us as having a certain kind of financial life, but it's actually not the case. The system's rigged against us, and I love A24, truly such good partners, but the culture is rigged against the filmmaker. And there's a lot of people who didn't do much on these movies who are getting paid more than the filmmaker.”

 










Speaking of filmmakers pulling it in financially, there's a running gag throughout “Friendship” in which Craig is just dying to see “the new Marvel” because it's apparently so good that it's driving people crazy. “I have to choose my words wisely because I know these things bring a lot of joy to people,” DeYoung said. “The reason why maybe talented filmmakers go to bigger tentpole projects is kind of none of my business, and I hope they're getting paid to do it regardless, but it just doesn't interest me… [Marvel is] almost boring to make fun of. But I think a character who likes it is interesting, and it's a way to comment on it without the usual tearing down of it. All those arguments have already been made.”

“Friendship” is now in select theaters from A24. It goes into wide release on Friday, May 23.

Thom Yorke and Mark Pritchard first crossed paths in 2012, after Radiohead, on a night off tour in Sydney, turned up to the dextrous producer's festival set. The two of them chatted over dinner in a meeting that Pritchard, perhaps surprisingly, portrays as a perfectly casual affair. On the right is an inscrutable titan of art-rock, presumably shooting daggers around the room while cryptically eating a salad. On the left is the bespectacled interloper with more production aliases than anyone can count, propounding a hare-brained scheme to get together and rustle up some tunes.

But travelers of the dance underground represented mythic figures to Yorke. By 2012, he was already several years into a self-imposed life sentence of atonement for his part in some of the greatest rock music ever made. Cult concerns like Link and Reload—Pritchard's sprawling constellation in the extended Warp universe—had long ago bewitched the singer, a man who still seems personally affronted that Radiohead are more popular than LFO. So “yeah, yeah,” Yorke told him. “Just send me whatever you want.”

Nearly a decade later they started work on Tall Tales. By then, Pritchard had released the scenic 2016 album Under the Sun—featuring his first collaboration with Yorke—and evolved from a fiendish dance stylist into a mellow elder statesman. During pandemic lockdowns, Yorke took a trove of Pritchard instrumentals and gave them hell, shuffling synths and disembowelling basslines before sending it all back for review. Maybe it was lockdown fever, but Yorke saw an opportunity to take some strange vocal turns—the croaks, chirrups, siren songs, and sneering monologues of a voice forever lashing out at its inconvenient beauty. A chance, in short, for two serious musicians to limber up and have fun.

And that is exactly what transpires on roughly half of Tall Tales. “The White Cliffs” takes a cosmic trip to the dark side of Air's Moon Safari; “The Men Who Dance in Stag's Heads” is Joy Division's “Atmosphere” dreaming of a medieval folk ballad, Yorke's narrator a mystic Lou Reed. “The Spirit” is a bolt of silvery joy, keyboard pulse and vocal line in rapturous harmony, life-loving lyrics spiked with only a hint of irony: “I wish you well/Pray for peace/A magic spell that sends you all to sleep.”

“The Spirit” steals the show on track six, and the album could probably have started there. Yorke and Pritchard tinkered away on Tall Tales for some three years, which is not readily apparent in the sequencing or editing. Eight-minute opener “A Fake in a Faker's World” is alluring but impenetrable, a union of outros asserting its right to form a song. When the ambient paean of “Ice Shelf” follows, you think: Here is a dark, grim record. “Bugging Out Again” better reflects the playfulness to come, but by the clunky “Back in the Game,” the duo's mothballed productions feel laborious, faintly reminiscent of that awkward period when Damon Albarn was composing Gorillaz songs on his iPad.

Scrape away the opening suite's permafrost and you have an album you can enjoy like an ice cream. New-wave mutant “Gangsters” is so melodically irresistible that the chorus of nefarious alien children invading Yorke's vocal track would have little trouble amassing a stan army to conquer the world. “This Conversation Is Missing Your Voice” fulfills the prophecy of an old Radiohead concert review, in a 2000 issue of Q magazine, asserting that Yorke had debuted an electropop zinger indebted to Joe Jackson's “Steppin' Out.” (The original critic, alas, was describing “Everything in Its Right Place.”) The vaudevillian marching beat of “Happy Days” deploys a gleefully malevolent Yorke to chase up a mysterious accounting error. Each of these songs disconcerts in its own way—spectral arrangements, lyrics laced with eerie corporate euphemisms—but comes with a dopamine rush to help it go down. Sell us the dream, then show us the nightmare.

If anything, it is the concept of Tall Tales that threatens to slip between its authors' fingers. As a DJ and producer, Pritchard can play music that raises the roof, frightens the ravers, or frightens the ravers and raises the roof anyway. Yorke would relish that sort of anything-goes approach, but he cannot get away from his shadow. He has to sing, he has to plug away at the business of being Thom Yorke. “We have an edge over all this other electronic music,” Nigel Godrich told OOR magazine in 2019. “We have Thom, we have his voice and what he can do, his melodic talents.” But a voice like Yorke's creates an expectation: that emotions will rise and fall, that a money note will flutter from the sky and land snug in the finale's back pocket. The money note is not what Yorke and Pritchard seek. They believe in a vibe economy: the underhand beat switch or seesawing synth buzz that shifts the energy just enough to wormhole us into the next verse.

Whether that is an asset or liability depends on your mileage for Yorke's solo ventures. What Tall Tales lacks in razzle-dazzle it makes up for with risky maneuvers, particularly Yorke's in the vocal booth—the latest in a freewheeling run from a singer who has spent the years since ANIMA concocting new ways to delight and disturb. Pritchard, beyond his handwork with analog synths and Arctic atmospheres, coaxes a sweet naivety out of his collaborator, reaffirming Yorke's long-held faith in electronic music's power to liberate: from rock orthodoxy, yes, but also the demand to be spectacular at all times. For all its maverick flair, this meeting of musical intellects feels just as innocuous as Yorke and Pritchard's dinner back in 2012: a pair of guys immune to their own lore, with nothing to fear and not much left to doubt.

There's a moment on “bluffing in the snow,” the first track on André 3000's new surprise-released solo piano EP, where you can hear the artist thinking. For roughly the first half of the three-minute piece, he tries out different ideas—a rigid eighth-note rhythm; a billowy chord progression—without committing to any one direction. Then, around the 1:25 mark, he hits on a head-nodding pattern, with low and high registers standing in for kick drum and snare. He keeps floating away from the motif and then returning, refining it a little more each time, until it becomes a hypnotic staccato groove.

Make no mistake, this passage isn't supplanting the “shake it like a Polaroid picture” breakdown in the 3 Stacks canon anytime soon. But there's an intimate thrill in eavesdropping on that real-time creative decision. If The Love Below was a finished masterpiece, this latest offering isn't just, as the title suggests, a peek inside the sketchbook—it's an in-the-moment look at the pencil moving across the page.

It's also the latest step in the larger conceptual artwork that is André 3000's shift from hitmaking rapper-songwriter-producer to beatific Johnny Appleseed of vibe. It's been around six years since he made flutespotting a national pastime. (Journalist Antonia Cereijido's viral 2019 tweet, documenting her disbelief at seeing the Outkast icon playing his woodwind while strolling through LAX, now seems like a heartwarming relic of a simpler time.) Those sightings culminated in New Blue Sun, the master wordsmith's famously bar-less 2023 solo debut, and a record that seemed to crystallize our era's new New Age aesthetic in a sonic mood board where Alice Coltrane shares space with Erewhon.

This all could have turned out to be just a phase, a sojourn into process-over-product abstraction before André returned to the vibrant lyrical murals that defined a generation. But as the lengthy, surprisingly rewarding New Blue Sun tour showed, he made a real commitment to instrumental, improvisational music, approached with a determinedly amateur spirit.

That commitment is even clearer on 7 piano sketches. New Blue Sun was, after all, a studio creation, honed with the help of a crew of skilled collaborators. This is a literal iPhone dump, a collection of mostly verité documents—captured, as the artist revealed on Instagram, nearly a decade before New Blue Sun—of André sitting down at the keys and letting his fingers wander, in his words, “randomly but with purpose.” The sound is appealingly grainy; the rough edges, such as occasional mic fluff, or what sounds like faint background chatter, proudly left in.

The brief length of the release—just over 16 minutes—works greatly in its favor. As inviting as New Blue Sun could be, it was also, at nearly an hour and a half, an unwieldy sprawl. A first listen to sketches almost dares you to dismiss these piano takes as throwaway fragments that stop short before achieving any kind of liftoff, but repeated spins reveal a wealth of intriguing detail.

As a finished release, this isn't quite as tossed off as its maker would have us believe. The strongest piece, “off rhythm laughter,” transcends its one-take-improv origin thanks to savvy post-production touches including looped background laughter and a faint drone that gradually overwhelms the keys, leading into a minute of blissful ambient drift. Like watching a coherent image dissolve into blots of pure color, the effect is straightforward but highly effective. (In contrast, the addition of a drum machine on the final piece, “i spend all day waiting for the night,” almost feels like a letdown—a guardrail on a sandbox.)

Even on the more stripped-down pieces, the playing rarely feels haphazard; surprisingly, André often sounds more assured at the keys than on the acoustic and digital woodwinds heard on New Blue Sun. On “and then one day you'll…,” he alternates between warm, swelling chords and droll single-note turnarounds, outlining a skeletal song form, while on “hotel lobby pianos,” he finds a charming six-beat vamp that vaguely recalls what McCoy Tyner—one of the piano inspirations he cited in his Instagram announcement—played on John Coltrane's version of Rodgers and Hammerstein's “My Favorite Things,” a piece memorably covered on The Love Below. What he lacks in technique, he makes up for in a patient, inherently musical approach—he may just be noodling, but the sketches can't help but resemble blueprints.

It may be tempting to draw comparisons—or contrasts—between André's playing here and the various names he listed on Instagram, including another jazz great, Thelonious Monk, and master songwriters such as Joni Mitchell and Stephen Sondheim. But, as with the many well-circulated touchstones for New Blue Sun, it's probably best to take the artist as his word: As an instrumentalist, he's not remotely in their class, and, with his candidly novice approach, he's not making any effort to get there. (Nor is he playing “jazz” simply because he's working spontaneously: The Köln Concert, this is not.)

As with New Blue Sun, some may ask of 7 piano sketches, what gives him the right? The right to treat his doodles as gallery-ready—or worthy of being rolled out to the world via the stunt-like piano-as-backpack costume portrayed on the cover, which André sported at the Met Gala the night the release dropped, with accompanying prestige merch. The simplest answer: because he's André 3000. Few contemporary artists in any genre have united off-the-wall originality and massive success in quite the way he has. So, yes, he is a special case. Naturally, we're going to read more into a curated collection of his home recordings than those of the fellow parent at school pickup who offers to send us a link to their Google Drive.

So, just like New Blue Sun, these pieces could never be considered in a vacuum, nor should they be. They have to be heard as part of a larger experiment, an inquiry into what happens when you reject the careerism at the heart of the pop machine and decide to go a quieter, less goal-oriented way.

And even the chronology here matters: It's not simply that the flute excursions of New Blue Sun emboldened André to try the same experiment with the piano. It's that, in the wake of that foray, he was inspired to dig out recordings that previously, as he stated on Instagram, he'd only ever relished privately, or texted to family and friends, indicating that his faith in a directionless direction is steadily growing.

Sure, you can listen to these pieces and wonder why they aren't more “finished”; why he didn't take piano lessons and then try again; why he's bothering with any of this at all instead of getting back to the virtuosic rapping that made him famous. Or, you could just be grateful he saw fit to add us all to his Contacts list.

Think of the title of Lunchbox's 2023 release, New Jazz, as the Harlem rapper-producer's attempt to distinguish himself among a wave of drill and internet rap descended from the likes of Future and Chief Keef. No, Lunchbox isn't splicing Miles Davis and Wynton Marsalis horn samples between the whirring synths (though in an 2023 interview, he claimed some of the beats had a “saxophone” presence). But in an underground middle class filled with striving Yeat clones and Opium-adjacent lackeys, he wasn't satisfied to become another dead-eyed rage adherent “curating a vibe” out of chaos. Lunchbox's counterproposal—confirmed by his 2024 album, Lunchtime., and the singles and loosies on his SoundCloud—relied not just on the characteristically blown-out sound of rage rap but the creativity of the melodies he put on top.

Lunchbox's latest release, L.B. Cooper, is an exercise in refinement. Forsaking the trend of maximalist data dumps (each of his last three releases featured at least 22 songs), the tape comes in at a brisk 13 tracks and 25 minutes. Lunchbox stretches the limited space by turning the focus toward his off-kilter melodies, twisting his delivery as though he were rapping and singing under duress. Not every execution is outstanding, but the earnest effort to push himself—along with his team of producers—nets him more successes than missteps.

The L.B. Cooper production credits read like the Lunchbox All-Stars, with Amir, Chromes, and Mowz handling much of the responsibilities, as they did on New Jazz and Lunchtime. They've all understood the assignment—robotic landscapes tinged with enough darkness to border on moody—though Amir still seems the most attuned to the rapper's quirks, having worked with him since 2023. His frenetic synths on “Feelin Myself” hit top speed in an instant and seem almost to graft to Lunchbox's voice. On “So Not Me,” a thundering bassline and a high, piercing whirr resemble the ambient noise on an intergalactic spaceship as Lunchbox tries to break through the gates of heaven with his croons.

It's Chromes who scores the single strongest moment with “Goin Bad,” where melodies that sound ripped from the dial-up modems and the arcade game Dig Dug lace the beat with boyish personality as Lunchbox spits with the unbridled energy of a Harlem street freestyle. Even new collaborators like Texas underground artist rexv2 fit seamlessly—his beat on “Act Like U Kno” wouldn't feel out of place on the deep recesses of F1lthy's hard drive, with synth progressions that ebb and flow with Lunchbox's crescendos. But the relative uniformity means that less specular beats, like the ones on “Gta” and “Gta 2/Eta,” blend too easily into the background.

The draw of L.B. Cooper lies in the deft way Lunchbox contorts his vocals to elevate his storytelling. He's like the surface of a pond on a breezy day, moving on a whim while still somehow perfectly in place; whether morose or quietly faded or blissfully hyped, each mood is a natural turn for his sound. On “Luv,” he extends his syllables to fill the space between blown-out basslines, lingering amid the hectic production, almost imploring you to focus on how his girl's love sustains him. His flows change with damn near every couplet on “Shady,” riding the Auto-Tuned upper register like a jet stream. There's a charm to the way he makes the most of his limited vocal range: “Baby can you see the pain?” he sings on “So Not Me,” voice straining like it's 4 a.m. in a Koreatown karaoke spot and he's putting it all on the line.

The emotional peaks in Lunchbox's melodies don't always pave over the gaps left by the lyrics' lack of substance. Standard boasts about flying girls out to Mykonos and getting racks in various ways fill the space, but you're not meant to listen to L.B. Cooper for the soliloquies. What's exciting is the feeling that Lunchbox is throwing out new cadences and runs on the spot, drawing from the energy of freestyling to introduce greater spontaneity. There's an earnest effort to ensure that no two lines sound the same, and it's this refusal to coast on copy-pasted chaos that separates the tiers of rage-rap artists. As the ad-libs spill out on “Act Like U Kno,” Lunchbox breathlessly spits, “Look what I just made today,” sounding like a kid who's sprinted home from school to show his mom a new project. It's that pride in the craft that ensures L.B. Cooper doesn't get sucked in by the gravitational pull of mediocrity.

Miley Cyrus' ninth studio album, Something Beautiful, arrives at the end of the month. Now, she's shared another single from the record: “More to Lose” follows “Prelude,” “Something Beautiful” and “End of the World.” Cyrus co-wrote the new song with Autumn Rowe and Michael Pollack, and she directed the accompanying music video with Jacob Bixenman and Brendan Walter. Watch it below.

Cyrus co-produced “More to Lose” with Pollack, BJ Burton, Shawn Everett, and Foxygen's Jonathan Rado. The track also features contributions from bassist Pino Palladino, multi-instrumentalist Drew Erickson, and others.

Something Beautiful, the follow-up to 2023's Endless Summer Vacation, is out May 30 via Columbia. A companion film also directed by Cyrus, Bixenman, and Walter will receive a theatrical release in June. She has previously described Something Beautiful as like Pink Floyd's The Wall, “but with a better wardrobe and more glamorous and filled with pop culture.”

Stupid rich pop stars have dreams, too. At least as far as I can tell. Beyoncé wants to turn pop stardom into the family business. Taylor Swift probably wants to use her army of 35-year-old white women to get access to the nuclear codes. Ariana Grande wants the next Wicked movie to win her every award. Katy Perry wants, I don't know, Katy Perry stuff. Halsey, for a moment, wanted me to have a very bad day at work. Drake wants to be Kendrick. Kendrick wants to be Drake. The Weeknd wants to be one of the sleazeballs in Paul Schrader's porn-world noir Hardcore. As for Justin Bieber, I believe that, deep down, he wants to be a regional rap star. The kind who might shoot vlogs at jewelry stores and sneaker resale shops and make most of their money doing 25 minute sets in cities like Tucson and Omaha and shilling weed strains on their Instagram stories. One who might only be a part of the general online conversation when they pop up on a stream or get name-dropped during the Lil Yachty panel at ComplexCon.

My proof is that, lately, Bieber has been kind of tapped in. Bumping Drakeo the Ruler on the regular. Joining the Opium legion, including teasing a grainy Carti-esque snippet. Dressing like he's auditioning to be on the Conglomerate sequel. And, now, popping up on the soon-to-be-official remix of babushka-wearing New Orleans hothead Rob49's viral TikTok hit “WTHelly,” alongside Latto and G Herbo. This might not seem like a big deal considering Bieber has been brushing up against rap forever—pretty much all of his albums have a bunch of rappers on them, and he's on Rodeo getting washed by peak Thug—but he feels more attracted to the genre than ever.

My theory is that Bieber is yearning for the freedom of rappers, especially as a former child star with a ton of people depending on his music not to rock the boat too much so that the money train doesn't get held up. He's never really had the chance to put out music that is uncensored and raw, out there and random, or silly and boneheaded. And what's the point of all the cash and fame if you can't get smacked in the studio one night, talk shit on a Michigan type beat, and put it out the next morning without an entire team of label executives, managers, and corporate bagmen getting up your ass about it?

So, to cut loose, Bieber hopped on the “WTHelly” remix, which hasn't been officially released but was premiered during Rob49's appearance on a stream held by Reggie, a Baltimore comedian of the Kai Cenat universe or whatever. (By my count there are literally a million of these guys.) If you're unfamiliar with “WTHelly,” here's the rundown: When you sit through the entire two minutes it's the dumbest rap hit of the year, and when you absorb it strictly through 15 second IG Reels, the way it's meant to be, it's still pretty dumb but also fun as hell. If you can get past the stock violin beat, the appeal is Rob49's swerving-in-traffic flow, which has the improvised, unserious feel of a goofy radio freestyle—an aspect of hip-hop culture that has felt diminished in the shift from live radio to the heavily edited YouTube performance series. That energy is used to pull off the song's big idea: morphing the mild confusion of “What the hell?” into the you-got-me-fucked-up shock of “What the helly?”

Clearly stoned out of his mind and having a ball, Rob49, with life-or-death intensity, drops in a “What the helly?” after nearly every bar. None of the situations described in the song require this level of emotion (“I get bad hoes naked, bad hoes give me Becky/What the helly?/Bad hoe call me daddy, I ain't her fuckin' daddy/What the helly?”), but he's really committed to it. Genuinely, it feels like he has no idea what words are about to come out of his mouth.

The funniest part of it all is the finale, where Rob doesn't seem like he knows when the beat is going to cut off, so he kills time with off-the-dome spins on “What the helly?”: “What the helly-liante?” (jeweler Elliot Eliantte), “What the helly-burton?” (Indiana Pacers guard Tyrese Haliburton), “What the helly-Bron James?” (LeBron James). His On the Radar performance even adds more, like it's a director's cut, including “What the helly-Oubre?” (Philadelphia 76ers wing Kelly Oubre) and my favorite, “What the fucky?” (the word “fuck”). He beats the joke into the ground like a sketch comic, an effect that keeps the song constantly rotating between hilarious, annoying, and hilarious again. It's a solid, stupid rap hit in the way that NLE Choppa's “Slut Me Out 2” was, though that one is a better song because wanting to have sex with yourself is a stickier concept.

I think it's easy to tell why Bieber is drawn to “WTHelly.” Here's a rapper just throwing shit at the wall, going viral by running with a half-assed joke he came up with on a whim in the studio. Bieber's deep respect for “WTHelly” comes through in a leaked Instagram DM from about a month ago. “Bad hoes give me Becky,” he apparently messaged Rob; the lyric clearly had moved him. Naturally, Rob gave thanks by typing back, “Wthellyyyyy WtBieberrrrr.” I imagine that made Bieber's day.

Unfortunately, Bieber's remix is awful. He doesn't even rap, and, instead, harmonizes as the fast-paced drums fade out to make space for a slow and cloudy piano outro. “What the helly I'ma do if I can't get through to you?” sings Bieber repeatedly, like he thinks he's on a Boyz II Men record. I just know he has a Notes app full of bars about smoking weed and getting head that he's been jotting down for a decade, but he opts to keep those on ice. The only saving grace is that his vocals sound slightly pitched-up. What's the point of Bieber being on the track if he's not going to fully lean into the off-the-cuff spirit and format of the original?

How was the mark missed so badly? Did Bieber's handlers give him guidelines that they will only allow him to fool around if he sang? Did he chicken out and retreat to his comfort zone? Do rappers just want Bieber to be Bieber they know? Who knows. Maybe Bieber just thinks these overproduced switch-ups are extremely cool. He is a Travis Scott guy, after all. I'm not sure what I expected. Bieber's Stinc Team impression? His interpretation of the “Evil J0rdan” flow? That would have been a disaster, but the kind of disaster that a real regional rap star would drop on Track 17 of their third mixtape of the year without a second thought. Perhaps all my fantasies about who Bieber is or wants to be in 2025 are complete bullshit, and he is still, above all, just Justin Bieber the popstar, and he's cool with that.

In 1997, Dante Basco, known to me as the Filipino dude from that one season of Moesha, starred in the uncomfortably bad comedy Fakin' da Funk as Julian, a Chinese American teen who grew up raised in a Black family. At the beginning of the movie, the family moves from Atlanta to Los Angeles, where Julian undergoes an identity crisis about his culture, brought on by neighborhood kids questioning why he uses slang and plays basketball. (You're telling me in Los Angeles in 1997 they've never met a Chinese kid who likes rap and basketball? Sure.) As is the norm in the '90s, L.A. rapper Tone Loc is part of the cast as a gangster from around the way named Frog. He doesn't really do much except mumble a lot and wear sunglasses, but he does get Julian's little brother mixed up in the gang. Julian and Frog end up having to settle their differences through a basketball game, which Julian, of course, wins. Unexpectedly, Frog takes the loss pretty well and doesn't pull a Wood Harris at the end of Above the Rim. After that journey, Fakin' da Funk left me with a very important message: You can check the African American box off on your census if you can hoop.

The next evolution in open world video games is being able to make tdf type beats whenever you want.

Listening to Tovi's “Jiggy” is what I imagine it was like to sit in a dark room in 1994 taking in Bone Thugs' group prayer on “Mr. Quija” for the first time. The Philly drill weirdo pushes the hushed, faded-out flows Ot7Quanny and NR Boor have tinkered with to the brink, rapping like a vengeful mummy back from the afterlife. Every time I show Tovi's cryptic, horrorcore-adjacent rap to a friend, the immediate response has been a hand on my shoulder, followed by, “Are you doing alright, man?” As expected, “Jiggy” is a psychedelic, barely one-minute oddity with a flickering beat that sounds half-finished in the best way and gruff whispering that's so over-the-top you'll need to rely on the captions in the music video. His lyrics aren't actually that spooky—lots of talk of getting money and BBLs—but he says them like he found them written on a basement wall in red paint. However “Jiggy” came to be, I am just glad to have Tovi popping out from the shadows every six months or so to drop 90 seconds of unholiness.

							By 

	David Browne



	In mid-March, Jill Sobule arrived at her friend Michelle Lewis' home in L.A. to write songs with Lewis and her co-writing partner, former Letters to Cleo frontperson Kay Hanley. Calling themselves Sugar Tits, the three had collaborated periodically over the years. As Lewis and Hanley learned right away, Sobule had one tune already in hand: a sly ditty filled with words that rhymed with “unt” (“runt,” “blunt,” “grunt,” “Emily Blunt,” and so on). One chorus ended, teasingly, with “J.D. Vance is a …” Only in the last chorus did Sobule actually sing the full line: “J.D. Vance is a cunt.”


	“She played it for us, and we were like, ‘Oh, my God,'” Hanley tells Rolling Stone. “Michelle and I came up with background parts and we filmed it and I started a TikTok account for Sugar Tits and just threw it up.”

A post shared by Jill Sobule (@jillsobule)


	A month and a half later, Sobule, most widely known for the ground-breaking bisexual anthem “I Kissed a Girl,” died tragically in a house fire in Woodbury, Minnesota, where she was staying with friends. Sobule was in town to help prep a performance of her one-woman-with-band autobiographical musical, F*ck 7th Grade. The cause of the fire is not yet known (the case is still “under active investigation,” Woodbury police tell Rolling Stone), and a toxicology report on the cause of death will likely take weeks. As to why Sobule didn't make it out the burning house in time, her manager, John Porter, wonders if one of her medical issues played a role. “She was in so much back pain that she was taking muscle relaxants or sedatives to sleep, and that might have made it harder for her to get out,” he says. “But I don't know for sure.”

	











	As far as “J.D. Vance Is a C___,” Sobule told Westword, a few days before her death, that it was a “really dumb little thing with a lot of words that rhyme with ‘cunt.' It's not radio-friendly. It's not my best song, but it does get to the point.” In a bittersweet irony, the song — possibly the last one she wrote — was becoming a viral hit when she died. The two-minute video of Sugar Tits singing “J.D. Vance Is a C___” was approaching one million views on Facebook, giving Sobule more public exposure than she'd had in years and thrusting her back into the national conversation in ways she didn't expect.

	Although the general public was largely unaware of Sobule's work after “I Kissed a Girl” and the 1995 Clueless anthem “Supermodel,” she'd remained active all along. An original cast recording of F*ck 7th Grade was scheduled for release next month, and she was planning to start cutting a new album this summer. Sobule was also working on a memoir and was prepping to write new material with Sugar Tits (named after something Mel Gibson supposedly said to a female cop when he was pulled over for drunk driving in 2006, although Gibson has denied that).


	For another project, Sobule had reached out in February to frequent collaborator, journalist, cartoonist, and musician Bill DeMain. She told him she was working on a group of songs “playfully criticizing people in the new administration,” DeMain recalls. Topical songs weren't new to Sobule; her earlier “Soldiers of Christ” and “America Back” took aim at Christian conservatism and MAGA, respectively. In this case, Sobule had written one verse for “J.D. Vance Is a C___” but needed a melody, so DeMain devised what he calls a “Harry Nilsson-type tune” that would offset the bluntness of the lyric. “She said, ‘That's great,' because it lightens it but also makes it more, in her word, ‘insidious,'” says DeMain, who also contributed a verse.


	As it turns out, “J.D. Vance Is a C___” was tailor-made for Sugar Tits. “The plan was to make social media videos, because the topics of Sugar Tits songs are what's in the news now,” says Hanley. “It's not really stuff you're meant to dwell on. ‘J.D. Vance Is a Cunt' is great video to look at, take in, laugh at it, and then for it to leave your consciousness.”

	After the video of the song (filmed in Lewis' living room) went viral, Sobule wasn't content to have the song exist only in that space. Before she went on the road opening for the Fixx in early April, she debuted it at a few solo shows. Talking about the difference between headlining her own gigs and opening for other acts, she told one crowd, “I can do whatever,” and played “J.D. Vance Is a C___.”


	At those shows at least, her fans responded enthusiastically. “It's not easy to write political songs without sounding like an asshole or preachy or, holier than thou, and it's really difficult to do that especially for women,” says Hanley. “But she was so funny, sweet and smart that you just couldn't be pissed at her. When claws came out for other sorts of liberal activists, Jill seemed to avoid some of that because of the way she was. She was like pixie dust.”

	











	When she started opening for the Fixx, though, the reaction wasn't always so positive. At a show at the Palladium in New York, Sobule was shoved by one woman (possibly two) as she made her way to her merch table after her set. “They told her, ‘Keep your politics to yourself,' or something like that,” says Porter. During a text exchange afterwards, Hanley asked Sobule if the New York experience was shocking. “It was, but I'm over it now,” Sobule texted back. “Back in the saddle.” 


	The following night, Sobule told that story to a Fixx crowd in Pennsylvania — and then sang the song anyway. At another Fixx show, someone in the crowd yelled at her after she sang it. For the next few shows, Porter let security at those venues know there could be an issue, although nothing dramatic or dangerous happened. “It's not an artist manager's job to get in the way of a creative and activist soul like Jill,” says Porter. “In the case of the ‘J.D.' song, artists need to stand up to authoritarian bullies. Jill was already at risk by this administration being who and what she was — a strong, politically active woman. Encouraging her to be her and set an example for others, easier for me. I am behind the scenes. But Jill was brave and willing to be an instigator.”


	Sobule did, however, decide not to perform “J.D. Vance Is a C___” at shows in Franklin, Tennessee, and Richmond, Virginia. Both shows taking place in the South was one reason, as was the fact that Sobule's regular tour manager wasn't working those days. “She was more alone [at those shows],” Porter says. “These MAGA bears need to be poked, but her safety and health came first.” (After her sets, Sobule did opt to sing the song for fans at her merch table.)


	“The fact that the song has struck a chord is maybe because we're not hearing a lot of songwriters who are brave enough to criticize [the Trump team],” says DeMain. “And humor is one of the things that really bothers Trump. It's why he gets so mad at Jimmy Kimmel or Saturday Night Live, because he doesn't know how to laugh, so he's furious. She acknowledged it was just kind of a silly little throwaway thing, but it's something people will be talking about.”

	At the moment, the future of “J.D. Vance Is a C___” is unclear. In 2017, Sobule compiled an album of modern protest songs, Monster Protest Jamz (Volume 1), with contributions from her, Jackson Browne, Tom Morello, Graham Nash, and others. Porter feels that the song (assuming there is a workable recorded version of it) could fit on a second possible volume. “She kept adding verses to it,” he says. “It turns out that lots of things rhyme that were apropos.”

	











	In the meantime, her friends, including her occasional bandmates, are wrapping their heads around Sobule's shocking death. Sobule had planned on returning to Los Angeles to resume writing songs for Sugar Tits posts. “She was going be staying with Michelle and that was what we had planned for this week,” says Hanley. “Instead, we're planning a Shiva.”

This post contains spoilers for the first three episodes of Poker Face Season Two, now streaming on Peacock. 


	The first season of Poker Face had a fairly straightforward premise and structure. Each week, Natasha Lyonne's Charlie Cale would drive into a new locale, discover that a murder had taken place, and solve it using her uncanny ability to recognize when people are lying. And then, because she was on the run from vengeful mobster Sterling Frost (Ron Perlman), she had to quickly move onto a new town. 


	The season finale killed off Frost, but then introduced a new vengeful mobster in Beatrix Hasp (Rhea Perlman, no relation to Ron), and it seemed as if the series would continue indefinitely with Charlie perpetually being chased by one bad guy or another. 


	Well, so much for that. In the new season's third episode, Charlie helps Beatrix solve the murder of her husband Jeffrey (Richard Kind) by crooked FBI agent Danny (John Mulaney), and in return, Beatrix agrees to call off the hit. Charlie is safe, and free to stop wandering. But rather than move back to Reno, where she was living when the series started, or going to Atlantic City to reconcile with her estranged sister, the episode ends with her looking at a road map of America and putting her finger down on it blindly, picking a new destination at random. And the “This season, on Poker Face” trailer that follows shows Charlie in a variety of locales across the country. 

	











	Why, after all of the trouble Poker Face creator Rian Johnson and company went to in order to keep Charlie a fugitive, would they end the Hasp threat so quickly? And how does the show function if she has no need to keep running? Rolling Stone spoke with Johnson last month to get the no bullshit explanation for it all.  


Why did you decide to end the idea of Charlie being a fugitive? Part of it was me feeling exhausted at the notion of repeating Season One, and slipping into a rut and feeling like every season was chase, chase, chase, and the finale was a mob boss episode. But it was also me feeling, when we sat down in the room, that I really wanted to define both for the writing staff and also for the audience, bring this back to being an episodic show, and make sure the emphasis is on that. We took away the external threat for Charlie, so that every episode is her landing in a place and maybe being a little more introspective about, “Why do I keep moving?” Or, “Could I see myself being here?” It gave us more ammunition for her to form these relationships that are the things that pull her into these crimes. There were a lot of different reasons for it, but it felt natural, and once we committed to it, I was really happy we did.

While she was on the run, Charlie couldn't call the cops for help, couldn't have a phone, or any of the other methods that most mystery shows heroes can employ when they get in trouble. How did giving her access to these things change the storytelling?   Those new freedoms that she had, I found they didn't fundamentally break the show. There are some things, like cell phones in horror movies, that suddenly become obstacles to the dynamic of what makes something work. I felt we had established the character as kind of a lone wolf, she's not the type who's going to really get in there and start collaborating with law enforcement or science. I felt like there were enough ground rules for her as a character, and we were on solid enough ground that we could cut her loose from some of those restrictions and keep ourselves honest in terms of what makes the show actually tick.


When we spoke before the first season, you and Natasha both said you'd love to keep this show going for as long as possible. Do you still feel that way after making another season? I don't know, man. Maybe it's because I'm getting older. I'm really proud of this season, let's put it out there and see how it goes. Let's see how we're feeling when those conversations start happening. But I know that there's nothing about the experience that makes me want to stop doing it.

Having made 10 episodes of the show already, was it easier or harder to do this time? Harder! It keeps getting harder. It should get easier the more that you do it, but it's harder. Also, we did 12 episodes this time as opposed to 10. It leaves me more in the awe of network shows who turn out twentysomething episodes of a season. Even doing 12 episodes instead of 10 from last season felt like running two marathons instead of one. It's a beast, man. TV is hard, but it's fun.

							By 

	Nikki McCann Ramirez



	President Donald Trump can't decide if taxing the ultra rich is worth it. 


	In a Friday morning Truth Social post, the president wrote that “Republicans should probably not do it, but I'm OK if they do!!!” 


	“The problem with even a ‘TINY' tax increase for the RICH, which I and all others would graciously accept in order to help the lower and middle income workers, is that the Radical Left Democrat Lunatics would go around screaming,'Read my lips,' the fabled Quote by George Bush the Elder,” Trump wrote, referencing George H.W. Bush declaring, “Read my lips: no new taxes,” during the 1988 Republican National Convention.


	The wishy-washy commentary comes just a few weeks after Trump told Time magazine that while he supported a tax hike for the rich, he was thinking about the potential political fallout. 


	“I actually love the concept, but I don't want it to be used against me politically, because I've seen people lose elections for less, especially with the fake news,” he told the magazine. “The only reason I wouldn't support it is because I saw [H.W.] Bush where they said, where he said ‘Read my lips' and he lost an election. He would have lost it anyway, but he lost an election. He got beat up pretty good.” 

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	Trump posted that Republicans should “probably not” raise taxes on the rich the morning after he reportedly instructed Republicans to bump up taxes on the ultra wealthy. 


	According to sources who spoke to The New York Times, the president's proposal would add a new income bracket for individuals making over $2.5 million a year, and subject them to a 39.6 percent tax on income above that threshold. According to a separate report from The Washington Post, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has also floated placing individuals who make over $5 million a year in their own tax bracket. 


	The proposal is likely an attempt to assuage widespread public concern over the GOP's current fiscal project, which proposes to make Trump's 2017 tax cuts — which heavily favored wealthy Americans — permanent, and then paying for those same cuts by firing federal employees, slashing entitlements, and gutting other government programs. One source told the Times that the president believes a small tax hike for high earners could help keep Medicaid's budget off of the chopping block.

	Taxing the rich sounds great, but Trump is clearly conflicted about the matter, and so are Republicans in Congress. Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) told The Washington Post that while he was cool with it, “zero” or at most “maybe one or two” other Republicans would support such a proposal. 


	Last month, House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) said he was “not in favor of raising the tax rates, because our party is the group that stands against that traditionally,” during a Fox News interview.

	In his April interview with Time, Trump may have inadvertently given up the game. Yes it's a tax hike, but a marginal one that rich people might be willing to absorb because it's almost negligible. 


	“I would be honored to pay more, but I don't want to be in a position where we lose an election because I was generous — but me, as a rich person, would not mind paying and you know, we're talking about very little,” he said. “We're talking about one point. It doesn't make that much difference, and yet, I could just see somebody trying to bring that up as a subject, and, you know, say, ‘Oh, he raised taxes.'”

Judas Priest found out too late that Ozzy Osbourne and Black Sabbath would be playing a star-studded farewell concert this summer to join in on the festivities, frontman Rob Halford recently told Metal Hammer. A talent agent in Germany recruited the band to perform at the 60th anniversary concert for another venerated metal band, the Scorpions, on July 5, and despite Sharon Osbourne offering to fly the band to and from Birmingham, England for Ozzy's final bow in time to honor their Scorpions commitment, Judas Priest declined.


	“It all got announced and was a big deal — Scorpions and Priest — and suddenly I get this phone call [from Sharon Osbourne]: ‘Robbie, I know you've got this gig with Scorpions, but could you consider coming over to do a thing with Ozzy and the guys, he'd love to see you.'”


	Halford mulled over Sharon's offer to ferry the band via private jet between the concerts, but the singer didn't want to leave anything to chance. “Even with a private plane, there's a word called ‘technical', where something could go wrong, or the weather that time of year could cause problems… I was absolutely gutted,” he said.

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	He nevertheless said that he was excited for the concert, even Judas Priest would be there, since it reinforces Birmingham's status as the birthplace of heavy metal. Like Black Sabbath, Judas Priest formed in the city. (And incidentally, ex-Priest guitarist, K.K. Downing, will be performing at the event.


	In addition to Osbourne and Black Sabbath, the concert, dubbed Back to the Beginning, will feature sets by Metallica, Guns N' Roses, Tool, Slayer, Pantera, Gojira, Alice in Chains, and many others. It will take place at Birmingham's Villa Park. “All my mates are going to be there though, great bands and artists,” Halford told Metal Hammer. “It's a wonderful and epic moment for Sabbath and heavy metal.”

	Halford may be missing out on Black Sabbath's farewell, but he should take some comfort that he was actually one of the few headbangers to have been there at the actual beginning. In 2020, he told Rolling Stone what it was like to see Sabbath's early club gigs in Birmingham. “I have vague memories of seeing them as Earth in an obscure club in Birmingham, and they were in a sort of heavy-blues, jazzy-prog mode musically,” he said. “I can only recall the very first Sabbath songs like [Crow's] ‘Evil Woman,' which was a cover. There was still some freeform noodling going on when they played live, but essentially the heaviness was dominating.”

	He was also present for the first time when the original Black Sabbath lineup said goodbye at the conclusion of Osbourne's No More Tours tour in 1992. At the time, Osbourne had been worried about his health and decided to take a final bow, before reversing course a couple of years later with the Retirement Sucks tour. Black Sabbath had reunited with Ronnie James Dio. When the idea of Black Sabbath opening for Osbourne's final shows came up, Dio quit, and Halford became their frontman for two shows. The rest of the band — guitarist Tony Iommi, bassist Geezer Butler, and drummer Bill Ward — then joined Osbourne for encores later in the evening. Halford also fronted Sabbath for a short set in Camden, New Jersey, in 2004 when Osbourne fell ill.

Eminem's stalker was found guilty of first-degree home invasion and aggravated stalking after breaking into the rapper's home outside of Detroit for a second time last summer, The Detroit News reports. 


	Matthew David Hughes, 32, was convicted earlier this week after a short trial that began Tuesday (May 6) and ended the following day. Eminem testified during the trial, as did his security chief, and the jury returned the guilty verdict after about 90 minutes of deliberation. Hughes will be sentenced June 17.


	Hughes has a history of stalking Eminem, going back to 2019 when he broke into one of the rapper's former homes looking for him. He was ultimately convicted of breaking and entering and sentenced to 90 days in prison. 


	The following year, Hughes successfully broke into Eminem's actual home, with the rapper claiming that he woke up to find Hughes in his bedroom and that Hughes threatened to kill him. Hughes pleaded guilty and was sentenced to five years probation, though a violation in an unrelated assault landed him back in prison. He was released on parole in May 2024.

	Prosecutor Seven Fox said that, like the 2020 incident, Eminem was sleeping when Hughes broke into his property early one morning last August. This time, however, Hughes did not make it to the rapper's bedroom. Fox said that Eminem has taken to sleeping in a padlocked room in a secluded part of his home because of the past incidents with Hughes. 


	“Marshall Mathers has taken extraordinary steps to protect himself and his family,” Fox said. “Security 24/7. And each time that step has had to increase, but only as the result of one person's actions, Matthew Hughes. The world becomes smaller. He's on an island.”


	According to authorities, Eminem's security team spotted Hughes near Eminem's home at about 7 a.m. on Aug. 26, 2024. Hughes had apparently entered the property through an unlocked door and fled with a stolen bike, likely after realizing he'd been spotted. He was apprehended a few days later after one of Eminem's employees saw him while shopping at a Walmart. Police believe Hughes was homeless at the time and living in the woods nearby.

	Hughes had pleaded not guilty to the charges against him. His public defender called the case circumstantial, saying there was no direct evidence linking Hughes to the break-in, including a lack of potential DNA or fingerprints from the door he allegedly used to break into the home. 

	











	A representative for Eminem did not immediately return Rolling Stone's request for comment.

Lil Durk appeared today in a federal courtroom in downtown Los Angeles, where a judge denied his souped-up bid to be released on bond pending his Oct. 14 trial on charges he orchestrated a murder-for-hire plot that led to a man's death.


	Moments after the the Grammy-winning “All My Life” rapper heard the ruling, he was asked to enter a plea to the second superseding indictment filed in the case last week. “Not guilty,” he said while seated at a defense table wearing a beige jail uniform and knit kufi cap in keeping with him Muslim faith.


	At the end of the hourlong hearing, the 32-year-old artist stood up and smiled broadly at a group of nearly two dozen supporters seated in the gallery. He raised his right hand to his heart and nodded at various family and friends before U.S. Marshals led him back into detention.


	“He's strong and focused,” the rapper's dad, Dontay “Big Durk” Banks, tells Rolling Stone. “You saw the smile that was on his face, both during the time and afterwards, after the ruling. He's still smiling. He's still strong. He's standing on his faith, you know, and believing that God will make a way for him.”

	











	Lil Durk, born Durk Banks, had proposed paying Beverly Hills-based ARSEC Security to enforce a strict home detention program with around-the-clock armed guards while he prepares for his upcoming trial. He also increased the cash portion of his proposed bail package, adding $150,000 to the $1 million previously offered by Alamo Records.


	In oral arguments, Banks' lead lawyer, Drew Findling, said the “robust” proposal was more than adequate considering Banks has no prior criminal record. Findling said the circumstances of the case also changed when prosecutors filed their updated indictment last week. He said they “removed” two of the three “specific facts” in the prior indictment that purportedly connected Banks to the August 2022 shooting death of Saviay'a Robinson at a gas station near the Beverly Center mall in Los Angeles.

	Speaking to the judge, Findling said prosecutors not only eliminated the allegation that Banks “monetized and celebrated the death” with song lyrics, they also removed the allegation that Banks directed a co-defendant to pay “the bounty” for Robinson's death. Findling argued the new indictment now hinges on only “sweeping generalizations” that Banks offered a bounty for the death of Robinson's cousin, Tyquian Terrel Bowman, also known as Quando Rondo. (Prosecutors allege Banks wanted Bowman dead because he blamed him for the death of a childhood friend. Robinson was traveling with Bowman the day a group of alleged hitmen opened fire on Bowman's car, killing Robinson.)

	











	When it was his turn to speak, Assistant U.S. Attorney Ian Yanniello disputed the claim that the murder-for-hire indictment rises or falls on the lyrics no longer specifically cited. “This murder case is not about [Banks'] lyrics, and it's not about his music. It's about his conduct, and the steps he allegedly took when he allegedly dispatched hitmen to hunt, stalk and kill a rival,” Yanniello said. He also claimed the government hadn't “conceded” anything.


	“The government stands by the allegation that [Banks] did in fact commercialize his violence. But that's a question for another day,” Yanniello said. He said the matter would be decided when the court takes up motions on the evidence to be allowed at trial.


	Before she issued her ruling denying Banks' bond, U.S. Magistrate Judge Patricia Donahue said she had received a report claiming Banks “repeatedly used at least 13 other inmate phone accounts to make phone calls” from his detention center. She said it was a violation of the facility's rules. She also said Banks appeared to be engaging in three-way calls.

	Findling argued that inmates using other inmates' phone accounts is a common practice inside federal detention centers. He said there was no evidence Banks was doing anything other than connecting with his family. The lawyer said he's in regular contact with officials at Banks' detention facility and that he's heard “nothing but praise for Mr. Banks' conduct” and his “commitment to his Muslim faith.”


	The judge still cited the phone issue when she issued her ruling. She said while the practice of using other inmates' phone accounts “might not be uncommon, it showed a disrespect for the rules, and that's precisely the court's concerns with regard to risk of flight.”


	In denying Banks' release, Donahue said the charges against the rapper “remain the most serious, as reflected in the potential punishment.” According to prosecutors, the indictment's charge of murder for hire resulting in death carries a mandatory minimum penalty of life in prison.


	Speaking after the hearing, Findling tells Rolling Stone he plans to appeal the bail decision. He says the “only” remaining fact-based allegation left in the indictment is an Aug. 18, 2022, text in which Banks purportedly told a co-conspirator: “Don't book no flights under no names involved wit me.” Prosecutors claim the text shows that Banks was trying to conceal his involvement in the movement of the alleged hitmen.

	











	“The superseding indictment is really only down to one specific fact. And it's an out-of-context text message,” Findling, a prominent lawyer known for representing NBA YoungBoy, Cardi B, and President Donald Trump, says. “It's just completely out of context. They don't know what the meaning of it was. And other than that, there's nothing that sets forth any direct evidence tying him to anything that's alleged in the indictment.”


	As Rolling Stone first reported back in December, Banks has denied since last year that he “sought to commercialize” the shooting at the center of the case. In the prior indictment, prosecutors alleged that Bank's song “Wonderful Wayne & Jackie Boy,” released in December 2022 with Babyface Ray, referenced Banks' alleged revenge on Bowman. In the song, Banks raps, “Look on the news and see your son, You screamin', ‘No, no.” Prosecutors claimed it was a reference to Bowman seeing Robinson's dead body. At the prior bond hearing on Dec. 12, 2024, Findling argued that the song was recorded months before the shooting. He offered a sworn declaration from the song's producer, Justin Gibson, supporting the point.

	“The proverbial smoking gun is that this incident takes place, and then months later, Mr. Banks puts out a song to celebrate it and commercialize it,” Findling told the court in December. “That song was recorded approximately eight months before that incident took place.… We have all the time stamps from the producer. This took place not in August 2022, when the [shooting] took place. This music was produced, these lyrics performed by my client approximately seven months before in January of 2022.”


	Findling and his co-counsel attacked the use of the lyrics in a prior motion to dismiss. Prosecutors then filed the second superseding indictment without any lyrics last week. A hearing on the dismissal motion is set for June 2.

In the movie Arrival (2016), a seven-limbed alien species lands on Earth with a language that no human can understand. The aliens – dubbed Heptapods – are obliging enough to provide room in their spaceship for linguistic exchanges, but the team charged with translation is baffled. The creatures write in sentences that look like circular smoky inkblots, unlike anything on our planet.

The movie's drama – based on a story by Ted Chiang – rests on the sheer strangeness of the Heptapod language, but it's actually not as alien as it could be. Apart from the sci-fi twist that learning it imparts special abilities, the Heptapod language is not very different from ordinary human languages. The symbols are strange and circular, sure, but they still stand for words belonging to familiar grammatical categories like nouns and verbs, and can be translated into English. In fact, a major plot element in the movie is the mistranslation of a Heptapod noun meaning ‘tool' as ‘weapon'.

The situation is similar with several other nonhuman languages in fiction. Consider Klingon from Star Trek, now spoken by several Earthlings. Klingon's claim to alienness is that it contains a peculiar set of sounds and an unusual sentence structure. But, like human languages, it still contains nouns and verbs, and the same structural elements, like subject and object. The same is true of other fictional languages like Dothraki (Game of Thrones), Na'vi (Avatar) and Quenya (The Lord of the Rings).

Even outside fiction, imaginations are rather impoverished. The development of constructed languages (referred to as ‘conlangs') for fictional and other purposes draws primarily from linguistics. But, as a science, linguistics generally focuses on discovering the general rules governing actual, observable human languages – their sounds, symbols or gestures, their grammar, the elements and structure of their sentences, the meanings of their expressions, etc. And while conlangs may have unique vocabularies or flout one or more rules of human languages, the formula for creating one essentially involves adapting familiar elements from how Earthlings communicate.

As a philosopher of language, I find this unsatisfying. The space of possible languages is vast, and full of exotic languages that are much weirder and stranger than any we have yet imagined. We should explore what those might be – and for more than intellectual curiosity alone. If we one day encounter aliens through first contact or a signal sent across the galaxy, their language might be nothing like ours. After all, humans have evolved with certain cognitive abilities and limitations. Expecting intelligent beings with alternative origins to use languages like ours betrays an anthropocentric view of the cosmos. If we want to move beyond exchanging prime number sequences to figuring out what the extraterrestrials are actually saying, we need to be prepared.

To approach the space of possible alien languages, we must first consider the building blocks from which a language is constructed – and how these can differ. A language can be thought to contain four levels, corresponding to four features of human languages: sign, structure, semantics and pragmatics. While an alien language might not share all these features, it's helpful to know what they are before we venture into extraterrestrial strangeness.

At the first level are the signs: things that we produce, observe or exchange. The sounds we make using our vocal apparatus are signs; so is the alphabet you are looking at right now. Pictograms like an emoji or a ‘No smoking' symbol also belong to this level, as do logograms like some Chinese characters or Egyptian hieroglyphs, as well as the gestures of a sign language. Depending on the physical constitution of a creature, its language may employ a wider variety of signs than humans. While the language of nonhuman animals isn't complex, its signs may include smells or body movements. Even machines can employ signs, such as the high-pitched sounds of Gibberink, a language that some artificial intelligences use to interact.

The elements of language can reach out and be ‘about' things other than themselves

The second level is structure, and concerns word structure, grammar and syntax. A word is one structural element of a language, and so is a sentence. Further, words themselves can belong to grammatical types (eg, nouns, verbs, pronouns) and so can sentences (eg, questions, commands, declarations). So, for example, if you were analysing the words in the sentence Peacocks eat insects, you can identify the nouns and verb, and that it's a declaration not a question. Individual words also have an internal structure (eg, they can have suffixes, or other ways of marking case, tense, number, gender, etc) and so do sentences (eg, English sentences typically have a subject-verb-object structure, while those of Sanskrit have subject-object-verb). If you pluralised insect using ‘-s' as a prefix not a suffix, it would violate a rule of English word structure, and if you said Eat insects peacocks, it would violate a rule of English sentence structure.

The third level is semantics, which concerns meaning. Among the most enigmatic things about language is that its elements can reach out and be ‘about' things other than themselves, such as objects of the world or abstract concepts. The word mammoth is more than a collection of its letters: it refers to an elephant-like creature with tusks, which once roamed Earth. And the sentence Mammoths are extinct is more than a collection of words: it manages to say something true about the world.

The fourth level is pragmatics, which concerns how language users can say things that go beyond the literal meanings of the words they produce. When people use the idiom I could eat a horse, they are expressing hunger, not their attitude towards horses. And if someone in an action movie says We need to call Washington, the use of ‘Washington' is metonymic: it is a government, not the city. Sometimes, pragmatic phenomena allow us to convey meaning without breaking social norms. For example, if someone asks you for a dance, it can be more polite to say I am here with my partner than simply saying no. Such ‘implicatures' – along with metaphors and metonyms – belong to this level.

One recipe for creating an alien language could be to pick an arbitrary human language and make modifications to its rules concerning signs, structure, semantics or pragmatics. Perhaps the easiest is to make changes at the first level: signs. One could cook up an alien language by adopting an arbitrary set of phonemes that no spoken human language has. For a written language, one could choose an entirely new set of symbols.

If you were feeling particularly imaginative, this language could include signs from a completely new modality of articulation, like movements of the body (think bee dances) or electrical impulses, which was presumably used by the robots in the Hollywood movie AI Artificial Intelligence (2001) who communicated by touching each other. In principle, any familiar Earth language can be used as a ‘base' to construct such a language. The resulting alien language will seem very different from the base language, even when the alien language is identical to the familiar language at the level of structure, semantics and pragmatics.

Why must the structural elements of an alien language be the same as human languages?

A more elaborate recipe would be to construct an alien language with a structure that is different from that of familiar human languages. Word and sentence structure differs across human languages: some use prepositions while others use postpositions for the same purpose; some languages have a dedicated word to indicate definiteness (eg, the English definite article ‘the') while others like Swedish use suffixes to achieve the same effect (eg, Vetenskapsrådet, the word for the Swedish Research Council, indicates definiteness using the suffix ‘-et'). The word order in a sentence can vary across languages too. A majority of languages have sentences beginning with a subject – a referring expression like a name or a noun phrase like ‘the tiger' – but a tiny minority have them beginning with a verb.

One could cook up an alien language by picking and choosing grammatical rules from different languages in a systematic manner. In fact, the typical formula for constructing a fictional conlang involves putting together a potpourri of grammar rules, along with an exotic system of signs and a lexicon.

But there is scope to stretch our imagination further. Why must the structural elements of an alien language be the same as human languages? An alien language may lack words of some grammatical type: it may, for instance, lack nouns. Such a language may ‘nominalise' verbs, adjectives or other parts of speech in a way analogous to the gerunds of English. For example, the subject noun in Misgendering is a sensitive topic is a nominalisation of the verb ‘to misgender'.

Or it may have a single category corresponding to two or more grammatical types typically found in human languages. It has been claimed that even some human languages are ‘lumpers', meaning they lump grammatical categories together. For instance, Salishan languages of Northwestern North America are claimed to lack a noun/verb distinction, and Quechua, a language spoken in the Peruvian Andes, is claimed to lack a noun/adjective distinction. These claims are still controversial, but they give us all the more reason to drop the simplistic assumption that the words of an alien language should belong to the same grammatical types that words of human languages do.

We can also imagine languages all of whose words are of the same type, and thus cannot be categorised into distinct grammatical types. Philosophers have been toying with such languages for some time. In his Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus (1921), Ludwig Wittgenstein proposed a ‘logically perfect' language whose elementary sentences contain only simple signs, analogous to names like Xi Jinping, Colosseum or Bogota that refer to individuals, objects and places. Wittgenstein thought that the sentences of the language are true when the configuration of names that they contain correctly ‘picture' or represent the world.

An alien language may be less like English, Swahili or Cantonese, but more like maps

But the world is more than a mere collection of objects. The objects have properties, relate to each other in different ways, and are themselves arranged in complex patterns in space and time. For example, the Eiffel Tower is tall, Socrates was the teacher of Plato, and Trump was seen sitting between Zelenskyy and Vance. How can a mere configuration of names represent such facts, which include patterns, properties or relations? Wittgenstein himself thought that the world – including properties and relations – was itself an enormous collection of objects arranged in different configurations. But even if we reject Wittgenstein's quixotic view about what the world is like, we can imagine that the logical language can represent facts using, again, sequences of names. Alternatively, the logical language could represent them using different distances between names, or different spatial arrangements of names in a sentence. However one decides, such ‘Wittgenstein languages' are plausible candidate languages whose words belong to a single grammatical type: a noun. An alien language could behave similarly.

But for a language to exhibit true alienness at the structural level, it would need to have words belonging to entirely new grammatical types that no familiar language has. For instance, it may not have words and sentences, and, if it does, they may belong to grammatical types not found in any human language.

Non-linguistic systems of representation may hint at what these alien grammatical types could be like. For instance, an alien language may be less like English, Swahili or Cantonese, but more like maps. It is difficult to identify words or sentences on a map. One may think that the icon for a church is a sign that corresponds to a noun phrase, such as ‘the church'. However, there are so many differences between the properties of map elements and linguistic elements that they cannot be considered the same. For example, map elements ‘update automatically': changing the location of the church icon on a map automatically updates its distance from all other elements on the map. But there is no corresponding phenomenon in natural language. Why couldn't an alien civilisation have a ‘map-like' language whose words belong to grammatical types that no human language has?

Languages that differ at the level of sign or structure will appear quite alien. But they may still be translatable into a human language like English. Such alien languages may have elements that refer to the same objects, or convey the same meanings that some English words and sentences do. The sentence Aristotle Plato Socrates in a Wittgenstein language may have the same meaning as the English sentence ‘Plato is the teacher of Aristotle, and Socrates of Plato' (if, say, the space between names represents the relation ‘is the teacher of'). An icon of a church in the middle of a green patch on a map may translate into English as ‘The church is located in a park.' It may be possible to match elements of two languages that differ only at the first and second level as translations of one another.

But languages that are different from human languages at the third, semantic level will raise problems concerning translatability. One problem could be that an expression from one language has a meaning that no single expression in another language has. To some extent even different human languages exhibit untranslatability of this kind. A human language may have a noun or verb with a meaning that no noun or verb of another human language does. English speakers would struggle to find a direct translation for the German Fernweh – a melancholic ache to be in faraway places – just as I feel at a loss in my native language of Hindi when seeking a word for serendipity.

We can also imagine alien languages that raise this sort of problem. Some elements of an alien language may be untranslatable into human languages because they refer to an alien sentiment or some astronomical object that the aliens have discovered but we have not. However, this problem is, in principle, solvable. The object or phenomena described by a noun or verb from one language can be described using a collection of words (if not a single word) from another language. And if we have not yet discovered the object or phenomena described by some elements of an alien language, we may make further discoveries and expand our knowledge of the world, and coin new words or phrases that describe them. These new words in our language will then serve as translations of the alien elements.

But a second, radical problem of untranslatability would arise when one or more expressions of a language have a kind of meaning that no expression of another language does. As humans with a certain set of evolved cognitive abilities, we perceive the world as structured in a certain way. For instance, we perceive it as containing objects, actions, properties and processes. The kind of meanings that the elements of our languages have reflects our way of structuring the world. For instance, proper nouns have objects as their meaning, verbs refer to actions, and whole sentences represent facts.

Even if their language is very different from ours, the aliens may need concepts like ‘truth' and ‘falsity'

But what if an alien species, which has evolved differently, perceives the world totally differently? The language of this species would reflect its own way of classifying the world with categories that we do not have the cognitive capacities to grasp. Unless we know what element of the world a fragment of an alien language corresponds to, coining a new word in our language would not help. The elements of such an alien language are radically untranslatable, not because we cannot know what they mean, but because we would not even know what kind of meaning they have. In his book Alien Structure (2024), the philosopher Matti Eklund argues that it is indeed possible for such radically untranslatable languages to exist, and does so even without appealing to differences in cognitive apparatus.

But not all hope is lost. Some fragments of alien languages that differ from human languages at the third level of semantics may still be translatable. For example, describing the world, specifying when a description is true or false, or issuing commands, are all behaviours that any sophisticated society of intelligent creatures would plausibly need to engage in. Even if their language is very different from ours, the aliens may need concepts like ‘truth', ‘falsity', ‘description', ‘question', etc.

If so, these concepts can serve as points of contact between mutually untranslatable human and alien languages, and can be used to match up elements that serve the same purpose. If we identify a set of elements in an alien language that serve as descriptions or commands, we can match them up with our indicative or imperative sentences. And if we can figure out when the aliens take a description to be ‘true' or ‘false', we may even be able to narrow it down to a set of sentences that correspond to the alien description (even when we do not know the exact meaning of the words in the description).

We may also try to find cognate concepts in our language that most closely match up with alien concepts. An interesting analogy here is an analysis of the concept of ‘mass' proposed by the physicist and philosopher Thomas Kuhn. He argued that Albert Einstein changed the concept of ‘mass' so much from Newtonian mass that the two are incommensurable and untranslatable (the amount of Newtonian mass in the Universe is constant, but Einsteinian mass is convertible with energy). However, the fact that we can understand both Einsteinian and Newtonian physics should give us hope of being able to understand the concepts expressed by an alien language, especially if the differences are not too radical and too pervas ive.

In principle, differences at one level do not necessitate difference at another. Recall that Klingon employs different signs and a somewhat different structure, but mirrors human languages at the other levels. But, in practice, we should expect real alien language to differ at multiple levels. Aliens who perceive the world to be structured differently would also have a language with grammatical and syntactic elements different from familiar languages. So, it is quite unlikely that aliens have a language that is different only at the fourth, pragmatic level, while being just like English at the other levels.

But, for argument's sake, imagine creatures whose language is just like English at the first three levels, but who have settled on a different set of metaphors, metonyms, or have communicative norms that are different from ours. These creatures can ‘eat a horse' if they are happy, and one is ‘a chicken' if they are prone to run in a zigzag manner. Further, human languages have implicatures, which communicate things that go beyond what is literally expressed (like the sentence we saw earlier: I'm here with my partner, which serves as a polite refusal of a dance invitation). The norms governing alien communication may be different, resulting in implicatures of a different kind. Unless we know the relevant conventions, we will not understand fragments of this language.

But if pragmatic differences come on top of semantic differences, things can get a lot more interesting. An alien species may have alien semantic conceptions corresponding to concepts like ‘communication', ‘metaphors', ‘norms', which play a central role in our understanding of pragmatics. If so, alien pragmatics can be much different, and weirder.

A noteworthy example here is the language of the Tamarians, an alien species from Star Trek: The Next Generation. In the episode ‘Darmok' (1994), Captain Picard's Enterprise makes contact with a Tamarian spaceship, but the crew struggle to communicate. Starfleet's ‘universal translator' can provide only literal translations of Tamarian expressions. One of the aliens keeps repeating the sentence Darmok, on the ocean, but Picard cannot understand its meaning. It turns out the Tamarians do not consider the literal meanings of their words important – in fact they do not even attend to them. Instead, they attend to allegorical associations between expressions and concepts rooted in the myths and history of their culture. Thus, the expression Darmok, on the ocean communicates something in the vicinity of loneliness on a quest, by reminding them of a story with a certain Darmok and their ordeals at sea. Someone unfamiliar with the story, or the fact that the story has this meaning – instead of, say, drowning – would not be able to communicate with the Tamarians.

The language of an alien species who can communicate telepathically will not have the first level of signs

It seems highly unlikely to me, if not outright impossible, that an alien species can ignore the literal meanings of their expressions, and focus only on the allegorically conveyed concepts. The Tamarians do use the literal meanings of Darmok and ocean to figure out which story is referenced. So, it would seem terribly wasteful not to use the literal meanings to communicate.

But the example does suggest an interesting possibility: that an alien language may lack a level that human languages have. The language of an alien species who can communicate telepathically, for example, will not have the first level of signs. Aliens who have the cognitive capacity to remember an infinite number of signs (eg, a name) – each standing for a distinct meaning – would have no use for the second level of structure. Human languages, by contrast, have a structure because, despite our limited memory and cognitive abilities, it helps us create infinitely many sentences using finite elements.

An extraterrestrial language that lacks the third, semantic level would be particularly alien: one whose elements are not ‘about' anything. Its words do not refer to objects nor are its sentences true or false descriptions of the world. Creatures that use such a language would be causal mechanisms that hook up with the world by way of environmental inputs – eg, smell, temperature or radiation – to produce resultant outputs. ‘Communication' between such creatures may be a series of causal transactions: a stimulus from one causing a response in another, much like how hormones work in our bodies.

This should remind us of the interaction between machines, which is also causal in nature: the computer on which you are reading this article interacted causally with the Aeon server to bring this article to your screen. But does this interaction amount to linguistic communication? Is a language that lacks semantics even a language? It is difficult to give a simple answer to this. But these are the sort of questions that we should expect to encounter when meditating on alien modes of communication. We expect an encounter with aliens to challenge our conception of what it is to have a body, what it is to be conscious, what it is to be a living creature, and what it means to behave intelligently. So, in thinking about alien modes of communication, shouldn't we be exploring possible languages that are very different from our own – so much so that they challenge our very conception of what a language is?

Alien modes of communication may also have additional levels, ones that we cannot yet foresee. Perhaps there is an affective level that can encode how exactly one feels – say, the nature and intensity of one's pain. Or a phenomenal level that can encode qualitative experiences, such as an apple's redness. Growing out of our anthropocentric bubble to explore how aliens might communicate will equip us better for a potential first contact scenario. But it will also make us more reflective about, and potentially improve, one of the greatest assets that our species possesses: language.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=Supernatural","10 Best Batman Comics That Could Inspire James Gunn's Supernatural DCU","https://www.cbr.com/batman-best-supernatural-comics-inspire-dcu/","Fri, 09 May 2025 02:55:00 GMT","

Batman is widely praised and well-known in the modern age as one of DC Comics' more grounded heroes. Blending the inherent fantasy of superheroes with grittier crime-noir elements makes for a winning combination, but James Gunn's DC Universe paves the way for more. Alongside co-CEO Peter Safran, the DCU, kicking off theatrically with this summer's Superman, is already promising sci-fi and fantasy aspects.

What works for one character doesn't necessarily mean it will work for another, but there are plenty of ways the supernatural can be introduced in the DCU Batman's world. This is abundantly evident by looking at the Caped Crusader's extensive comic book history. With stories set in the hero's early days, like Batman and the Mad Monk, and mind-bending thrillers like R.I.P., there are plenty of Batman comics the DCU could borrow from.

While Dick Grayson's star continued to rise as Nightwing, hos start as the first Robin has been wonderfully explored in a few amazing Batman comics.

One of the '00s most interesting Batman comic miniseries was Matt Wagner's Dark Moon Rising. This was broken into two story arcs, each remaking Golden Age comics to fit within the then-new mainline canon. Batman and the Mad Monk is one such arc, fleshing out one of the Dark Detective's earliest supernatural encounters. The fresh-faced vigilante finds himself investigating a string of ruthless killings from a vampiric cult. Telling Batman stories focusing on his early years is likely something the DCU (at least in film) should avoid, given earlier theatrical adaptations.

However, seeing the hero to be introduced in Andy Muschietti's The Brave and the Bold go up against a similar supernatural threat creates an enticing premise. It wouldn't need to be in his DCU debut movie, but a shadowy group of villains like this organically weaves in the otherworldly of DC's world into Batman's sandbox. This eases audiences into the DCU's different tone compared to The Dark Knight Trilogy or The Batman while using the detective theme and darker atmosphere to feel familiar enough.

Considering that the upcoming The Brave and the Bold will focus on Bruce Wayne as Batman and his biological son, Damian, as Robin, Birth of the Demon could provide great inspiration. Iconic Batman writer Dennis O'Neil and artist Norm Breyfogle created this one-shot comic to expand on the origin story for Batman villain Ra's al Ghul—Damian Wayne's eventual grandfather. Readers are shown the beginnings of the Head of the Demon's story 600 years earlier, while the hero attempts to destroy the Lazarus Pits he uses to rejuvenate himself.

Whatever way The Brave and the Bold develops story-wise, it's hard to imagine the DCU's iteration of Batman won't have a narrative connection to his son's grandfather or mother, Talia al Ghul. Borrowing from O'Neil and Breyfogle's Birth of the Demon would be an elegant way to weave in Ra's' origins tastefully through flashbacks in a present-day story. As the DCU will inherently have fantastical elements, this could be a chance to introduce the supernatural elements of Ra's al Ghul's lore rather than the grounded interpretation from Batman Begins.

While something like Arkham Asylum: A Serious House on Serious Earth is more akin to a psychological horror movie, there are certainly elements capable of being adapted to the DCU. James Gunn has made a point to champion this DC cinematic universe for exploring different stories, tones, and corners of the world. With that stipulation, legendary Batman writer Grant Morrison and artist Dave McKean's surrealist Arkham Asylum comic presents a wealth of opportunities.

The Dark Knight is called in to end a violent riot at Arkham that devolves into a gruesome exploration of the hero's rogues, the bloody origins of the asylum, and introspection on Batman's part. The nature of the setting alone paves the way for introducing several larger-than-life villains, and even the plot could inspire a claustrophobic thriller. However, a DCU Batman film adopting the supernatural elements of Morrison's story in a similar way to Rocksteady's Arkham Asylum video game would be more tonally fitting for a PG-13 blockbuster movie.

For recent comics from the pages of DC's mainline Batman titles, Ram V's Gotham Nocturne is an engrossing odyssey. The storyline fits well within the mainline DC canon while telling a solid standalone story in its own right. This arc is sparked by an unmistakable and unshakable sense of dread that slowly creeps into Bruce Wayne's mind. It's soon revealed to have roots in a darker, supernatural conspiracy with ties to an ancient house.

Batman's origins are rooted in the Crime-Noir genre, and the iconic DC Comics character has starred in quite a few stories to appeal to the same fans.

Ram V tells a tantalizing and slow-burning saga in Gotham Nocturne ​​​​​​that effortlessly makes its fantasy feel at home in Batman's world. With at least one aspect of the Ra's al Ghul family confirmed to debut in Brave and the Bold—Damian Wayne—the DCU could flesh out this side of Batman's rogues gallery to include their ties to the mysterious Orgham family. Gotham Nocturne has a moody atmosphere that's fundamentally Batman enough to feel familiar to moviegoing audiences. At the same time, this Detective Comics arc uses its premise to give it a distinctly gothic, operatic, and dark fantasy flair.

Matt Wagner's The Mad Monk ​​​​​​remakes and chronicles the hero's first clash with magical, cultish foes. But in Batman and the Monster Men, the writer and artist reimagined his first encounter with Dr. Hugo Strange and the metahuman-level enemies he paves the way for. This early-years vigilante faces the combined threat of Gotham's seedy underworld and super-powered threats when mobster Sal Maroni funds Strange's cruel experiments on Arkham inmates.

Batman and the Monster Men is another tasteful modernization of a Golden Age comic. It perfectly captures the pulpy, crime-noir atmosphere of the plot and setting while making the fantasy fit seamlessly. This combination feels right for a DCU movie, as it contains the gloomy tone most fans appreciate from the Dark Knight's world while fashioning it with an almost Dr. Frankenstein-style whimsy. Strange is another rogue who would be a perfect fit for Matt Reeves' world, but the genetic experiment angle can justify its place in the DCU.

Many fans know the sinister Court of Owls villains from their debut in writer Scott Snyder and artist Greg Capullo's Batman ​​​​​​run. They added an exciting new dimension to Gotham City's history, but Christian Ward's City of Madness ​​​​​​gives them a new twist. The writer and artist's DC Black Label Batman series depicts the Court as the guardians of an ominous door beneath the city, and they turn to the Dark Knight when something creeps in.

City of Madness is a brilliant take on Batman's mythos and the Court of Owls' place in it from a cosmic horror perspective. It even combines a more vibrant art direction with the surrealism of McKean's Arkham Asylum ​​​​​​artwork. Ironically, the Court could fit well into director Matt Reeves' The Batman's ""Elseworld"" canon. However, the way City of Madness cleverly toys with more abstract supernatural ideas could fuel the premise of a DCU Batman movie. A similar concept could be a bold way to connect a live-action Court to the cosmic elements of the character's lore rather than a grounded crime syndicate.

Even concerning the World's Greatest Detective's street-level affairs, talented DC Comics writers find ways to let ominous, supernatural forces creep in. Peter Milligan and Kieron Dwyer's brief Dark Knight, Dark City arc does precisely that to shocking effects. This storyline sees Riddler sink to sinister new lows in an attempt to drive Batman to madness, using demonic forces as his weapon.

It would be somewhat poetic to take inspiration from Dark Knight, Dark City to introduce the supernatural to audiences unaccustomed to the supernatural in Batman's world. The Dark Detective isn't a stranger to sci-fi and fantasy elements, even before this. Even so, this arc is notable for directly incorporating occult, dark fantasy elements into Batman's mythos and backstory. The obvious caveat would be the repeated use of Riddler after Paul Dano's recent excellent take in The Batman, but the hero's deep bench of villains could find a suitable replacement in a movie following a vaguely similar plot.

DC Studios co-CEO James Gunn made it clear that Grant Morrison's influence is already baked into his DCU plans. Their work on All-Star Superman with artist Frank Quitely will be felt in Gunn's upcoming movie, and their epic Batman run will inspire Brave and the Bold. Beyond that, Morrison, DC Animated Universe writer Paul Dini, and more's Resurrection of Ra's al Ghul has the potential to be a DCU event and introduce the Dark Knight to the supernatural. The Demon's Head threatens the world again with his presence and ties into Damian's significant role in the Bat-Family.

Batman is often considered a loner, though he has gathered a close family of both biological and adopted children from across DC's entire multiverse.

The Resurrection of Ra's al Ghul has the narrative scope to justify a Batman crossover movie in the DCU, especially with Brave and the Bold ​​​​​​set to explore the supporting cast in his extended family, namely, Damian. Moreover, a loose movie adaptation could combine elements of Birth of the Demon and Resurrection. A climactic event film could dive into the villain's backstory, reveal how he's lived for centuries, and introduce the fantasy of the Lazarus Pit.

Alongside artist Tony Daniel, Grant Morrison's R.I.P. is the climax of act one of their Dark Knight odyssey, as the seedy Black Glove organization executes a meticulous scheme to tear the hero apart physically and psychologically. The syndicate attempts to strike at the core of what makes Bruce Wayne function as a man and Gotham's symbol. R.I.P. easily leaves a permanent mark on what makes the character so celebrated in the modern era of superheroes, championing the hero's indomitable spirit.

Brave and the Bold will pull from Morrison's Batman and Son and Batman and Robin, so the groundwork could be laid for a loose R.I.P. adaptation. It would make a rousing sequel and event film that combines Batman storytelling approaches from mystery to supernatural thrillers, thanks to the enigmatic Dr. Simon Hurt, who seemingly has occult roots in Gotham's history. The campy Bat-Mite and Bruce's Zur-En-Arrh personality are likely out of the question, but between R.I.P.'s Black Glove and Hurt's potential roots in demonology, there's room for a DCU movie to be dark and zany simultaneously.

There are certainly ways the pulpy, more realistic version of the first Clayface could cause problems for Robert Pattinson's Dark Detective. But to embrace the character's ""creature feature"" elements, One Bad Day: Clayface ​​​​​​is the perfect template for not only crossing paths against the DCU's Batman, but also his upcoming solo movie. This one-shot comic takes a Killing Joke-like approach to the villain, exploring how Basil Karlo attempts to forge a new identity for himself away from Gotham—and how he psychologically unravels at the seams.

One Bad Day: Clayface excels as a harrowing character profile of a tragic villain who's far more nuanced than his monstrous form would suggest. Director James Watkins is directing a Clayface movie written by Mike Flanagan for the DCU, and pulling from Collin Kelly, Jackson Lanzing, and Xermánico's short but impactful comic couldn't be more appropriate. Whether the filmmakers opt for an antihero or villainous approach, it lends itself beautifully to a body-horror-fueled movie delving into meta themes of self-obsession and Hollywood vanity.

Batman is one of the oldest comic superheroes, with nearly a century of comics, TV-shows, films, and video games. The mild-mannered Bruce Wayne becomes Gotham City's caped crusader, protecting it from villains like The Joker, Killer Croc, The Penguin, and more. Batman is also one of DC comics' ""Big Three"" alongside Superman and Wonder Woman, and together the three help keep the earth safe as founding members of the Justice League. 

Get ready for a brand new DC experience! The DC Universe (DCU) is coming soon, bringing together familiar comic book heroes in a connected storyline across movies, TV shows, animation, and even video games. It is an upcoming American media franchise and shared universe based on characters from DC Comics publications.

The Boys has been igniting rumors of a Supernatural reunion since Soldier Boy's inclusion in The Boys season 3, but now that they are confirmed, I'm amazed by how good it sounds. When I heard that Eric Kripke was behind Prime Video's seminal The Boys, I couldn't believe my luck. Kripke had secretly been one of TV's most hilarious writers and showrunners for decades, long before The Boys rose to prominence. In Supernatural, Kripke proved why he was perfect to tackle The Boys — and now he can bring both shows together.

Launching in 2005, Supernatural managed to run until 2020, presenting America's longest-running live-action fantasy TV show. The Boys appears to be adopting the opposite tactics, with Kripke putting a hard stop to it at the end of The Boys season 5. Knowing that The Boys was due to end in season 5, I was watching season 4 anxiously for a sign of the Supernatural reunion I've been longing for since Jensen Ackles joined the cast. Kripke finally confirmed that it will indeed be coming, and it's beyond my wildest dreams.

Kripke has confirmed to TV Insider that the Supernatural reunion of everyone's dreams will include not just Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki, but also Misha Collins. By the ending of The Boys season 4, it was starting to look like Ackles and Padalecki, who played Sam and Dean Winchester in Supernatural, might never reunite in The Boys. Some were even hoping for Collins to join the proceedings. Collins played Castiel, an angel who was the Winchesters' ally from Supernatural season 4 to its final, epic season, ending on November 19, 2020.

As if all the actors appearing in the same season of The Boys wasn't enough, having them share a story is bound to be epic.

Frenchie and Kimiko's hookup in The Boys was one of the highlights of the whole show, but I'm relieved to know that Kripke hasn't yet pulled all of his tricks out of his sleeve just yet. Kripke may have saved the coup de grâce to The Boys' competition for season 5, finally treating fans to a reunion between Ackles, Padalecki, and Collins in the same season — and in the ""same frame"" and ""same storyline"" as well. As if all the actors appearing in the same season of The Boys wasn't enough, having them share a story is bound to be epic.

In his interview with TV Insider, Kripke did not reveal the parts that Padalecki and Collins will play in The Boys season 4, but they will inevitably be wickedly appropriate. Ackles is incredible as Soldier Boy, and I can't wait to see his old chemistry with Padalecki and Collins fired back up. I'm even more intrigued to see which absurd subversion of American culture and superhero tropes Kripke will be pasting onto this trio. I hope the trio's roles in The Boys will somehow parallel their roles in Supernatural.

I can see Padalecki playing a supe opposite Ackles in The Boys.

If anyone is capable of performing such blatant fan service in a way that slots perfectly into the plot of season 5, it is Kripke. Soldier Boy's appearance in Gen V proved his ongoing importance to the overall The Boys franchise, so Kripke clearly has no intention of sidelining him in season 5. Ackles' role will get bigger, as it seems that Homelander may wake him up from his slumber. I can see Padalecki playing a supe opposite Ackles in The Boys, paralleling Ackles and Padalecki's partnership in Supernatural, before Padalecki is killed off in some hilarious way.

The Last of Us is back this week on HBO and Max with season 2, episode 5. Here's exactly when and how you can watch the show on TV or streaming.

Doctor Who's villain arcs are often clear and quick, but Russell T. Davies has really taken his time with this very minor character's development.

Jun-ho didn't have much to do after the beginning of Squid Game season 2, but he will now finally reach the island and confront his brother.

The Handmaid's Tale season 6, episode 7 has introduced an all-new character, and here's who she is and why she is so important to the show.

Piper ended up backing out of her original Thailand plans in The White Lotus season 3, which would have resembled a season 1 character's story.

A second season of Netflix's The Four Seasons could easily work thanks to the Tina Fey comedy show's big changes from the original movie.

As Doctor Who season 15 returned to Earth in episode 4, ""Lucky Day"", the series may have addressed why humans can never remember alien incursions.","{'href': 'https://screenrant.com', 'title': 'Screen Rant'}","other"

VESTAL, N.Y. (WBNG) -- On May 8, self-proclaimed psychic pled guilty to the violation of scheme to defraud in the first degree. 

According to Private Investigator Bob Nygaard, Patsy Brown operated a fortune-telling parlor, Binghamton Psychic, at 257 Vestal Pkwy. 

Nygaard said he gave evidence of this to the Vestal Police Department and continued working with them before Brown was arrested. 

Two victims were involved in this case.

Nygaard said Brown and another unnamed psychic conned one victim in 2022 by having him perform multiple egg rituals, a “reversing time” ritual using a watch and pay money to Brown under the guise it would go to the victim's ex-fiance for a medicinal procedure that Brown made up, among other things which made the victim “emotionally broken and financially devastated.”

According to court records, Brown was sentenced to five years of probation and ordered to pay back two victims a combined total of $20,000.

In this age of info war, it is becoming increasingly difficult to know what the reality is on the India-Pakistan front. In a sense, the disinformation war that was seen during the war in Ukraine is being replicated now in the ongoing drone/missile war between India and Pakistan over the last three days.

If you watch the Indian television news channels, India is winning the war overwhelmingly by attacking all parts of Pakistan. But if you read the social media of Pakistan (as one cannot see their news channels in India), then Pakistan has already attained a massive victory over India by not only foiling the Indian attacks but also destroying its military installations in Punjab and Jammu and Kashmir and shooting down highly expensive fighter planes like Rafale and Su-30.

According to a dispassionate and respected source, India is more systematic in the ongoing disinformation war than Pakistan.

While New Delhi has ensured that Pakistani channels are not easily accessible to Indians, it is deliberately feeding all misinformation to Indian news channels that are watched by millions of Pakistanis. The idea is to inject elements of fear among the Pakistanis.

Interestingly, while Pakistan has banned many things Indian, including films, it has not done so effectively as far as Indian news channels are concerned.

There is a theory that the Pakistani establishment needs Indian news channels the most when it launches a terrorist attack or wages limited wars against India.

When Pakistan Army Lost 129 Elite Soldiers In One Of The Deadliest Avalanches & Pointed Fingers At India



Both during the Kargil war and the attacks on Mumbai, the Pakistani handlers were getting all the information about what the Indian security forces were planning and how they were fighting the terrorists/aggressors on the ground, thanks to the hyperactive Indian news channels and journalists.

Of course, now the Indian authorities have curtailed the easy access that the Indian news channels had those days when operations were on. But Pakistanis still think that the Indian channels are sources of authentic information.

And this being the case, in the ongoing artillery exchanges between the two countries, the military leadership in India is deliberately feeding misinformation to the Pakistanis, the argument goes.

IAF Jets Can Hit Pakistan From Central Asia; A Little-Known Overseas Base Emerges As Islamabad's ‘Big Nightmare': OPED



Therefore, nobody can be sure what India is doing or will do.

For instance, Indian media has been flashing reports about JF-17 shootdown, capturing F-16 pilot, hunting Pakistan's AWACS, bombing Karachi port, etc. Some even claimed seizing Pakistan's capital, Islamabad, and some reported the arrest of General Asif Munir!

This could well be an Indian strategy to unnerve Pakistan and pressure its ‘rogue' military.

This big question still remains: “How should India deal with Pakistan?” So far, the standard Indian policy towards Islamabad is that “ a stable and secure Pakistan is in India's national interest.”

It is now time to revisit that policy.

Let us point out some hard facts about Pakistan. First, it is meaningless for India to talk to any civilian leader of Pakistan. The ultimate decision-maker in Pakistan, as far as India is concerned, happens to be the Army Chief.

Therefore, if there is to be any breakthrough in the India-Pakistan impasse, New Delhi should insist that the Pakistani Army Chief, Asim Munir, be directly involved in the talks.

Let us not forget that Pakistan is essentially an “Army with a country”.

Secondly, unlike China, which is and can be India's rival and partner simultaneously, Pakistan will always behave as India's enemy. Come what may, it will continue to promote jihad in Kashmir and other parts of India.

Exclusive! How India Used World's ‘Fastest' Fighter, MiG-25 Foxbat, To Outfox Pakistan During The Kargil War



Indeed, it is a huge myth that Pakistan will shed its hostility to India if the Kashmir issue is resolved on Islamabad's terms. Even if Kashmir joins Pakistan, Islamabad will find another issue to trouble India.

This is because Pakistan's antipathy towards India is deep-rooted. Pakistan's very existence as an entity depends on hostility towards India. Take India away, and Pakistan's justification as a separate country on the map of the world will hold no water.

And this explains why the Pakistan Army promotes fundamentalist mullahs in the country and uses them in tirades against India through terrorist organisations like the LeT. Their fundamentalist Wahhabi Islam negates the Sufi tradition that promoted Hindu-Muslim amity and coexistence in the subcontinent for centuries.

So much so that many Pakistanis now suffer from some identity crisis — they are not sure whether they should retain their age-old cultural roots (that are influenced by Hinduism) or develop totally new “Arab identities”.

It is increasingly becoming obvious that General Munir is the most communal Army Chief after Zia-ul Haq. It is he who orchestrated the latest terror attack on India at Pahalgam.

Just days before that dastardly attack, General Munir had boasted of how Pakistan has a “superior ideology and culture” than that of India and how “our forefathers thought that we are different from the Hindus in every aspect of life. Our religions, our customs, traditions, thoughts, and ambitions are different. That was the foundation of the two-nation theory that was laid.”

It is true that Pakistan was created as “a state for Muslims”. But for the likes of General Munir and hardliner Mullahs, Pakistan is an “Islamic state”. For them, India is an eternal enemy, and the very identity of Pakistan is based on hatred and animosity towards India. And they seem to be increasingly dominant in Pakistan's political and public discourse.

Diplomatic Fiasco For Pakistan: Why Suspension Of 1972 Simla Agreement Is An Open Invitation To India To Seize Pak-Occupied Kashmir: OPED



Not long ago, in one of his judgments, Pakistan's former Chief Justice Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry reportedly asked, “Should we accept if tomorrow Parliament declares secularism, and not Islam, as the state policy?” Another judge asked, “Will it be called a rightful exercise of authority if tomorrow parliament amends Article 2 of the constitution, which states that Islam will be the state religion?”

However, this most unfortunate trend is spreading among the Pakistani intelligentsia as well. For instance, Majid Nizami, editor-in-chief of The Nation, one of Pakistan's leading newspapers, had once written that “Pakistan is destined to defeat India because our horses in the form of atomic bombs and missiles are far better than Indian ‘donkeys.'

According to him, “if one wants to have an idea as to what would have been our condition, had Pakistan not come into existence, he should visit India to apprise himself about the untold pathetic living conditions of the Muslims there at this point of time.”

Nizami added, “We were grateful to the Almighty Allah that today we had been blessed with Independence. The day is not far off when we would once again conquer India.”

If one goes by the history books written for students in Pakistan, the intensity of the anti-India venom and the ferocity with which it is being injected into young minds are mind-blowing. They are taught that  “Previously, India was part of Pakistan.”

In these books, Muhammad bin Qasim, the first Muslim conqueror of the Hindu-dominated Sindh province in the 8th century, is declared the first Pakistani citizen. In Social Studies for Class VI (Sindh Textbook Board, 1997), the story of the Arabs' arrival in Sindh is counted as the first moment of Pakistan, with the glorious ascendancy of Islam.

This textbook teaches that “The Muslims knew that the people of South Asia were infidels and they kept thousands of idols in their temples.” The Sindhi king, Raja Dahir, is described as cruel and despotic. “The non-Brahmans who were tired of the cruelties of Raja Dahir joined hands with Muhammad bin Qasim because of his good treatment.”

According to this historical narration, “Pakistan came to be established for the first time when the Arabs led by Muhammad-bin-Qasim occupied Sindh and Multan in the early years of the eighth century, and established Muslim rule in this part of the South Asian subcontinent. Pakistan under the Arabs comprised the Lower Indus Valley.”

It is interesting to note the flight of imagination of this author: “During the 11th century, the Ghaznavid Empire comprised what is now Pakistan and Afghanistan. During the 12th century, the Ghaznavids lost Afghanistan, and their rule came to be confined to Pakistan…By the 13th century, Pakistan had spread to include the whole of Northern India and Bengal…Under the Khiljis, Pakistan moved further southward to include a greater part of Central India and the Deccan… Many Mongols accepted Islam. As such, Pakistan remained safe for Islam… During the 16th century, ‘Hindustan' disappeared and was completely absorbed in ‘Pakistan'…Although Pakistan was created in August 1947, yet except for its name, the present-day Pakistan has existed, as a more or less single entity, for centuries.”

Interestingly, Pakistani students are being taught that though Akbar was a great Mughal ruler, Islam declined during his rule as he was influenced by the Bhakti movement that began during the Sultanate period and propounded Hindu-Muslim unity. They are also taught that the glory of Islam was at its best during the reign of Aurangzeb, displaying “the Pakistan spirit.”

Thus, systematic attempts are being made by the Pakistani government to brainwash the students in schools and universities that there are irreconcilable differences between the Hindus and Muslims and that they, with their diametrically opposed world views and interests, could not have stayed together in an undivided country that India was until 1947.

In fact, Pakistan's National Education Policy of Pakistan clearly says that the curricula should be specifically designed to “inculcate among the students the sense of gratitude to Almighty Allah”, to “promote the unity of Muslim Ummah in the world”, to “develop and practice the spirit of the ideology of Pakistan and Islam”, and to “inculcate a strong sense of gratitude to Almighty Allah for his blessings providing us an independent state”.

With such tendentious imaginings against India being legitimised by the successive governments in Pakistan, the Muslims there are forgetting the centuries-old tradition of pluralism that enriched the subcontinent, giving rise to many faiths and religions, including Sufism that guided them. Unless this entrenched anti-India mindset of the Pakistanis is changed, India will remain their eternal enemy.

Erosion of Indian power, dismemberment of its territories, and consolidation of an anti-India geostrategic nexus are Pakistan's predominant strategic goals.

Pakistan's war against India is no longer confined to Kashmir. Pakistan wants to Balkanise India by cutting off the country's northern, eastern (North-East), and southern (Kerala) wings.

In fact, Mushahid Hussain, once a former information minister under Nawaz Sharif, has argued that Pakistan should work towards dividing India into three or four independent countries. Simultaneously, Pakistan's ISI machinery will concentrate on widening the Hindu-Muslim divide, spreading hatred, and destroying India's inherent ethos of communal harmony.

This being the case, India needs to reappraise its fundamental policy towards Pakistan. Fortunately, India has a Prime Minister in Narendra Modi, who hails from the south of Vindya and can think rationally about Pakistan.

It may be recalled that WikiLeaks documents revealed how the then Indian national security advisor M K Narayanan had once indicated to his American interlocutors, and that too, in the presence of the then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, that persons living in the south of Vindhyas were better placed to frame India's policy towards Pakistan. One sees some merits in that argument.

Invariably, we have seen that leaders hailing from North India, including those who were born in what is today Pakistan, are often more emotional rather than rational when dealing with Pakistan.

No wonder Prime Ministers like Manmohan Singh, I K Gujral, or, for that matter, even Atal Behari Vajpayee always found virtues in Pakistani leaders' India-related “statements” by overlooking their India-related “activities.”

Pakistan needs to be handled realistically, not emotionally, by India. Modi seems to have initiated this process by suspending the Indus-Water treaty, arguably one of the most unequal treaties in the world. Bringing back the Pakistan-occupied Kashmir to the Indian national mainstream should at least be the logical corollary.","{'href': 'https://www.eurasiantimes.com', 'title': 'EurAsian Times'}","other"

            In 2020, Miles founded Nature Is a Human Right, a campaign advocating for daily access to green spaces to be recognized in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Frustrated by the slow pace of institutional change, Miles says she “lost faith in the top-down process.” So she took matters into her own hands. Her weapon? Not protest banners or petitions, but seeds and shovels.
    


            She became a so-called guerrilla gardener — “Grassroots planting in a public place, with a purpose,” Miles explains. “Think of it like graffiti, but with wildflowers instead of spray paint.” This form of urban activism involves transforming neglected or overlooked spaces — cracks in pavements, roadside verges, abandoned lots — into mini-oases for people, pollinators and biodiversity.
    


            What began during the Covid pandemic — when parks were shut and access to green space became scarce — grew into a weekly ritual. Miles and her neighbors would meet on Sunday mornings, armed with bulbs and trowels, planting in overlooked corners of the London Borough of Hackney.
    


            In the UK, guerrilla gardening occupies a legal gray area: while planting on public land without permission is not technically lawful, authorities often turn a blind eye — so long as it doesn't cause damage, obstruction or a public nuisance.
    


            According to the Royal Horticultural Society, guerrilla gardeners should ensure their planting doesn't inconvenience others and be careful to not restrict public access or create trip hazards. It's also important that anything planted is removable, and that the roots won't cause structural damage to sidewalks and buildings.
    


            Guerrilla gardening dates back to the 1970s, when the Green Guerrillas, founded by Liz Christy in the US, transformed vacant lots into community gardens. The movement has since spread worldwide, from Ron Finley, the “Gangsta Gardener” in Los Angeles, to Ta Mère Nature in France, and the Ujamaa Guerrilla Gardening Collective in South Africa.
    


            Miles has brought the underground movement into the spotlight on TikTok and other social media. Her upbeat videos demystify the process, showing everything from creating seed bombs to planting moss graffiti — a form of street art where living moss is used to create patterns or words on walls. “I wasn't a gardener. I was learning as I went along,” she admits. “But I just wanted the streets to be greener.”
    


            As Miles' seeds grew, so did her online following. “Young people today are very awake to issues like climate change, inequality, and mental health,” Miles says. “Guerrilla gardening intersects with all of that. It's something you can do with your own two hands and see the impact immediately.”
    


            “A lot of activism can feel intangible,” she adds. “With guerrilla gardening, you see the results. It's empowering.”
    


            And it's more than just symbolic: “It's been shown that having access to green spaces is as vital to your mental and physical health as regular exercise and a healthy diet,” says Miles. “We need it around us. We need the phytoncides (compounds plants release into the air) that plants produce. The experience of having plants around us calms us.”
    


            A study of 20,000 participants by the UK's University of Exeter found that people who spent at least 120 minutes a week in green spaces reported significantly better physical health and psychological well-being than those who didn't. For young children, access to green spaces has been linked to reduced hyperactivity and improved attention spans. Communities can benefit too: a US study showed that greening vacant lots can lead to lower crime rates.
    


            Miles' message is simple: anyone can get involved. “It's spring now,” she continues. “Find native wildflowers, scatter them when it's raining then you won't even have to water them.” For those who want to go further, Miles has written a book on the subject and teaches a free four-week online course through the nonprofit Earthed, which has attracted over 300 participants. She advises gardening as a group — community is key.
    


            Her vision is bold but refreshingly practical: “Why aren't all our sidewalks lined with hedges?” says Miles. “Our buildings could be covered in plants. Our rooftops and bus stops could be buzzing with flowers. It's a no-brainer.”

German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has met top EU officials, promising that Europe's biggest economy was back to help steer the bloc at a tough time. Follow DW for our latest updates on news from and about Germany.

German Chancellor Friedrich Merz traveled to Brussels for talks with top EU and NATO leaders on his second foreign trip since taking office.

The conservative leader met NATO head Mark Rutte as well as EU chiefs Ursula von der Leyen, Antonio Costa, and Roberta Metsola after stops in Paris and Warsaw on Wednesday.

Merz, who had slammed his predecessor Olaf Scholz for ""silence in European policy,"" renewed his promise that Germany's ""voice in Europe"" will be heard again.

Here's a roundup of developments from and about Germany on Friday, May 9:

As Germany's Left Party begins a party conference, co-leader Ines Schwerdtner told DW she expects the new government under Chancellor Friedrich Merz to take her party seriously in addressing the problems Germany faces.

""We're really strong in parliament as an opposition party, and we want the government not to be afraid of us, but to take us seriously when it comes to all social interests,"" she told DW. ""In the coming political decisions, when you need a two-thirds majority again, [the government coalition] will need to talk to us and need to take us seriously because we're stronger than ever.""

Watch the entire interview where Schwerdtner addresses migration policy, Germany's relationship with Israel and the Left Party's goals.

Prosecutors in the eastern German city of Dresden announced Friday that they have begun an investigation into whether far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) politician Maximilian Krah accepted bribes from China as well whether he is guilty of money laundering.

The charges stem from Krah's time as a European parliamentarian. After numerous scandals in Brussels — investigations into charges of accepting Russian bribes during that time, for instance, are still underway — he was voted out of parliament and is now an AfD parliamentarian in Berlin.

Prosecutors have requested that his immunity against prosecution be lifted. They are currently seeking to determine ""if there is sufficient cause to bring charges or whether the proceedings should be discontinued.""

Krah has claimed that these latest accusations, like others prior, are ""politically motivated.""

Despite Polish complaints over Germany's current migration and border policies, new Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul said Friday, ""In my talks in Warsaw, I did not detect any major irritation but rather a great deal of agreement.""

Wadephul, speaking on the sidelines of Friday's EU foreign ministers' summit in Lviv, Ukraine, said: ""We all have a migration problem in Europe. We must solve it together.""

The new German foreign minister voiced support for Polish President Donald Tusk's calls for strengthened external borders for the bloc, especially in light of continued provocations from  Belarus. Wadephul said that he and his Polish counterpart, Radoslaw Sikorski, would travel to the Polish-Belarus border to assess the situation.

Speaking of Belarus intentionally bringing migrants to the border to be released into the EU, Wadephul said: ""We must find joint answers to this. That is the focus of our policy.""   

German Chancellor Friedrich Merz says he is more optimistic about the future of the NATO alliance than he was three months ago when he questioned its continued existence in light of the attitude of the US administration under President Donald Trump.

""What has changed is the acceptance of what we, as European NATO partners, are doing,"" Merz told a joint Brussels news conference with NATO chief Mark Rutte.

""And that is why I associate the NATO summit in June with more hope today than I did back in February — that we will succeed in developing a joint strategy with the Americans,"" he added, referring to a NATO meeting planned for next month in the Netherlands.

Merz also said he had no hopes of Ukraine joining NATO in the near future, as he visited Brussels for the first time since taking office.

After Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Kyiv applied for membership to the European Union and urged allies in the NATO military alliance to issue an invitation for it to join.

While NATO agreed last year to admit Ukraine in the future without setting a date, the US administration under Donald Trump has since ruled out such a move. NATO allies must unanimously agree on admitting new members.

Merz said Ukraine would not join NATO until it had also joined the EU, something that most experts say won't happen until 2030 at the earliest.

German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has spoken by phone to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu three days after taking office, to discuss developments in the Gaza Strip. 

""The chancellor condemned in the strongest terms the brutal terrorist attack by [Palestinian Islamist organization] Hamas on October 7. He expressed his concern about the fate of the hostages and the humanitarian crisis in Gaza,"" said government spokesman Stefan Kornelius.

Merz expressed hope that negotiations for a ceasefire would soon begin, the spokesman added.

The chancellor, who heads Germany's new coalition government of conservatives and Social Democrats, also referred to upcoming visits to mark the 60th anniversary of diplomatic relations being established between Germany and Israel.

Israeli President Isaac Herzog will arrive in Berlin on Sunday with German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier set to join him on his return to Israel on Tuesday.

The countries only established diplomatic relations on May 12, 1965, two decades after the end of the Second World War.

Germany's new economy minister, Katherina Reiche, has stressed the need for rapid construction of additional gas-fired power plants to bolster the country's energy supply when renewable energy sources are unavailable.

""We need flexible gas-fired power plants that can supply electricity when the wind isn't blowing and the sun isn't shining. And we need them quickly,"" Reiche told the Ludwig Erhard Summit in Tegernsee, a Bavarian lake resort.

She emphasized the necessity to ""quickly move to tender at least 20 gigawatts of gas-fired power plants to maintain energy security.""

Reiche, a member of Chancellor Friedrich Merz's conservative Christian Democratic Union, highlighted a recent power outage on the Iberian Peninsula, noting that it had underscored the critical role gas-fired power plants play in ensuring energy security.

Reiche argued that ""long-term gas supply contracts"" and a ""reality check of the energy transition"" are essential to make the plan work.

New German Chancellor Friedrich Merz made clear that Berlin is back at the European top table, seeking to steer the bloc at a time of daunting challenges, as the new chancellor made his maiden visit to Brussels.

After back-to-back trips to neighbors in Paris and Warsaw, Merz's visit sought to turn the page on months of political turmoil in Germany that left Berlin struggling to act decisively on the EU stage.

""Germany needs to play a strong role, an active role, in the European Union, and the German government is going to do so,"" he told a news conference alongside EU chief Ursula von der Leyen.

""In a way, I'm coming home to Brussels, coming home to Europe,"" said the 69-year-old German conservative leader who cut his teeth as an EU lawmaker three decades ago.

Merz, who has long been critical of his predecessor Olaf Scholz, has said he aims to end Germany's ""speechlessness"" on European policy, particularly since the collapse of his so-called traffic light coalition last November.

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen called for member states to jointly tackle migration as she hosted new German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, whose government is moving to turn back asylum-seekers at its borders.

""Migration is a common European challenge and it needs a common European solution,"" the EU Commissionpresident told a news conference alongside Merz.

Having been elected on a pledge to clamp down on migration, conservative Merz made one of his first official steps a unilateral move to reject undocumented migrants, including asylum-seekers at Germany's borders. That step prompted notable displeasure from some member states, foremost Poland.

Von der Leyen stressed that actions ""have to be time-limited"" and ""closely coordinated"" with the Commission and neighboring countries.

The German initiative was a central part of Merz's strategy to reclaim momentum from the anti-immigration, far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD), which placed second in February's general election.

Merz said he had notified French President Emmanuel Macron and Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk in advance about the ""temporary"" measures.

Addressing reporters in Brussels alongside von der Leyen, Merz sought to reassure his partners that ""there is no German solo attempt here,"" and he promised to keep acting ""in accordance with European law.""

Police in Germany have shut down a major online cryptocurrency exchange platform, seizing some €34 million ($38 million) in assets. 

The Frankfurt Prosecutor's Office and the Federal Criminal Police Office (BKA) on Friday said it had seized and closed down the German server infrastructure of the crypto swapping service ""eXch.""

Police said the operators of the platform are suspected of commercial money laundering and of running a criminal online trading platform.

The assets seized were in cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ether, Litecoin and Dash, and the seizure is the third-largest haul of crypto assets in the BKA's history. 

The platform had been operational since 2014, allowing users to exchange cryptocurrencies without any measures being implemented against money laundering. Police pulled the plug on the servers in April.

Europe is backing President Donald Trump's proposal for a 30-day ceasefire in the war between Russia and Ukraine, the EU is ready to ramp up sanctions if Moscow refuses to engage in serious peace talks, Germany's new chancellor said Friday.

After a conversation with Trump on Thursday, Merz said he was ""somewhat"" confident that the US would now also increase pressure on Russia so that serious negotiations can begin after this weekend.

On his first trip to Brussels since taking office, Chancellor Friedrich Merz emphasized continued Western support for Ukraine — and readiness to boost that support if needed.

""We call on Russia at last to set out on the path for real peace negotiations,"" Merz said. ""If that doesn't happen, we won't hesitate, together with our European partners and the US, to increase the sanctions pressure.""

Meanwhile, Merz reaffirmed Germany's opposition to issuing joint EU debt to fund defense efforts.

For the latest developments from Russia's war in Ukraine, follow DW's Friday blog.

The German bank Commerzbank has posted its best quarterly profit since 2011, just ahead of a key shareholder meeting as it tries to block a potential takeover by Italy's UniCredit.

Net profit for Q1 jumped 12% to €834 million ($936 million), defying analyst expectations of a slight dip. 

Chief Executive Bettina Orlopp called it proof the bank can grow even in tough conditions.

Revenue rose nearly 12% to €3.1 billion, driven by stronger-than-expected interest and commission income. UniCredit, which has steadily built a stake in Commerzbank, is widely seen as eyeing a full takeover — an idea firmly resisted in Berlin.

German Chancellor Friedrich Merz is on the second stage of his introductory tour abroad, this time with a trip to Brussels for meetings with European Union and NATO chiefs.

Merz, who has long been critical of his predecessor Olaf Scholz, has said he aims to end Germany's ""speechlessness"" on European policy.

The new chancellor plans to meet NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte and the three top EU representatives: Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, Council President Antonio Costa, and Parliament President Roberta Metsola.

Merz completed his first inaugural visits to Paris and Warsaw on Wednesday.

At the signing of the coalition agreement between the conservative CDU-CSU and the SPD, the CDU leader announced that he and his government would ensure that Germany's ""voice is heard again in Europe and in the world.""

""Large parts of Europe, and the European Union in particular, are waiting for us to once again make a powerful contribution to the success of the European project,"" Merz said.

As opposition leader, conservative Merz accused his center-left predecessor of passivity in European policy.

In close cooperation with neighboring France and Poland, he wants to strengthen European sovereignty and thus respond to the US' foreign policy shift under President Donald Trump.

Scholz's ""traffic light"" coalition came under repeated criticism for the time it took to position itself on important projects such as the reform of the European asylum system.

This came to a peak when the members of the coalition themselves — SPD, Greens and FDP — failed to take a unified position on the EU Supply Chain Act, eventually abstaining on the EU-level vote.

Newly elected German Chancellor Friedrich Merz is completing the second part of his inaugural visit on Friday — after Paris and Warsaw on Wednesday, this time he will travel to Brussels.

There he is meeting EU Council President Antonio Costa, then EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, and finally NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte.

Key topics are expected to include the pursuit of greater competitiveness for German and European industry, as well as strengthened defense policy and aid to Ukraine.

As legislative attacks on unhoused people ramp up, disabled people are on the front lines.

As legislative attacks on unhoused people ramp up, disabled people are on the front lines.

The U.S. approach to addressing homelessness in the wake of a recent Supreme Court ruling will maim and kill people, housing rights advocates and experts tell Truthout. It will disproportionately harm disabled Americans, who comprise more than a quarter of the nation's population and about half of its unhoused population.

The court's decision in Grants Pass v. Johnson, issued in June 2024, allows local governments to cite or jail unhoused people for camping on public lands even if there is no shelter available to them. The ruling de facto criminalized homelessness nationwide.

Meanwhile, since it came down, state governments have also given the green light to ramped-up policing as a response to homelessness. The Trump administration has also expressed support for carceral approaches, including banning urban camping and forcibly relocating homeless people into psychiatric institutions or detention camps.

“I'm terrified of being [detained] in an encampment when that starts happening, and I think that it will if things continue the way they are going,” Finn, an unhoused and disabled resident of Portland, Oregon, who is using only their first name due to safety concerns, told Truthout.

Homelessness in the U.S. reached a record high in 2024, with the Department of Housing and Urban Development recording more than 771,000 unhoused Americans during its annual point-in-time count. That marked a staggering 18 percent increase from the number of unhoused people recorded at the previous annual count.

At the same time, policy makers have begun to turn away from the evidence-based Housing First model for addressing homelessness and embrace punitive approaches. Right-wingers have long advocated for the carceral approach, and Democratic lawmakers have begun to echo them in recent years, with cities, including San Francisco and Portland, Oregon, corralling unhoused residents in encampments and enforcing camping bans.

Disabled Americans are at particular risk from the nationwide trend to criminalize homelessness. They are overrepresented among the nation's unhoused population due to several factors. Policies that allow employers to pay subminimum wages to disabled workers and place caps on the savings or income of recipients of Supplemental Security Income (SSI) and some Medicaid benefits contribute to increased poverty among disabled people and render them less able to prepare financially for a crisis.

People with disabilities also experience discrimination in housing, health care, employment and wages, making it difficult for some to secure stable housing and earn the income needed to meet their basic needs. These forms of discrimination are compounded for women, people of color and trans people. The U.S. also has a significant shortage of affordable and accessible housing.

Experts warn that even more disabled people are likely to slip into poverty and homelessness as the Trump administration eyes cuts to Medicaid, slashes funding for protection and advocacy agencies, undermines public health programs and pursues pharmaceutical tariffs that are likely to make medications more expensive. These are concerns that keep David Zoltan, a Chicago-based human rights activist, awake at night. “I am measuring my life right now in months,” they told Truthout.

“Nobody goes through homelessness unscathed.”

Zoltan, an amputee who lives with chronic illnesses, including complex post-traumatic stress disorder, experienced homelessness for several months almost a decade ago. While they have been off the streets for years, the roof over their head has never stopped feeling tenuous, and conditions have worsened since Donald Trump began rolling back federal support programs. “I survive because I have SSDI, Medicare, Medicaid, a housing voucher and SNAP benefits,” Zoltan told Truthout. “And still, I've literally had to stop paying my electric bill just to be able to make the rest of my bills work.”

Supplemental Security Disability Income (SSDI) provides monthly payments to individuals with health conditions that limit or prevent them from working. SSI provides payments to disabled and older adults with low incomes. These benefits have lost 20 percent of their buying power since 2010 as rising consumer prices outstrip annual cost-of-living adjustments to the payments, according to an analysis by The Senior Citizens League.

Like Zoltan, several disabled people who spoke to Truthout for this article expressed concern about rising living costs outstripping support programs. Janine Harris, an unhoused resident of Grants Pass, Oregon, the town that brought the now infamous Supreme Court case, also noted the disproportionate share of medical debt shouldered by disabled Americans. “There are disabled people out here and elderly people out here who cannot afford to live in a house because the rents have gotten so high, and some of them are using credit cards to pay off medical debt,” Harris told Truthout. “They don't have the money or the medical or housing benefits to deal with that, and so they end up losing their homes, and they're on the street.”

Once a disabled individual loses their housing, they face having to navigate homelessness services that are often inaccessible. Barriers to accessing homeless shelters are ubiquitous, according to experts and advocates who spoke to Truthout. “They may not be physically accessible. They may not allow people to bring service animals. They may not allow people to store medications or get other kinds of really elementary accommodations,” Tom Stenson, deputy legal director at Disability Rights Oregon (DRO), told Truthout.

Miranda DeNovo, a New Yorker who has spent the last year advocating for a friend with myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) and long COVID who was made homeless by caregiver abuse, told Truthout that the pair have been in contact with over a dozen housing and case management organizations, none of which has been able to provide the support needed to help DeNovo's friend transition into housing. DeNovo's friend was not able to access domestic violence shelters because they require regular visits from a caregiver, which the shelters could not accommodate due to privacy concerns.

“When we asked them to recommend alternatives, every single service provider just said my friend would need to go into a nursing home,” DeNovo told Truthout. “I'm just so frustrated at the lack of awareness of this issue, that sick people are still being pushed into institutions even though we fought for programs to prevent that.”

For many long COVID patients and others who are immunocompromised or concerned about the dangers of COVID-19 and other infectious diseases, the crowded indoor environment and lack of infection control measures at most communal shelters make those spaces inaccessible.

Meanwhile, Finn — the Portland, Oregon, resident — told Truthout that they once left a shelter even though they had nowhere else to go because they witnessed shelter staff physically abuse other disabled residents and feared for their own safety.

When shelters are inaccessible or hostile to disabled people, individuals are often forced to stay outdoors in conditions that can exacerbate health issues. Harris struggled to live in a local communal shelter due to her claustrophobia, which manifests in panic attacks. Other shelters would not accept her service animal. Since she began living outdoors, her arthritis and chronic migraines have worsened. “My health is deteriorating every single day; I can feel it,” she told Truthout.

Jeffrey Dickerson, another unhoused resident of Grants Pass, has had a similar experience. Dickerson has been intermittently unhoused since experiencing an aneurysm that left him unable to work in 2006. He is unable to save enough from his SSDI payments to cover the first and last month's rent and security deposit needed to move into most apartments.

“These proposals are not just criminalizing being poor, but they're criminalizing having a disability.”

But sleeping outside on a gravel lot, where Grants Pass lawmakers have sequestered the town's unhoused population after banning urban camping, has worsened Dickerson's chronic nerve pain. That pain is a symptom of neuropathy, which also causes weakness in his feet, making it difficult for him to walk on the uneven gravel. “It's not just physical either,” Dickerson told Truthout. “It's emotional, it's stressful.”

Zoltan told Truthout that for nondisabled and disabled people alike, the experience of homelessness can lead to new health problems. “Nobody goes through homelessness unscathed,” they said. “To what extent it is disabling, that's going to differ from person to person, but I would argue that it has an effect on everybody.”

For disabled people living on the street, the recent proliferation of policies criminalizing homelessness has compounded dangers. At least 150 cities in 32 states have passed or strengthened ordinances banning outdoor camping since the Grants Pass v. Johnson decision last summer.

“Cities out there are creating restrictions on camping, and sitting, and lying down in public that carry with them some implicit understanding that you have to be able to move around, you have to be able to carry your tent around, or you have to be able to move across a particular area that's not paved or doesn't have a safe way for people who use wheelchairs to get around,” DRO's Stenson told Truthout. “These proposals are not just criminalizing being poor, but they're criminalizing having a disability.”

Those who cannot meet the new demands are more likely to be swept up in crackdowns, raising the prospect of citations, arrests, police violence and confiscation of belongings. Unhoused individuals interviewed by Truthout reported having necessities — including mobility aids, medications and identity documents — taken in police sweeps. Recent reporting in San Francisco showed that the city confiscated dozens of wheelchairs and walkers in sweeps of homeless encampments in 2024.

The disability community is not only on the front lines of increasing violence against unhoused people nationwide, but it is also front and center in fighting anti-homeless policies in the courts. A lawsuit filed in February 2025 by DRO and the Oregon Law Center against the City of Grants Pass is one example. Harris and Dickerson are both plaintiffs in the suit, which asserts that the town's new policies on homelessness violate Oregon laws, including laws prohibiting discrimination against disabled people. A judge halted enforcement of the city's rules on March 28, 2025, while the lawsuit moves forward.

While Grants Pass Police continue to cite unhoused people for non-enjoined sections of the law, such as for leaving out trash or having a too-large tent footprint, there is no indication that they have violated the court's order, according to DRO.

Legal battles like this one have been made more complex by last year's Supreme Court decision, which advocates said has empowered anti-homeless contingents within government and the public. Still, Stenson told Truthout that the lawsuits send a message that “the rights of people with disabilities have to be respected.” If recent anti-homeless legislation goes unchallenged, Stenson fears that under the policies, “it would just be illegal for hundreds of people to exist.”

At this moment, we are witnessing a terrifying array of anti-democratic tactics to silence political opposition, increase surveillance and expand authoritarian reach.

Truthout is appealing for your support as Trump and his sycophants crack down on political speech. Nonprofits like Truthout could be caught in Trump's crosshairs as he attacks dissenting groups with bad faith lawsuits and targeted harassment of journalists.

As well, these attacks come at a time when independent journalism is most needed. The right-wing corporate takeover of media has left reliable outlets few and far between, with even fewer providing their work at no cost to the reader. Who will be there to hold the fascists to account, if not media like Truthout?

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:rt.com","Putin hails wartime ties and record trade with Egypt","https://www.rt.com/africa/617220-putin-egypt-meeting-moscow/","Fri, 09 May 2025 18:14:00 GMT","

Russian President Vladimir Putin emphasized wartime ties and soaring trade figures during a meeting with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi at the Kremlin on Friday. He described the country as one of Moscow's “key partners in Africa.” 

The Egyptian delegation arrived in Moscow to participate in the Victory Day parade on Red Square and other festivities marking the 80th anniversary of the Soviet Union's victory over Nazi Germany in World War II. Following the parade, the Russian and Egyptian leaders held a bilateral meeting.

“We are sincerely pleased to welcome all of you to Moscow,” Putin said. He recalled Egypt's role as a strategic base for the USSR's allies in North Africa during the war and noted that Cairo officially joined the anti-Axis coalition.

“It is symbolic that our diplomatic ties were established during the war,” Putin added.

He described current Russian-Egyptian relations as developing successfully and “supported by regular and substantive political dialogue.” Putin remarked that Egypt joined BRICS in 2024 and that, by the end of last year, bilateral trade had grown by more than 30%, reaching a record $9 billion. He added that trade had increased by another 80% in the first two months of this year. President el-Sisi responded it was a great honor to take part in the commemorative events and congratulated Russia on the anniversary of its victory over Nazi Germany. El-Sisi is one of seven African heads of state who were scheduled to attend Moscow's Victory Day parade on May 9. According to Kremlin officials, President Putin is expected to hold bilateral meetings with the leaders of five African nations: Congo, Egypt, Zimbabwe, Burkina Faso, and Guinea-Bissau.

Officials float idea of compact of free association (Cofa), used by US to keep close ties with Pacific Island nations

US officials are discussing a plan to pull Greenland into America's sphere of influence using a type of agreement that the United States has used to keep close ties with several Pacific Island nations, according to two US officials and another person familiar with the discussions.

Under the plan being considered, the Trump administration would propose to Greenland's leaders that the island enter into a so-called compact of free association, or Cofa, with the United States.

While the precise details of Cofa agreements – which have only ever been extended to the small island nations of Micronesia, the Marshall Islands and Palau – vary depending on the signatory, the US government typically provides many essential services, from mail delivery to emergency management to military protection. In exchange, the US military operates freely in Cofa countries and trade with the US is largely duty-free.

Donald Trump, who during his first administration floated the idea of acquiring Greenland, has pressed even harder since taking office in January, refusing to rule out taking the island by force. Denmark, which governs the island, has sharply rebuffed the idea.

A Cofa agreement would stop short of Trump's ambition to make the island of 57,000 people a part of the US. It is not the only Greenland plan on the table, the sources said, and it would face many practical hurdles.

Some officials at the national security council and the national energy dominance council, which Trump established, are involved in the talks, two of the sources said. The national economic council is also involved, one of those sources added.

Cofa agreements have previously been inked with independent countries, and Greenland would probably need to separate from Denmark for such a plan to proceed. While polls show Greenlanders are interested in independence, surveys also show most do not want to be part of the US. A Cofa – which cedes significant autonomy to Washington – could be viewed with similar skepticism.

One of those involved in the discussions is Markus Thomi, the acting senior director for the national security council's western hemisphere section, according to two of the sources. David Copley, the key mining official on the NEDC, is also involved in the talks, one of those sources said.

The White House did not respond to a request for comment, nor did the Danish embassy or Greenland's representative office in Washington.

The interior department, which plays a key role in administering Cofa agreements through its office of insular affairs, also did not respond.
 Washington's existing Cofa agreements with Palau, the Marshall Islands and Micronesia are seen across the US political spectrum as important for countering China's growing influence in the Asia Pacific region.

Still, such accords have hit snags in the past.

Republican lawmakers have at times opposed elements of the budget allotted to fund Cofa agreements, creating deep frustrations in the countries that rely on the funds.
  Signing a Cofa also offers no guarantee that a nation will be immune from influence operations by US rivals.

Danish leaders have not been approached about the idea and have not had any substantive discussions with the White House about Greenland's future status, one senior European official said. Danish officials have publicly rejected the idea of the US acquiring Greenland, and insist Greenlanders must determine their future.

Administration officials argue the island is crucial to the US due to its deposits of minerals that have important hi-tech and military applications, but which remain untapped due to labor shortages, scarce infrastructure and various other challenges.

An administration official told Reuters the US was helping Greenland diversify its economy and gain greater economic independence from Denmark. The Development Finance Corporation and Export-Import Bank could play a role in that process, the official said.

The official said a Cofa “could be an elegant way to address some of the concerns that we have when it comes to Greenland security” but did not otherwise comment on the possibility of such an accord.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Trump administration understood to have pushed for requirements to be attached to deal in effort to freeze out Chinese steel

The US deal on steel tariffs imposes conditions on the “nature of ownership” of British plants as part of its efforts to freeze out Chinese steel, it has emerged.

It is understood Donald Trump's administration pushed for requirements to be attached to the steel deal to ensure that the Chinese-owned British Steel plant in Scunthorpe was not used by Beijing as a backdoor to circumvent US tariffs.

Government sources say Washington is understood to be reassured that Scunthorpe is now in effect controlled by Jonathan Reynolds, the business secretary, and is likely not to come back under the direction of Jingye Group, its Chinese owners.

However, before the UK government took steps to seize control of British Steel last month the US had been concerned that the Scunthorpe plant could have been used as a base for processing Chinese steel to take advantage of lower tariffs.

The US-UK deal, agreed on Thursday, has come as a relief to the car and steel industries, which had been worried about job losses, although some of the terms are still unclear. It is set to bring car tariffs down to 10% and steel tariffs to zero if conditions are met.

Peter Mandelson, Britain's ambassador to the US, said the deal had immediately prevented job losses at Jaguar Land Rover's plant in the West Midlands. “This deal has saved those jobs,” Mandelson said in an interview on CNN. “That's a pretty big achievement, in my view, and I'm very pleased that the president has signed it.”

Government sources said JLR had planned for imminent cuts among its 30,000 staff in the UK but had not informed unions in the hope that a deal with the US could be struck to eliminate the 25% tariffs on exports of cars to the US.

Keir Starmer told ITV on Friday that the deal would be “measured in thousands and thousands of jobs that will be protected, saved and will thrive as a result” in steel, cars and in pharmaceuticals.

Government sources said the UK was still working with the US to define the exact requirements for the quota of steel allowed to be exported tariff-free, looking at the security of the supply chain and on ownership, so that the deal could be introduced as soon as possible.

The text of the agreement makes clear that US steel tariffs of 25% will be lowered only if certain US requirements are met on the “security of supply chains” and the “nature of ownership of the relevant production facilities”.

It says: “Understanding the United Kingdom will meet these requirements, the United States will promptly construct a quota at most favored nation (MFN) rates for UK steel and aluminum and certain derivative steel and aluminum products.”

Howard Lutnick, the US commerce secretary, boasted on Thursday: “The British government as part of this deal nationalised British Steel.”

UK sources said the US had not pushed Britain towards nationalising British Steel but had been impressed with the action taken against its Chinese owners before Easter.

Chrysa Glystra, the director of trade and economic policy at UK Steel, the industry body said: “The terms of the deal highlight a number of hoops to jump through before the UK steel sector can see the benefits of this deal.”

The UK exports about 200,000 metric tons of steel per year to the US, which is worth about £400m.

Glystra said it was still not clear what the terms and conditions of the tariff exemption were or when it would kick in, underlining the admission by government sources that they settled on a quick deal to “bank progress” and save jobs in the car industry.

“To fully assess the impact on our sector, we will need to fully understand the supply chain conditions that need to be met, how the quotas will be defined and when these will take effect,” Glystra added.

Trump, who has now turned his attention to the first trade talks between the US and China in Geneva on Saturday, said the “final details [of the UK deal] are being written up in the coming weeks”.

There had been reports that the deal in effect handed the US a veto on Chinese investment in UK sectors covered by the deal but No 10 said this was not the case.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre listens to questions from journalists as he arrives on Parliament Hill for a meeting of the Conservative caucus after the federal election, in Ottawa, on May 6.Justin Tang/The Canadian Press

Allan Levine is a historian and the author of King: A Life Guided by the Hand of Destiny. His next book, The Dollar-A-Year Men: How the Best Business Brains in Canada Helped to Win the Second World War, will be published in October.

Going into the 1921 federal election, Arthur Meighen was feeling mildly confident. Nearly 17 months earlier, the Conservative leader had succeeded Sir Robert Borden, who had led the Unionist government – a coalition of Conservatives and some English-speaking Liberals – during the First World War. Nearly all the Unionist Liberals had returned to their own party, led by William Lyon Mackenzie King. 

But Meighen was in far more trouble than he was willing to admit. He was detested in Quebec for being the architect of conscription and hated in the West for his unwavering support of the protective tariff.

King's Liberals won the slimmest of majority governments with 118 of 235 seats. For the first time in a Canadian federal election, the Conservatives fell from first to third, winning only 50 seats. More surprising was that the Progressive Party, a loose political association formed in 1919 by farmers who had lost patience with both traditional parties, combined with farmers' parties from Ontario and Alberta to win a total of 62 seats. 

Like Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre, who recently lost his Ottawa-area seat in Carleton, Meighen was defeated in Manitoba's Portage la Prairie by his Progressive opponent by 177 votes. He was “not very greatly surprised by the downfall of his regime,” writes Roger Graham, Meighen's biographer, but he was “sorely disappointed by the humiliating decisiveness of its rejection at the polls.” 

Still, there are always second chances in Canadian politics. Meighen did contemplate resigning, but decided against it: “A man is not much good, who after a period of unbroken success, cannot stand one reverse, however sharp and decisive,” Meighen wrote to a friend. 

In quick order, and before King was officially prime minister, a newly elected Conservative MP in the eastern Ontario riding of Grenville accepted a low-level civil-service job and resigned his seat. Much to King's dismay, Meighen easily won the by-election by 1,662 votes over his lone opponent from the Progressive Party. When the internally divided Progressives made clear that they had no desire to serve as the Official Opposition, Grenville's new MP was asked to serve as Opposition Leader.

Three years later, the tables were turned. In the 1925 federal election, King's Liberals came in second place with 99 of 245 seats, while Meighen's Conservatives won 116. Meighen assumed he would form a minority government, but King, as was his right, refused to relinquish power because he knew that the Progressives, who won 24 seats, would rather have him in power. And King was proven right – much to Meighen's incredulity.

But like Meighen in 1921, King lost his seat in the Southern Ontario riding of York North by 494 votes to Conservative Thomas Lennox. King later wrote of “feeling regret” at losing his seat, and he rationalized his loss to Mr. Lennox as being the result of “what money and whiskey can do.” Still, he was confident he would find and win in another riding in the near future – which he did early in 1926 in a by-election in Prince Albert, Sask. He appointed Charles McDonald, the Liberal MP who had won the riding, to the Senate.

A similar avenue is now open to Mr. Poilievre. Damien Kurek, a Conservative MP for the Alberta riding of Battle River‐Crowfoot since 2019, has decided to put the needs of the party leader ahead of his own by offering to resign. Winning there should not be a problem: Mr. Kurek got 46,000 more votes than the second-place Liberal candidate. And though the Prime Minister could take up to six months to call the by-election, Mark Carney has said he will do so “as soon as possible.” 

The other important factor, for leaders in this chastened purgatory, is to understand why you lost in the first place and alter your future strategy. Neither King nor Meighen did much soul-searching and carried on, however. Both blamed a myriad of factors for their respective electoral losses – except themselves. That approach mostly turned out better for King, though, because he innately understood that in Canadian politics, extreme and inflexible policies will never sustain long-term victory at the polls. King survived the debacle of 1925, a customs scandal and his famous constitutional fight with governor-general Byng, and went on to reign for many more years. 

However, in the 1945 election – King's last – he lost his seat in Prince Albert to the CCF by 159 votes. He easily won a by-election two months later in the Ontario riding of Glengarry, though he found the experience disappointing and somewhat humiliating. 

Meighen, on the other hand, was not flexible, especially on his unyielding faith in the pre-eminence of the British Empire and his sacred but alienating economic policies. He lost his seat again in the 1926 federal election, and after that resigned as Conservative leader. He returned as leader during the Second World War, but a 1942 by-election loss in the Toronto-area constituency of York South ended his political career.

Given Mr. Poilievre's supreme confidence and brash style, and the fact that his Conservatives won 20 more seats than they did in 2019, he seems far more likely to be a Meighen than a King. He, too, does not appear to grasp King's basic political tenet: That “in a country like ours it is particularly true that the art of government is largely one of seeking to reconcile rather than to exaggerate differences – to come as near as may be possible to the happy mean.” Mr. Poilievre's attack-dog shtick is sure to continue. 

Mr. Meighen titled his 1949 collection of speeches and essays Unrevised and Unrepented. That title might work as well for Mr. Poilievre's memoir, too, should he ever write it.

Hungary and, in a tit-for-tat move, Ukraine each expelled two of the other's diplomats

Below, you can read a roundup of developments in Russia's invasion of Ukraine from Friday, May 9:

The US Embassy in Kyiv has warned of a ""potentially significant"" air attack in the coming days.

""The US Embassy in Kyiv has received information concerning a potentially significant air attack that may occur at any time over the next several days,"" the embassy said on its website.

The embassy advised US citizens to take shelter immediately in the event of an air alert.

Support for Ukraine is the ""absolute focus"" of Britain and its northern European allies, UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer said as he attended a meeting of the Joint Expeditionary Forces (JEF) in Oslo.

Speaking after the summit, Starmer said the UK-led group's top priority was to defend the values ""hard-won"" during the Second World War and to continue to stand behind Kyiv.

""That's where our absolute focus is — with Ukraine, defending the values that yesterday at VE Day we were remembering and commemorating, that were hard-won in the Second World War,"" Starmer stressed.

The JEF is a military coalition of mostly northern European nations that includes Denmark, Finland, Norway, Sweden, Iceland, the Baltic states and the Netherlands.

French President Emmanuel Macron called for the rapid drafting of a US-European plan for a 30-day ceasefire in the war between Russia and Ukraine, backed by ""massive sanctions.""

""My wish ... is that in the coming hours and coming days, we manage to all come together to commit to a ceasefire, saying that if one of the parties betrays it, there will be massive economic sanctions,"" Macron told Polish television channel Telewizja Polska.

He said there needed to be stronger action ""so that we are much more dissuasive, Europeans and Americans united.""

On Thursday, US President Donald Trump called for a 30-day unconditional ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine. He warned that Washington and its partners would impose further sanctions if the ceasefire was not respected.

Ukraine has imposed sanctions on 58 Russian citizens and 74 foreign companies, according to a presidential decree.

Most of them are Russian companies linked to the military-industrial complex.

However, the list also includes one based in Hong Kong, three Iranian companies, and three Uzbek companies.

Smart Kit Technology Limited is from Hong Kong, while Alvand Motorbuilding Industries Company, Bonyan Danesh Shargh Private Company and Pishro Sanat Aseman Sharif Private Company are registered in Iran.

The decree did not give a reason for the restrictions, but Ukraine has previously accused both China and Iran of supporting Russia's war effort.

The United States and European countries are finalizing a proposal for a 30-day ceasefire in Ukraine that, if rejected, would see them jointly impose new sanctions on Russia, Reuters news agency quoted a French diplomatic source as saying.

The source added that the proposal had not yet been given the green light and would be worked on at a summit in Ukraine over the weekend.

Meanwhile, Finnish President Alexander Stubb, speaking shortly after talks with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and US President Donald Trump, said efforts to secure an agreed ceasefire in Ukraine were moving in the right direction.

""We can't give a timetable now, but in an ideal world a Ukraine ceasefire would be declared over the weekend,"" Stub told a press conference with his Norwegian counterpart Jonas Gahr Stoere after a meeting of Northern European nations' leaders in Oslo.

Trump on Thursday called for a 30-day unconditional ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine. He warned that Washington and its partners would impose further sanctions if the ceasefire is not respected.

Britain, France and a group of northern European nations said they supported a US proposal for an unconditional 30-day cease-fire between Russia and Ukraine.

Pro-Ukrainian activists staged a protest at a Soviet memorial in Warsaw, where Moscow's ambassador laid a wreath as Russia marked World War II Victory Day.

About two dozen demonstrators wrapped in white sheets, their clothes and faces splashed with a red substance imitating blood, lay at the foot of a monument at the cemetery for Soviet soldiers in the Polish capital.

They chanted ""terrorists"" as Russia's ambassador to Poland, Sergei Andreyev, made his way to the monument with a wreath commemorating the Soviet defeat of Nazi Germany.

About a dozen people also gathered at the site for a counter-protest. Minor scuffles and verbal altercations broke out between the groups.

Russia's ambassador to Germany, Sergei Nechayev, has laid wreaths at Soviet memorials in Berlin on the occasion of the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II.

Nechayev visited both the huge memorial in Treptower Park, in former East Berlin, and the site in Tiergarten near the Brandenburg Gate, in the city's western sector.

Russia commemorates the victory over Nazi Germany on May 9, while Europe celebrates the end of the war on May 8.

The pro-Kremlin Russian Communist Party has unveiled a bust of Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin in the Russian-controlled southern Ukrainian city of Melitopol.

The unveiling came a day before a military parade in Moscow to mark the victory over Nazi Germany 80 years ago.

The party later said it was the first monument dedicated to Stalin in ""Novorossiya,"" as Moscow calls illegally annexed parts of Ukraine.

Stalin, who led the Soviet Union in the war against Nazi Germany and is still considered a hero by many in Russia, was also responsible for starvation, terror, murder and repression of his own people.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said leaders from the ""coalition of the willing"" will meet in Kyiv on Saturday.

""We need this coalition, and we need it to be strong enough to guarantee security,"" Zelenskyy told a military summit in Oslo via video link on Friday.

The coalition is an initiative led by France and the United Kingdom that was announced by UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer after a summit of Kyiv's allies in London.

That summit was held in the wake of US mediation efforts with Russia, talks that did not include Ukrainian or European officials.

The initiative has been joined by 33 nations that have vowed to provide more support for Ukraine against Russia's invasion, including being part of a potential peacekeeping force on Ukrainian territory.

Most of the EU's 27 members have signed up, with four notable exceptions. Malta has opted out, citing its neutrality, although Ireland — which is also neutral — has joined.

Hungary and Slovakia have also refused to join the coalition. 

The rest of the initiative's partners are made up of Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Japan, Iceland, Turkey and Norway.

Russia has said that it will view the presence of any Western troops in Ukraine as a hostile act, and has warned that the coalition could trigger a war between NATO and Moscow.

Kyiv has been calling on its European allies to send soldiers to enforce a potential ceasefire and ward off any potential future aggression by Russia, as well as urging them to increase sanctions.

Ukraine's European Union allies have endorsed creating a special tribunal to prosecute senior Russian leaders, including President Vladimir Putin, for crimes committed during Moscow's invasion of Ukraine.

EU foreign ministers, as well as the EU's foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas, were meeting the western Ukrainian city of Lviv on Friday in a symbolic show of support for Ukraine.

Kallas said the EU was sending ""a very important signal"" by endorsing a ""tribunal for the crimes of aggression"" Russia has committed.

""That means that nobody can go unpunished for the crimes they commit,"" she said, urging all other nations ""who stand for the principles enshrined in the UN Charter"" to support the creation of the tribunal.

""If there is no accountability, we will see this happening again,"" Kallas warned. 

In her remarks, she also confirmed that Europe would provide a further €1 billion ($1.13 billion) for the Ukrainian defense industry.

The meeting in Lviv was held at the same time that Russia was marking victory in World War II with a massive military parade in Moscow. 

Hungary has expelled two Ukrainian diplomats accused of being spies, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said Friday.

""Today we have expelled two spies from Hungary working under diplomatic cover at Ukraine's Embassy in Budapest,"" Szijjarto said on Facebook, accusing Kyiv of conducting a ""smear campaign"" and of contributing to ""growing anti-Hungarian propaganda"".

The move came after the SBU, Ukraine's internal security service, said Friday it had arrested two alleged Hungarian spies.

The SBU accused the ""two agents"" of gathering military intelligence in western Ukraine near the border with Hungary. The Zakarpattia region is home to around 150,000 ethnic Hungarians.

The suspects are former soldiers — a 40-year-old man and a woman — the SBU said, adding that they both face life in prison. 

Ukrainian authorities believe they were recruited by a handler in Hungarian military intelligence and given cash and specialist equipment for secret communications.

Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha later said in a social media post that two Hungarian diplomats must leave Ukraine within 48 hours.

""We are acting in response to Hungary's actions, based on the principle of reciprocity and our national interests,"" he wrote on X.

Ties between Kyiv and Budapest have been strained for years. Hungary's Prime Minister, Viktor Orban, has sided with Moscow and Russian President Vladimir Putin since Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022.

Orban has refused to join Western sanctions against the Kremlin, and has opposed Ukraine's bid to join the European Union.

German Chancellor Friedrich Merz says he is more optimistic about the future of the NATO alliance than he was three months ago when he questioned its continued existence in light of the attitude of the US administration under President Donald Trump.

""What has changed is the acceptance of what we, as European NATO partners, are doing,"" Merz told a joint Brussels news conference with NATO chief Mark Rutte.

""And that is why I associate the NATO summit in June with more hope today than I did back in February—that we will succeed in developing a joint strategy with the Americans,"" he added, referring to a NATO meeting planned for next month in the Netherlands.

Merz also said he had no hopes of Ukraine joining NATO in the near future, as he visited Brussels for the first time since taking office.

After Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Kyiv applied for membership in the European Union and urged allies in the NATO military alliance to issue an invitation for it to join.

While NATO agreed last year to admit Ukraine in the future without setting a date, the US administration under Donald Trump has since ruled out such a move. NATO allies must unanimously agree on admitting new members.

Merz said Ukraine would not join NATO until it had also joined the EU, something that most experts say won't happen until 2030 at the latest.

Germany will provide Ukraine with an additional €40 million ($45 million) in humanitarian aid, German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul said as he met with EU foreign ministers in Lviv, Ukraine.

""We are showing here that Europe stands with Ukraine and are reminding people that the Nazi regime was also significantly defeated by Ukrainian soldiers,"" the new German top diplomat said.

After visiting a rehabilitation center for severely injured soldiers and a cemetery with his EU colleagues, Wadephul called the war ""completely senseless.""

US President Donald Trump has demanded an unconditional 30-day ceasefire between Ukraine and Russia.

According to Trump, further sanctions await Russia by the US and its partners, should the ceasefire not be respected by Moscow.

A host of European leaders have shown support for Trump's call, including German Chancellor Friedrich Merz and French President Emmanuel Macron.

""Russia is now called upon to finally agree to a longer ceasefire, which must leave room for a genuine peace treaty,"" Merz said after meeting European Council President Antonio Costa, with Macron welcoming Trump's ""strong call"" for a ceasefire.

About 1,000 troops who have been identified as having gender dysphoria are being discharged from the military, the Department of Defense said on May 8.

“Approximately 1,000 Service members who have self-identified as being diagnosed with gender dysphoria will begin the voluntary separation process.”

The force has around 2.1 million troops.

Gender dysphoria is when a person believes they're a gender that does not match their sex. At least some of the troops with gender dysphoria have begun or finished transgender treatments in an attempt to transition to a gender different from that of their sex, according to court filings.

President Donald Trump's first administration banned transgender troops. Under President Joe Biden, the military rescinded the ban.

Trump said in a January order that “expressing a false ‘gender identity' divergent from an individual's sex cannot satisfy the rigorous standards necessary for military service.”

The military said that troops with gender dysphoria can choose to voluntarily separate, and that if they do so, they may be eligible for voluntary separation pay.

The deadline to identify themselves for voluntary separation is June 6 for active-duty troops and July 7 for reserves. Both windows were extended, the former for 30 days and the latter for 60 days, from before.

Supreme Court justices in the majority, and the three who said they would not have granted the government's emergency request for a stay pending appeal, did not offer any rationale for their decision.

Darin S. Selnick, a Department of Defense undersecretary, said troops who want waivers must show there is “a compelling government interest” in retaining them “that directly supports warfighting capabilities.” Those seeking exemptions must also demonstrate they have had “36 consecutive months of stability in the Service member's sex without clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning,” that they have never attempted a gender transition, and that they are “willing and able to adhere to all applicable standards, including the standards associated with the Service member's sex.”","{'href': 'https://www.theepochtimes.com', 'title': 'theepochtimes.com'}","world"

U.S. leaders on Thursday celebrated after an American pope was elected for the first time in the 2,000-year history of the Catholic Church.

White smoke billowed from the chimney of the Sistine Chapel shortly after 6 p.m. local time, signaling a new pontiff had been chosen after just two days of conclave deliberations.

Cardinal Robert Francis Prevost, 69, emerged on the balcony to greet the large crowds in the Vatican City in his first public appearance as the Catholic Church's new leader.

The new pope chose the name Leo XIV.

The Chicago-born cardinal spent many years serving as a missionary in Peru. In 2023, Pope Francis brought Prevost to the Vatican to lead the office that vets bishop nominations from around the world, a role considered one of the most powerful positions in the Catholic Church. That prominence gave Prevost an advantage over other papal candidates going into the conclave.

President Donald Trump congratulated the new pontiff and expressed excitement over the first American pope.

Vance, during a discussion with Sean Hannity of Fox News, explained that the concept means family comes first, followed by neighbors, community, and then the rest of the world. Immigration policies that prioritize illegal immigrants over Americans don't follow “ordo amoris,” Vance said.

Many experts considered the U.S. cardinal a dark horse in the election to become the next leader of the Catholic Church. Historically, cardinals have voted for leaders from European countries, and 217 popes out of the 267 popes were from Italy.

While the news of a U.S. pope surprised many Americans, Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson said he was proud that the new pope was born in his city.

Prominent Americans, including President Joe Biden, wished the new pontiff success.

The new pope was elected by 133 cardinals who were sequestered in the Sistine Chapel during the voting process. The cardinals did not have any contact with the outside world during conclave deliberations and were sworn into secrecy as part of the papal election.

The longtime California congresswoman also applauded the new pope for echoing words spoken by Francis on Easter Sunday before he died.

“God loves everyone,” Leo said in his first public remarks as the new leader of the Catholic Church.

“Evil will not prevail; we are all in the hands of God,” he said.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio, a devout Catholic, described the historic moment as having profound significance for the Catholic Church and offering renewed hope for the 2025 Jubilee Year. In the Catholic Church, 2025 has been designated a holy year that represents a time of reflection and pilgrimage.

The new pope is now set to make a series of initial appearances.","{'href': 'https://www.theepochtimes.com', 'title': 'theepochtimes.com'}","world"

President Donald Trump said he's open to hiking taxes on wealthy Americans to help pay for Republicans' sweeping tax and spending cuts package, but the idea remains hotly contested among GOP lawmakers on Capitol Hill.
    


            In a Truth Social post Friday morning, Trump said that he would “graciously accept” even a “TINY” tax increase on the rich, while acknowledging that that it could bring political risks for Republicans. House GOP lawmakers have been struggling to find $1.5 trillion in spending cuts to help offset trillions of dollars of tax reductions.
    


            “The problem with even a ‘TINY' tax increase for the RICH, which I and all others would graciously accept in order to help the lower and middle income workers, is that the Radical Left Democrat Lunatics would go around screaming, ‘Read my lips,' the fabled Quote by George Bush the Elder that is said to have cost him the Election. NO, Ross Perot cost him the Election!” Trump wrote.
    


            “In any event, Republicans should probably not do it, but I'm OK if they do!!!” he continued.
    


            Trump also mentioned the possibility of letting tax cuts expire on top earners – targeting individuals who earn at least $2.5 million or couples that make at least $5 million — in a call with House Speaker Mike Johnson on Wednesday, a Republican source familiar with the matter told CNN's Dana Bash.
    


            The White House has made the suggestion to Congress with the thought that not only would it help achieve much needed offsets, it could also help wipe away Democrats' argument about tax cuts for the rich, the source familiar said.
    


            This is not the first time Trump has indicated that he supports raising taxes on the wealthy, even though throughout last year's presidential campaign, he repeatedly promised to cut their taxes. The president recently told Time magazine, “I actually love the concept,” when asked about a proposal circulating to raise taxes for those earning more than $1 million a year.
    


            The idea, however, is not being warmly embraced among the House GOP and is far from guaranteed to make it into the president's final “one big beautiful” bill, which aims to make permanent the sweeping Trump 2017 tax cuts and incorporate the president's campaign promises to eliminate taxes on tips and certain other income.
    


            Just extending the 2017 individual tax provisions – which expire at the end of this year – could cost more than $4 trillion. Republican lawmakers are also fractured on how deeply they'd have to cut spending – including on Medicaid and food stamps – to meet their targets.
    


            Within the House Ways and Means Committee, members have discussed two ideas. One is to let the tax breaks for the richest Americans expire, returning their top income tax rate to 39.6% – which is what it was before Trump's 2017 tax overhaul – from the current 37%. This has drawn some criticism, however, as some Republicans fear it could impact small business owners.
    


            But it could hit roughly 1.5 million households and cut about $409 billion of the cost, as well as greatly limit potential economic growth from making the tax cuts permanent, according to the Tax Foundation, a right-leaning think tank.
    


            Another idea is to create a brand-new tax bracket for the wealthy. The proposal, though limited in scope, could contribute to offsetting costly tax provisions, such as restoring the state and local tax deduction – known as SALT – that has become another flashpoint in Congress' tax debate.
    


            The new tax bracket would raise about $59.3 billion over a decade, according to the Tax Foundation. And it would affect between 150,000 and 200,000 households and would have a much smaller dampening effect on the package's economic growth potential.
    


            Levying a higher income tax rate on the very wealthiest of Americans would raise less money because much of that group's earnings come from dividends and capital gains, which are taxed at lower rates, said Garrett Watson, the foundation's director of policy analysis. Also, there are much fewer of them.
    


            One of the considerations for Republicans is what the goal of such a provision would be – to limit how much of the benefit is going to the rich or to raise more money to offset other tax cuts, Watson said.
    


            Despite Trump's apparent openness to raising taxes on the wealthy, his economic adviser said Friday that the president “is not a strong advocate” of the idea.
    


            Asked whether Trump is seriously considering taxing the rich to pay for his budget bill, National Economic Director Kevin Hassett said: “The president is not a strong advocate of that, but he is a strong advocate of many things like no tax on tips, no tax on overtime, and nice treatment for auto loans.”
    


            “He has cited his priorities, and he understands that in the end, the final bill will include some priorities of members of the House of the Senate. That's how the democratic process works, and that's really what this conversation is about.”
    


            When asked how the White House expects to pay for the bill, given a number of its stated priorities are expensive, Hassett argued Congress has already identified clear areas for cuts, without detailing what they are and whether they are achievable.
    


            “Well, the budget rules in the House and the Senate are very clearly identified that include spending cuts and so on, and they don't include dynamic scores,” he told CNN. “And so in the fullest of time with the spending cuts that we're achieving ,and the dynamic score of the tax bill, we're highly confident that we're going to reduce the deficit that make bond markets celebrate.”
    


            House Ways and Means Chairman Jason Smith is expected to meet with Trump at the White House on Friday, and Hassett earlier told CNBC that he expects Smith will outline the House's schedule for the tax bill at some point during the day.
    


            Hassett has been meeting almost weekly with Johnson, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and others regarding Congress' budget. Earlier this week, the group met in the Roosevelt Room of the White House.

            President Donald Trump on Friday set negotiating terms for his administration's first discussions with China, which are set to take place in Geneva this weekend.
    


            In a series of posts on Truth Social, Trump appeared to lay out his demands — and concessions — for the meeting between US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer and their Chinese counterparts. Trump said China must import more US goods, and in return, he believes the United States should lower its 145% tariff on most Chinese goods to 80%.
    


            “CHINA SHOULD OPEN UP ITS MARKET TO USA — WOULD BE SO GOOD FOR THEM!!! CLOSED MARKETS DON'T WORK ANYMORE!!!,” Trump posted.
    


            “80% Tariff on China seems right! Up to Scott B,” Trump said in a separate post.
    


            The concession would be a dramatic break from the present reality, which has sent shipments from China into the United States plunging by 60%, according to Ryan Petersen, CEO of Flexport, a logistics and freight forwarding broker.
    


            Even if tariffs fall to 80%, it's not clear that would be enough to convince US businesses to import Chinese goods. Economists have said 50% is the make-or-break threshold for the return of somewhat normal business between the two countries.
    


            Meanwhile, the damage is already done. Price hikes are beginning, and Goldman Sachs analysts Thursday said a key measure of inflation would effectively double to 4% by year end because of the trade war. Even if tariffs went to 0% this weekend, the US would still have price hikes and shortages, at least temporarily, because so little has been coming into US ports.
    


            China said Friday exports to the US fell 21% last month — before the effects of tariffs took hold.
    


            Trump has said he considers that a good thing. In the Oval Office Friday, Trump said the reduction in shipments from China means the United States is no longer losing money — a frequent if highly inaccurate refrain from the president that mistakenly equates a trade imbalance with losses.
    


            Trump and Bessent have both said the high tariff on China — and China's 125% tariff on most US goods — is unsustainable and needs to be lowered.
    


            However, Trump administration officials are trying to lower expectations about the potential outcomes of this weekend's talks in Geneva, according to senior administration officials briefed on the plans. They are framing the talks as a good first step but won't result in any kind of “deal,” or even a framework like the one with the United Kingdom that Trump announced in the Oval Office to much fanfare Thursday.
    


            Despite Trump's apparent overture, Director of the White House National Economic Council Kevin Hassett told CNN Friday that the tariff will not be lowered ahead of the negotiation.

            “I think that everything will happen while the talks are happening, not before,” he said at the White House. “It will come out tomorrow what happens. It's a negotiation.”
    


            Hassett added that Bessent and Greer are going into negotiations “with an open mind,” but said that news about any changes in tariffs won't come “until after the talks finish.”
    


            Bessent said Tuesday on Fox News that the discussions are to begin the thawing process in a frozen trade relationship.
    


            “My sense is that this will be about de-escalation, not about the big trade deal … but we've got to de-escalate before we can move forward,” he said. “You know, 145% [tariffs], 125%, is the equivalent of an embargo. We don't want to decouple, what we want is fair trade.”
    


            In the meantime, America's aggressive trade war has sent the US economy into reverse. Last week's report on gross domestic product, the broadest measure of the US economy, showed America's first contraction since early 2022, as an otherwise-healthy economy was dragged down by companies stockpiling goods to get ahead of tariffs. And that was the first quarter — before the most aggressive trade policy had even taken effect.
    


            Despite the increasingly dire warnings and economic turmoil, the United States and China remain far apart on an actual deal. Even with the talks set to kick off this weekend, Bessent said it could take two to three years for trade to normalize with China.

Soldiers given false arrest records have been stuck in bureaucratic limbo for years. President Trump or Defense Secretary Hegseth could fix it, lawyers say.

FIRST ON FOX: President Donald Trump on Friday signed an executive order to establish a national center for homeless veterans with redirected funds previously spent on services for illegal aliens, Fox News Digital has learned. 

The president's order directs the secretary of veterans affairs to establish the National Center for Warrior Independence on the Veterans Affairs campus in West Los Angeles. 

TRUMP TO HOST MILITARY PARADE TO CELEBRATE ARMY'S 250TH BIRTHDAY, HONOR ACTIVE-DUTY SERVICE MEMBERS, VETERANS

Los Angeles has approximately 3,000 homeless veterans — more than any other city in the country, and accounting for about 10% of all homeless veterans in America, according to the White House.

""The new National Center for Warrior Independence will help them and other veterans like them rebuild their lives,"" the White House said. 

The center will allow veterans from around the nation to seek and receive care, benefits and services ""to which they are entitled,"" the White House said. 

The order redirects funds previously spent on housing or other services for illegal aliens to constructing, establishing and maintaining the new center. 

""The Center will promote self-sufficiency through housing, substance abuse treatment, and support for productive work for the veterans housed there,"" the White House explained. 

It said the goal is to house up to 6,000 homeless veterans at the center by 2028.

TRUMP TO CREATE TASK FORCE TO PLAN 'EXTRAORDINARY CELEBRATION' FOR 250TH ANNIVERSARY OF AMERICA'S INDEPENDENCE

The order also directs the secretary of housing and urban development to use vouchers to support homeless veterans and instructs the secretary of veterans affairs to ""restore accountability at the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)."" 

The order also instructs the VA to take action against individuals who have committed misconduct and to investigate and rectify the Biden administration's decision to ""rehire and reinstate back pay for employees previously fired for misconduct."" 

The order also ensures that veterans will have access to increased options for care, benefits and services — including reduced wait times for Veterans Health Administration appointments through options such as expanded hours, weekend appointments and virtual healthcare.

The order also directs a feasibility study at the Manchester VA Medical Center to expand services to support a full-service medical center in New Hampshire.

""President Trump strongly believes that every veteran deserves our gratitude, and that the federal government should treat veterans like the heroes they are,"" the White House said. 

The order comes a week after the White House announced that Trump will host a military parade on June 14 to honor military veterans and active-duty service members and commemorate the U.S. Army's 250th birthday.

Jordon Hudson is not going anywhere any time soon.

A report earlier Friday circulated that UNC athletic staff had barred Hudson, the 24-year-old girlfriend of head coach Bill Belichick, from both the facility and the field.

However, the university refuted that, regarding ""false"" reports of her role.

""While Jordon Hudson is not an employee at the University or Carolina Athletics, she is welcome to the Carolina Football facilities. Jordon will continue to manage all activities related to Coach Belichick's personal brand outside of his responsibilities for Carolina Football and the University,"" the unversity's athletic program said in a statement.

The report came from ex-ESPN employee Pablo Torre, who also said he had heard from sources in the Belichick family that there is a ""deep worry"" that Hudson could be ""detrimental"" to his legacy, and they were even ""digging"" up on her.

Shortly after UNC's statement, though, Torre released a statement of his own, backing up his reporting on Hudson being banned from the facility.

""The University of North Carolina can choose to describe or change its position on Jordon Hudson's involvement however it wishes, following the publication of our episode. We requested comment and filed dozens of FOIA requests that were not satisfied. And we stand by the specific reporting in our episode, which came from the highest levels of the football program,"" he said.

Hudson has reportedly been heavily involved in Belichick's professional life since he was hired to be UNC's football coach in December. One report said she struck down the idea of the Tar Heels program being featured in ""Hard Knocks.""

She and Belichick both reportedly expressed concern about fan vitriol, particularly about their relationship, if UNC were to underperform.

Apparently, Belichick had asked UNC staff to include Hudson in all emails moving forward.

The 73-year-old and 24-year-old made their relationship public last year, which prompted plenty of eyeballs as it is. However, in recent weeks, Hudson gained more notoriety last month when she interrupted a CBS interview with Belichick, resulting in back-and-forth statements between the two parties.

Jim Whaley, retired Army Lt. Colonel and CEO of Mission Roll Call, told Fox News Digital in an exclusive interview why reform is necessary to improve the Department of Veterans Affairs.
 

EXCLUSIVE: President Donald Trump's Secretary of Veterans Affairs, Doug Collins, has proposed a 15% workforce reduction with a goal of cutting 80,000 jobs at the VA. 

Retired Lt. Col. Jim Whaley, CEO of Mission Roll Call, a veteran advocacy non-profit, said such VA reform is necessary to improve veterans' lives across the United States. 

Whaley told Fox News Digital that veterans want to see less bureaucracy at the VA and more ""community care"" to cut wait times and increase services at local VA hospitals, but ""if it was easy, somebody would have solved it.""

""Every American and politician, from both sides of the aisle, can agree that we want to make sure we take care of our veterans,"" Whaley said. ""We just got out of over 20 years of war, so there are a lot of veterans and their families that need help. We want to make sure that every dollar that the American taxpayer is paying to support the VA is spent wisely, and that veterans are getting the care that they need. And more importantly, that they're getting the care when they need it, where they need it and how they need it.""

The VA serves only half of U.S. veterans. While Whaley said Collins is trying to reach the other 50% through TV and podcast appearances, he encouraged more transparency about the VA's services to reach the other half of veterans who still need care. 

""One hundred days into the second Trump administration, and VA is no longer content with poor results. Under President Trump's leadership, we have already stripped away many of the costly distractions that were coming between VA beneficiaries and the benefits they have earned. And we're looking to make even more historic reforms to better serve our veterans,"" Collins said. 

Trump and Collins have faced controversy in the media and among Democrats for cutting VA jobs and for their efforts to overhaul the department. Whaley, whose organization conducts veteran polling, said more than half of veterans are worried about VA cuts.

""When all you hear is about the cuts versus what the philosophy is behind why you're making those changes in an organization, there's going to be fear. Change is hard. It's important that the VA stays as transparent as possible and reports on what is being done and what improvements are being made,"" Whaley said. 

However, Whatley, a veteran himself, said all veterans want to see an improved VA.

""They want to see services improve, they want to see wait times reduced. As time goes on and Veterans Affairs communicate more and more with veterans, they will know a little bit about what's going on, and they'll be a little less anxious about it. I think it's all about making sure that veterans are getting the news, making sure they understand why they're making these cuts.""

Whaley encouraged Collins and the VA to include more veterans in the conversations surrounding the VA's reform by listening to families and caregivers to learn how to best invest in veteran care. 

""Veteran affairs are very important to recruitment issues, and that, of course, affects national security. So they're not all separate, it all wraps together. When a veteran gets out of the service after a few years of serving their country, we have to make sure that the transition to the civilian world and finding a job and plugging into the community goes smoothly, because if we don't, then we have an issue,"" Whaley said.

According to the 2023 National Veteran Suicide Prevention Annual Report, more than 17 veterans committed suicide per day in 2021. 

""We need to get the number of suicides as close to zero as possible. That's the number one priority,"" Whaley said, adding that community care is also a top priority, so veterans don't have to drive long distances and wait a long time to get the services they need.

""We need to make sure that the Department of Defense and the VA are working together when veterans are transitioning out of the military to make sure they're plugged into the VA and that the transition goes well. Because the fact of the matter is, the majority of suicides among veterans are from veterans that have recently transitioned to the civilian world.""

My home state of Colorado used to shine as a Western American land of promise, where economic vigor and free-spirit vibes lured diverse transplants from around the globe. Migrants from great coastal cities likened it to a real-life version of Ayn Rand's fictional, Colorado-based Galt's Gulch, where industrialists, inventors, entrepreneurs, and artists established themselves to escape a collectivist society that manifests mediocrity and oppression.

Growth in population and wealth was the norm through the late 20th and early 21st centuries. Business leaders and top-ranking executives flocked to Colorado, with the state becoming a permanent home for at least 12 billionaires and 170,223 millionaire households by 2020 — not bad for a state with fewer than 6 million residents. It was an environment in which liberals, conservatives, libertarians, hippies, cowboys, rednecks, hillbillies, artists, tech entrepreneurs, and free-spirited people of all philosophical and political persuasions led safe and stable lifestyles in a cultural and economic cocoon.

Then came 2018, when the far Left won majorities in both chambers of the legislature, and voters elevated Democrats to every statewide office, including Gov. Jared Polis, Secretary of State Jena Griswold, and Attorney General Phil Weiser. By 2021, the Left held both of Colorado's U.S. Senate seats and four of the state's seven House seats (the state gained an eighth district in 2023, first held by a Democrat).

Seven years into this dark blue tsunami, the signs of damage are mounting. At first, Colorado's stumbles looked eerily like those made notorious by California. Nearing the end of the 2025 legislative session, Colorado has outdone what center-right Coloradans call the “Left Coast.” This year's legislative agenda — including a countercultural push to rework the state's Labor Peace Act, tilting the scales toward unions and away from production — hints at more trouble ahead.

For decades, Coloradans have grumbled about “Californication,” the influx of Californians jacking up home prices and hauling in left-leaning politics. It was one part jest, another part gripe, and a nod to the Red Hot Chili Peppers' riff on culture creep. “Colofornia” became a term of consternation among natives and others witnessing the influx. But it's no laughing matter in 2025. The numbers show a genuine shift, and the fallout — economic strain, cultural friction, and a state generally losing its footing — is hitting hard.

Despite a doctrinaire, radicalized legislature, what's the matter with Colorado is far from intractable. Colorado cities and towns consistently rank among the top 10 for livability, as ranked on lists by U.S. News & World Report, WalletHub, and other research organizations.

Colorado has become a draw for the country's booming aerospace industry. Parks, trails, open spaces, ski slopes, and awe-inspiring vistas complement a four-season climate conducive to year-round recreation. A modern proliferation of art venues, museums, and concert arenas gives Coloradans cultural amenities more common in major coastal cities.

What we have here is a governmental leadership crisis of one-party control, with rippling consequences of death, homelessness, addiction, despair, and growing unemployment, disproportionately burdening the most vulnerable among us.

Pre-2018, Colorado reliably flexed economic muscle no matter which party controlled the famously swingy purple state. Studies consistently ranked Colorado in the top five for economic performance, and the state shone as a beacon for go-getters. By 2024, the Centennial State slumped to the bottom 10. It is California's slow bleed redux: Regulations pile up, costs soar, and growth fizzles. Personal income growth, a bragging right at third nationally pre-2018, crashed to 39th by 2024, even with Polis and company supporting some of the country's highest minimum wage mandates, consistently projecting themselves as champions of the state's dwindling working class.

Though wage hikes raise some paychecks, jobs thin out and businesses hesitate to grow or relocate, handing Colorado a growing “income inequality” dilemma like the divide between California's Silicon Valley/Hollywood crowd and ordinary households.

Housing is referred to as a “crisis” by the legacy media. Median prices hit $541,352 in February, based on Zillow sales and listing data, landing Colorado among the five least affordable states. Apartments.com shows apartments in Denver going for 32% more than the national average.

Inflation across goods and services has risen 15.4% since 2021, outpacing the rest of the country. Colorado's new and troubling status as the sixth-most-regulated state raises a growing concern: Will top employers continue doing business in what free-market, supply-side defenders view as a freakishly controlling regulatory environment, much less choose Colorado as a good place to start, grow, or relocate a business?

The regulatory excess goes beyond wage mandates, expensive requirements to save the planet by forcing the abandonment of natural gas heating, and countless other regulations that are hostile to businesses. In April, the legislature and Polis banned the sale of most common handguns, rifles, and shotguns except for those with enough free time and money to buy themselves past required training courses and licensure fees.

If that's not enough to discourage doing business in Colorado, the legislature crafted a bill that penalizes parents, with consequences that include losing custody, if they use a child's given name instead of one the child prefers. That proposed law alone has families planning to move and much of the country rolling its eyes.

The workforce is taking hits. Oil and gas, a godsend for smart workers without college degrees, dropped 25% in active rigs by 2023, based on industry tallies. Compliance costs from post-2018 rules — $590 million a year, as found by the Common Sense Institute — push layoffs and send firms packing.

The proposed 2025 Labor Peace Act overhaul, making it easier to require “closed shops” in Colorado, could jack up costs for employers running on fumes. The bill now on the table at the legislature to scrap the act would make Colorado join the ranks of the minority of states where one simple majority vote is all that's needed to force all employees in a workplace to fork over union dues, like it or not. The net effect, worried Colorado development recruiters point out, would be to scare off a lot of employers looking to locate in Colorado or expand their operations here. California, under a union chokehold, is the poster child; employers have been fleeing its closed shops for “right to work” states where unions cannot make nonmembers pay fees or dues. Colorado's 3.8% unemployment in late 2024 looked rosy. Expect it to rise if this bill becomes law.

Colorado's energy production provides a case study in control creep. Senate Bill 19-181, signed in 2019, flipped the Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation Commission from industry booster to eco-enforcer. Industry seats shrank from three to one, swapped for environmentalists. Local governments gained free rein to tighten drilling regulations that the state had long prohibited to protect property rights and the country's energy supply.

The oil and gas permitting process has become an engineered slog. Permits that took an average of 319 days in 2021 ballooned to 647 days by 2023. A per-barrel fee imposed in 2024 siphons cash for transit and wildlife. Colorado, the country's fourth-largest energy producer, harvests less than it did in 2019, costing the state high-wage jobs and tax revenues essential to funding schools and infrastructure.

In March, Colorado had the second-highest unemployment rate, 4.8%, falling far below Mississippi, West Virginia, and other states that traditionally struggle economically. That compares with 2017, when Colorado tied for the country's second-lowest unemployment rate at 2.7% before the left-wing, uni-party tsunami.

In 2017, Colorado's job-growth rate was the envy of the country at 2.4%, compared with the national rate of 1.5%. The state's most recent job-growth rate has fallen to 0.17%, compared to the national rate of 1.2%, landing Colorado 43rd in the country for job growth between March 2023 and March 2024, with neighboring Utah and Wyoming in the top 10 for job growth.

As with oil and gas producers, commercial real estate owners also feel the squeeze of excessive regulation. House Bill 1286 (2021) mandates that buildings over 50,000 square feet track energy and cut emissions by 7% by 2026 and 20% by 2030. Owners pay for retrofits, and the electrification mandates ban gas furnaces in buildings erected since 2024, with electric swaps due by 2027.

A 2024 rule tacks on gender-neutral restrooms and baby-diaper changing stations by 2026, raising construction costs even more. Polis pitches sustainability and fairness, but for business leaders, it is the importation of California-style regulatory excess they can choose to reject by moving operations next door to Utah or to any of the other less-regulated states surrounding Colorado.

Since 2019, Polis has backed policies such as House Bill 19-1124, tying the hands of state and local law enforcement when asked to cooperate with federal holds requested by Immigration and Customs Enforcement. By 2025, more than 40,000 unvetted immigrants had poured in, landing in a state with 5.8 million permanent residents. Most have no jobs, cash, or prospects for employment and long-term housing.

The economy creaks under the weight of what Denver Mayor Mike Johnston gleefully calls “new arrivals.” It is a view from the perch of an Ivy League politician who grew up in Vail, where the median home price hovers around $2 million. Before the immigrant invasion, housing was a pipe dream for the young, and now these taxpayers shell out big to care for immigrants. Denver dropped $36 million on shelters in 2023, based on city budget data. Culturally, it's a jolt, as schools strain under language gaps, and neighborhoods grapple with a new population of homeless people on top of scarcities in healthcare, social services, and housing that were problematic before the immigrant surge dramatically increased demand.

Illegal immigrant prison gangs, most notably the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua, have notoriously spread from Denver. They have taken over apartment complexes in Aurora, and several of their victims told a member of the Colorado Springs Gazette's editorial board that the problem is far worse and more widespread than the public has been told.

Similarly, California's open-door experiment tanked affordability and stretched resources. For a state with seven times fewer residents than the Golden State, 40,000-plus “new arrivals” are a wave too high for the public to surf. Polis might call it compassion, but it amounts to a bill the average Joe and Jane Six Pack can't afford.

Crime, especially violent crime, was for Coloradans a problem mostly found in distant coastal and Midwestern cities throughout the 1990s and early 2000s. People lived here to avoid crime.

Then, the left-wing cabal decriminalized every illicit drug, on the heels of voters enacting full legalization of marijuana, and indulged a “criminal justice reform” agenda that eased penalties for nearly every crime. The ideology said criminals need reform, but the result has been criminals flocking to Colorado, including Tren de Aragua gangsters, who made Colorado their North American headquarters.

The Common Sense Institute pegged Colorado's 2022 monthly crime rate at 530 offenses per 100,000 residents, up 7.3% from 2019 and 20% from 2008. Car thefts jumped 13.6% that year, hitting 40,000-plus and topping the nation. Violent crime is at 423 per 100,000 since 2018, above average, with homicides and assaults creeping up. Walking the streets of Denver alone at night — where one risks life and limb in Washington Park, on Capitol Hill, or in other traditionally safe neighborhoods — makes little more sense than walking the streets of south-central Los Angeles.

The Left's soft-on-crime policies culminated in national notoriety when U.S. News & World Report ranked Colorado the third-most dangerous state in 2024.

Most of Colorado's 1,927 public schools are faltering, California-style. Post-2020, Colorado Measures of Academic Success found math proficiency at 27.4% of the student population, down from 32.7%, and literacy at 43%, down from 44.5%.

The scores reveal a dilemma nearly identical to California's 2022 slump to 33% proficiency in math and 47% in English. Gaps for minorities, low-income children, and special education students widened after 2018 gains faded. More funding is the cry, but experience proves it doesn't buy results.

The state slid from the top 10 for legal in-migration for three decades to the bottom 10 by 2025, perhaps the result of high living costs, crime, and a one-size-fits-all, intolerant political climate incapable of interparty cooperation. Homelessness festers in Colorado's metropolitan areas, linked to housing woes and limp policies. Tents and shanties make Denver streets and parks look similar to those in San Francisco and Los Angeles.

In the wake of hard-drug decriminalization and full-scale cannabis legalization, fentanyl deaths soared 101.3% from 2019 to 2022. Illegal marijuana trafficking persists. A federal forest official years ago told the Colorado Springs Gazette's editorial board of large plantations hiding in some of Colorado's 11 national forests, complete with makeshift buildings and armed guards.

It turns out Latin American cartels prefer producing the drug in a state where illegal products meld right in with their licensed and legal counterparts. So much for the belief that legalizing marijuana would kill the black market.

Colorado's anything-goes drug orgy, with the second-highest teenage fentanyl overdose rate, has fueled a booming drug rehab sector that has elders liquidating retirement funds to pay the costs of saving their children and grandchildren from substance abuse.

The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration reported 413 substance abuse treatment facilities in Colorado in 2020, up from 382 in 2016. By 2022, its national directory listed 448 facilities, suggesting an uptick in corporations feeding on a growing addiction epidemic.

Though numbers tell the rehab story, for the public, it is palpable. Consider the Tri-Lakes region of mountain villages north of Colorado Springs. There, a former Ramada Inn hotel and two luxury mountain resorts have transitioned into rehab centers. The community's former bowling alley and family fun center houses a large cannabis grow operation and recreational marijuana store.

The California-to-Colorado pipeline has been flowing for years, with estimates showing tens of thousands of California transplants annually for the past three decades.

Though diminishing, the California influx brings Left Coast policies and more. Because of Colorado's relatively small population of 5.8 million, the demand created by deep-pocketed Californians contributes to housing prices rising so sharply that retirees struggle with property tax bills that rival old mortgage payments.

Politically, Californication has tilted Denver, Boulder, and Fort Collins leftward while eating away at the consistently conservative tendencies of Colorado Springs — the veritable Orange County of Colorado, mimicking shifting political trajectories in south Los Angeles suburbs and San Diego.

In a state with living costs and crime approaching levels endured in California, bringing up children becomes increasingly challenging for many and a near impossibility for the working class.

Birth rates signal the growing unease. Polis, a married parent of two children, frequently champions what he calls family-friendly legislation and insists the state could use more children. Yet, births in his state fell from 62,949 in 2021 to 61,494 in 2023, based on the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment and March of Dimes data.

Fertility has fallen as low as 50.2 in recent years for every 1,000 women aged 15 to 44, nearly a 25% fall since 2010, and the steepest decline nationwide. Fertility is at 1.48, which falls below the replacement rate. A slate of new laws, including a tweak to the state's Medicaid program, encourages and subsidizes terminations of unborn children. The Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment reports abortions increased from 8,873 in 2017 to 14,691 in 2023 (latest available) — a 65.5% increase.

The 2024 Colorado Political Climate Survey from CU-Boulder shows 33% approving of the state's economy, with a 52% buy-in from Democrats and 16% from Republicans. The gap resembles California's, in which wealthy tech executives and celebrities don't typically know or care about the struggles of those living on or below the state's $96,000 median household income.

Although Colorado's median household income mirrors California's, a recent study found that a household of four needs an income of $108,000 in 2025 just to scrape by. In Denver proper, the median household income is $94,157 — nearly $14,000 short of affording a modest family lifestyle.

Similar factors, throughout Colorado's metropolitan areas, render the state comfortably livable only for those with solid six-figure wages, high net worths, or what frustrated Boulder residents commonly refer to as “trust funders” or “trustafarians” — residents gifted with inherited wealth.

When my wife and I moved to her native Colorado from Washington, D.C., in 1993, the state was indisputably America's playground — a magnet for workers, young professionals starting families, and free spirits of all sociopolitical and cultural backgrounds. Today, not so much.

THE CALIFORNIACATION OF COLORADO 

Colorado's new economic strains, high crime rates, and the sanctuary misstep have tested its historic grit. High costs, red tape, and policy pivots since 2018 echo California's stumbles, hitting a smaller state harder and faster. Workers and families feel it as homes slip away, jobs dwindle, and sidewalks and other public spaces head toward blight.

Polis, a well-intentioned optimist, anticipates a brighter tomorrow. Yet, data portend a future that could make California look stable and equitable by comparison. Colorado is far from hopeless — the climate, awe-inspiring terrain, and entertainment amenities will outlive trends, and even humanity's existence — but the culture and economy tell a cautionary tale of a far-left, central planning agenda gone mad. As the Chili Peppers tell it, “Born and raised by those who praise control of population — it's Californication.”

Ron Chernow's biography dwells more on the wreck of a man than on his sublimely comic work.

In his last, most pathetic years, Mark Twain threw himself behind the crackpot theory that the true author of Shakespeare's plays may have been Francis Bacon. The penultimate book that Twain published in his lifetime, Is Shakespeare Dead? (1909), asked his readers to consider how few solid biographical details existed about Shakespeare the man, and how much critics had inferred from so little. They had built, Twain wrote, “an Eiffel Tower of artificialities rising sky-high from a very flat and very thin foundation of inconsequential facts.” The literary critic Northrop Frye, who dismissed the Bacon theory, nevertheless had a wry aside of his own about extrapolating too freely from scattered biographical details and the unflattering portrait that is the only surviving image of Shakespeare. “We know nothing about Shakespeare,” Frye wrote, “except a signature or two, a few addresses, a will, a baptismal register, and the picture of a man who is clearly an idiot.”

Ron Chernow's Mark Twain forces a similar conclusion about its subject: clearly an idiot, and a born sucker. This conclusion will shock anyone who knows Twain only through his writing, in which the author is wise and witty and, above all, devastating in his portrayal of frauds, cretins, and sententious bores. In life, Twain (1835–1910) was quite different. He was gullible, emotionally immature, and prone to shoveling money into obvious scams. Twain therefore presents a tantalizing challenge for literary biography: to explain how someone able to spot and depict frailties of conscience, character, and judgment in others could be so powerless to correct them in himself. Forced to choose, as Yeats wrote, “perfection of the life, or of the work,” Twain left the former a total shambles—and then for good measure was struck by a series of family tragedies that would have been unbearable even for a much less self-destructive man.

Twain bequeathed to history much more than “a signature or two.” In addition to a whole archive of notebooks, articles, and unpublished or unfinished manuscripts, he dictated half a million words of autobiography, and he appeared in public so often that even if he'd never written or dictated anything, many thousands of others could have supplied accounts of his existence. Chernow is the latest in a long line of biographers undaunted by this surplus of Twainiana (a line so long, in fact, that he is not even the only recent biographer named Ron).

Chernow is not a literary scholar—he is best known for his lives of American political, military, and business figures—which may explain his relative neglect of Twain's literary output (more than 30 books published in his lifetime, and thousands of additional pages to keep the printers busy more than a century later). The biography contains no new interpretations of Twain's novels, nor much to explain the splendid originality of his travel writing. Instead, Chernow devotes a hefty portion of his 1,039 pages (excluding notes) to Twain's personal tribulations, a depressing series of bungles and calamities starting in the author's middle age.

Twain's exposure to bad ideas had begun much earlier. His father, the lawyer and judge John Marshall Clemens, had sunk the family's money into land in Tennessee, and though the plan went nowhere, the impulse toward wild speculation seems to have imprinted on young Samuel Langhorne Clemens. Later Sam was, Chernow says, “blinded by greed,” and convinced beyond evidence and reason that his schemes would eventually succeed. In fact, the Clemens family, having settled in Hannibal, Missouri, grew poorer. Perhaps more important, Twain's childhood unfolded in a part of the country soon to be defeated and never to recover fully during his lifetime.

The four years of his early 20s that he spent as a steamboat captain on the Mississippi were nevertheless an idyll. “The older and more famous he became and the grander his horizons,” Chernow says, “the more he pined for the vanished paradise of his early years.” An occupational hazard of writing about Twain is that the subject always finds a way to preempt his biographer and say it better himself. Even if Twain cannot be bested, he can still be quoted, and Chernow does so liberally. On a brief return to the river in 1882, Twain wrote that he indulged in the “dream that the years had not slipped away; that there had been no war, no mining days, no literary adventures; that I was still a pilot, happy and care‑free as I had been twenty years before.”

Twain's journalism eventually brought him riches. Happiness was permanently elusive. The most remarkable aspect of his southern youth is how decisively he abandoned it, first at the age of 25, to go out West as a newspaperman in Nevada, and later to reside in New York, Connecticut, and Europe as an established writer. The Mark Twain closely associated with Hannibal rarely returned to it.

At 34, for love and money, Twain married into a wealthy abolitionist family and settled in Hartford. “I never saw any place where morality and huckleberries flourished as they do here,” he said. (According to Michael Patrick Hearn's magisterial annotated 2001 edition of Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, Twain never saw a huckleberry until he moved to Hartford. Huckleberries and morality are equally scarce there today.) His newlywed days, Chernow writes, were “the happiest period of his life.” With money, part of it his wife's, Twain began to live “like a mogul,” Chernow notes, “without the slightest trace of guilt.”

Twain's first big success, The Innocents Abroad (1869), was written while accompanying American pilgrims to Europe and the Holy Land. It is the seminal and unsurpassed work of American travel writing. The country had declared its political independence in 1776, and Ralph Waldo Emerson had declared its intellectual independence in 1837. The Innocents Abroad is written with a new curiosity and sass, unburdened by any lingering sense of inferiority to Europe. It is also, in its treatment of Twain's fellow passengers (“philistine killjoys,” Chernow calls them), freighted with the question of who these newly independent people are, and what—if not vassals of the Old World—they should be. The book sold better than anything else Twain wrote, and it established a steady revenue stream from the lecture circuit for the rest of his life.

Twain needed to leave a place in order to come back to it, and the greatest case of productive exile was Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (1884). It was written over seven years. The main value of learning about Twain's life during its composition is the discovery of just how estranged from his youth he had become. He wrote his memoir Life on the Mississippi (1883) during the same period, and the two books gestated together as fraternal twins. Twain had found that the romance of the river had dissipated, and could be summoned only in memory and dreams. In Huckleberry Finn, what appears to be romantic nostalgia is in fact the death of the romantic instinct and shedding of defunct fantasies. By the time he began writing the novel, Twain had given up on the South and transformed permanently from barefoot Missouri rascal into rich and famous New Englander. The glorious opening of Chapter 19, about the Mississippi passing by “so quiet and smooth and lovely,” is a poetic vision evoked only so that Twain can then evoke its loss: not passing by so much as passing away. The end of that illusion had left Twain spiritually homeless, just as it left Huck's conscience untethered, and the boy himself adrift with the fugitive slave Jim.

Chernow at times seems almost afraid of applying too much interpretation to Twain's writing—as if aware that literary criticism is not his sport, and that he is better off when recounting names, dates, locations, and events. He is, however, unsparing when Twain evades hard questions. Twain's transformation from southerner to northerner was never complete. He married a northerner and settled in the North. But Chernow shows that the extent of his former prejudice, as a product of the South, was greater than one might presume, given Twain's later eminence as an opponent of racism. Twain's early writing and private letters and diaries contain vile language and sentiments. “For all the progress Twain made in his racial awareness, he never achieved perfection,” Chernow writes. “Racial epithets could still pop up in his letters with dismaying frequency.”

From the April 2024 issue: A bloody retelling of Huckleberry Finn

During the Civil War, Twain saw brief, ineffectual combat in a Confederate militia. He atoned for this service by making grand gestures of solidarity with the Union he'd once fought. He became such a friend of the North that he was “the speaker of choice for many Union army reunions.” Chernow doesn't doubt the sincerity of Twain's conversion, but he sees where Twain's humor can be a form of deflection. When he wrote about his war record in “The Private History of a Campaign That Failed” (1885), he ridiculed himself and mocked war in general. But the self-deprecation avoided a full reckoning with the moral abomination of the Confederacy—about which he says nothing specific. Chernow calls this deflection “the sure sign of an unresolved conflict” in Twain, and deems the essay “unsatisfying because it is devoid of any political or ideological content.”

Twain grew up hankering for money, but the money arrived when he could take little satisfaction from it. He is the funniest writer America has ever produced, and Chernow has an awful task as a biographer, which is to portray him from midlife onward as a suffering wreck. “What any biography of Mark Twain demands is his inimitable voice,” he writes. The Twain of the printed page is irreverent and quotable, but the private Twain is petulant, self-pitying, narcissistic, and afflicted with tragedy and misery of his own making and of God's. Mark Twain is funny. Mark Twain is funny the way the Book of Job is funny.

If the life of William S. Burroughs is the sum of his addictions, and the life of Norman Mailer the sum of his quarrels, then the life of Mark Twain could be told by listing what Chernow calls his “lifelong fantasies of king‑size wealth and countless schemes to attain it.” These schemes nearly all tanked, and often ended in recrimination. Twain was “insanely litigious” in his efforts to seek recompense when he imagined himself wronged, as he often did, including in petty disputes with his own publishers. The late 19th century was a boom time for mad inventors, scam artists, and fast-talking salesmen. Twain was defenseless before the promises of these types.

His credulity led to misadventures the details of which are so picayune that Chernow's emphasis on them can be maddening. Only when one realizes how much time and energy Twain himself devoted to the boondoggles does the emphasis feel merited. Twain invented ridiculous devices that no one wanted (“a bed clamp that would prevent children from kicking off their blankets; a vest that would require no suspenders”). He created awful board games. “Mark Twain's Memory-Builder” was meant to help the player remember dates, using pegs in a cribbage-like board. “The forbidding‑looking board,” Chernow writes, “had all the allure of a railway schedule.” Chernow quotes such thrilling details as Twain's specifications for the proper depths of the peg holes (“about a quarter of an inch”). Twain's quest to get the peg depth right distracted him from the timely completion of Huckleberry Finn.

From the April 1897 issue: Mark Twain as an interpreter of American character

Twain's biggest blunder was an investment in the Paige Compositor, a typesetting machine that he thought would become the industry standard. Starting in 1880, he slowly blew his family's savings on it. He relentlessly hyped it to investors as “the most marvelous invention ever contrived by man,” and its creator, James W. Paige, as “the Shakespeare of mechanical invention.” His judgment about this mechanical Shakespeare was as impaired as his later judgment of the actual Shakespeare. The machine never worked—at one point it was declared functional, but on closer inspection it could not typeset a period at the end of a sentence—and this failure provoked constant stress. Twain and his loved ones became, Chernow writes, financial “captives of the monstrous machine.” Even upon realizing that one scheme had come to nothing, Twain would promptly embark on another. He begged Andrew Carnegie to invest in a drink called Plasmon—little more than reconstituted skim milk—and claimed that a pound of Plasmon powder “contains the nutriment of 16 pounds of the best beef.”

The world tour that became the basis for Twain's second-best travel book, Following the Equator (1897), was undertaken to settle debts due to the failure of the Paige Compositor investment. But mostly the financial hardship did not spur him to write more. Instead it drained his morale and delayed or diminished his work. It is as if Philip Roth cut back on writing novels during the 1990s to devote himself to selling SlimFast and creating an alternative to Microsoft Word. Twain knew that his schemes had become a problem. Everyone knew. Chernow quotes a Washington Post article suggesting that a sane investor should watch Twain, and do the opposite—but he was incorrigible. “I quite understand that I am confessing myself a fool,” he wrote, when recounting the Paige Compositor scheme. “But that is no matter, the reader would find it out anyway, as I go along.”

Reading this narrative, I cringed plenty but laughed out loud only once. In the early 1890s, Twain visited the scientific workshop of the Serbian eccentric Nikola Tesla. Tesla had built a platform that “shook with pleasing vibrations” and allegedly offered therapeutic effects as well as (he warned) occasional involuntary laxative ones. “After Twain had stood on the platform awhile, Tesla discreetly nudged him to dismount,” Chernow writes. Twain, having much too good a time, repeatedly declined, “then stiffened with sudden alarm.” If there is a more wonderful literary anecdote than Twain—let us imagine him wearing his trademark white serge suit—jiggling in a mad scientist's lab while soiling his pants, I have yet to read it.

Would that all life could be filled with such tomfoolery. Twain's final decades were his Job years, the opposite of quiet and smooth and lovely. Twain's wife, Olivia Langdon, bore him four children, only one of whom escaped a wretched end. Throughout their marriage, Olivia was intermittently bedridden, with a nervous illness that Chernow and other biographers suggest was psychosomatic. Twain's only son died of diphtheria at 18 months, and Twain unfairly blamed himself. (He had taken the boy on a carriage ride in cold weather.) His daughter Susy died at 24 of meningitis. Olivia died in 1904. Their daughter Jean suffered from chronic epileptic seizures, for which Twain tirelessly sought, and never found, effective treatment. In 1909, Jean was found dead in a cold bath at 29.

“He that hath wife and children hath given hostages to fortune,” Francis Bacon wrote, under his own name, with Twainian pith. These agonizing deaths were made, if anything, worse by Twain's fame and money problems. Olivia's family's wealth gave him not one but two fortunes to squander, and her family's religious conservatism made the possibility of bankruptcy a moral as well as fiscal event. In 1891, the family's accounts had so declined that they had to move out of their Hartford mansion. They spent more than a decade traveling in Europe, seeking cures for their illnesses and hoping for a reversal of luck that never came. In 1906, when dictating his autobiography and commenting on a friend's death, Twain said that life is “a tragedy; with a dash of comedy distributed through it, here and there, to heighten the pain and magnify it, by contrast.”

These final years are sometimes treated as a lost period, because Twain's writing grew bitter and cynical and unpalatable to those more interested in pleasing escapades. “Mark Twain had given the world laughter and now had gotten only misery in return,” Chernow writes. Twain has long been accused of giving Huck Finn an overly pat, comic ending. His later work does not suffer from this problem. Even A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (1889), which starts like an adolescent adventure, ends with its hero, Hank Morgan, broken and demoralized, and his family lost.

Yet the morbid final phase of Twain's writing, though always less popular (in part because much of it was unpublished during his life), is to my taste still sublime. Chernow follows the pattern of most biographers in giving this work less attention than the more chipper earlier books—which is a pity, because the later work also reflects the Twain best illuminated by Chernow's biography and its emphasis on Twain's most forlorn years.

“I have no special regard for Satan,” Chernow quotes Twain remarking, “but I can at least claim that I have no prejudice against him. It may even be that I lean a little his way, on account of his not having a fair show.” By then Twain had several reasons to believe that both his favor toward Satan and Olivia's favor toward God were unreciprocated. Nearly all the gifts showered upon them had morphed into curses: The wealth vanished, the children were struck dead, and the fame transformed into shame. After Susy died suddenly in 1896, Twain wrote an essay, quoted at length by Chernow, about the sick trickery of the Almighty. “He never does a kindness. When He seems to do one, it is a trap which He is setting,” Twain writes. “He gives you riches, merely as a trap; it is to quadruple the bitterness of the poverty which He has planned for you.”

From the August 1966 issue: Arthur Schlesinger Jr. on Mark Twain

This streak of anti-theodicy is the engine of Twain's posthumous novel, The Mysterious Stranger (1916). Twain had abandoned in manuscript several chilling tales, later stitched together by his official biographer, Albert Paine. Set hundreds of years ago in Austria, they involve encounters between children and a wandering figure who reveals himself, nonchalantly, as Satan. Satan is a lover of strangeness and coincidence—of exposing the happiness of humans as a prelude to their misery, and sometimes their misery as a prelude to happiness. With a shrug, he will grant wishes or cause misfortune. Those who meet him achieve an unwanted enlightenment about their place in the world.

Twain concludes one version of the story with the mortal narrator's recognition that the contradictions of existence are so “frankly and hysterically insane” that the world must be amiss. How “strange,” Satan tells the narrator, that he could believe in a God “who gave his angels painless lives, yet cursed his other children with biting miseries and maladies of mind and body”—and not see that the only world that could accommodate these discrepancies is “a grotesque and foolish dream.” Then Satan vanishes, abandoning the narrator in a measureless ocean of space and time. He “left me appalled,” the book ends, “for I knew, and realized, that all he had said was true.”

This exchange forms a disorienting end to a disorienting book—and indeed a disorienting life. Chernow claims that The Mysterious Stranger “ultimately sags beneath the weight of Twain's grievances, obsessions, and dogmatic opinions.” But Chernow's own book is evidence that Twain earned his grievances, obsessions, and dogmatic opinions. It is cruelly ironic that Twain, the foremost American dealer in irony, would himself be tortured by ironies: blessings that turn out to be curses, curses that turn out to be blessings; Cassandra-like ability to see stupidity in others, but failure to detect the same in himself.

Sam Altman's friendship goals for his infant son do not include AI.

The OpenAI CEO was asked Thursday while giving Senate testimony whether he'd want his child to form a best-friend bond with an AI bot.

""I do not,"" Altman replied.

The question, from Sen. Bernie Moreno, came during a broader discussion about how to shield children from harm in the AI era as people trust chatbots with more personal information.

""These AI systems will get to know you over the course of your life so well — that presents a new challenge and level of importance for how we think about privacy in the world of AI,"" said Altman, who became a father in February.

Altman said that people were already forming deeply personal relationships with artificial intelligence and essentially relying on it for emotional support.

""It's a newer thing in recent months, and I don't think it's all bad,"" he said. ""But I think we have to understand it and watch it very carefully.""

Altman said there should be greater flexibility for adults using AI tools, while children should have ""a much higher level of protection.""

But, as with other online services, it can be difficult to know a user's age.

""If we could draw a line, and if we knew for sure when a user was a child or an adult, we would allow adults to be much more permissive and we'd have tighter rules for children,"" Altman added.

He has previously spoken about what it means to raise a child in the AI era.

""My kid is never going to grow up being smarter than AI,"" he said during a January episode of the ""Re:Thinking"" podcast with Adam Grant. ""Children in the future will only know a world with AI in it.""

Last month, Altman said OpenAI was no longer his proudest achievement after his son, who was born prematurely, learned to eat on his own.

On Thursday, Altman said his son was ""doing well,"" adding that it's ""the most amazing thing ever.""

Mark Zuckerberg is the king of the quiet glow up — but his luxury watch collection reminds us that in fact, he's worth billions.

The 40-year-old Meta founder, who is estimated to be worth over $207 billion, has taken to flaunting his wealth via wrist candy in recent years.

From a flashy Rolex to a $900,000 Greubel Forsey creation, here's a look at some of his standout timepieces.

While attending Ambani's pre-wedding party in March 2024, Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla Chan, were seen admiring a Richard Mille watch worn by the Reliance Industries heir.

""You know, I never really wanted to get a watch, but after seeing that, I was like, watches are cool,"" Zuckerberg is heard saying in a video of the interaction.

While he clarified to Chan that he wasn't interested in buying the same watch, he said he'd consider similar options.

On September 1, 2024, Zuckerberg shared an Instagram photo of himself embracing his wife. In the image, his wrist was adorned with a large watch featuring a gold face and a brown strap.

Zuckerberg indulged watch fanatics who asked for details, sharing that the watch was a ""5236P,"" or a Grand Complications In-Line Perpetual Calendar watch from Patek Philippe.

The timepiece is crafted with a platinum case and an alligator-leather band. In terms of functionality, it displays the current day, date, and month. It also indicates leap years, moon phases, and whether it's day or nighttime.

It retails for $141,400, according to the brand's website.

Zuckerberg appeared at an ""Acquired"" podcast event on September 10, 2024. While onstage, he was photographed wearing another flashy watch: a DB25 Starry Varius from the Swiss watch brand De Bethune.

He seemed to be wearing its rose-gold model, which can cost over $80,000 from independent watch sellers. As watch specialist Bryan Li previously told Business Insider, only 20 of the watches are made annually.

Other variants — like one made from titanium and another encrusted with 273 diamonds — can cost between $75,000 and $127,000.

There's also the Aérolite version of the watch, which features a dial made from a meteorite and usually costs $260,000.

This De Bethune piece — and Zuckerberg's Patek Philippe watch — showed a significant shift in the Facebook founder's style, taking his outfits from basic to luxe almost overnight.

He was photographed wearing a chunky silver watch onstage at the 2024 Meta Connect conference. It appears to have been a variant of a watch from the Swiss brand F.P. Journe's Souveraine collection.

The specific one Zuckerberg wore featured a thick band and large black buttons on its side. Sotheby's listed what appears to be the same watch for auction in March, and said it was made entirely from aluminum.

The auction company also said the watch style was produced between 2011 and 2014. The piece was estimated to sell for between $30,000 and $54,000, though it's unclear what it actually sold for.

The same watch in a darker gray colorway is now available to purchase online for $135,000.

On January 8, Zuckerberg posted a video to announce the end of Meta's fact-checking partnerships in the US. In the clip, he's seen wearing a Greubel Forsey watch that retails for over $900,000.

According to the brand's website, the watch is assembled entirely by hand, and only two or three are crafted each year. It's made with white gold and contains 281 pieces.

Michel Nydegger, the CEO of Greubel Forsey, told Bloomberg at the time that Zuckerberg showed ""true appreciation for the most traditional approach to fine watchmaking"" by wearing the piece.

Zuckerberg posted a handful of photos and videos from the mixed martial arts event, which showed a thick gold watch on his wrist.

BI spoke with four watch experts at the time, who all said the timepiece was likely a yellow-gold Rolex Daytona Le Mans.

Though Rolex has never confirmed how many exist, collectors and sellers say the watch style is rare.

That's partially why it had a resale value of up to $300,000, as Ng Yong Shen, a vice president at the Dubai-based secondhand retailer Re-Loved Luxury, told BI.

In April, Zuckerberg appeared on The Colin and Samir Show wearing a white timepiece with a vibrant blue face.

Watch fanatics quickly pointed it out as the GA2100WS-7A from Casio's G-Shock line. Made from resin and mineral glass, the watch retails for $120.

So far, it's the least expensive watch Zuckerberg has worn in public.

 US Air Travel Safety:

Air traffic controllers guiding planes in and out of Newark Liberty International Airport briefly lost communications and radar displays early Friday morning, the second outage in as many weeks affecting the transportation hub.

The telecommunications breakdown at a Federal Aviation Administration facility in Philadelphia occurred at approximately 3:55 a.m. local time and lasted about 90 seconds, the FAA said in a statement. Controllers at the facility also lost radar and radio on April 28, leaving them unable to see or communicate with crews flying through some of the most congested airspace in the US.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg.com'}","business"

Carahsoft Technology headquarters in Reston, Virginia.

US prosecutors and regulators investigating a $32 million deal between CrowdStrike Holdings Inc. and a technology distributor are probing what senior company executives may have known about it and are examining other transactions made by the cybersecurity firm, according to two people familiar with the matter.

In recent months, investigators with the Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission have been probing the transaction between CrowdStrike and the distributor, Carahsoft Technology Corp., to supply cybersecurity software to the Internal Revenue Service. CrowdStrike has previously said that Carahsoft made on time payments for the order. However, the IRS never purchased or received the products. It remains unclear why the companies struck the deal without an IRS purchase, but Carahsoft previously said it stands by the transaction.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg.com'}","business"

Newark Mayor Ras Baraka was arrested Friday for allegedly trespassing inside a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention center in his city, New Jersey's interim top prosecutor said.

Baraka ""committed trespass and ignored multiple warnings"" from Department of Homeland Security officials who told him to leave the facility, alleged Alina Habba, the interim U.S. attorney for the District of New Jersey.

""He has willingly chosen to disregard the law. That will not stand in this state. He has been taken into custody,"" Habba, a former defense attorney for President Donald Trump, wrote on X.

""NO ONE IS ABOVE THE LAW,"" she added.

Baraka, 55, is a Democrat running for governor of New Jersey. Kabir Moss, a spokesman for Baraka's gubernatorial campaign, confirmed the arrest at the facility known as Delaney Hall, NBC News reported.

At least three U.S. House Democrats from New Jersey were also at the detention center on Friday, according to an X post from Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman.

Baraka's office and campaign did not immediately respond to CNBC's requests for comment.

Videos posted on X by News12NJ reporter Amanda Lee show a physical altercation between law enforcement officers and apparent protesters by a security gate at the facility.

Another video posted by Lee appears to show Baraka being led away with his hands cuffed behind his back.

A spokesperson for Watson Coleman told NBC that the three U.S. representatives ""were escorted in"" to Delaney Hall ""after a period of explaining the law to the officials at the site.""

The members of Congress said they were there to conduct oversight on the facility in light of reporting about other ICE centers, which have become political flashpoints amid Trump's aggressive deportation efforts.  

But Homeland Security spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin in a statement to NBC called the incident ""a bizarre political stunt"" by a group of protesters that included the elected officials.

The group ""stormed the gate and broke into the detention facility"" as a busload of detainees entered a security gate, McLaughlin said.

The protesters ""holed up in a guard shack, the first security check point,"" she said.

""Had these members requested a tour, we would have facilitated a tour of the facility. This is an evolving situation,"" she added.

Baraka's administration filed a lawsuit in late March to block the opening of the Newark immigrant detention facility, arguing that its operators failed to obtain the proper permits and violated city code.

Air traffic controllers who guide planes in and out of Newark Liberty International Airport lost radar and communication with aircraft before dawn on Friday in another 90-second outage, the Federal Aviation Administration said, hours after the Trump administration unveiled a plan to overhaul the aging technology that keeps U.S. airspace space safe.

The outage occurred at about 3:55 a.m. ET, the FAA said. There are far fewer aircraft flying overnight, so disruptions were minimal compared with a similar outage on the afternoon of April 28, which snarled air travel for days.

Several controllers took leave because of the stress of that April incident, the FAA said. That exacerbated low staffing levels at the Philadelphia facility, where controllers oversee planes at Newark, New Jersey, airport, forcing the FAA to slow the airport's traffic.

Like in the April incident, Friday's outage left controllers unable to communicate with aircraft and their radar screens dark.

On Thursday, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy unveiled plans to overhaul several aging facilities and modernize technology used by controllers, who oversee about 45,000 flights a day in the U.S.

Aviation-industry groups and labor unions applauded the proposal and said Thursday that Congress should approve at least $31 billion over the next three years for improvements. That includes $12.5 billion outlined in a House spending proposal last month, for air traffic control modernization and more hiring of controllers.

White House deputy chief of staff for policy Stephen Miller said Friday that the Trump administration is ""actively looking at"" suspending the writ of habeas corpus, which is the right to challenge the legality of a person's detention by the government.

Miller's comment came in response to a White House reporter who asked about President Donald Trump entertaining the idea of suspending the writ of habeas corpus to deal with the problem of illegal immigration into the United States. 

Asked when that might happen, Miller responded: ""The Constitution is clear, and that, of course, is the supreme law of the land, that the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus can be suspended in time of invasion.""

""So, I would say that's an option we're actively looking at,"" he said.

Miller said that Trump's decision on whether to suspend the writ of habeas corpus ""depends on whether the courts do the right thing or not.""

Miller implied that ""the right thing"" is for judges to stop blocking the administration's deportation of undocumented immigrants in cases where those people are exercising habeas writs.

The idea of habeas corpus was codified in the Magna Carta, signed by King John of England, in the early 13th Century.

""No man shall be arrested or imprisoned...except by the lawful judgment of his peers and by the law of the land,"" the provision said.

Miller's use of the word ""invasion"" reflects the Trump administration's argument that the U.S. faces an ""invasion"" of undocumented migrants. 

The administration likewise has claimed that there is a national emergency from the influx of the deadly opioid fentanyl into the U.S. that justifies the imposition of high tariffs on China, Canada and Mexico without prior authorization by Congress.

A number of pending civil cases challenging the Trump administration's deportation of undocumented immigrants in the United States are based on habeas claims.

In one such case, a Georgetown University scholar, Dr. Badar Khan, is challenging the constitutionality of his arrest and detention.

The Trump administration has chafed at orders by judges blocking efforts to summarily deport immigrants, including alleged gang members.

Miller said that Congress had stripped federal courts of jurisdiction over immigration cases with the Immigration and Nationality Act.

""The courts aren't just at war with the executive branch, the courts are at war, these radical rogue judges, with the legislative branch as well,"" Miller said.

""So all of that will inform the choices the president ultimately makes.""

Another major player has entered the quantum-computing race: Amazon. 

The tech giant is the latest to make waves in the field with the February announcement of Ocelot, its own quantum chip. Amazon joins fierce competition from familiar rivals in cloud computing as Google, Microsoft and others race after what they say could be their next frontier. 

While Amazon is widely known as an e-commerce giant, its business took a pivotal and profitable turn in 2006 with the launch of Amazon Web Services. AWS is now a more than $100 billion business and a key part of why Amazon is worth over $2 trillion. The company sees quantum as the next major growth area for its cloud services.

""There's a … strong business case for AWS or Amazon to get involved with quantum computing,"" Oskar Painter, director of quantum hardware for Amazon Web Services, told CNBC. ""Quantum computing is very much in line with that sort of business model where you would have off-premise quantum computing resources that can be made accessible through the cloud."" 

Part of the hype with quantum computing is the perceived payoff down the line. While still years away from commercial applications, McKinsey projects quantum could be a $173 billion market by 2040. 

""The opportunity to build just a supercharged part of AWS that can crack incredibly difficult problems, whether it's related to drug discovery or cybersecurity … that is an opportunity for them to charge a lot more,"" said Gene Munster, managing partner at Deepwater Asset Management.

CNBC's Kate Rooney got an exclusive look inside the AWS Center for Quantum Computing located at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, California. Founded in 2019, Amazon's partnership with the university is starting to yield results, as it showcased the Ocelot quantum processor. Amazon says the chip, which it designed and fabricated in-house, uses a scalable architecture that reduces error correction by up to 90 percent. That's a key obstacle in developing these machines. Google's Willow chip, which was unveiled in December, also demonstrated improvements in this area.

Ocelot uses ""cat qubits,"" named after the Schrödinger's cat thought experiment. The company says the design intrinsically suppresses certain forms of errors, reducing the resources required for quantum error correction.

""The heart of these quantum computing systems … it's really this quantum processor"" Painter said. ""The details of how that happens is really what differentiates one hardware platform from another – and really is where the secret sauce is and where all the intellectual property is.""

Munster said quantum-computing should be thought of as a new vertical within the AWS cloud business. 

""In the end, it will probably be solved and monetized through one of these big cloud platforms,"" Munster said. ""And AWS has a great shot at being successful there.""

Watch the video as Kate Rooney goes behind-the-scenes at Amazon and learns how the company is taking on Google and Microsoft in the quantum computing race.

The U.S. Postal Service Board of Governors said Friday that it had selected former Waste Management CEO David Steiner as postmaster general.

Steiner, who is a board member of shipping giant FedEx, will succeed former Postmaster General Louis DeJoy, who resigned in March, and current acting Postmaster General Doug Tulino.

Steiner, who is expected to formally join the USPS in July, will leave the board of FedEx, where he has served some 2009.

USPS reported a net loss of $9.5 billion in 2024

In a statement, Steiner said, ""It is an incredible honor to be asked to lead the world's greatest postal organization, with a history that stretches back before the founding of the United States.""

""I deeply admire the public service and business mission of this amazing institution, and I believe strongly in maintaining its role as an independent establishment of the executive branch.

Steiner served as CEO of Waste Management from 2004 through late 2016.

USPS said that when he led Waste Management, Steiner was ""credited with leading tremendous change in the organization, transforming operations and culture, and delivering strong financial results.""

Have you ever been in a work meeting or social gathering where one person just won't stop talking? It's really frustrating, especially when you have something to say.

As a global communication expert, I work with a lot of smart, polite people who feel like it's rude to interrupt. However, in my book, ""Smart, Not Loud: How to Get Noticed at Work for All the Right Reasons,"" I talk about how important it is for you to speak up, especially if you have something important to add to the conversation. 

Here are three things you need to do:

The first step is to not think of interrupting as a bad thing. Instead, you're part of the conversation and your thoughts are just as valued as everyone else's.

Now, with the right mindset, how do you actually get a word in? 

When you find that opportune time to chime in, the first thing you'll want to say is the person's name. Research shows our brain lights up when we hear our name being called. It signals to us the flow of the conversation has changed, and we intuitively pause to see what's going on. 

So say the person's name firmly and politely. This combination showcases both confidence and presence without coming across as confrontational. 

Next, reroute the conversation to what you want to talk about. Be strategic by showing that you're collaborative and trying to expand on their thoughts. People love to feel like their ideas were acknowledged and it also creates a seamless conversational flow.

For example, you might say: 

When someone feels listened to and heard, they're more likely to back down and make way for others to speak. Now, you can drive the conversation to what you really want to talk about. 

If you're not sure exactly how to phrase your interjection, try this sentence — whether you're in a work brainstorm or a book club meeting: 

""[Person's name], can I jump in real quick here? I'd love to open up the conversation…""

For example: 

Let's say you've used this simple strategy to firmly and politely interrupt a person dominating the conversation. But this person just won't back down. What do you do? 

Being direct is key. If someone keeps going, it's okay to assert yourself even more firmly and call out exactly what you're doing. It's also powerful to pose it as a question. 

You might say:

At the end of the day, you want to create a respectful environment where everybody feels like they have a chance to talk. Speaking up doesn't have to be loud or combative. It just has to be intentional. 

If you feel like someone is dominating the conversation and making it difficult for anyone else to get a word in, chances are other people feel the same. With this approach, you can speak up tactfully and politely, but firmly. And I guarantee others will appreciate you for doing it.

Oops, something went wrong

(Bloomberg) -- The culture clash between Bitcoin enthusiasts and gold bugs is about to be played out in the world of exchange-traded funds.

What's Behind the Rise in Serious Injuries on New York City's Streets?

Tidal Financial Group this week filed to launch a pair of long-short trades — pitting the world's biggest cryptocurrency against the shiny metal, and vice versa — offering investors a high-conviction bet on the best alternative hedge, in one fell swoop.

Packaged under the Battleshares brand, the novel exchange-traded funds would monetize the long-running debate about the ultimate store of value for those fearing everything from trade wars and geopolitical stresses to fiscal and monetary largesse. The ideological divide among the retail and institutional masses has raged since Bitcoin was born from the ashes of the 2008 crisis, and it comes just as both assets have surged over the past year on starkly different narratives.

The ETFs would, if launched, use a number of different tools to do so, including short sales of securities, swaps and options, according to paperwork submitted to the US Securities and Exchange Commission.

Battleshares declined to comment.

“This is a kind of ‘victory' for me,” said Dhaval Joshi, chief strategist at Counterpoint, who has long argued Bitcoin and gold belong to the same “non-confiscatable” asset class — immune to inflation, capital controls, or seizure. “Bitcoin will gradually grab market share from gold. So long BTC/short gold should trend higher over time, while short BTC/long gold will trend lower.”

Still, the zero-sum proposition has critics.

“It feels gimmicky and unnecessary,” said Brent Donnelly, president of Spectra FX Solutions. “Most people bullish on Bitcoin are also bullish on gold. These ETFs just add friction to a trade investors could already make by pairing low-cost ETFs like IBIT and GLD,” referring to BlackRock Inc.'s spot Bitcoin ETF and State Street Corp.'s gold fund — both of which have extremely low fees.

This year, gold has notched successive records on haven demand as the trade war stoked fears over the safety of US assets, while Bitcoin plunged in the tariff-spurred turmoil in early April in sympathy with risky stocks. Now, as the White House seeks to ink trade agreements, Bitcoin has roared back in an era in which the US government is going all-in on digital finance.

“Bitcoin continues to trade as a risky asset, tracking Nasdaq very closely with a few exceptions,” said Donnelly. “Gold is more of a ‘Sell America' proxy these days.”

Regardless of the diverse storylines anchoring both assets, gold and crypto have been touted by wealth managers as diversifying assets that offer insurance against the risk of currency debasement and related cracks in the traditional financial order. These are grand claims and FOMO may be more to do with it. Investors have poured more than $14 billion into four major gold ETFs this year alone and $8 billion has been added to the four top Bitcoin ETFs.

Risk Appetite Endures

Battleshares, the upstart product manager, has been seeking to seize on the next evolution of pair trading. Thus far, it's only product is Battleshares TSLA vs F ETF (ticker ELON), a long position on Elon Musk's Tesla Inc. paired with a short position on Ford Motor Co., according to its website. Launched in February with a 1.29% expense ratio, the fund has barely nabbed $1 million in assets. The firm has since filed for a slew of such ETFs that seek to employ long-short bets including Coinbase Global Inc. versus Wells Fargo & Co. and Eli Lilly & Co. against Taco Bell-owner Yum! Brands Inc., among others. Battleshares isn't the first to test pair-trading strategies.

Increasingly, smaller firms and mainstream Wall Street issuers alike have flooded the market with typically higher-fee ETFs offering souped up securities and derivatives products this year with differing leverage and return profiles. Derivatives-based ETFs, a fast-expanding category that includes single-stock funds that offer juiced up or inverse returns on one company, have boomed since 2019 when US regulators eased constraints for launching new funds. Many of these are popular among the retail-trading crowd whose appetite for risk pushes them to the riskiest corners of the market on the promise of big payouts on volatile moves.

Still, risk appetite remains as markets staged a gravity-defying rebound last month. And this week, Bitcoin topped $100,000 on Thursday as gold declined following the Federal Reserve's decision to keep rates steady.

The tussle between the two may very well continue but to Charlie Morris of Bytetree Asset Management, Bitcoin should beat gold and take away the latter's market share long term.

“I believe Bitcoin and gold both benefit from this era of macroeconomic uncertainty, but at different times,” said the chief investment officer, whose firm runs BOLD, an exchange-traded product that allocates both to gold and Bitcoin. “Gold tends to do better when there is geopolitical uncertainty, and Bitcoin when things are going well.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=bitcoin","Institutional investors continue to scoop up Bitcoin above $100K","https://cointelegraph.com/news/institutional-investors-continue-to-scoop-up-bitcoin-above-100-k","Fri, 09 May 2025 14:09:15 GMT","

 Bitcoin surged past $100,000 on May 8 as institutional investors ramped up ETF inflows, with ARK 21Shares, Fidelity and BlackRock leading the charge. 

Bitcoin crossed the $100,000 mark again on May 8 as institutional investors continue stacking sats.

Farside Investors' data shows that spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) recorded cumulative net inflows of $142.3 million on May 7, in a sign of “sustained institutional interest,” according to the founder of Obchakevich Research, Alex Obchakevich.

“These inflows indicate the activity of institutional investors, including hedge funds and asset managers, who continue to accumulate BTC through regulated instruments,“ he said.

The ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB) led with $54 million in inflows, followed by Fidelity's Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) at $39 million and BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) at $37 million. Data from Arkham Intelligence shows BlackRock acquired more than 86 Bitcoin worth $8.4 million in a single transaction on May 7.

On May 8, Bitcoin ETFs saw over $117 million worth of inflows, this time led by IBIT with $69 million, followed by FBTC with $35 million and ARKB with $13 million. Obchakevich also pointed to the strengthening correlation between Bitcoin and tech stocks. “BTC correlation with the Nasdaq was 0.75, indicating the influence of sentiment in the tech market,” he said, adding:

Obchakevich said the positive trend goes as far back as May 2, when IBIT inflows were as high as $675 million. He said that a continuation of this trend was the most likely outcome:

Obchakevich explained that “the absence of significant outflows in key ETFs other than Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) supports the hypothesis that the whales and funds remain bullish.” GBTC outflows, he said, are justified by different factors.

Obchakevich said GBTC outflows “are of particular importance because it is the largest Bitcoin ETF, and its high fees ~1.5% are driving investors to switch to cheaper alternatives, which affects the price of Bitcoin and market dynamics.” According to the analyst, GBTC outflows are caused by “a combination of factors starting with tariffs, the political crisis, and the conflict between Pakistan and India.” He added:

Ethereum surged by 28.9% from $1,939 to over $2,400 Friday morning, on the heels of the Pectra upgrade—which core developers called the “most ambitious upgrade” the network has ever implemented.

The second-largest cryptocurrency is currently trading at $2,339, up 20.4% on the day, per data from CoinGecko.

On Wednesday, Ethereum successfully rolled out its Pectra upgrade. This was the third significant upgrade since The Merge in 2022, in which the network moved from the proof-of-work consensus mechanism to proof-of-stake.

Pectra aims to improve the network's user experience, scalability, and staking flexibility. This is being done by enabling account abstraction, tweaking data storage requirements, as well as increasing validator staking limits and allowing them more flexibility when withdrawing.

In the three months leading up to the Pectra upgrade, Ethereum had fallen 33.3% from $2,727 to $1,818 amid broader macro economic pressures with U.S. President Donald Trump's trade war and heightened geopolitical tensions.

However, following Trump's signing of a trade deal with UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer on Thursday, the market started to rise, with Bitcoin quickly reclaiming $100,000. Soon after, Ethereum also reclaimed its $2,000 milestone, before rocketing to $2,400 on Friday for the first time since early March.

UK Treasury minister Darren Jones called the deal a “huge relief,” with the markets possibly taking it as a sign that global trade war tensions may be starting to ease.

Despite Ethereum's rise in value, according to CoinGlass, Ethereum U.S. spot ETFs have seen three successive days of outflows, with the last day of positive inflows being a week ago.

The wider crypto market is up 3.5% to a total market cap of $3.37 trillion, according to CoinGecko data. The biggest winners out of the top 100 tokens by market capitalization are all Ethereum-based projects. Legacy meme coin Pepe (PEPE) has taken the top spot after rising 43.3% over the past 24 hours, followed by AI agent launcher Virtuals (VIRTUAL), up 24.3%, and decentralized exchange Uniswap (UNI), up 21.5% on the day.

 The Ethereum Foundation distributed $32.6 million in Q1 2025 grants to support education, ZK tech developer tools and the wider blockchain ecosystem. 

The Ethereum Foundation, the nonprofit that supports development across the Ethereum blockchain, distributed $32.6 million in grants in the first quarter of 2025. 

In an allocation update, the organization reported spending on various initiatives through its Ecosystem Support Program (ESP). 

Categories included community and educational grants, zero-knowledge and cryptography. Other allocations included execution layers, developer experience and tools, layer-2 networks and overall ecosystem growth and support. 

Of the 101 grants awarded, 32 went to community and education-focused initiatives. Recipients included educational content creators, conference organizers, bootcamps and hackathons such as ETHPrague and ETHiopia.  

Sixteen projects focused on improving the developer experience and tooling. Beneficiaries included projects focusing on creating software-development kits (SDKs), building analytics platforms and validator tooling. 

Several projects addressed Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) accessibility, ecosystem tools and language support libraries. 

In addition, 14 grants were awarded to projects in the cryptography and zero-knowledge proofs (ZK-proofs) category. These projects focused on developing cryptographic techniques, building ZK-proof technology and researching security and post-quantum cryptography. 

Meanwhile, seven grant beneficiaries are focused on execution layer projects, while another seven are focused on the consensus layer. Nine grant beneficiaries were focused on protocol, general growth and support. 

An additional 13 grants fell under an “other” category, encompassing areas including decentralized finance, DApps, stablecoin infrastructure and business development.

On May 7, Ethereum's much-anticipated Pectra upgrade went live. The update went live on the mainnet at about 10:00 am UTC, starting on epoch 364032. The upgrade included three EIPs, which are EIP-7702, EIP-7251 and EIP-7691. 

The upgrade focuses on improving layer-2 scaling data storage, validator user experience improvements and smart account wallet user experience features. 

Since the upgrade, Ether (ETH) prices have recovered from a slump, reaching a 30-day high of $2,400 on May 9. At the time of writing, the crypto asset traded at $2,345.

This is a daily technical analysis by CoinDesk analyst and Chartered Market Technician Omkar Godbole.

About two weeks ago, I discussed bitcoin's (BTC) bullish breakout above a technical resistance called the Ichimoku cloud and potential for a rally to $100,000. This week, the cryptocurrency obligingly surged into six figures.

Now, top alternative cryptocurrencies such as memecoin DOGE, payments-focused XRP, the Ethereum blockchain's ether (ETH) and Solana's SOL have also crossed above the cloud, flashing bullish signals.

The analysis, developed by a Japanese journalist in the 1960s, is used to identify support and resistance, momentum and trend change in price actions. The indicator comprises five lines: Leading Span A, Leading Span B, Conversion Line or Tenkan-Sen (T), Base Line or Kijun-Sen (K), and a lagging closing price line.

The gap between the first two lines makes the cloud. Crossovers above and below the Ichimoku cloud are taken to represent bullish and bearish shifts in momentum.

The chart shows XRP and DOGE moving above their respective Ichimoku clouds, signaling more gains.

In XRP's case, the breakout shifts focus to resistance at around 30 cents, characterized by the trendline falling from February highs. DOGE is trading close to its bear market trendline, which, if topped, would expose resistance at $3.02, the lower high created on March 2.

In ETH's case, the breakout has opened the doors to the 200-day simple moving average (SMA) at $2,700. Meanwhile, SOL may encounter resistance at $218, the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement of the January to April sell-off.

The moves brings the first Web3 game from a major publisher to Sony's fledgling Soneium blockchain. Sony said that game studios and entertainment giants are choosing Soneium as a channel to collaborate, distribute, and connect with a new generation of builders. As more IP-driven titles enter the ecosystem, they're not just launching onchain, they're choosing a place where cross-game collaboration, interoperability, and creative ownership are part of the foundation, Sony said.

But it's not clear how much Symbiogenesis will be expanded with new content, as the content hasn't proven that popular so far. Sony is also connecting the game with others, offering rewards and status to players who complete the Symbiogenesis experience. Those who complete it will be greenlit to participate in the Evermoon and Sleepagotchi games that are also on Soneium. 

This initiative begins in the expansive world of Symbiogenesis, the blockchain-based narrative game from Square Enix. 

Sony called Symbiogenesis the flagship Web3 entertainment project, blending interactive storytelling, non-fungible token (NFT) ownership, and game progression into a single immersive experience. Gamers can collect unique character NFTs, unlock episodes, and shape the game's story. But so far, only hundreds of fans have collected the NFTs.

This initiative involving the three distinct gaming worlds offers players a shared quest, collectible rewards, and a new way to engage through blockchain gaming on Soneium.

Now, players who complete a limited-time quest in Symbiogenesis will receive a commemorative NFT collectible on Soneium, which opens the door to additional in-game benefits in Evermoon and Sleepagotchi. 

Symbiogenesis has a sprawling narrative told through 10,000 character NFTs, six chapters, and over 1.1 million words of interactive storytelling. Every NFT unlocks new story content and choices that shape the game world. The chapters one to four of this season's quest is the key to entering the crossover.

The onchain MOBA, Evermoon, leads onchain interactive entertainment with fast-paced 5v5 battles, interoperable NFTs, and DeFi rewards—built on Soneium. The Evermoon x Symbiogenesis collection introduces limited-edition digital stickers with perks like profile customization and rewards for gamers.

Sleepagotchi LITE launches a hit mini-app on LINE in collaboration with Soneium, after topping charts on Telegram with over a million users in its first month. It rewards daily engagement through light gameplay—and in this initiative, players can unlock the Epic Rarity One-Horned Dragon, exclusive to Symbiogenesis quest participants.

On Soneium, everyone is a creator. This initiative captures the spirit of collaboration that defines the ecosystem. Symbiogenesis brings IP and story. Evermoon brings competitive depth. Sleepagotchi brings daily habit loops and mobile-native simplicity. Soneium brings the infrastructure to make these experiences interoperable, onchain, and meaningful.

Square Enix is the example of top game publishers choosing Soneium to build a new kind of entertainment layer of the internet, where characters, rewards, and narratives travel across games, communities, and apps.

 Cybersecurity researcher ZachXBT said they identified the wallet linked to the scam. 

Law enforcement detained the wrong person for a 2022 scam that pilfered more than $1 million worth of Bored Ape non-fungible tokens (NFTs), cybersecurity researcher ZachXBT said. 

In a May 9 X post, ZachXBT said he identified the wallet behind the scam and linked it to an X account that has since been deleted. 

But in 2023, law enforcement detained Sam Curry, a former Yuga Labs security researcher, at an airport as a suspect in the incident, ZachXBT said. Yuga Labs is the company behind the Bored Ape Yacht Club NFT collection. 

“It's unfortunate to see how a security researcher was detained when stronger leads on a threat actor potentially responsible exist,” ZachXBT said.

In December 2022, an anonymous attacker stole 14 Bored Ape Yacht Club NFTs, which at the time traded for roughly $86,000 each, according to data from CoinSlam.

Law enforcement then “mistakenly reviewed logs from OpenSea which included [Curry's] home IP address and used this to incorrectly link him as the suspect,” ZachXBT wrote.

“In reality as part of his security work at Yuga, [Curry] had been investigating the theft and used a private key put in the JavaScript of the website by the threat actor,” ZachXBT said. 

ZachXBT said he used forensic tracing — including reconstructing the flow of funds through Tornado, an Ethereum mixer — to identify a person he alleges is a likely suspect in the 2022 theft.

He said law enforcement officials should “request all data related to [the individual's] social media accounts” and dig into on-chain transactions associated with their alleged wallet. 

Launched in 2021, Bored Ape Yacht Club is among the most valuable NFT collections, with a cumulative market capitalization of more than $300 million, according to data from CoinGecko.  

As of May 9, Bored Ape NFTs trade for roughly $30,000 each, according to NFT marketplace OpenSea. Individual NFTs vary in price due to unique characteristics.

The president's side hustle is proving to be very, very lucrative.

Early Monday morning, the leader of the free world had a message to convey. Not about the economic turmoil from tariffs, any one of the skirmishes playing out abroad, or a surprise shake-up in his White House staff. Instead, President Donald Trump turned to Truth Social to post about something called the “$TRUMP GALA DINNER,” with a link to gettrumpmemes.com.



A visit to the website paints a slightly fuller picture: Buy as many tokens as you can of Trump's personal cryptocurrency, $TRUMP, and you could be invited to a private event later this month at the Trump National Golf Club outside Washington, D.C. There, you will get the unique opportunity to meet with the president and “learn about the future of Crypto.” The gala looks very much like a thinly veiled gambit to pump up the price of $TRUMP, a so-called memecoin that is mostly owned by Trump-backed entities. Funnel the greatest amount of money to the president of the United States, and you could win some face time with the big man himself.



In 2021, Trump called bitcoin a “scam.” Now he seems to understand exactly what crypto can do for him personally: namely, make Trump and his family very, very rich. The $TRUMP gala is one part of a constellation of Trump-affiliated crypto efforts that includes Trump Digital Trading Card NFTs, a crypto company called World Liberty Financial, and a bitcoin-mining firm. According to an analysis by Bloomberg, the Trump family has already banked nearly $1 billion from these projects. Long before he descended the golden escalator at Trump Tower a decade ago, Trump's public image was rooted in his business prowess. But compared with his real-estate projects or The Apprentice, crypto is already turning into his most successful venture yet.

Read: The crypto world is already mad at Trump

Trump perhaps wouldn't be president at all if it wasn't for crypto. During the 2024 campaign, the industry was among his campaign's biggest donors. That money flowed in from both crypto corporations and individual donors, such as the bitcoin billionaires Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss. (The identical twins gave $1 million each in bitcoin to the Trump campaign, but had to be refunded because they exceeded the legal donation limit.) In exchange, Trump promised the imperiled industry a fresh start after four years of a Biden-sanctioned crypto crackdown. Last summer, as the keynote speaker at the annual bitcoin conference, Trump promised that if elected, he would make America the “crypto capital of the planet.” The crypto industry is now getting its money's worth. Consider the crypto firm Ripple, which spent four years squaring off against Biden's regulators in federal courtrooms and donated $4.9 million to Trump's inauguration fund. Yesterday, the new administration dropped the government's case, as the White House has effectively stopped enforcing crypto rules.



Trump is still tapping crypto magnates for money. On Monday, he attended a super PAC's “Crypto & AI Innovators” fundraiser, for which donors shelled out $1.5 million to get in the door. But for Trump, crypto has quickly become about more than soliciting campaign donations and rewarding supporters. In September, Trump announced the launch of World Liberty Financial, a decentralized-finance company to be managed by his sons Eric and Don Jr. and a couple of young entrepreneurs. (One previously ran a company called Date Hotter Girls, while the other is the son of Steve Witkoff, a longtime Trump ally serving as special envoy to the Middle East.) Then, in January, just before Inauguration Day, he launched $TRUMP. Like all memecoins, it has no underlying business fundamentals or links to real-world assets—the point is to just quickly capitalize on a viral trend, conjuring value out of practically nothing. This proved extremely lucrative almost immediately: $TRUMP initially spiked in value before crashing back down, at one point accounting for almost 90 percent of the president's net worth. (There's also an official $MELANIA coin, if that's more your thing.)



With crypto, Trump has found an unnervingly effective way to transmute the clout and power of the nation's highest office into cold, hard cash. Last week, World Liberty Financial announced that its cryptocurrency, USD1, would facilitate an Abu Dhabi investment firm's $2 billion stake in the crypto exchange Binance. Eric and Don Jr. are also on the crypto press circuit, with plans to speak at the 2025 bitcoin conference later this month. Some of Trump's decisions as president, such as creating a “Strategic Bitcoin Reserve,” may also function to inflate his crypto riches, in the sense that a rising tide lifts all boats; promoting crypto as part of the national interest can only support the idea that these coins are worth buying into.

Read: Trump's crypto reserve is really happening

Crypto is a conduit for the self-interest that has defined Trump's entire political career—an M.O. that has consistently blurred the boundary between public and private, country and party. For the most part, Trump has been especially good to those who line his pockets, rewarding them with all kinds of preferential treatment.



During his first term, Trump enriched himself the old-fashioned way—by way of merchandising deals and real-estate investments across the globe. But with crypto, all of that has ratcheted up in Trump's second term. In crypto, money is fast, loose, and digitally native—properties that have made his personal dealings in the industry even more galling, and potentially more vulnerable to outside sway. Someone looking to gain access to Trump might have once had to pay thousands of dollars a night for a room at Mar-a-Lago for a chance encounter with the president on the golf course. Now the door is open for influence from almost anyone in the world with an internet connection.



The White House insists that there is nothing to see here. “His assets are in a trust managed by his children, and there are no conflicts of interest,” Deputy Press Secretary Anna Kelly said in an emailed statement. Keeping that wealth in a trust may do very little to sever the connection between Trump and his riches, though, depending on the exact conditions of the arrangement. Even when Eric and Don Jr. serve as a buffer, the money stays in the family.



Crypto's anonymous nature poses unique challenges in understanding exactly what is happening—transactions on a blockchain are typically posted using long strings of numbers known as addresses, rather than verified by legal name. By all accounts, to interact with $TRUMP is to funnel money directly into the president's pockets, but the campaign-finance laws that caused the Winklevosses' exorbitant donations to be refunded don't apply here. Nothing is stopping, say, agents of foreign powers, or tech billionaires looking for favorable tariff treatment, from using $TRUMP to gain access to the highest echelons of government. Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle are starting to get it: Yesterday, three GOP senators joined Democrats to block a major crypto bill that would serve to benefit World Liberty Financial.



Ironically, Trump's embrace of crypto is pumping money into the industry while simultaneously damaging it. Since the fall of Sam Bankman-Fried in 2022, the image of crypto as a haven for scams and hackers has loomed large. At a moment when the crypto industry is trying to claw its way back to respectability and legitimization, Trump has taken every opportunity to cement it in the minds of the Americans as nothing more than a vehicle for channeling money directly to him. In crypto, “there are many people who have ethics, and have been working for years to build the system because they believe what they are doing is in the public interest,” Angela Walch, a crypto expert and former law professor, told me. “And what this does is it makes all the messaging that has come from extreme crypto critics about, ‘It's only a tool for grift,' and makes it look like that.”



By hitching their wagon to Trump, the industry's leaders have unleashed a force they can't control. The moment the president cashed in on crypto, the calculus shifted. Like the hot dogs at Costco, “being the president” is the loss leader; crypto pays the bills.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","cryptocurrency"

Benzinga Rankings give you vital metrics on any stock – anytime.

Shares of Next Technology Holding Inc NXTT surged by 706% to $2.50 on Friday afternoon, driven by an extremely large spike in trading volume over the company's Bitcoin BTC/USD assets.

Friday's session volume exploded to 152.165 million shares, dwarfing the 100-day average volume of just 524,333 shares.

What To Know: Fueling the rally was the company's latest disclosure revealing it held approximately 5,833 Bitcoins as of March 31, 2025, with a carrying value of $481.7 million, up from just 833 Bitcoins at the end of 2024. This increase was largely tied to a major crypto acquisition executed in March, which was financed through stock issuance and warrants.

Next Technology, which has dual business focuses in software development and Bitcoin investment, also reported $193.4 million in net income for the first-quarter—almost entirely from unrealized gains on digital assets. 

With seemingly little traditional revenue and limited cash on hand, the company's stock price Friday appears to be riding the momentum of its crypto-centric strategy.

By now you're likely curious about how to participate in the market for Next Technology Holding – be it to purchase shares, or even attempt to bet against the company.

Buying shares is typically done through a brokerage account. You can find a list of possible trading platforms here. Many will allow you to buy “fractional shares,” which allows you to own portions of stock without buying an entire share.

If you're looking to bet against a company, the process is more complex. You'll need access to an options trading platform, or a broker who will allow you to “go short” a share of stock by lending you the shares to sell. The process of shorting a stock can be found at this resource.  Otherwise, if your broker allows you to trade options, you can either buy a put option, or sell a call option at a strike price above where shares are currently trading – either way it allows you to profit off of the share price decline.

According to data from Benzinga Pro, NXTT has a 52-week high of $6.00 and a 52-week low of $0.22.

We've Only Seen 0.001 Percent of Earth's Seafloor. Here's What That Really Means

A new review of ocean data suggests that more than 99.999 percent of the global deep seafloor has never been seen by humans. But what does that really mean?

What do we really know about the deep ocean? Whether Earth's ocean is an ecological paradise teeming with wildlife or a mysterious, stormy underworld hiding mythological sea monsters, it goes without saying that our ignorance of the aqueous abyss has shaped our perception of what could exist there. But in terms of actually tallying up what we do know about the deep seafloor, establishing certainty has been elusive.

“In scientific papers, some people [said] we've explored 5 percent or 10 percent or 1 percent [of the deep ocean]—and there was no consensus,” says Katy Croff Bell, a marine scientist and founder of the Ocean Discovery League. She wondered “Has anybody actually calculated this?” Bell adds. “And I couldn't find anything. So I started to do just initial estimates about four or five years ago, and the numbers seemed ridiculously small: 0.001 percent [visited and explored] over almost [the past] 70 years.”

That couldn't be right, Bell remembers thinking. But follow-up investigations confirmed her suspicions that we humans indeed had only directly observed less than 0.001 percent of the global seafloor—a total area that is about the same as that of Rhode Island. That's a shockingly tiny amount, considering we've now managed to obtain high-resolution images of practically all of the surfaces of the moon and Mars.

As detailed in a study published on May 7 in Science Advances, Bell and her co-authors compared 43,681 records from submersible expeditions that were conducted by institutions in by 14 countries and territories and had each reached a minimum of 200 meters (about 656 feet) beneath the waves. In addition to our generally limited understanding of the global seafloor, Bell and her colleagues also found a significant bias in the regions that did have visual reconnaissance. Unsurprisingly, most direct observations of the deep sea occurred in the waters around wealthy countries with the capability to conduct them—especially the U.S., Japan and New Zealand.

But what does Bell's “0.001 percent” figure really mean? Do we truly know less of the sea floor than we do of the moon or Mars? The correct answer, according to researchers, is no, although this pushback comes with important caveats. For one, it's worth noting that the 99.999 percent statistic explicitly represents what we have not “directly seen” of the deep seafloor—meaning all that we have not surveyed via visual imaging. This is different from mapping, which can measure seafloor topography with or without visual data collection. “Seeing” is also not the same as “sampling,” the gathering of geological or biological specimens from a particular area. These three elements—visual imaging, terrain mapping and physical sampling—constitute fully “exploring” an unknown environment, Bell says.

With that in mind, it's not so shocking that Bell's number would be so small, says Alfred McEwen, principal investigator for the High Resolution Imaging Experiment on NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter and a planetary geologist at the University of Arizona, who was not involved in the new work. Orbital surveillance has indeed allowed us to create stunningly detailed visual maps of the surface of the moon and Mars that far exceed those we have for Earth's ocean floor. But that's different from understanding, McEwen says. “I mean, you can map the topography and the brightness and color variations and have nice-looking maps,” he adds. “But that doesn't mean you understand what's there in terms of composition, relevant processes, and so on.”

Additionally, any talk of directly observing Earth's seafloor versus the surfaces of Mars and the moon “is a little bit of an apples-to-oranges comparison,” says Mathieu Lapôtre, a geophysicist at Stanford University, who was also not involved in the study. The former is hidden beneath kilometers of cold, dark, crushingly pressurized water, while the latter can be seen clearly from a spacecraft passing far overhead.

But we've managed to come up with very clever ways to unveil the ocean's depths, Lapôtre says. For example, using altimeters on satellites or sonar technology, it's more than possible to build a pretty accurate model of what the bottom of the sea looks like. In that sense, there's probably more we “understand” about the ocean floor—particularly regarding its role in shaping Earth systems—than we do about the surface of the moon or Mars, McEwen says. And at least partially by virtue of our proximity and familiarity with the ocean and all its complexities, he adds, it seems to us a richer, more vibrant place, with “dynamically changing environments, undersea vents, and so forth—there's a lot more to understand on Earth.”

Even if we do, in fact, “know” Earth's oceans better than the surface of any otherworldly body, that doesn't mean we know everything or that there are no benefits to higher-resolution optical data of the deep sea, says Brett Denevi, a planetary scientist at Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory, who is involved with NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter and was not a part of the new work. As our maps of the moon have improved, Denevi explains, we have not solved all lunar mysteries but instead revealed new ones. The more we learn, the more we see, the better, it seems, that we can pinpoint smaller, more subtle environmental details that coarser-grained mapping or sampling might otherwise miss.

“And often, the smaller things might be the important things, right?” Lapôtre says. “The ocean bottom, we know, is very complex. It has all these features that are fascinating for many reasons—for example, the origins of life, plate tectonics, and the subduction zones and all those things—it's a complex terrain. And right now we're missing a lot of that complexity.”

“Imagine owning a house but never going down to the basement to figure out how your heater or electrical system works,” Bell says. For example, she says, it was only in the 1970s that humanity found out about thriving ecosystems around hydrothermal vents—a discovery that showed biology could flourish even in the ocean's sunless depths and “changed our understanding of life on Earth.” Indirect mapping from sonar and other techniques allows you to “see” the mid-ocean ridges that host some of these vents. But actually finding the vents was a serendipitous discovery that was only made possible by deep-sea cameras.

And, Bell points out, given the wonders we've already witnessed by our direct visitations of just 0.001 percent of the seafloor, the prospects for further revolutionary observations are good. The abysmally low figure for our visual knowledge of the abyss is cause for excitement, not dismay, she says. Paired with burgeoning technological advances to make submarine exploration better, cheaper and safer, Bell's assessment is an invitation to begin “an unbiased and more representative look at the global deep seafloor.”

“On the exploration side of things, the [new study] really lays the groundwork for setting out a global initiative that we should undertake in the next 10 to 20 years,” Bell says. “Being able to explore, or at least accelerate, the exploration of the other 99.999 percent of the deep ocean is really going to give us an amazing opportunity to ask new questions we'd never even thought of before.”

We had to freeze 'em to see 'em.

What do atoms do when we're not watching? It turns out they do exactly what we thought. 

Enigmatic because of their quantum nature—meaning that they behave as both particles and waves—atoms had never been visualized freely interacting with each other. Where an atom is and how fast it is moving through space cannot be determined simultaneously. Before, it had been possible to make out the shape and structure of entire clouds of atoms using probes, but the individual atoms within the cloud eluded observation. Now, a team of researchers from MIT have finally managed to capture their interactions for the first time. 

Led by physicist Martin Zwierlein, the team developed a technique that allowed them to freeze atoms in place and put them in the spotlight with lasers. They were able to successfully image bosons of a sodium isotope and fermions of a lithium isotope before these atoms scattered again. (Bosons—like the infamous Higgs Boson—have spins of integer values, while fermions—like electrons, protons, and neutrons—have odd half-integer spins.) Both isotopes were in the form of quantum gases.

Bosons were previously predicted to bunch together in a wave form, exhibiting the wave part of quantum behavior, while fermions were predicted to repel those like them and form pairs with different fermions, which illustrates particle behavior. The probability of finding bosons near each other is high, while there is a low chance of seeing fermions as close together, and the gases needed to be at ultracold temperatures to see anything at all (because atoms get the zoomies when agitated by heat).

“Imaging quantum gases in situ at the resolution of single atoms realizes the ultimate depth of information one may obtain in real space,” Zwierlein and his team said in a study recently published in Physical Review Letters.

Their new technique, known as non-resolved microscopy, involves using a laser beam to trap the atoms in one place. There, they are free to interact before they are exposed to a lattice of light that freezes them in place. The atoms are then illuminated with fluorescent light to expose where they are and what they are doing. There was some difficulty in lighting these atoms up, since too much heat would send them flying all over. As a result, this is the first time Zwierlein managed to freeze the motion of strongly interacting atoms in situ, and he was able to capture images of both bosons and fermions.

With bosons, the team formed a Bose-Einstein condensate, which is a boson gas cloud cooled to temperatures verging on absolute zero. The MIT team wanted to prove the existing prediction that bosons bunch together because of their high probability of being near each other and their ability to share the same quantum mechanical wave. Atoms in this type of wave show wave-like behavior as they keep changing in time and space, but the properties of those atoms are difficult to observe. The image of bosons shows atoms bunching together with wavelike trails of light behind them, indicating that they are moving in waves.

To image a fermion cloud, the team needed two types of fermions—they wanted to capture pairs, and fermions of only one type would end up repelling each other. Sure enough, fermions of the same type avoided each other, while opposite fermions attracted each other. 

Zwierlein plans to continue using non-resolved microscopy to understand more about the physical world and potentially image stranger, more exotic quantum phenomena.

“This kind of pairing is the basis of a mathematical construction people came up with to explain experiments. But when you see pictures like these, it's showing in a photograph, an object that was discovered in the mathematical world,” Richard Fletcher, a coauthor of the study and physicist from MIT, said in a recent press release. “So it's a very nice reminder that physics is about physical things. It's real.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","First fossil evidence of endangered tropical tree discovered","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/05/250509132216.htm","Fri, 09 May 2025 17:53:08 GMT","

For the first time, scientists have discovered fossil evidence of an endangered, living tropical tree species. The unprecedented find was made in Brunei, a country on the large island of Borneo, and reveals a critical piece of the ancient history of Asia's rainforests, highlighting the urgent need for conservation in the region, according to researchers at Penn State who led the discovery.

The research team published their findings in the American Journal of Botany.

The fossils, at least two million years old, represent the first direct evidence of an endangered tropical tree species in the fossil record. The research study, conducted in collaboration with the University of Brunei among other international partners, identified fossilized leaves of Dryobalanops rappa, known locally as the Kapur Paya. It is a towering dipterocarp tree that still exists today but is endangered and found in the carbon-rich peatlands of Borneo, including Brunei.

""This discovery provides a rare window into the ancient history of Asia's wet tropical forests,"" said Tengxiang Wang, a doctoral student in the College of Earth and Mineral Sciences at Penn State and lead author on the paper. ""We now have fossil proof that this magnificent tree species has been a dominant part of Borneo's forests for millions of years, emphasizing its ecological importance and the need to protect its remaining habitats.""

Until now, the fossil record of Asia's wet tropical forests has been surprisingly scarce compared to the Amazon and Africa, said Peter Wilf, professor of geosciences at Penn State and co-author.

The team identified the fossils by analyzing microscopic features of the preserved leaf cuticles, which revealed a perfect match with modern Dryobalanops rappa, down to the last cellular detail.

""Our findings highlight that these forests are not just rich in biodiversity today but have been home to iconic tree species for millions of years,"" Wang said. ""Conserving them is not only about protecting present-day species but also about preserving a legacy of ecological resilience that has withstood millions of years.""

Dipterocarps, the dominant tree family in Asia's rainforests, are critical for carbon storage and biodiversity. However, the researchers said, they are increasingly threatened by deforestation and habitat destruction. By revealing the deep historical roots of these trees, this discovery adds an important new perspective to conservation efforts.

""The findings add a new dimension to conservation; we are not only protecting modern species but ancient survivors that have been key components of their unique ecosystems for millions of years,"" Wang said. ""This historical perspective makes both the endangered trees and their habitats even more valuable for conservation. Our study also shows how fossil evidence can strengthen conservation strategies for threatened species and ecosystems based on their historical significance.""

Understanding the history of tropical forests is essential for their conservation, especially as many key species face rapid decline, Wilf said.

""Penn State's paleobotany group is making exciting fossil discoveries with our international partners in several Southeast Asian countries, illuminating the poorly known history of the region's magnificent and severely threatened tropical forests,"" Wilf said. ""Our finding fossils of living, endangered, giant tree species provides a vital historical foundation for conserving tropical Asia's keystone trees, the rapidly disappearing dipterocarps.""

What happens when trailblazing engineers and industry professionals team up? The answer may transform the future of computing efficiency for modern data centers.

Data centers house and use large computers to run massive amounts of data. Oftentimes, the processors can't keep up with this workload because it's taxing to predict and prepare instructions to carry out. This slows the flow of data. Thus, when you type a question into a search engine, the answer generates more slowly or doesn't provide the information you need.

To remedy this issue, researchers at Texas A&M University developed a new technique called Skia in collaboration with Intel, AheadComputing, and Princeton to help computer processors better predict future instructions and improve computing performance.

The team includes Dr. Paul V. Gratz, a professor in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Dr. Daniel A. Jiménez, a professor in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, and Chrysanthos Pepi, a graduate student in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering.

""Processing instructions has become a major bottleneck in modern processor design,"" Gratz said. ""We developed a new technique, Skia, to better predict what's coming next and alleviate that bottleneck.""

A common problem for modern data center workloads is that the instruction stream -- the steps a computer must take for processing -- can be too large or difficult to process. Skia, a Greek word for shadow, can not only help better predict future instructions, but based upon that information, it can improve the throughput of instructions on the system. Throughput refers to units of completed processing per units of time.

""Think of throughput in terms of being a server in a restaurant,"" Gratz said. ""You have lots and lots of jobs to do. How many tasks can you complete, or how many instructions can you execute per unit time? You want high throughput, especially for computing.""

Improving throughput can lead to quicker performance and less power consumption for the data center.

""There are new bottlenecks in data center workloads associated with the instruction footprint and by fixing these, we can make the hardware better mapped and suited to that workload,"" Gratz added. ""If we make it up to 10% more efficient, a company previously needing to make 100 data centers around the country, now only needs to make 90, which is 10 less data centers. That's pretty significant. These data centers cost millions of dollars, and they consume roughly the equivalent of the entire output of a power plant.""

In data centers, modern processors improve efficiency by predicting instructions and retrieving them before they're needed, relying on a system known as Fetch Directed Instruction Prefetching (FDIP). FDIP uses Branch Prediction Unit to anticipate and fetch instructions.

However, as data center applications grow more complex, issues can occur when the Branch Target Buffer (BTB), which helps to monitor and track instructions, faults. This hinders FDIPS's effectiveness, causing incorrect predictions and cache pollution. Many of these missed branches, termed ""Shadow Branches,"" exist in previously fetched cache lines but aren't being used by the current instruction sequence and remain undecoded.

Skia identifies and decodes these shadow branches in unused bytes, storing them in a memory area called the Shadow Branch Buffer, which can be accessed alongside the BTB.

""What makes this technique interesting is that most of the future instructions were already available, and we demonstrate that Skia, with a minimal hardware budget, can make data centers more efficient, nearly twice the performance improvement versus adding the same amount of storage to the existing hardware as we observe,"" Pepi said.

Their findings, ""Skia: Exposing Shadow Branches,"" were published in one of the leading computer architecture conferences, the ACM International Conference on Architectural Support for Programming Languages and Operating Systems. The team also traveled to the Netherlands to present their work to colleagues from around the globe.

Other collaborators on the project include David I. August, a professor in the Department of Computer Science from Princeton University, Krishnam Tibrewala, a graduate student in the Computer Science and Engineering Department at Texas A&M, Gilles Pokam, a senior principal engineer at Intel Corporation, and Bhargav Reddy Godala and Gino Chacon, senior central processing unit architects at AheadComputing.

Funding for this research is administered by the Texas A&M Engineering Experiment Station (TEES), the official research agency for Texas A&M Engineering.

LHC experiments don't create large gold nuggets — but some particles within a beam of lead ions can turn into gold for about a microsecond.Credit: Zen Rial/Getty

The dream of seventeenth-century alchemists has been realized by physicists at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), who have turned lead into gold — albeit for only a fraction of a second and at tremendous cost.

The not-so-mysterious transmutation happened at CERN, Europe's particle-physics laboratory, near Geneva, Switzerland, where the multi-billion-dollar LHC smashes together ions of lead for a portion of each experimental run.

How the revamped Large Hadron Collider will hunt for new physics

How the revamped Large Hadron Collider will hunt for new physics

Early chemists hoped to turn abundant lead into precious gold. But differences in proton number between the elements (82 for lead and 79 for gold) made that impossible by chemical means.

CERN researchers achieved the feat by aiming beams of lead at each other, travelling at close to the speed of light. The ions occasionally glance past each other, rather than hit head on. When this happens, the intense electromagnetic field around an ion can create a pulse of energy that triggers an oncoming lead nucleus to eject three protons — turning it into gold.

The LHC's ALICE experiment filtered out these instances of transmutation from the wider collision debris. In an analysis published on 7 May in Physical Review Journals1, the team calculated that between 2015 and 2018, collisions at the LHC created 86 billion gold nuclei — around 29 trillionths of a gram. Most of the unstable, fast-moving gold atoms would have lasted around 1 microsecond before smashing into experimental apparatus or breaking into other particles.

Metrics details

In isocitrate dehydrogenase wildtype glioblastoma (GBM), cellular heterogeneity across and within tumors may drive therapeutic resistance. Here we analyzed 121 primary and recurrent GBM samples from 59 patients using single-nucleus RNA sequencing and bulk tumor DNA sequencing to characterize GBM transcriptional heterogeneity. First, GBMs can be classified by their broad cellular composition, encompassing malignant and nonmalignant cell types. Second, in each cell type we describe the diversity of cellular states and their pathway activation, particularly an expanded set of malignant cell states, including glial progenitor cell-like, neuronal-like and cilia-like. Third, the remaining variation between GBMs highlights three baseline gene expression programs. These three layers of heterogeneity are interrelated and partially associated with specific genetic aberrations, thereby defining three stereotypic GBM ecosystems. This work provides an unparalleled view of the multilayered transcriptional architecture of GBM. How this architecture evolves during disease progression is addressed in the companion manuscript by Spitzer et al.

Tumor heterogeneity is a hallmark of isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) wildtype (WT) glioblastoma (GBM)1. Different GBM samples have distinct genetic and transcriptomic profiles (intertumor heterogeneity)2 and even a single GBM specimen contains diverse malignant and nonmalignant cells (intratumor heterogeneity)3,4. This diversity endows malignant GBM cells with distinct functional properties5 and is thought to enable them to evade therapies, leading to progression and relapse6. Nonmalignant cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME) establish an ecosystem with complex interactions that also plays critical roles in shaping GBM biology and treatment response5,7,8,9.

Previous studies used single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to uncover gene expression heterogeneity within human gliomas3,4,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17. These studies revealed that GBM malignant cells exhibit a variety of cellular states, including those resembling neurodevelopmental cell types. The frequency of these states in a particular tumor is influenced by genomic alterations and the TME7. However, previous studies had several limitations: (1) they were based on limited number of samples and cells and could still miss rare cellular states; (2) they relied on enzymatic tumor dissociation, which may deplete certain cell types and states, as evident by the scarcity of detected astrocytes, neurons and endothelial cells; (2) they addressed either heterogeneity across tumors (that is, tumor subtypes) or within tumors (that is, cell states) but did not develop an integrated model that explains tumor heterogeneity by a combination of tumor-level and cell-level features; (4) they lacked in-depth genetic characterization of the tumors; (5) they had limited clinical metadata; and (6) they were published by different groups, and leveraged diverse pipelines, analytics and classification schemes4,10,12,15,16.

To address these challenges, we created the GBM Cellular Analysis of Resistance and Evolution (CARE) consortium and profiled 121 IDH WT GBM samples using single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) and bulk DNA sequencing, thereby establishing a multi-omic dataset of unprecedented size while eliminating the confounding effects of enzymatic tumor dissociation. This dataset is richly annotated with clinical data and contains primary and recurrent matched pairs. In this article, we describe the identification of new GBM cellular states, for both the malignant and TME compartments. Furthermore, we describe new analyses that distinguish the contributions of intratumor and intertumor heterogeneity, toward a more complete understanding of the multilayered transcriptional architecture of GBM. The main conclusions of this article are independent of the timing of sampling (primary or recurrent) and can be reached by only analyzing primary GBM specimens, yet we include the recurrent samples for more robust statistical analysis and to provide a broad view of the range of GBM tumors. In the accompanying study by Spitzer et al.18, we focus on characterizing the longitudinal evolution of GBM after standard-of-care therapy.

Our groups jointly generated an snRNA-seq dataset of 121 tumor samples from 59 patients spanning initial disease and recurrence (Fig. 1a; see Supplementary Table 1 for detailed clinical information). All tumors were diagnosed as ‘Glioblastoma, IDH WT' based on the World Health Organization (WHO) 2021 classification, which was further confirmed using bulk DNA sequencing. We profiled all 121 samples with the droplet-based 10x Genomics platform, and also profiled a large subset of tumors (54 of 121) using plate-based full-length Smart-seq2 (ref. 19). Most samples (116 of 121) were also profiled using bulk whole-exome sequencing (WES) or whole-genome sequencing (WGS), enabling the integration of genetic information with single-nucleus transcriptomics (Fig. 1b and Supplementary Table 1). The frequency of common genetic alterations was consistent with previous studies of GBM20.

In the 10x snRNA-seq dataset, 429,305 of 752,458 cells passed our stringent quality control (Methods) with 2,318 genes detected per cell on average (Extended Data Fig. 1a). Cells were classified as malignant (246,408 cells) or nonmalignant (182,897 cells) by inferring chromosomal copy number aberrations (CNAs) from gene expression data, as described previously13,21, but with additional steps to improve classification accuracy (Extended Data Fig. 1b–d). Clustering of all cells highlighted the diversity of malignant cells, including many small patient-specific clusters, while nonmalignant cells were intermixed across patients without apparent batch effects (Fig. 1c and Extended Data Fig. 2a,b). Nonmalignant cells were assigned to cell types using clustering and well-established signatures (Extended Data Fig. 2c)22,23,24,25,26. Notably, we detected neurons and astrocytes (Fig. 1c,d) that were typically not captured in scRNA-seq studies with enzymatic tissue dissociation. In the Smart-seq2 dataset, 10,062 of 11,136 cells passed our quality control and were similarly classified to malignant and nonmalignant cell types (Extended Data Fig. 2d). Overall, the fractions of cell types were similar between 10x Genomics and Smart-seq2 datasets (Extended Data Fig. 2e–g).

We previously defined four principal cellular states in GBM based on 28 samples (7,930 cells) obtained at initial diagnosis4: neural-progenitor-like cells (NPC-like); oligodendrocyte-progenitor-like cells (OPC-like); astrocyte-like cells (AC-like); and mesenchymal-like cells (MES-like). While this robust classification scheme has been broadly adopted and validated by the community5,27,28,29, we sought to extend the atlas of GBM malignant cellular states by leveraging our much larger snRNA-seq dataset. First, nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) was used to derive gene expression programs that vary within each tumor30. After removing programs suspected of low technical quality (for example, enrichment of ribosomal proteins or pseudogenes; Methods), we found ten groups of similar programs and defined a consensus meta-program (MP) for each of them, representing the malignant cellular states in our dataset (Fig. 2a, Extended Data Fig. 3a and Supplementary Table 2).

a, Jaccard similarity indices of the robust NMF programs (n = 707) based on their top 50 genes. Programs are ordered according to clustering and grouped into MPs (Methods). MP10 (stress1) and MP15 (stress2) were coalesced into a single stress state. MP9 (excitatory neuron (ExN)) and MP14 (neurogranin neuron) were coalesced into a single NEU-like state. The ‘cycling' MP is separated to emphasize it as a feature that cells can have on top of their neurodevelopmental identity (and not as an independent state; Extended Data Fig. 3a). b, Gene expression scores of each cell for the different cellular states and the cell cycle. Cells are aggregated according to the state to which they were classified and are ordered within each group according to their cell cycle score. ‘Unresolved' represents cells that could not be confidently classified to a particular state. c, Relative expression (centered log2) of the three new MPs discovered in this work. Each row represents a gene and each column a cell. d, Association between the malignant MPs (rows) and gene sets reflecting normal brain development and adult brain cell types (columns). Each cell in the heatmap represents the Pearson correlation coefficient between the gene expression scores of an MP and a normal brain gene set across the malignant cells in the dataset. e, Association between pathway-based (rows) and gene-based (columns) MPs. Each cell in the heatmap represents the Pearson correlation coefficient between the gene expression scores of the pathway-based and gene-based MPs. The colored squares represent the seven groups of PMPs and their associated MPs. f, Demonstration of the hybrid state concept. The rows represent genes, which are aggregated according to the MP to which they belong. The columns represent cells, which are aggregated according to their singular (AC, GPC) or hybrid (AC-GPC) state. The heatmap of genes' centered log2 expression shows that hybrids express two MPs to the same extent, whereas singulars highly express a single MP. g, GBM cellular hierarchy model stemming from the high-frequency hybrid pairs. Each vertex represents a state; vertices are connected when they represent a high-frequency hybrid state. h, Two-dimensional representation of cellular states. Each quadrant reflects a cellular state and each dot represents a malignant cell; exact cell positions reflect their relative scores for the MPs, and their colors reflect the proportion of cells around them classified to the GPC state.

Overall, seven of the ten MPs largely recapitulate the patterns from ref. 4. One of these MPs represented the cell cycle and another five represented the previously defined cellular states: AC-like; OPC-like; NPC-like; MES-like; and hypoxia (previously denoted as MES2)4 (Fig. 2b). Another MP (stress) included genes associated with heat shock and unfolded protein response, which were previously included in the MES-like MP and associated with disordered DNA methylation12. Thus, high-resolution analysis divides MES-like states into three MPs that we termed MES-like, hypoxia and stress.

Although these seven MPs produce highly correlated cell scores as those from ref. 4 (Extended Data Fig. 3b), it is important to note that the exact sets of genes that define the MPs here and in ref. 4 differ (Extended Data Fig. 3c), suggesting platform-dependent effects such that distinct genes are highlighted by scRNA-seq versus snRNA-seq (Extended Data Fig. 3d). We also compared these MPs to prior GBM cell-state classifications, further corroborating their identities (Extended Data Fig. 3e)31,32.

The first new MP contained NPC-like genes but was mostly associated with markers of more differentiated neurons (NRG1, NRG3, NRXN3, CNTNAP2) and synaptic activity (SYN3, SYT1; Fig. 2c) and was similar to the NEU (neuronal) pathway-based program reported previously15. Consistent with a differentiated NEU state, cycling cells were depleted in this program relative to NPC-like cells (Extended Data Fig. 4a). Comparison to the signatures of neural cell types in development and in adult human brains showed the highest similarity to L2–L3 excitatory neurons (P = 7.2−5, hypergeometric test; Fig. 2d); thus, we named this state NEU-like. This state is depleted in single-cell relative to single-nucleus data4, suggesting that it may be poorly captured by enzymatic tumor dissociation, possibly because of complex cellular morphology.

The second new MP included the tyrosine kinase genes EGFR and ALK, the transcription factor genes MEIS1, MEOX2, ETV1, ELOVL2 and KLHDC8, which were previously linked to glioma stemness33,34,35. Comparison to normal brain signatures showed the strongest association with a recently described signature of glial progenitor cells (GPCs)36; hence, we denoted it as GPC-like. Consistent with a progenitor state, the GPC-like MP was enriched with cycling cells (Extended Data Fig. 4a). Like the NEU-like state, GPC-like cells were depleted in single-cell relative to single-nucleus data4.

The third new MP mostly contained cilia genes, including 12 of 50 DNAH and CFAP family members; therefore, it was named cilia-like. This MP was specific to a small fraction of cells (~1.6%), underscoring the utility of our large cohort for identifying rare cellular states. Notably, all of those cells also expressed the AC-like MP, indicating that a subset of AC-like cells activate a cilia program. As expected, this MP was most enriched with external cilia signatures. Therefore, all MPs are enriched with corresponding cell-type-signatures from developing or adult human brains24,26,36 (Fig. 2d), supporting our annotations and suggesting that GBM states mirror developmental trajectories32.

Collectively, our MPs are reflective of cell identity (for example, GPC-like, AC-like, NEU-like) or cell activity (for example, response to hypoxia or stress). We also scored malignant cells for signatures of functional attributes5,37,38, which suggested that AC-like and MES-like cells had greater connectivity, while OPC-like, NPC-like and NEU-like cells had greater motility and invasion scores, while cilia-like and GPC-like cells were intermediate (Extended Data Fig. 4b).

The new MPs defined from 10x data were validated in Smart-seq2; they were still detected when analyzing only primary samples and were detected independently in specimens profiled by different labs and obtained from different medical centers (Extended Data Fig. 4c–f). Overall, our analysis expands our original malignant GBM MPs to ten, some of which represent more granular subsets of the states in ref. 4.

As an orthogonal description of cellular states, we defined pathway-based MPs (PMPs) (Fig. 2e). We previously defined four PMPs, namely NEU, glycolytic/pluri-metabolic (GPM), mitochondrial (MTC) and proliferative/progenitor (PPR)15,39. To preserve a similar computational approach to the gene-expression-based MPs, we adapted the NMF-based algorithm to consider pathways instead of genes, including 3,015 pathway gene sets from the Molecular Signatures Database Hallmark, Gene Ontology (GO) and Reactome. This resulted in seven PMPs that recapitulated and extended the previously defined PMPs (Extended Data Fig. 5a–c).

We confirmed the existence of the NEU PMP, which correlated with the OPC-like, NPC-like and NEU-like MPs (Fig. 2e). We identified two distinct PMPs related to the previous GPM, one linked to glycolysis and hypoxia, and another closely resembling the MES-like state (denoted as GPM-MES). MTC-related and PPR-related PMPs also emerged from this analysis. We additionally identified two new PMPs, one similar to the AC-like and cilia-like MPs (AC-CIL), and another that is highly correlated with the GPC-like state, denoted as GPC/radial glia-like (RGL) (GPC-RGL). Overall, the association of PMPs and MPs provides further functional characterization to each state, supporting the identification and biological interpretation of the new malignant cell states.

Most malignant cells in our dataset were classified into a single state, yet roughly 20% of the cells could be classified into multiple states, with a limited difference between the two highest state scores (for an example, see Fig. 2f). These hybrid cells did not have a high number of detected genes as would be expected from technical doublets (two nuclei occupying the same droplet; Extended Data Fig. 5d). Moreover, hybrid cells were not distributed as expected across all state pairs but rather were highly enriched for certain state pairs (Extended Data Fig. 5e). Thus, we reasoned that these may represent cells in transition between two states, and constructed a GBM model where each node represents a cellular state and each edge reflects a high-frequency hybrid state (Fig. 2g).

Although this analysis lacks evidence for directionality, the differentiated cellular states (NEU-like, AC-like, cilia-like, MES-like and hypoxia) were all at the edges, while the three progenitor-like and stem-like states (NPC-like, OPC-like and GPC-like) were all in the center of the model. Specifically, the GPC-like state was positioned at the center of three trajectories (NEU, AC-cilia, hypoxia-MES), perhaps suggesting that this population represents an early progenitor state with differentiation potential along multiple trajectories. Consistent with this possibility, cells having high GPC-like scores tended to exhibit intermediate expression levels of programs for the other cellular states (Fig. 2h).

When assessing differences between samples, a dominant signal reflects variations in the abundance of shared cellular states. To highlight additional patterns of intertumor differences, we developed a cell-state-controlled approach in which we compared tumors only based on cells in corresponding states. First, each tumor sample was decomposed into subpopulations of cells representing seven common malignant states. For each subpopulation with a minimum of 25 cells in a particular sample, we then defined a state-specific pseudo-bulk (average) expression profile. Then, for each state, the pseudo-bulk profiles were compared across tumors, thereby eliminating state-specific signals and highlighting tumor-specific differences in that state. Principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to the pseudo-bulk profiles of each cell state, defining high and low signatures for the top three principal components (Fig. 3a).

Intertumor variability reflects the average variability measured between scores of different samples (defined as the average s.d. of program scores in each state across all states). Intratumor variability reflects the average variability measured between scores of same samples (defined as the average s.d. of program scores in each sample across all samples). Intertumor variability was significantly larger in BPs relative to MPs (mean score = 1.05 versus 0.65, P = 0.0005, one-sided t-test) whereas intratumor variability was significantly higher in MPs relative to BPs (mean score = 0.76 versus 0.62, P = 0.028, one-sided t-test). P values were not corrected for multiple testing. c, Intra-sample variability in BP scores across state-specific pseudo-bulk profiles. Each dot reflects a state-specific pseudo-bulk profile, is colored according to state and aggregated horizontally according to sample. The black horizontal lines connect pseudo-bulk profiles from the same sample as a visualization aid and have no other meaning. The black dots reflect the mean BP score of each sample and are connected using a line for visualization purposes. The dashed lines mark y = −1 and y = 1 to aid in visualization. The y axis shows the difference between the ECM and NEU BPs. d, Top, two-dimensional representation of the BPs. Each dot represents a specific sample (the mean score across the pseudo-bulks for each BP) and are colored according to the maximal score. The y axis reflect the BP-glial score, the x axis reflects the difference between the NEU and ECM BPs as follows: sign(NEU-ECM) × max(NEU, ECM). Bottom, limited intratumor variability in BP scores. Cells are colored according to the maximal BP score. Cellular states that reflects each quadrant are indicated on the right.

We found highly consistent signatures of intertumor variation across PCA analyses of different states. For example, signatures of variation across AC-like pseudo-bulk profiles were highly similar to signatures of variation across NPC-like pseudo-bulk profiles. Three sets of signatures were each identified in analyses of most states, reflecting patterns of intertumor heterogeneity that commonly influences several malignant states (Extended Data Fig. 6a). We denoted their consensus signatures as state-controlled baseline profiles (BPs), that is, consistent malignant gene expression differences between tumors that are not accounted by differences in tumor cell-state distribution.

We annotated BPs based on functional enrichment as NEU, glial and extracellular matrix (ECM) (Extended Data Fig. 6b and Supplementary Table 3). While BP annotations are reminiscent of cell-state MPs (that is, BP-NEU and NEU-like MP; BP-ECM and MES-like MP), we note that BPs and cell-state MPs reflected distinct sets of genes, such that MPs preferentially varied within tumors while BPs preferentially varied between tumors (Fig. 3b,c and Extended Data Fig. 6c) and remain consistent within a tumor (P = 2.3 × 10−9, Wilcoxon rank-sum test; Extended Data Fig. 6d). Accordingly, when we assigned tumors to BPs by averaging across the respective pseudo-bulks (Fig. 3d top; Extended Data Fig. 6e), we found that this classification tended to be consistent across different cellular states in the tumor (Fig. 3d bottom). In a tumor with high ECM BP, cells existed in multiple states but most tended to express high ECM, while in a tumor with high NEU BP most cells tended to express high NEU BP, even those in a MES-like state.

To examine whether BPs are consistent across regions of the same tumor, we leveraged a GBM spatial transcriptomics dataset that includes multi-sampled tumors37. We derived de novo BPs from the spatial transcriptomics data, resulting in three BPs that were highly correlated with the snRNA-seq-derived original BPs (Extended Data Fig. 7a,b). Sample pairs from the same tumor had significantly higher similarity in BP scores than sample pairs from different tumors (Extended Data Fig. 7c), supporting the consistency of BPs within tumors. Finally, we leveraged a subset of samples with both bulk RNA-seq and snRNA-seq data to compare the newly defined BPs to The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) expression subtypes17,40. We found a significant association (Fisher's exact test, P = 0.02) with the greatest overlap between the BP-ECM and the MES TCGA subtype (Extended Data Fig. 7d). Taken together, the three BPs reflect core intertumor transcriptional variation (that is, tumor-level phenotypes) that are partially independent of the variation in cellular states within tumors.

We next investigated how TME heterogeneity may influence malignant BPs and cell-state abundance. To accomplish this, we applied our NMF framework to derive TME MPs for each nonmalignant cell type (n = 62 total MPs; Fig. 4a). We annotated TME MPs based on pathway enrichment and by scoring cells for published signatures (Extended Data Fig. 8a–d, Supplementary Table 4 and Methods). TME MPs were linked to diverse functions, for example, reflecting cortical layers (among excitatory neurons), immune phenotypes (microglia versus bone marrow-derived macrophages) and differentiation status (immature versus mature oligodendrocytes). A subset of TME MPs had high overlap with malignant cell MPs (for example, hypoxia and MES-like), suggesting a similar effect of microenvironmental niches on multiple cell types30 (Extended Data Fig. 8e).

The size of the donut represents the relative proportion of all TME cells. b, Selected TME NMF state composition of tumors assigned to each BPs. The statistical significance of TME composition between samples with assigned BP to ECM (n = 23), glial (n = 39) or NEU (n = 35) was computed using a two-sided Kruskal–Wallis test (n = 97). c, Interaction graph between malignant cell states and TME cell type abundance. Each node represents malignant cell-state (red) or TME cell type nodes (colored according to cell type as presented). The thickness and color of the edge indicate the strength of the Pearson correlation. d, Correlation heatmap for the Pearson correlation between the relative malignant cell-state proportions (rows) and relative TME cell-state abundance (columns), which show representative associations for the hypoxic environment. e, Ligand–receptor cross-talk graph. Each green circled node represents a malignant cell state versus nonmalignant cell type pair, while each squared node represents a ligand–receptor interaction; there is an edge if that cross-talk is present. The thickness and color of the edge indicate the percentage of tumors in which both malignant cell state and nonmalignant cell type are present and the cross-talk exist. Open ‘(' and closed ‘)' parentheses reflect multiple ligand or receptor interaction from the same family. Specifically, closed parentheses ‘)' indicated multiple ligands interacting with the same receptor, and viceversa for closed ‘)' parentheses, multiple receptors interacting with the same ligand. UPR, unfolded protein response.

We assigned all TME cells to their highest-scoring TME MP (Methods). TME MP abundances differed significantly across GBMs mapping to the three BPs, suggesting an association between TME and BPs (Fig. 4b). Similarly, TME MP abundances were associated with malignant MP abundances (Extended Data Fig. 9a). Abundance of MES-like cells was associated with increased tumor-associated myeloid cells (TAMs) and monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs)4,7,9, but also with endothelial cells (Fig. 4c). Abundance of NEU-like malignant cells was associated with neurons, suggesting that nonmalignant neurons may interact with malignant cells and shape their states. Abundance of GPC-like cells was positively correlated with TAM-microglia; abundance of OPC-like malignant cells correlated with nonmalignant OPCs.

Collectively, these results indicate that malignant state abundance is associated with diverse TME cell types. Clustering of all states revealed two major TME-malignant compartments that probably reflect tumor periphery and core regions41 (Extended Data Fig. 9b). In particular, malignant hypoxia, stress and MES-like states were associated with inflammatory and hypoxic macrophages, reactive astrocytes, and inflammatory and angiogenic endothelial states (Fig. 4d). Thus, beyond shaping glioma cell identity3,4, hypoxia may cultivate an immunosuppressive ecosystem and induce astrocyte reactivity.

Finally, we used CellChat42 to quantitatively infer ligand–receptor interactions between malignant cell states and nonmalignant cell types. This resulted in two separate subnetworks, supporting the division into tumor core regions (Fig. 4e, left) versus periphery (Fig. 4e, right). Among those, we found (1) IGF1 and IGF1R cross-talk between TAM-MDM and MES-like cells, which is consistent with a proposed resistance mechanism43; (2) PTN-PTPRZ1 OPC cross-talk, which may promote tumor progression and invasion17,31; and (3) NLGN-NRXN and NRG-ERBB4 interactions between neurons and NEU-like cells, reported as potential therapeutic target in glioma44,45,46 (Fig. 4e). Taken together, GBM microenvironmental niches such as hypoxia, glial and NEU TME may serve as determinants of malignant and nonmalignant states.

Malignant gene expression profiles may also be driven by genetic alterations. Previously, we found that the CNAs of CDK4, PDGFRA and EGFR and mutations in NF1 were associated with inferred abundance of cellular states in bulk GBM data from TCGA4. To examine these associations in our snRNA-seq dataset, we analyzed malignant state abundance in samples with matched DNA profiling and sufficient malignant cells (n = 108 samples). As expected, we found associations between CDK4 amplification and NPC-like abundance, PDGFRA amplification and OPC-like abundance, and NF1 mutations and MES-like abundance (Fig. 5a; Wilcoxon rank-sum test, P < 0.05). In contrast, we did not observe an association between EGFR amplifications and AC-like abundance.

P value adjustments for multiple hypothesis testing were not performed. b, Cell type composition of each of the tumors (n = 121) in the dataset, aggregated based on their composition group. c, Malignant cell-state proportions (rows) in each tumor sample (n = 111 with at least 50 malignant cells; columns). Tumors are aggregated according to the dominant malignant state (at least 30% of cells). d, Interaction graph between the different layers of GBM (composition groups, malignant state groups, BPs, gene-level CNAs and single-nucleotide mutations). Each node represents a layer; nodes are connected with an edge if a statistically significant association exists between the nodes. mut, mutation.

We next tested whether EGFR amplifications, or other genetic alterations, might be associated with the newly identified states (Fig. 1b). The strongest associations were between canonical genetic alterations of GBM (that is, chromosome 7 gain, chromosome 10p loss, EGFR amplification and TERT promoter mutations) and increased GPC-like state abundance (Fig. 5a and Extended Data Fig. 10a). These canonical genetic alterations typically co-occur in GBM, so we compared samples with at least one of these alterations to those without. Tumors with canonical alterations had, on average, 12% GPC-like malignant cells, compared with less than 1% of those without (Wilcoxon rank-sum test, P = 0.003; Extended Data Fig. 10b), suggesting that the GPC-like state is rare in GBMs lacking canonical alterations.

Other associations included TP53 mutations linked to NEU-like abundance and chromosome 7 amplifications linked to hypoxia abundance, which is consistent with a recent study28. Similar analyses of BPs found that glial BP is more closely aligned with canonical GBM genetic alterations compared to ECM or NEU BPs (Extended Data Fig. 10c). Together, these results indicate an interplay between genetic alterations and specific cellular states, although our dataset may still be underpowered to detect additional associations given the low frequencies of GBM genetic alterations.

We defined three distinct layers of GBM transcriptional patterns: cell type composition; malignant cellular states; and BPs. To examine the associations across these layers, we first classified all samples according to each layer (Supplementary Table 5). Regarding cell type composition, tumors were divided into three main groups according to malignant fraction (high, intermediate and low); the latter group was further subdivided according to the dominant TME cell type (Fig. 5b). Regarding malignant state, most tumors were dominated by one state, thereby defining six groups (Fig. 5c). Finally, BPs were used to define three groups of tumors as described above (Fig. 3d).

Next, we investigated associations across layers (Fig. 5d). Each of the three BPs was significantly associated with classifications according to cell type composition and malignant state, as well as specific genetic events. BP-NEU was associated with the NEU-like and OPC and NPC-like states, with a glio-neural (GN)-rich (neurons, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes) TME and with TP53 and RB1 mutations. BP-ECM was associated with the MES-like and hypoxia states, with macrophage-rich TME and NF1 mutations. Finally, BP-glial was associated with the GPC-like state, with a highly malignant fraction and with EGFR and MDM2 amplifications (Fig. 5d).

These results define three multilayer ecosystems, each including correlated features among the three layers (Fig. 6a). Overall, 43% (52 of 121) of the samples could be robustly assigned to one of these three multilayer ecosystems, based on either two or three of its layers (Fig. 6b and Supplementary Table 6), which is significantly more than expected by chance (P < 0.01 for each ecosystem according to a binomial test). The remaining samples could be described according to individual layers but did not correspond to a stereotypic association between these layers (Extended Data Fig. 10d), highlighting the complexity and diversity of GBM ecosystems.

After the first report of scRNA-seq for 430 cells derived from five GBM samples3, technical progress has dramatically expanded the scale of single-cell profiling. In this study, we leveraged a large-scale single-nucleus dataset (~430,000 nuclei, 121 samples) to comprehensively redefine the GBM cellular architecture. We discovered three new cellular states that were not captured in previous glioma studies, including a differentiated NEU state (NEU-like), a new progenitor state (GPC-like) and a cilia-related state. The capacity to identify these new states may be due to the high number of samples and cells profiled in this study. Yet this explanation is insufficient given that two of the new states are relatively common in our data (6.7% NEU-like and 14.2% GPC-like cells). Thus, we speculate that these states were depleted by single-cell isolation protocols that require enzymatic digestion and may poorly capture specific cell states (for example, those with complex morphology). Single-nucleus protocols isolate nuclei using tissue homogenization in cold buffer, thus capturing a wider variety of cell types23,47. Accordingly, the newly described malignant states may resemble normal cells with complex cellular processes (for example, neurons, ciliated cells).

GBM cellular states resemble the programs observed in normal glial or NEU cell types. This finding is further supported by analysis of potential cellular transitions. Transitions between GBM states was demonstrated previously4, but the rate of specific transitions is unknown. We explored this question through quantification of hybrid states, based on the assumption that cells mapping to two states often reflect a transition. Only eight of the potential 38 hybrid states accounted for 71% of hybrids, highlighting the enrichment of specific hybrids and presumably the identity of common transitions. These putative transitions also mirror normal brain development, supporting the view that many aspects of GBM biology are inherited from the cell of origin.

Previous work noted that much of the diversity between GBMs is tightly linked to diversity within GBMs, such that tumor subtypes can be partially explained by the abundance of recurring cellular states. However, not all intertumor variation may be explained in this way; to our knowledge, no previous studies attempted to define the residual signal of intertumor heterogeneity. In this study, we addressed this issue by analyzing intertumor heterogeneity only among cells of the same cellular state, thereby controlling for the diversity of states within tumors. We found that the main patterns that vary between tumors in one state also vary in other states, thus defining a state-independent pattern of intertumor variability that may be thought of as reflecting a tumor baseline profile.

Notably, the three BPs we identified—NEU, ECM and glial—are functionally reminiscent of some of the malignant states that vary within tumors (NEU-like, MES-like and GPC-like), although they include distinct sets of genes. Moreover, these features are correlated, such that tumors with one BP also tend to be enriched with the related malignant state. We speculate that certain genetic and environmental features give rise to two related effects: a BP that influences all cells in the tumor and a higher fraction of cells with a certain expression program (that is, state). Thus, tumors with an NEU BP (represented by one set of NEU-related genes) also tend to have an abundance of cells that activate another set of genes that corresponds to the NEU-like MP. Similarly, tumors with an ECM BP also have an abundance of cells that activate genes of the MES-like MP. At bulk, the two phenomena of BP and frequency of certain MPs coalesce into the signal of GBM subtypes, while single-cell analysis allows us to dissect these distinct effects.

What might be the signals that concomitantly activate BP and frequencies of MPs? Our analysis shows a correlation of both of these malignant features with the TME. NEU malignant features are associated with low-purity tumors enriched with glial and neural TME cells. Mesenchymal and ECM malignant features are associated with low-purity tumors enriched with macrophages. Finally, glial malignant features are associated with high purity. In addition to the TME, we also found genetic events associated with a combination of tumor features: NF1 mutations, TP53 and RB1 mutations, and EGFR and MDM2 amplifications are linked to the ECM, NEU and glial ecosystems, respectively. Thus, we speculate that tumor genetics along with tumor location, which influences the tumor TME, define the propensity of each GBM toward a particular BP and enriched MP, culminating in three stereotypic ecosystems, each associated with multiple correlated components—tumor genetics, nonmalignant TME and two malignant features (BP and MP frequency). Nevertheless, the coupling between these components is only partial, such that around half of the tumors cannot be assigned to a stereotypical ecosystem but rather reflect unique combinations of features, highlighting the diversity and complexity of GBM.

Additional clinical characteristics related to longitudinal analyses are shown in the companion paper by Spitzer et al.18.

In protocol 1 (laboratory 1 and laboratory 2 for the cohorts from Duke University, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Tokyo University Hospital, St. Michael's Hospital and Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital), nuclei from frozen tumor tissue were isolated. Tissue was thawed and mechanically dissociated in ST buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 146 mM NaCl, 1 mM CaCl2, 21 mM MgCl2) with 0.49% CHAPS (no. 28300, Merck Millipore). Single-nucleus suspensions were filtered using a 40-μm strainer, centrifuged at 500g for 5 min and resuspended in ST buffer supplemented with 0.01% BSA (cat. no. B9000S, New England Biolabs). Nuclear suspensions were inspected by microscope, counted using a hemocytometer and used for 10x Genomics workflow or fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) for the Smart-seq2 workflow.

In protocol 2 (laboratory 3 for the cohorts from NORLUX and Seoul National (SNU) cohorts), tissue samples were thawed and mechanically dissociated in Nuclei EZ Lysis Buffer (NUC101, Sigma-Aldrich) using dounce homogenization. Solutions were incubated on ice for 5 min and mixed 1–2 times during incubation. Single-nucleus suspensions were filtered through a 70-μm strainer and centrifuged at 500g for 5 min at 4 °C, resuspended in Nuclei EZ Lysis Buffer and incubated on ice for 5 min. Solutions were centrifuged at 500g for 5 min at 4 °C and resuspended in 1% BSA, 0.2 U μl−1 RNase inhibitor and PBS buffer (three times). For the final resuspension, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole was added to the buffer; the solution was filtered through a 40-μm strainer, cells were counted on a Countess II Automated Cell Counter (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and nuclei were taken into the 10x Genomics workflow.

The Chromium Single Cell 3′ Reagent Kit Vv3 (cat. no. PN1000128, 10x Genomics) was used according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, nuclei were loaded on the Chromium Chip (cat. no. PN12000120, 10x Genomics) with a target cell recovery of 6,000–8,000 nuclei and processed in the Chromium Controller. Single nuclei were partitioned into Gel Beads-in-emulsion, followed by RNA reverse transcription with barcoding. Libraries were created by breaking the Gel Beads-in-emulsion and pooling barcoded fractions, complementary DNA amplification, fragmentation and attachment of sample index and adapter, and sequenced on the NextSeq 500 or NovaSeq (Illumina) platform, with paired-end 28–91 bp reads. For the NORLUX and SNU cohorts, nuclei were loaded on a Chromium Chip with a target cell recovery of 6,000 nuclei for single-cell multi-omic assay for transposase-accessible chromatin and gene expression according to the manufacturer's protocol. The gene expression chemistry for the 10x multi-ome possesses the same chemistry as the 10x v3 3′ snRNA-seq.

The nuclear suspension was stained using the Vybrant DyeCycle Ruby Stain (cat. no. V10309, Thermo Fisher Scientific) immediately before FACS. Single-nucleus sorting was performed on a FACSAria Fusion Sorter (Becton Dickinson) using a 640-nm laser (Ruby, 670/14 filter) (Extended Data Fig. 2d). After doublet discrimination, intact nuclei were selected with ruby+ and were sorted into 96-well plates containing TCL buffer (cat. no. 1031576, QIAGEN) with 1% 2-mercaptoethanol (cat. no. M6250, Sigma-Aldrich). Plates were frozen on dry ice immediately after sorting and stored at −80 °C before whole-transcriptome amplification, library preparation and sequencing.

Whole-transcriptome amplification, library construction and sequencing were performed as previously published with slight modification for the nucleus as follows4,19. Briefly, on 96-well plates, RNA derived from single nuclei was first purified with Agencourt RNAClean XP beads (cat. no. A66514, Beckman Coulter). Then, Oligo(dT)-primed reverse transcription was performed using Maxima H Minus Reverse Transcriptase (cat. no. EP0753, Thermo Fisher Scientific) and locked TSO oligonucleotide (5′-AAGCAGTGGTATCAACGCAGAGTACATrGrG+G-3′, QIAGEN). This was followed by PCR amplification (22 cycles for snRNA-seq) using the KAPA HiFi HotStart ReadyMix (cat. no. K2602, KAPA Biosystems) with subsequent Agencourt AMPure XP Bead (cat. no. A63882, Beckman Coulter) purification. Libraries were tagmented using the Nextera XT Library Prep Kit (cat. no. FC-131-1096, Illumina) with custom barcode adapters. Libraries from 768 cells with unique barcodes were pooled and sequenced on a NextSeq 500 or NovaSeq 6000 sequencer (Illumina), with paired-end 38 bp reads.

WES for the samples from Duke University, the MD Anderson Cancer Center, Tokyo University Hospital and St. Michael's Hospital was performed as follows. DNA was extracted from each frozen tumor sample and blood samples corresponding to the patients using the DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit (cat. no. 69504, QIAGEN). Genomic DNA (100–250 ng) was acoustically sheared using an ultrasonicator (Covaris), targeting 150-bp fragments. Library preparation was performed using the KAPA HyperPrep Kit (cat. no. KK8504, KAPA Biosystems) followed by enzymatic cleanup using AMPure XP beads. Exome capture was performed using a custom exome bait (manufactured by Twist Bioscience to Broad Institute's specifications). Captured libraries were sequenced with 150 bp paired-end sequencing on a NovaSeq 6000. For the samples from Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital, after DNA was fragmented by a LE220 ultrasonicator (Covaris) and size-selected, library preparation and capture were performed using Twist Human Core Exome kit (Twist Bioscience) according to manufacturer's protocol. Sequencing was performed on a NovaSeq 6000, with 200-bp paired-end sequencing.

Newly generated whole-genome DNA sequencing data were collected for a cohort of frozen samples from the NORLUX Neuro-oncology Laboratory. Briefly, DNA was extracted from each tumor sample using the AllPrep DNA/RNA Mini Kit (cat. no. 80204, QIAGEN) for samples with sufficient tumor tissue and matched normal blood when it was available. Selected tissue for bulk DNA isolation was adjacent to tissue used for single-nucleus data generation. Briefly, DNA was sheared to 400 bp using an LE220 ultrasonicator (Covaris) and size-selected using AMPure XP beads. Whole-genome libraries were prepared and sequenced with 150 bp paired-end sequencing on a NovaSeq 6000 platform. WGS data for the SNU cohort was prepared in an identical manner and was previously reported in ref. 9. Data for the SNU cohort are available on Synapse (https://www.synapse.org/glass).

No statistical method was used to predetermine sample size. All available samples were provided by the aforementioned centers and no data were excluded from the analyses. For figures containing box plots, the box spans from the first to third quartiles, median values are indicated by a horizontal line and the whiskers show 1.5× the interquartile range; individual sample points are presented. The statistical analysis described in this work was done using R v.4.0.1 and above.

DNA sequencing alignment, fingerprinting, somatic variant detection (Mutect2) and copy number segmentation was performed in accordance with the Genome Analysis Toolkit best practices using the Genome Analysis Toolkit v.4.0.10.1, as described previously9,48. Briefly, whole-exome and whole-genome reads were aligned to the b37 genome (human_g1k_v37_decoy) using the Burrows–Wheeler Aligner MEM v.0.7.17. DNA fingerprint analysis using ‘CrosscheckFingerprints' (Picard) confirmed that all samples belonging to a patient came from the same individual, indicating that there were no sample mismatches in this study. Somatic mutations were detected using Mutect2 (v.4.1.0.0) for tumor samples with a matched normal blood sample. A panel of normals was constructed for each sequencing batch to account for differences in DNA library preparation (for example, whole-genome versus whole-exome) and used to filter out common artifactual and germline variants. Patient tumor samples without matched normal blood were analyzed for copy number alterations but not for SNV detection.

For Smart-seq2 sequencing data, the reads were mapped to the UCSC hg19 human transcriptome using Bowtie with the following parameters:-q-phred33-quals -n -e 99999999 -l 25 -I 1 -X 2000 -a -m 15–best -S -p 6. For droplet-based sequencing data, the Cellranger v.3.1.0 pipeline provided by 10x Genomics was used for alignment (GRCh38 release 93) and to generate count matrices. Smart-seq2 gene expression levels were quantified as \({E}_{i,\,j}=\log 2(\frac{{{\mathrm{TPM}}}_{i,\,j}}{10}+1)\) where TPMi,j refers to transcripts per million for gene i in sample j, as calculated using RSEM. For droplet-based sequencing data, we quantified the gene expression levels as \({E}_{i,\,j}=\log 2(\frac{{{\mathrm{CPM}}}_{i,\,j}}{10}+1)\), where CPMi,j refers to counts per million for gene i in sample j. We divided the TPM and CPM values by ten as the size of single-cell libraries is estimated to be in the order of 100,000 transcripts; therefore, we wanted to avoid inflating the expression levels by counting each transcript approximately ten times. After these normalization steps, initial filtering of low-quality cells was done based on the low number of detected genes (fewer than 200 genes) or the high expression of mitochondrially encoded genes (more than 3%). Most low-quality cells were removed downstream in case they could not be robustly classified as malignant or nonmalignant (see the later sections on the CNA analysis). Lastly, we computed the average expression of each gene i as \(\log 2[(\frac{1}{n}{\sum }_{j=1}^{n}{{\mathrm{TPM|CPM}}}_{i,\,j})+1]\) and filtered out lowly expressed genes by limiting the analyzed genes to the top 3,000 most highly expressed genes (using the Seurat v.4.0.4 (ref. 49) function CreateSeuratObject). For the cells and genes that passed these quality control filters, we defined relative expression levels by centering the expression levels for each gene across all cells in the dataset as follows: \({{Er}}_{i,\,j}={E}_{i,\,j}-\,\frac{1}{N}{\sum }_{k=1}^{N}{E}_{i,k}\) where N is the number of cells in the dataset.

To facilitate clustering, cell type annotation and scoring of droplet-based data, we used the R package Seurat v.4.0.4 (ref. 49). Unique molecular identifier count data were normalized and scaled (using the NormalizeData and ScaleData functions) and then clustered by projecting the data to a lower dimensional space using PCA and then running the FindNeighbors and FindClusters functions. Initial classification of tumor-associated macrophages, T cells, oligodendrocytes and endothelial cells was based on the expression of known marker genes22,23,24,25,26, whereas the rest of the cells were annotated as presumed malignant. After classification of cells as malignant or nonmalignant (see the following two sections), cells classified as nonmalignant were scored (using the AddModuleScore function) for known cell-type-signatures and assigned a cell type using the method explained in the section ‘Assignment of cells to states'. Finally, heterotypic doublets were filtered our using the R package scDblFinder50.

CNAs were estimated as described previously4,13,14,21 using the function infercna from the R package infercna (an implementation of the original method presented in ref. 3, which is available at https://github.com/jlaffy/infercna) with default parameters. Briefly, the algorithm sorts the analyzed genes in each sample according to their chromosomal location and applies a moving average with a sliding window of 100 genes in each chromosome to the relative expression values. The scores computed for the cells classified as nonmalignant (oligodendrocytes, macrophages and endothelial cells) define the baseline of the normal karyotype and their average CNA values are used to center the values of all cells.

In cells classified using single-nucleus droplet-based sequencing, we generally encountered a lower CNA signal and continuous signal distributions related to (1) lower data quality relative to that observed in single-cell data, and (2) inclusion of nonmalignant cell types, such as astrocytes and neurons, in the presumed malignant group as these cell types could not be classified a priori as nonmalignant because of transcriptional similarity with malignant cells.

Therefore, we used a multi-step classification scheme for the droplet-based, single-nucleus sequencing data.

For each cell j, we computed the CNA signal on each chromosome separately as \({{\mathrm{CNA}}}_{j}^{C}=\frac{1}{n}{\sum }_{i=1}^{n}{{\mathrm{CNA}}}_{i,\,j}^{C}\) where n is the number of genes on chromosome C included in the analysis. We fitted a normal distribution (that is, a classifier) to the signal distributions of the reference cells for each chromosome (using the function fitdistr from the R package MASS v.7.3-56). This enabled assigning each cell with a P value for each chromosome using a two-sided z-test (function pnorm from the R package stats) reflecting whether the cell had a CNA signal that was significantly different than expected from nonmalignant cells. These P values were further corrected for multiple testing (for each chromosome) using the Benjamini–Hochberg method; cells with Benjamini–Hochberg-adjusted P < 0.05 for a particular chromosome were considered as having a copy number event on that chromosome (either amplification or deletion based on the sign of the CNA signal). Cells with an unadjusted P < 0.05 for a particular chromosome that failed to achieve statistical significance after adjustment were considered to have a ‘suspicious event' on that chromosome. Then, inferred copy number events were cross-referenced with copy number calls from the WES and WGS data; only events detected in both methods were considered for classification and were termed ‘real' events. For a subset of samples, this procedure was not possible because of (1) lack of WES or WGS data, or (2) inability to call CNA events from WES or WGS because of low purity or quality. For this subset of cases, we defined a panel of highly recurring CNA events (intersection of highly recurring events inferred from the snRNA-seq and WES and WGS data), which were used as a short-list of potential events. Cells classified a priori as nonmalignant were reclassified as ‘unresolved' in case a ‘real' or ‘suspicious' CNA event was detected and ‘nonmalignant' otherwise. Presumed malignant cells with at least one ‘real' CNA event were classified as ‘malignant'; those with a ‘suspicious' event were classified as ‘unresolved' and those with no events at all (‘real' or ‘suspicious') were classified as ‘nonmalignant'.

We defined the CNA correlation as the Pearson correlation between each cell and the average CNA profile of the tumor sample the cell originated from. We limited the computation to the chromosomes on which ‘real' events were detected and a control panel of ~1,000 genes from the other chromosomes. Based on the distribution of CNA correlations across the cells classified as malignant, we defined 0.5 as the lower threshold of malignancy. To determine the upper threshold for nonmalignancy, we performed SNV calling from the snRNA-seq data to estimate the algorithm misclassification rate. Briefly, for each sample with available WES data, we called SNVs for each cell using the Vartrix tool (https://github.com/10XGenomics/vartrix) from the FASTQ files. Misclassified cells were defined as cells harboring a malignant mutation that were classified as nonmalignant in step 1 of the algorithm. After a cost-effectiveness analysis (misclassification rate versus percentage of excluded cells), we set 0.35 as the upper threshold for nonmalignancy. Finally, cells classified as malignant with CNAcor < 0.5 or cells classified as nonmalignant with CNAcor > 0.35 were reclassified as ‘unresolved' and excluded from the downstream analysis.

To refine the classification, we defined confidence levels. Confidence level 1 includes cells classified as malignant that harbored a malignant SNV, cells in which at least 50% of the expected CNA events were detected including chromosome 7 amplification or chromosome 10 deletion, and cells classified as nonmalignant with CNAcor < 0.25. Confidence level 2 includes cells classified as malignant in which at least 50% of the expected CNA events were detected that do not include chromosome 7 amplification or chromosome 10 deletion, cells classified as malignant in which less than 50% of the expected CNA events were detected, including chromosome 7 amplification or chromosome 10 deletion, and cells classified as nonmalignant with CNAcor < 0.5. The rest of the cells classified as malignant or nonmalignant were assigned confidence level 3. In the analysis presented in this work, we used only cells in confidence levels 1 and 2.

To capture the heterogeneity between cells from the same cell type, we leveraged the NMF51. NMF was performed on the relative expression values of each sample independently after setting negative values to zero. The NMF algorithm requires defining a priori the ‘k' parameter, reflecting the expected number of latent features in the data. Since k varies between samples and is largely unknown, we ran the NMF algorithm on each sample using different values (3–10), thereby generating 52 programs for each sample. Each of these NMF programs was summarized using the top 50 genes based on the NMF coefficients. Derivation of the MPs from the NMF programs was described thoroughly by in ref. 30 and is described briefly here. The method first filters out NMF programs that are not robust (do not recur in the sample they originated from or across several samples) or are redundant in the sample (that is, they highly overlap other NMF programs in that sample). Then, robust NMF programs are clustered according to Jaccard similarity using a customized clustering algorithm that iteratively considers the degree of overlap between robust NMF programs and combines highly overlapping ones to form a cluster. The R 50 most-recurring genes in each cluster define an MP.

Overall, the algorithm yielded 16 MPs that were annotated based on functional enrichment analysis (using GO terms, Molecular Signatures Database Hallmark gene sets and gene sets derived from normal brain development datasets). MP16 included genes from several cell types resulting in an MP that fitted almost all cells and thereby did not reflect any heterogeneity; thus, it was excluded from the analysis. This same procedure was independently repeated for each nonmalignant cell type.

Malignant cells were scored for the NMF MPs using the Seurat function AddModuleScore. To facilitate cell classification, we generated 20 shuffled expression matrices by sampling each time 5,000 cells and shuffling the expression values for each gene. We then scored each shuffled matrix for the NMF MPs, thereby yielding 100,000 normally distributed scores for each expression program. These served as null distributions for cell-state classification. For each original cell, we computed a P value for each of the expression programs with a z-test (using the R pnorm function) using the statistics of the null distributions that we generated previously. We adjusted all P values for multiple testing using the Benjamini–Hochberg method. Each cell was classified into a specific state if the adjusted P value computed for that state was smaller than 0.05. Cells that achieved Padj < 0.05 for multiple states were assigned to the state for which they scored maximally. Cells that did not achieve Padj < 0.05 for any of the states were assigned an ‘unresolved' state.

Cells were assigned a ‘cycling' state on top of their cellular state if they achieved Padj < 0.05 for the cell cycle MP and ‘non-cycling' otherwise.

We define hybrids as cells scoring significantly (that is, with Padj < 0.05) for at least two cellular states with a difference between the top two significant scores smaller than expected by chance. To quantify the score difference expected by chance, we leveraged on the null distribution generated for the state classification algorithm and computed for each artificial cell the difference between the top two states. The 95 quantiles of this score difference distribution (equal to a difference of 0.24) was set as the threshold for determining if a state was singular or hybrid.

To estimate the expected frequency of technical hybrids, we first computed for each pair of states (A, B) the expected frequency of hybrids, defined as \({\mathrm{Exp}}\left({\mathrm{A,B}}\right)={\mathrm{Freq}}\left({\mathrm{A}}\right)\times {\mathrm{Freq}}\left({\mathrm{B}}\right)\) and the observed/expected ratio defined as \({\log }_{2}(\frac{{\mathrm{Obs}}({\mathrm{A,{B}}})}{{\mathrm{Exp}}({\mathrm{A,B}})})\). As this is an overestimation of the expected frequency attributed to technical effects, we estimated this technical factor (TF) by averaging across observed/expected ratios of hybrid pairs detected less than expected by chance (that is, observed/expected < 0). Then, we computed the expected frequency of technical hybrids for each hybrid pair by multiplying the expected frequency with the technical factor and defined the observed/expected ratio as \({\log }_{2}(\frac{{\mathrm{Obs}}({\mathrm{A,{B}}})}{{{\mathrm{TF}}}\times {\mathrm{Exp}}({\mathrm{A,B}})})\). Finally, we filtered out insignificant hybrid pairs with large observed/expected ratio (attributed to small numbers) using a one-sided Fisher's test. The hybrid lineage model was generated using the R package igraph, with cell states as nodes and edges connecting the states that formed significant hybrid pairs. We did not include the ‘cycling' state in this analysis because we did not view ‘cycling' as an independent state but rather as an additional feature that cells can have on top of their neurodevelopmental identity (that is, AC-like, OPC-like, and so on).

Each tumor sample was decomposed to up to seven pseudo-bulk profiles (one for each of the common states—AC-like, MES-like, hypoxia, GPC-like, OPC-like, NPC-like, NEU-like—given at least 25 cells classified to that particular state) by averaging across the normalized unique molecular identifier counts and log2-transforming. Genes were included if their mean log2 expression value across all pseudo-bulks was at least 1 and if their median variance (computed separately within state) was at least 2.5. Overall, 1,005 genes passed these filters. Then, pseudo-bulks were analyzed within state to remove the state-specific signal using PCA. We then derived six gene programs from each state (top and bottom 50 genes of the first three principal components), computed the Jaccard similarity index between each pair of programs and hierarchically clustered the similarity matrix using the ConsensusClusterPlus package (v.1.56.0). Analysis of the cumulative distribution function revealed minor increases in area under the curve for k > 5 (where k is the number of clusters); therefore, k = 5 was chosen as the number of clusters. Then, we derived five consensus signatures by including genes that recurred in at least 25% of programs in each of the clusters (with a hard minimum of at least three times). Using manual inspection and GO enrichment, we annotated the consensus signatures. Two signatures were excluded because of short length or high suspicion of reflecting a technical artifact. To exclude the possibility that ambient RNA had a role in driving the BPs, we estimated the contamination by ambient RNA per sample using the R package SoupX (v.1.6.2). There was no difference in the estimated contamination level across the different BPs and no significant overlap between the top most contaminated genes per sample and the MP or BP signatures (data not shown).

To measure the differences in tumor composition, we generated for each tumor sample a composition vector reflecting the proportion of each cell type in the tumor sample. This enabled assigning tumors to three main composition groups: high malignant fraction (percentage of malignant cells > 75%); intermediate malignant fraction (percentage of malignant cells 50–75%); and low malignant fraction (percentage of malignant cells < 50%), where the low malignant fraction group could be further subdivided according to the dominant TME cell types (percentage of TAM, oligodendrocyte, GN > 40%, or mixed in case of no dominant TME cell type). Similarly, we defined the proportion vectors for the malignant cell states and assigned tumors to six groups according to the dominant cell state (at least 25% of cells assigned to the particular state)—AC, MES/hypoxia, GPC, OPC/NPC, NEU and mixed (in case of no dominant state). Tumors were classified according to the BP with maximal score and to the mixed category if the maximal score was less than 0.25.

The association between each pair of features (A, B) was computed using a binomial test with the number of times the pair was observed as the number of successes, the number of tumor samples as the number of experiments and the frequency of feature A times the frequency of feature B as the expected probability of success (under the assumption that the features were independent). We then generated an undirected graph by defining each feature as a node and connecting the nodes with edges when a statistically significant association (P < 0.05, unadjusted for multiple testing) between the two features was observed.

a, Total counts (left), number of detected genes (middle), and mitochondrial expression proportion (right) per cell across the whole dataset. The vertical lines represent the 10% and 90% quantiles. b, Flow diagram of the CNA calling algorithm used to classify cells as malignant or non-malignant. CNA signal reflects the extent of CNAs on each chromosome per cell. CNA correlation reflects the similarity between the CNA pattern of each cell and the overall CNA pattern of the tumor. SNV - single nucleotide variation. c, Sample-level copy number aberrations. Rows represent samples, columns represent chromosomes, values reflect the average CNA signal across all cells classified as malignant in the tumor. d, Cost-effectiveness of the 2nd step of classification. Top panel shows the % of misclassified cells (that is cells harboring a malignant SNV that were classified as non-malignant in the 1st step) that remain for each CNA correlation threshold. Bottom panel shows the % discarded cells for each CNA correlation threshold. Dashed line marks the upper threshold for non-malignancy (0.35).

a, UMAP colored by the lab that processed the tumor specimens and generated the 10x snRNA-seq data. b, Proportion (%) of samples contributing to each cluster of cells. Each dot represents a cluster and is colored by the dominant cell type in the cluster (n = 195, 11, 6, 6, 43, 5, 45, 6 for Malignant, Excitatory neuron, Endothelial, Astrocyte, Oligodendrocyte, Inhibitory neuron, TAM and Lymphocyte cell types respectively). Y axis reflects the proportion (%) of samples (out of all samples in which the cell type was detected) that contribute to the cluster. c, Heatmaps representing the average gene expression level (log2 relative expression) of cell type marker genes within each TME cell type for the 10x dataset. d, Gating strategy for single nuclei sorting for Smart-seq2. First, ruby positive proportion (P1, top) was selected by 570 nm laser. Then, doublet discrimination was performed by strict forward scatter height (FSC-H) versus area (FSC-A) criteria (P2, bottom left). It was further gated by removing 480 nm laser positive fraction was to exclude false positive proportion (P3, bottom right), and was sorted into 96 well plates for Smart-seq2. e, Heatmaps representing the average gene expression level (log2 relative expression) of cell type marker genes within each TME cell type for the Smart-seq2 dataset. Data generated at the two different labs was analyzed separately. f, Pie chart demonstrating the proportion (%) of each cell type in the Smart-seq2 dataset (two labs data combined, left), and 10x dataset considering only the same samples profiled also by Smart-seq2 (right). g, Boxplots of cell type proportions (%) in each tumor (n = 44) in both 10x (red) and Smart-seq2 (SS2, blue). Pearson's correlations of the proportions of each cell type are reported below each panel. Lines connect the cell type proportions of the patient's tumor profiled with both 10x and SS2.

a, Jaccard similarity indices of the robust NMF programs (n = 835) based on their top 50 genes. Programs are ordered by clustering and grouped into meta-programs (Methods). MP10 (Stress1) and MP15 (Stress2) were coalesced into a single Stress state. MP9 (ExN) and MP14 (NRGN neuron, NRGN) were coalesced into a single NEU-like state. MP1 (Ribosomal protein, RP), MP11 (Doublet), MP12 (Low quality, LQ) reflect low quality and are not considered a state. b, Correlation between cell state scores of meta-programs derived from this dataset (columns) and those derived by Neftel et al. (rows). Each cell was scored within tumor-of-origin for both sets of meta-program signatures. Pearson's correlation coefficient was computed across all cells for each pair of meta-programs. c, Jaccard similarity between meta-programs derived from this dataset (columns) and those derived by Neftel et al. (rows). d, Distribution of scores in this dataset (upper panel) and Neftel et al. (lower panel) dataset of cells that scored maximally for both corresponding states (for example to both AC-like signatures derived from this dataset and from Neftel et al.) across all corresponding states. Dashed vertical lines mark the mean score of each distribution. e, Association between the malignant MPs from our datasets (rows) and malignant signatures from other studies (columns). Each cell in the heatmap represents the Pearson correlation coefficient between the gene expression scores of an MP and other signature scores across the malignant cells in the dataset.

a, Percent cycling cells in each subpopulation across samples with at least 50 cells in any of the states (n = 84, 16, 51, 67, 60, 65, 61, 28, 70 for AC-like, Cilia-like, Hypoxia, MES-like, Stress, NEU-like, GPC-like, NPC-like and OPC-like states respectively). NPC-like (13.6%) vs. NEU-like (9.5%) p = 0.012, GPC-like (12.5%) vs. AC-like (1%) p < 2.2−16 and vs. MES-like (6.6%) p = 0.0001 (one-sided Wilcoxon rank sum test for all comparisons). b, Pearson's correlation coefficient heatmap between GBM state signature scores defined in this dataset and published functional gene signature scores. The published signature name is followed by each study's lead author in parentheses. c, Pearson's correlation of the proportions (%) of cells classified in each MP per tumor in both 10x (rows) and Smart-seq2 (columns). d, Similarity of MPs derived using all samples (x-axis) and MPs derived using primary (untreated) samples. e, Proportion (%) of contributing samples to each MP (relative to the number of samples profiled by each lab). f, Proportion (%) of contributing samples to each MP (relative to the number of samples provided from each sample source).

a, Jaccard similarity indices of the robust NMF programs based on their top 50 pathways. Programs are ordered by clustering and grouped into Pathway-based metaprograms (PMPs) according to their functional activities. b, Clustering of the PMPs based on their pairwise Pearson correlations reveal functional activity groups. c, Scores of each cell for the different PMPs. Cells are aggregated by the PMP to which they were classified. “Unresolved” represents cells that could not be classified to a PMP. d, Average number of detected genes per sample (n = 121) for singular and hybrid cells. Two-sided t-test was used to test for statistical significance. e, Relative frequency (in log2 scale) of observed hybrids vs. expected technical hybrids (Methods) for each of the possible state pairs (order within a pair is meaningless). Dashed line marks log2(Fold Change) = 2 to aid in visualization. Statistical significance was assessed for each hybrid state pair using a one-sided Fisher's exact test. P values were corrected for multiple testing using the Benjamini-Hochberg method. The bar plots were colored according to the BH-adjusted p-value.

a, Jaccard similarity matrix of the PCA-derived gene programs colored by cluster (see Methods). b, GO enrichment results for C1 (BP-ECM), C3 (BP-Neuronal) and C5 (BP-Glial) program clusters. Nodes represent enriched terms. Node color represents the extent of statistical significance and size represents the number of overlapping genes. Edges connect terms with a Jaccard similarity above 0.2 c, Same as Fig. 3c but here shown are the three BP scores. d, Observed vs. expected within-sample standard deviation (SD) of BP scores. Observed SD was defined as the SD across state-specific pseudo-bulk profiles in each tumor, shown are n = 98 samples with at least 3 pseudo-bulk profiles. Expected SD was estimated by randomly sampling n = 100 times 3 pseudo-bulk profiles and computing the SD across these PBs. Statistical significance was assessed with a two-sided Wilcoxon rank sum test. Each box plot represents a specific group (that is observed or expected) that spans from the first to third quartiles, median values are indicated by a horizontal line, whiskers show 1.5× interquartile range, and each dot reflects a specific standard deviation value. e, Same as Fig. 3d but here shown are the individual state scores in the 3-axis plane.

a, Same as Fig. 3c for the BP derived de-novo from the spatial transcriptomics data. For each tumor sample on the x-axis, the points represent the scores of the pseudobulk of that sample for a specific spatial equivalent of a state (Methods). b, Pearson's correlation between scores of de-novo spatial BPs (rows) and those derive from the snRNAseq data (columns) with p-values (unadjusted for multiple testing) for each comparison in the tile. c, Euclidean distance between BP scores of samples resected from the same tumor (n = 6 distances from 4 tumor samples) and samples resected from different tumors (n = 225 distances from 22 tumor samples). Each point represents a Euclidian distance between BP scores of two samples. Statistical significance was estimated using a two-sided t-test. d, TCGA subtype and the association with BP assignment. The samples profiled by both bulk RNA-seq and snRNA-seq were used (n = 28).

a-b, Gene ontology term (rows) enrichment (log10 of adjusted p-values) for each metaprogram's 50 gene list (columns) against background for a, TAMs and b, astrocytes. Statistical significance was assessed with a two-sided Fisher's exact test and Benjamini-Hochberg p-value adjustment was performed. c-d, Pairwise Pearson correlation heatmap for all c, CARE TAMs and d, astrocytes scored for both this dataset's MPs as well as publicly available cell type-specific gene signatures. e, Jaccard similarity index representing the intersection of genes for both malignant and non-malignant (astrocytes and TAMs) metaprograms. 50 genes per metaprogram.

a, Correlation heatmap for the Pearson correlation between the relative TME cell state abundances (n = 121 samples). Only correlations with unadjusted P < 0.05 are shown and increasing size of circle reflects increasing absolute value of correlation coefficient.

a, Association between genetic aberrations and cell state abundances. Color intensity reflects the statistical significance from two-sided Wilcoxon rank sum tests comparing state abundances in tumors with and without each genetic alteration (log10 of adjusted p-values). b, Association between abundance of GPC-like cells and the representative genomic alterations in GBM (either of chr.7 gain, 10p loss, EGFR amplification, and TERT promoter mutations, n = 87, P = 0.003, two-sided Wilcoxon rank sum test). c, The difference of the BP scores between samples with and without the representative genomic alterations in GBM (either of chr.7 gain, 10p loss, EGFR amplification, and TERT promoter mutations). Two-sided Wilcoxon rank sum test (n = 95 samples with sufficient mutation, copy number, and malignant cell data) were not corrected for multiple hypothesis testing. Boxplots span from the first to third quartiles, median values are indicated by a horizontal line, whiskers show 1.5× interquartile range, and outlier points are not shown. The violin plots surrounding the boxplots represent the continuous distribution of the data. d, Same as in Fig. 6a but for samples that could not be classified to an ecosystem.

Researchers used an artificial-intelligence model to reconstruct neural circuits in brain samples imaged using a light microscope.Credit: Tavakoli, Lyudchik et al./Nature

A trick that inflates tissue samples to 16 times their original size has allowed scientists to map intricate patterns of cells in mouse brains with a cheap-and-cheerful light microscope. The approach, which uses gels that expand in water, makes details visible down to individual synapses — the junctions between neurons. Researchers behind the technique have used artificial intelligence to create colourful maps that show how brain cells connect, which molecules they use to communicate and whether their signals excite or silence other cells.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa — a strain of bacterium that often causes antibiotic-resistant infections in hospitals — can produce an enzyme that can break down medical-grade plastic. Researchers found that the enzyme, dubbed Pap1, can break down a plastic called polycaprolactone that is commonly used in health care because of its biodegradable properties. The ability to break down plastic could explain why these microbes persist in hospital environments, says biomedical scientist and study co-author Ronan McCarthy.

After more than 20 years of trying, scientists have mapped the molecular structure of the taste receptor responsible for our perception of sweetness. They've also shown how two of the most widely consumed artificial sweeteners bind to the receptor and activate it. “This single receptor is responsible for our insatiable, never-ending attraction to sugar,” says neuroscientist and study co-author Charles Zuker. “And now that we have this structure, perhaps we can find ways to modulate its function.”

More than half of the children born in 2020 will face unprecedented exposure to heatwaves over their lifetime — even under a conservative projection for how climate change will unfold over the next 75 years. Under a more pessimistic forecast, that figure rises to 92%, compared with just 16% of those born in 1960. The study is among the first to pinpoint the generations and numbers of people that will experience an “unprecedented life” in terms of extreme heat, says climate scientist Wim Thiery.

Childhood solid tumours are unbearably cruel: they account for more than half of cancer-associated deaths in kids under 14 in the United States and few new cancer drugs have been approved for them. Now hope is on the horizon thanks to PROTACs — short for proteolysis-targeting chimeras — laboratory-made molecules that hijack the cell's protein-disposal machinery. Typical drugs gum up the business end of a protein to inhibit its activity, while PROTACs eliminate the protein altogether. And the technology could target many other cancers too, as well as other diseases. Hard-to-drug proteins inside cells have roles in nearly every disease.

Behavioural-health researcher Jason ‘Jace' Flatt has lost nearly US$5 million in federal grants because their research into health disparities experienced by LGBTQIA+ people is deemed ‘unscientific' by the Trump administration. But they are determined to continue. “These are my people, and I want to make sure they're taken care of,” says Flatt. “They're the reason I can be married to my husband, and they're the reason that I can be out at my job and not worry.”

Today I'm celebrating the one and only David Attenborough on his 99th birthday. Over the course of his 70-year career, the naturalist and documentarian has brought nature into our homes, unveiling the secrets of the world around us, championing conservation and inspiring millions.

Documentaries won't be Attenborough's only legacy: he also had a hand in swapping formerly white tennis balls to their now-emblematic yellow.

In January, Apple agreed to pay out $95 million to settle a class action lawsuit over claims its voice assistant Siri listened in on private conversations. Now, affected users have less than eight weeks to stake their claim to a slice of the cash.

The Lopez v Apple Inc. lawsuit was filed back in December, accusing Apple of recording private conversations as a result of unintended Siri activations, and then sharing that data with third parties. Two plaintiffs claim they had related advertisements served to them after having personal conversations about particular brands, with another alleging they received an ad for a medical treatment following a private discussion with a doctor.

This is not the first time Siri has been accused of eavesdropping. A whistleblower spoke to The Guardian about it in 2019, claiming external contractors assessing Siri's effectiveness were able to listen in on everything from criminal dealings to sexual encounters.

Apple stopped using these third parties shortly after, and in settling this case, Apple also denies all wrongdoing here. An Apple spokesperson told WIRED in January that “Siri data has never been used to build marketing profiles and it has never been sold to anyone for any purpose.”

That said, Apple clearly still wants the lawsuit to go away, and—under the settlement—owners or purchasers of Siri-enabled devices who have experienced an unintended Siri activation during a private conversation could be eligible for a payment of up to $100. Each person can submit a claim of up to $20 per device, for up to five devices.

The list of eligible devices includes iPhone, iPad, MacBook, Apple Watch, iMac, HomePod, Apple TV, and iPod touch—but the devices must have been bought and used between September 17, 2014, and December 31, 2024. The lawsuit is for US owners only.

If you think you're eligible for part of the payout, you must submit your claim before July 2, 2025. Some people will have received an email or postcard notifying them of their eligibility, along with a Claim Identification Code. If you did, then use this when applying. Otherwise, head to the webiste for the case website and use the Submit Claim page.

Start by choosing “New Claim.” You will need to submit your name and address, the email address associated with your Apple ID, and either a proof of purchase or the serial number and model name of each device you are claiming for.

You will have to declare that you experienced at least one unintended Siri activation during the stated window of time, and that at least one incident happened during a conversation intended to be “private or confidential.”

It's worth noting that the payment amount per Siri device is capped at $20, but the amount claimants actually receive could be less depending on the number of valid claims submitted. The final approval hearing to decide on the final amounts will take place on August 1, 2025, when the court will decide if the claim is “fair, reasonable and adequate.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","US Customs and Border Protection Plans to Photograph Everyone Exiting the US by Car","https://www.wired.com/story/cbp-face-recognition-exit-us-border/","Fri, 09 May 2025 17:12:18 GMT","

United States Customs and Border Protection plans to log every person leaving the country by vehicle by taking photos at border crossings of every passenger and matching their faces to their passports, visas, or travel documents, WIRED has learned.

The escalated documentation of travelers could be used to track how many people are self-deporting, or leave the US voluntarily, which the Trump administration is fervently encouraging to people in the country illegally.

CBP exclusively tells WIRED, in response to an inquiry to the agency, that it plans to mirror the current program it's developing—photographing every person entering the US and match their faces with their travel documents—to the outbound lanes going to Canada and Mexico. The agency currently does not have a system that monitors people leaving the country by vehicle.

“Although we are still working on how we would handle outbound vehicle lanes, we will ultimately expand to this area,” CBP spokesperson Jessica Turner tells WIRED.

Turner could not provide a timeline on when CBP would begin monitoring people leaving the country by vehicle.

She tells WIRED that CBP currently matches photos of people coming into the country with “all documented photos, i.e., passports, visas, green cards, etc,” and adds that all “alien/non-US citizens encounter photos taken at border crossing” are stored by CBP. “The encounter photos can be used for subsequent crossings to verify identity,” Turner says. She did not specify whether CBP may integrate additional photos or data sources in the future.

When asked, Turner says it's not currently evident that a purpose of the outbound face-matching system would be tracking self-deporations. “Not to say it won't happen in the future, though, with the way self-deportation is going,” Turner says. She later adds that the goal of an outbound system would be to “biometrically confirm departure from the US.” This differs from the purpose of tracking people coming into the US, she says, which also considers the “purpose and intent” of entering the country.

WIRED reported this week that CBP recently asked tech companies to send pitches on how they would ensure every single person entering the country by vehicle, including people two or three rows back, would be instantly photographed and matched with their travel documents. CBP has struggled to do this on its own. The results of a 152-day test of this system, which took place at the Anzalduas border crossing between Mexico and Texas, showed that the cameras captured photos of everyone in the car that met “validation requirements” for face-matching just 61 percent of the time.

Currently, neither CBP nor Immigration and Customs Enforcement have any publicly known tools for tracking self-deportations, aside from an ICE app that allows people to tell the agency when they leave the country.

Last month, ICE announced that it is paying the software company Palantir $30 million to build a tool called ImmigrationOS that would give the agency “near real-time visibility” on people self-deporting from the US, with the goal of having accurate numbers on how many people are doing so, according to a contract justification published a few days later.

When asked, CBP would not confirm or deny whether its monitoring of outbound vehicles would or could be integrated with ImmigrationOS. “CBP does not use Palantir Technologies,” Turner says. (CBP has paid for Palantir services three times, with the last payment in 2013.)

ICE has not specified where Palantir would get the data to power the ImmigrationOS. However, the agency notes that Palantir could create ImmigrationOS by configuring the case management system that the company has provided to ICE since 2014.

This case management system integrates all of the information ICE may have about a person from investigative records or government databases, according to a government privacy assessment published in 2016. At the time of the assessment, it stored information about people's physical attributes—like hair and eye color, height and weight, and any scars or tattoos—as well as any ""location-related data” from “covert tracking devices” and any data from license plate readers, which can provide a detailed travel history.

DHS noted in a 2024 report that CBP has struggled to get biometric data from people leaving the country over land—meaning, people traveling via ""cars, trains, buses, bicycles, trucks, and on foot.” The report says that CBP wants to create a “biometric-based departure program” to monitor when people considered aliens leave the country, which DHS notes is required under US law.

The Trump administration is strongly encouraging self-deportation. In March, the Department of Homeland Security revoked the legal status of more than half a million people from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela who were given temporary parole to stay in the US due to instability in their home countries. A judge temporarily blocked the move, but the government is challenging this in court.

In April, the Social Security Administration listed more than 6,000 of these people who had temporary parole as dead, as a way of effectively ending their financial lives in the US. DHS also sent emails to an unknown number of people claiming that their legal parole had been revoked and demanding them to self-deport. Then, this week, the Trump administration offered to pay people in the country illegally $1,000 for a plane ticket to self-deport.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","Trump's Surgeon General Pick Is Tearing the MAHA Movement Apart","https://www.wired.com/story/casey-means-surgeon-general-trump-rfk-controlled-opposition-vaccine/","Fri, 09 May 2025 18:40:44 GMT","

There are a lot of reasons to question President Donald Trump's decision to nominate Casey Means to be surgeon general. She is not currently licensed as a doctor, failed to finish her surgical residency, and has voiced anti-vaccine opinions and embraced unproven alternative medicine, including advocating for raw milk and talking to trees.

But her questionable credentials are not the reason why a large cohort of anti-vaxxers, extremists, and far-right figures are angry about the nomination, which Trump credits to health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

For figures like former Kennedy running mate Nicole Shanahan and renowned anti-vaccine activist Mike Adams, better known as the Health Ranger, Means is nowhere near extreme enough in her views, and is viewed as a “Manchurian asset.”

“She's not a health freedom advocate,” Adams wrote on X. “She's not a vaccine truther. She'll never recommend natural cancer cures or remedies. She's basically cosplaying as a MAHA champion. In reality, she is an establishment pick, and she'll push the establishment narrative. 100% guaranteed. Count on it.”

“It's very strange,” Shanahan wrote on X. “Doesn't make any sense. I was promised that if I supported RFK Jr. in his Senate confirmation that [Means would not] be working under HHS or in an appointment (and that people much more qualified would be). I don't know if RFK very clearly lied to me, or what is going on. It has been clear in recent conversations that he is reporting to someone regularly who is controlling his decisions (and it isn't President Trump).”

Responding to Shanahan's post, Michael Flynn, the disgraced former national security adviser, wrote, “It is another terrible personnel decision by @POTUS.”

Conspiracy theorist Laura Loomer, meanwhile, who has enough influence in the White House to get credit for a recent purge of national security staff, called for the nomination to be revoked, citing what she says is evidence that Means had been vaccinated against Covid-19 as proof of her unfitness.

The backlash is the latest in a series of criticisms of the way Kennedy is implementing his Make America Healthy Again (MAHA) agenda, with people who have in the past been his most vocal supporters now questioning whether he has become part of the establishment. Much of the criticism is coming from the anti-vaccine community, in which Kennedy himself was a prominent leader for many years. But many in that world see the policies Kennedy is implementing as head of the Department for Health and Human Services (HHS) as a failure to fulfil his campaign promises.

Means unquestionably has support from within the MAHA movement, with figures from the wellness world, where Means has a huge following, celebrating her nomination. “A superb choice for US Surgeon General,” Dr. Suneel Dhand wrote on Instagram. “Finally a doctor not owned by Big Pharma.”

But on the “health freedom” side of the movement, which is filled with outspoken anti-vaccine activists, the nomination was viewed as a disaster and further evidence that Kennedy is not really in charge. “I can't help but think this is a very carefully groomed and selected person,” Dr. Suzanne Humphries, who has falsely stated that the polio vaccine doesn't work, wrote on X. “Just about no clinical experience. Talks a great game about everything but vaccines.”

Means' nomination was announced on Wednesday after Trump withdrew his nomination of Dr. Janette Nesheiwat, a former Fox News contributor whose résumé has been questioned in recent weeks.

“Casey has impeccable ‘MAHA' credentials, and will work closely with our wonderful Secretary of Health and Human Services, Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., to ensure a successful implementation of our Agenda in order to reverse the Chronic Disease Epidemic, and ensure Great Health, in the future, for ALL Americans,” Trump wrote on Truth Social.

However, on Thursday when asked by a reporter why he chose Means, Trump admitted: “I don't know her, I listened to the recommendation of Bobby.”

Means, the White House, and Kennedy did not respond to requests for comment on the criticism about the nomination.

A spokesperson for HHS pointed WIRED to a post on X by Kennedy, in which he defended Means and suggested the criticism was coming from Big Pharma: “I have little doubt that these companies and their conflicted media outlets will continue to pay bloggers and other social media influencers to weaponize innuendo to slander and vilify Casey, the same way they try to defame me and President Trump,” Kennedy wrote.

When asked which criticism specifically Kennedy was referencing, HHS did not respond.

In an interview on the Fox News broadcast on Thursday evening, Kennedy dismissed Shanahan's claims he was in some way controlled, saying that “the entire leadership of this agency are renegades who are juggernauts against convention.”

The position of surgeon general is described by the HHS as “the nation's doctor,” tasked with “providing Americans with the best scientific information available on how to improve their health and reduce the risk of illness and injury.”

But many within the mainstream medical profession have raised serious questions about Means' ability to fulfil this role, given the 37-year-old's lack of credentials.

Means has not held an active license to practice medicine since 2019, and despite calling herself a “former surgeon” on her LinkedIn, Means never completed her surgical training at Oregon Health and Science University, dropping out a bit over four years into a five-year residency.

Means is also a proponent of “functional medicine,” a holistic approach to medicine that is viewed by many as pseudoscience because of the lack of robust scientific evidence to back up treatments and claims.

During the Covid-19 pandemic, Means wrote on Twitter that “many (if not most) Covid-19 deaths could be prevented w optimal metabolic health.” In an op-ed published by The Hill during the height of the pandemic, Means appeared to put the blame for people's deaths on their poor dietary choices, calling Covid-19 “a Darwinian moment for America” and adding that “Americans must build personal immunity defenses through radical changes in diet and exercise, or risk getting sick and dying.”

She also appears to be against hormonal birth control, telling Tucker Carlson that suppressing the menstrual cycle reflects “a disrespect of life.”

And despite the anger of leading anti-vaccine activists, Means has repeatedly voiced fringe and disproven views on the topic.

In May, in her newsletter, Means appeared to suggest childhood vaccines are linked to autism, which is not true. “There is growing evidence that the total burden of the current extreme and growing vaccine schedule is causing health declines in vulnerable children,” she wrote, linking to a blog about vaccines and autism. “This needs to be investigated.”

In November, responding to criticism about her failure to speak more about vaccines, Means wrote on X: “I have said innumerable times publicly I think vaccine mandates are criminal.”

Means has promoted her sister-in-law's raw smoothie company. Raw milk is a topic she appears to be passionate about. “When it comes to a question like raw milk, I want to be free to form a relationship with a local farmer, understand his integrity, look him in the eyes, pet his cow, and then decide if I feel safe to drink the milk from his farm,” she's said. The Food and Drug Administration says raw milk contains dangerous bacteria that “are responsible for causing numerous foodborne illnesses.”

Means has also repeatedly documented her embrace of decidedly nonscientific treatments and idiosyncratic views of the role physicians should play in patients' treatment. In a newsletter last year, she claimed that the body was a “radio receiver” to commune with a higher power and that a doctor's role was not to simply treat diseases, but to be “a steward of the physical body, to be a guide in the process of building a functional material body that is unimpaired by chronic illness and can then reach its highest purpose of gaining a clearer signal to God.”

For the anti-vaccine community, however, Means' nomination is a surefire sign that a conspiracy is afoot, whether you support her nomination or not.

In one particularly illuminating interaction on X on Thursday, Robert Malone, a doctor who claimed to have helped invent the mRNA vaccine before pushing vaccine conspiracy theories, defended Means by claiming there was a secret campaign underway to disrupt her appointment.

“Big pharma and big Ag are throwing money behind the conservative influencers as well as bots throwing dirt on Dr. Casey Means,” Malone wrote. “There are WAY too many comments coming in on this topic in opposition to this SG appointment. It reeks of bot farm activity.”

In response, fellow anti-vaccine activist Naomi Wolf, who has compared the Covid-19 vaccine to mass murder, hit back, writing that she was not a bot and that Means was “bad news” and her nomination had all the hallmarks of a “Silicon Valley astroturf” campaign.

The U.S. Department of Labor has dropped its investigation into Scale AI's compliance with the Fair Labor Standards Act, according to a source directly familiar with the matter. 

The FLSA is a federal law that regulates misclassification of employees as independent contractors and unpaid wages. TechCrunch first reported that Scale was the subject of such an investigation in March. 

Upwork and Hireart, two of Scale AI's HR partners that were also being investigated for FLSA compliance per Inc. magazine, are also no longer being investigated by the DOL, they each confirmed to TechCrunch.

Scale AI, which was valued last year at $13.8 billion, depends on an army of workers it categorizes as contractors to do critical AI work, like labeling images for Big Tech. 

However, Scale has been sued by ex-workers alleging they were underpaid and misclassified as contractors instead of employees, denying them access to benefits like sick leave.

It's not clear exactly why the DOL dropped the probe. San Francisco-based Scale AI declined to comment, while the DOL didn't respond to a request for comment. 

There's several possible reasons, though. 

A recent move from the DOL hints at a friendlier approach to classifying workers as contractors, with the agency announcing on May 1 that it was no longer enforcing, at least for now, a Biden-era rule which made this more difficult.

Scale AI is also seeking favor with the Trump administration. Its CEO Alexandr Wang attended Trump's inauguration (like many other tech CEOs) and has published a letter urging Trump to “win the AI war.” 

Meanwhile, Scale AI's former managing director Michael Kratsios was confirmed in March as the new director of the White House's Office of Science and Technology Policy.

The position involves advising the President on science and tech issues, and has no oversight over the DOL. Kratsios didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.

Remember last week when Aurora met a major milestone — just squeaking by under its own deadline — and launched a driverless self-driving truck service? Welp, this week Aurora made headlines again, but for a surprising change in leadership. 

Co-founder Sterling Anderson, who has been chief product officer, is resigning from his position and the board. No real word on what prompted his resignation, beyond some comments he made during the company's Q1 earnings call. “Leaving Aurora is one of the most difficult decisions I've ever made, especially given the exciting stage Aurora is at,” he said. “This is precisely what gave me the confidence that now is the right time.”

He didn't say exactly where he was going, either, except that it will be an “exciting external opportunity in a senior leadership role at an iconic global company.” 

I'll let you all place your bets. 

Aurora is pressing on without Anderson. The company announced during its earnings call that it will start sending its self-driving trucks out at night and during adverse weather conditions like rain or heavy wind by the second half of 2025. The company also plans to expand its driverless trucking route beyond Dallas to Houston, and into El Paso and Phoenix.

It's not every day a public company reverses course and goes private. But then again, these aren't normal times. Especially for any company caught up in the U.S.-China trade war. 

Take Zeekr, for instance. One year ago, the Chinese EV company debuted on the New York Stock Exchange. Now, parent company Geely Auto wants to take Zeekr private in response to the Trump administration's idea to kick Chinese companies off American stock exchanges.

Other deals that got my attention …

Bosch Ventures has a new $270 million fund that will continue its tradition of investing in deep tech startups. Managing director Ingo Ramesohl told TechCrunch the plan is to put more of its money into North American startups.

Investors who previously backed Indian Uber rival BluSmart have proposed a plan to inject another $30 million into the struggling cab-hailing startup, which abruptly halted operations last month. But there's a catch.

Breathe, a battery software startup, raised $21 million in a Series B round led by Kinnevik Online AB, the company exclusively told TechCrunch. Lowercarbon Capital and Volvo Cars Tech Fund participated.

DoorDash announced two major acquisitions as it expands into Europe. The company agreed to buy its U.K. rival Deliveroo for about £2.9 billion (around $3.87 billion) and separately said it is buying SevenRooms — which provides CRM, marketing, and operations software to help restaurants, hotels, and public venues with reservations and guest management — for $1.2 billion in cash.

Meanwhile, Uber was busy this week, acquiring companies and investing in them. 

Uber increased its investment into Chinese autonomous vehicle company WeRide by $100 million as part of an expanded partnership deal to bring the service to another 15 cities over the next five years. In a separate deal, Uber also acquired an 85% controlling stake in Trendyol Go, the online meal and grocery delivery business based in Istanbul, for about $700 million in cash. 

Here's a personnel switch I didn't expect. Mo Elshenawy, the former president and CTO of now-shuttered self-driving car company Cruise, was just named the chief technology officer at telehealth and wellness company Hims & Hers. I spoke to Hims & Hers co-founder and CEO Andrew Dudum, and he said he specifically focused on the AV industry to find the next CTO. Here's why. 

Nuro has started testing its AV tech on the Las Vegas Strip. I recently sat down with co-founder and president Dave Ferguson. Stay tuned for an update on why the company shifted its business model. 

Tesla‘s “Robotaxi” and “Cybercab” trademarks have hit a few roadblocks. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office denied Tesla's attempt to trademark the term “Robotaxi” in reference to its vehicles because it's too generic. Meanwhile, applications from Tesla for the trademark on the term “Cybercab” were halted because of companies pursuing similar “Cyber” trademarks.

Uber locked up partnerships with three Chinese autonomous vehicle companies — Pony AI, Momenta, and WeRide — in a bid to gobble up robotaxi market share in the Middle East and Europe. Footnote: These deals are not to operate in China. 

Waymo announced it has a new 239,000-square-foot factory in the Phoenix suburb of Mesa through a deal with Magna to build more than 2,000 autonomous Jaguar I-Pace vehicles. That obviously got a lot of attention. But I was most interested in finally learning the size of Waymo's existing commercial fleet, which is now 1,500. 

Wayve is making the rounds on the high-profile executive set. You might remember the video of Bill Gates in one of Wayve's autonomous test vehicles. Now it's Virgin Group founder Sir Richard Branson's turn. P.S. Branson is a Wayve investor. BTW, Fortune Brainstorm held its AI conference in London, and Wayve CEO and co-founder Alex Kendall was there. He had some interesting comments about the company's end-to-end approach and Tesla's Elon Musk.

Zoox paused its driverless testing program for more than a week and issued a voluntary recall of its software following a crash in Las Vegas.

The Cadillac Celestiq EV — yep, that monster — is here, and contributor Emme Hall has thoughts after spending a day behind the wheel. 

It's earnings season, and the U.S.-China trade war is starting to leave a scratch on the paint of automakers everywhere. And, well, I don't think we'll be able to buff it out.

Ford and General Motors pulled their guidance for the year, citing economic uncertainty related to Trump's tariffs. Meanwhile, Rivian said it will likely deliver fewer vehicles this year (40,000 to 46,000 EVs) than previously forecasted due to tariffs and other regulatory changes. Reminder: The company was already tracking for its third straight year with no volume growth before the guidance cut. There was some good news for Rivian, though: It generated gross profit (yeah I know, gross profit isn't exactly my fave, either). But this met a contractual milestone that unlocked about $1 billion in funding from Volkswagen Group as part of a joint venture with the German automaker.

Ford is raising the price of the all-electric Mustang Mach-E SUV and the Maverick pickup by as much as $2,000 due to the import taxes Trump is placing on vehicles made in Mexico.

Lucid Motors has been working through some quality “hiccups” in the early stages of delivering its long-awaited electric Gravity SUV.

Mitsubishi Motors is in talks with Foxconn to source an electric car model the Japanese automaker plans to sell in Australia and New Zealand in the latter half of 2026.

Tesla sales continue to slump across Europe despite an April EV sales swell.

Joby Aviation seems to be settling on 2026 for its first commercial passenger service, according to its first-quarter earnings report. The electric vertical takeoff and landing startup-turned-SPAC was targeting 2025, then was stating “early 2026.” Now it's just 2026, which suggests it might not be early next year.

Fortnite maker Epic Games and Spotify are testing Apple's new App Store policies by submitting apps for review that would have previously never been allowed. On Friday, both companies submitted new versions of their respective apps to Apple's App Review.

For Epic Games, it would mean the return of Fortnite to the App Store. Apple removed the game in 2020 and terminated Epic's account after the company challenged the App Store rules by adding support for direct payments in Fortnite, ahead of filing its antitrust lawsuit against Apple.

Spotify, meanwhile, hopes to allow its users to buy individual audiobooks directly and allow Premium subscribers to buy “top up” hours for audiobook listening. (These hours can be purchased when subscribers go over the 15 free hours they receive each month.)

The streamer's latest update comes on the heels of Apple's approval this week of the Amazon Kindle app,  which added a “Buy Book” button for the first time. It also follows the approval Spotify received last week, which let U.S. users access pricing information for its subscription plans inside its streaming app, among other things. 

In time, more apps will likely join Epic Games and Spotify to take advantage of the new App Store policies.

For tech companies like Epic and Spotify, the App Store policy change the judge required in the lawsuit is about boosting their bottom lines, but for smaller developers, it could impact their ability to exist at all, as it permits new business models to thrive.

The updated App Store policies were rolled out last week after Apple lost a major legal battle in the antitrust case filed by Epic Games, when a federal judge ruled that Apple had not followed the court's orders around in-app purchases. Though Apple largely won that lawsuit, the judge directed the tech giant to be more competitive when it comes to payment processing.

Instead of allowing developers to link out to their website to offer consumers another way to pay for things like virtual goods or subscriptions, Apple had been requiring developers to apply for that permission. If granted, developers then also had to format how the links appeared in their apps to Apple's liking, which included the use of “scare screens” to warn consumers of the dangers of purchases made outside Apple's walls.

Most importantly, Apple was continuing to charge a hefty commission on those web sales of 27%, down from 30% before the changes.

None of that was what the judge had in mind, so it forced Apple to drop its anticompetitive barriers and allow developers to link to web purchase options without any additional hoops to jump through, and without commissions.

...saying this as someone who benefits from it but also rarely uses sub-typing (""poodle"" type sub to ""dog"" type sub to ""animal"" type) or any sort of the other benefits that are commonly associated with typing. for me the benefit is code checking and code navigation of unfamiliar code bases

Type's can be fun and useful, and i'd love to see them incorporated into ruby in a tasteful way. i don't want it to become a new thing developers are forced to do, but there is a lot of utility from making them more available.

1. Flowsensitivity: It's a sure thing that in a dynamic language people use coding conventions that fit naturally to the runtime-checked nature of those types.  That makes flow-sensitive typing really important.2. Duck typing: dynamic languages and certainly ruby codebases I knew often use ducktyping.  That works really well in something like typescript, including really simple features such as type-intersections and unions, but those features aren't present in C#.3. Proof by survival: typescript is empirically a huge success.  They're doing something right when it comes to retrospectively bolting on static types in a dynamic language. Almost certainly there are more things than I can think of off the top of my head.Even though I prefer C# to typescript or ruby _personally_ for most tasks, I don't think it's perfect, nor is it likely a good crib-sheet for historically dynamic languages looking to add a bit of static typing - at least, IMHO.Bit of a tangent, but there was a talk by anders hejlsberg as to why they're porting the TS compiler to Go (and implicitly not C#) - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10qowKUW82U - I think it's worth recognizing the kind of stuff that goes into these choices that's inevitably not obvious at first glance.  It's not about the ""best"" lanugage in a vacuum, it's a about the best tool for _your_ job and _your_ team.

I think it's pretty usuable now, but there is scarring. The solution would have been much nicer had it been around from day one; especially surrounding generics and constraints.It's not _entirely_ sound, nor can it warn about most mistakes when those are in the ""here-be-dragons"" annotations in generic code.The flow sensitive bit is quite nice, but not as powerful as in e.g. typescript, and sometimes the differences hurt.It's got weird gotcha interactions with value-types, for instance but likely not limited to interaction with generics that aren't constrained to struct but _do_ allow nullable usage for ref types.Support in reflection is present, but it's not a ""real"" type, and so everything works differently, and hence you'll see that code leveraging reflection that needs to deal with this kind of stuff tends to have special considerations for ref type vs. value-type nullabilty, and it often leaks out into API consumers too - not sure if that's just a practical limitation or a fundamental one, but it's very common anyhow.There wasn't last I looked code that allowed runtime checking for incorrect nulls in non-nullable marked fields, which is particularly annoying if there's even an iota of not-yet annoted or incorrectly annotated code, including e.g. stuff like deserialization.Related features like TS Partial<> are missing, and that means that expressing concepts like POCOs that are in the process of being initialized but aren't yet is a real pain; most code that does that in the wild is not typesafe.Still, if you engage constructively and are willing to massage your patterns and habbits you can surely get like 99% type-checkable code, and that's still a really good help.

If it's an object, it's as simple as having a static method on a type, like FromA(A value) and then have that static method call the constructor internally after it has assembled the needed state. That's how you'd do it in Rust anyway. There will be a warning (or an error if you elevate those) if a constructor exits not having initialized all fields or properties. Without constructor, you can mark properties as 'required' to prohibit object construction without assignment to them with object initializer syntax too.

For the best experience you may want to add `<WarningsAsErrors>nullable</WarningsAsErrors>` to .csproj file.

I get that a lack of types is a problem for massive organizations but turning dynamic languages into typed languages is a time sink for solo developers and small organizations for zero performance benefit.  If I wanted a typed language to build web apps with I'd use Java or something.Hopefully Matz sticks to his guns and never allows type annotations at the language and VM level.

In Objective-C, you also pass messages to an object, and it could be anything you want. But it would output warnings that an object/class did not respond to a certain message. You could ignore it, but it would always result in a runtime error obviously.  [someObject missingMethod]

Swift is a much nicer language in terms of typing, and I have started replacing some smaller Ruby scripts with Swift. Mostly out of performance needs though. (Single file swift scripts)The lack of proper typechecking is one of the main reasons I would not use Ruby, especially in larger teams.Unittests are fun and all, but they serve a different purpose.

Cool.  I'm using Ruby for a startup because it's 10x more productive for building a webapp versus a compiled language and because I'm solo.And when I want typing I use something like C++ because I don't want to lose productivity without a major performance boost.

It's not be more like those, it's be more like helpful, author-friendly programming which is very much Ruby's ethos.Every time I think about ripping out all of the RBS sig files in my project because I'm tired of maintaining them (I can't use Sorbet for a few reasons), Steep catches a `nil` error ahead of time. Sure we can all say ""why didn't you have test coverage?"" but ideally you want all help you can get.

   with db.session() as session:
      ... use the session ...

I can type session. and the IDE knows what kind of object it is and offers me valid choices.  If there's a trouble with it,  it's that many Pythonic idioms are too subtle,  so I can't fully specify an API like   collection = db[""some_collection""]
   collection.filter(lambda doc: doc[""amount""].as_integer() > 500)
   collection.filter({""name"": ""whatever""})
   collection.filter({""field"": lambda f: f[""subfield""] = jsonb({""a"":1, ""b"":""2})})

not to mention I'd like to be able to vary what gets returned using the same API as SQLAlchemy so I could write   collection.filter(..., yield_per=100)

and have the type system know it is returning an iterator that yields iterators that yields rows as opposed to an iterator that yields rows.  It is simple, cheap and reusable code to forward a few fetch-control arguments to SQLAlchemy and add some unmarshalling of rows into documents but if I want types to work right I need an API that looks more like Java.

Well types are a form of test performed by the compiler.

- the dynamic piece is exactly what allows you to ship quickly- most slowness is due to waiting for IO (database or external API calls) and can be easily solved by handling expensive work in the background- concurrency is solved by having more web workers, and web workers are cheap (database is the bottleneck anyway)

Dynamic languages in large systems have been controversial since there have been dynamic languages.  It was routine for heroic AI systems of the golden age (1980s) to be prototyped in Lisp and then be rewritten in C++ for speed.  You'd hear stories about the people who wrote 500,000 lines of Tcl/Tk to control an offshore oil drilling rig and the folks who think ""C++ is a great language for programming in the large"" but who don't seem to mind having a 40 minute build.

I think that's an oversimplification that doesn't do justice to the complexity or difficulty of the issue. Both sides of the argument can make a really good case.Slow programs (due to language or other factors) increase server costs, but that's only part of the problem. They also increase operational and architectural complexity, meaning you spend more time, effort and specialized expertise on these secondary effects. Note that some of that shimmers through in the article, mentioning ""CI flakiness"": It's probable that the baseline performance and its effects is a factor there. Performance has a viral effect on everything, positively or negatively. They also complain about async not being a part of the story here, which is also a performance issue.On the other hand, this shop has hundreds of developers. That means deep expertise, institutional knowledge, tooling, familiarity with each line of code and a particular style that they follow. Ruby is also a language that is optimized for programmer experience, and is apparently a fun language to work with. All those things are very essential investments, individually and as a whole. Then we can assume that they use Ruby like most glue languages are used and either write C/C++ modules where appropriate or attach high performing components into their architecture (DBs, queues, caches etc.)The reason I'm harping on this point is because I think it's important to acknowledge a more complete reality than the ""hardware is cheap, people are expensive"" statement. I assume it's very likely a throwaway line and not a hill you'd die on. But it masks two interesting and important things: Performance matters a lot and impacts cost transitively, but people and culture ultimately dominate for very good reasons.

Personally I would judge an engineering manager on how seriously they take issues with the build.  The industry standard is that a junior dev having trouble with the build is told he's on his own,  the gold standard is that he gets a checklist and if the checklist doesn't work it is treated as if the dev had said ""I have cancer"".A fast language can be slow to build.

The only velocity metric which needs to be measured is the build time.At the moment I have a side project I'm doing which is a port of the arangodb API to postgresql intended to bring a few arangodb applications into the open source world.  I test at the level where I make a new postgres db and do real operations against it because I really need to do that to soak up all the uncertainty in my mind,  never mind test the handful of stored procs that the system depends on.

San Francisco's widely relied upon public transportation system, Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART), went down early Friday morning due to a “computer networking problem,” according to city officials. The outage brought the entire system to a halt at around 5:00 am local time, forcing commuters to quickly find an alternative travel plan. BART officials announced that service had been restored across the entire system around 9:30 am local time, though a spokesperson for the agency told The San Francisco Standard, “Riders should expect residual major delays as we ramp back up.”

The system's shutdown, while temporary, caused a considerable number of logistical issues for riders. According to the San Francisco Chronicle, the transit system averaged about 175,000 riders on weekdays during the month of March. With BART out of order, riders were forced to shift their commute to buses, ride shares, and other alternatives. Some of those options are cost-prohibitive—San Francisco ranked in the top 10 for most expensive cities for ride sharing. The Chronicle spoke to one person who opted to wait for the trains to start running again rather than take a Lyft that would have cost $70 to get to his destination.

To accommodate the travelers stranded by BART, the San Francisco Municipal Railway offered additional buses and extra trains on some lines. The San Francisco Bay Ferry also used larger boats to make room for more riders, per the Chronicle.

The cause of the outage is still unclear, but a spokesperson for BART did further explain what happened to the SF Standard: “BART was unable to properly power up our train control system, which prevented us from safely operating trains,” the spokesperson said. According to the Chronicle, BART Chief Communications Officer Alicia Trost said the issue occurred after overnight maintenance work, but did not say that was specifically the cause. Instead, she said there were “a lot of different reasons” that could cause the issue. She did rule out the possibility that it was a cyber attack that knocked the system out.

Outages have gotten rarer in recent years for BART, according to the agency's own data, but delays have remained a major problem. The transport system has undergone cost-cutting measures, as well, which has led to some issues going unaddressed and a hiring freeze being put in place, though the city has spent on increasing police presence on the transit system and new methods for cracking down on unpaid fares.

The best aftermarket build plates to improve your 3D printer.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


The build plate is at the literal foundation of your 3D printer, and it can determine the success or failure of your prints more than any other feature. A single greasy fingerprint can be all it takes to turn a delicate model into a pile of spaghetti. And yet, we take the stock build plates that ship with our printers for granted, especially if we paid high dollar for the 3D printer itself.

🟦🟥 Stock Build Plates 🟥 🟦

Before we dive into aftermarket print surfaces, a word on stock plates. Every modern 3D printer we've reviewed since 2024 has come with a very usable build plate. Textured PEI flex plates have become somewhat standard, and that's a good thing. If you're buying a printer today, you may be quite happy with your stock plate. You may only need this list if your build surface has been scratched, worn down, or otherwise damaged.

3D printing has been constantly evolving, with new technologies emerging every year. My first printer had a rudimentary glass build plate held down with binder clips, but now I have a plate with my own logo embedded right in the center.

There's a buffet of build plate options out there: flexible, coated, textured, dual-sided, and optimized for specific filaments and print styles. But not all build surfaces are created equal. Here are the best third-party build surfaces you can buy for your 3D printer to get that first layer buttery smooth.

Our expert review:

Tyson Build Plates are a revolution in 3D printing build surfaces. The T-95 plate is made from a thick Tempered 1095 spring steel with a proprietary coating that is truly universal. The plate can handle everything from PLA to PEEK, and the only limits are from the machine you put it on.

We tested this plate on the Qidi Tech Plus 4 and ran PLA, PETG, TPU, ASA, and Nylon without glue stick or any adhesion aid. Prints pop off easily and release on their own when allowed to cool. The bottom of the print is smooth and glass-like.

For an extra charge, the plate can bear your logo or an etched pattern that will transfer to the bottom of the print.



Our expert review:

Glacier is one of BIQU's two new cold plates, which rely on texture and Arctic Fairy Dust to hold down prints with minium heat. Ok, we're kidding about the fairy dust, but there's definitely some magic to the “porous oleophobic polymer coating” used on the top surface. Glacier plates have superior holding powers and defy dirt and grease from ordinary handling, and are scratch resistant. They work for every material without a need for gluestick, even TPU.

Because the Glacier is a cold plate, it will continue to hold at room temperature, which is nice if you're worried about power outages. Most prints come off with a flex after it's cooled a bit, but smaller things – like flexi animals – may need light persuasion. If you still have problems, 10 minutes in the freezer will help.



Our expert review:

Frostbite is the other new cold plate from BIQU, and could have been called “Rottweiler” considering how well it holds on to prints. It has a courser texture than Glacier, and holds prints at low temperatures. The plate is almost TOO sticky, but if you've ever had just one segment of a 3-day print pop off, you'll appreciate the holding power of this plate. Frostbite plates defy dirt and grease from ordinary handling, and are also scratch resistant.

Because the Frostbite is a cold plate, it will continue to hold at room temperature, which is nice if you're worried about power outages. Prints need more than a little flex to pop off this plate, and definitely need to cool down before you even try. If you still have problems, 10 minutes in the freezer will help.



Our expert review:

Like Oreos dipped in chocolate, SliceWorx had a brilliant idea: what if we dip a PEI Flex plate in…rubber? Ok, it's not rubber, and they aren't saying what the “high quality polymer” actually is, but rubber is pretty close. The coated surface of SliceWorx's dipped plates is pure genius for those of us hooked on tiny articulated prints with a high failure rate.

Like the FrostBite plate from BQ, these dipped wonders are strictly for cool filaments like PLA and PETG. They need to be cooled a bit before flexing to remove your prints.



Our expert review:

Wham Bam PEI flex plates are no longer “revolutionary” after manufactures adopted PEI sheets for themselves. But their commitment to quality ensures that when you need a better build plate, Wham Bam has you covered with every size imaginable.

It's line of PEI plates are known for consistent quality and come in both a smooth sheet that gives a shiny surface, or a baked on textured plated.



Our expert review:

A holographic build plate has a specialized surface that leaves a shimmering “holographic” pattern on the bottom of the print. The plate has an ultra fine textured surfaces that diffracts light and can be transferred to the PLA print.

The holographic sticker is easily scratched, so great care should be taken when removing prints. The effect is also spoiled by finger oils and glue stick, so you'll need to keep the plates super clean and additive free, which is why PLA is the go-to filament for these special effects plates.

The plates do not have any special gripping powers, so you'll need to have a well tuned printer, and slow your speed for the best chances.



Our expert review:

Ember Prototypes knocked our socks off when it introduced custom PEI plates that bore whatever artwork you wanted to show off on your prints or the printer itself. The plates are not laser cut, but rather uses a proprietary coating that leaves a raised image on the plate that can transfer to the bottom of your print.

While they have some generic artwork available, the best plates are the ones where you supply the art. I had one made up with a hexagon pattern and my logo in the center, which is a little hit or miss as to what will end up on the finished print. Because these are bespoke plates, theres's no refunds, so double-check your artwork before sending it over.

We test all the build plates we recommend.

Our favorite test model for build plate adhesions is the humble “Mini Cute Octopus” by McGybeer – one in each corner – run at default speeds for the printer. We used a Bambu Lab P1P, A1, A1 Mini, QIDI Plus 4 and MK4s, all capable of running at an average speed of 200mm/s. It's eight tiny tentacles each have 5 sections, meaning there's 40 individual sections, some as small as 6x11mm.

I tested each printer's stock plate – many of which failed without the help of glue stick - before switching to the aftermarket plate. Each plate had a few weeks of regular printing in addition to the test prints. The Octopus models will be given to children (for free) at 3D printing festivals when they visit my table, so there is no plastic wasted.



🟢 What's the best build plate surface to print on?

A clean one! Many first layer issues can be fixed by washing your build plate with hot soapy water, then drying the plate with a lint free cloth. Preheating the bed and using a little “purple” washable glue stick can also help give some extra stick for your models.

🟢 What's the best build plate surface for PLA?

Textured PEI is one of the best all around surfaces, very affordable and generally works well for easy going PLA.

🟢 What's the best build plate for PETG?

PETG is known to bond with just about anything, but a good clean, smooth PEI works best. And it never hurts to add a little glue stick for insurance.

🟢 What's the best build plate for ABS?

We highly recommend the Tyson Build plate, a specialized high temperature plate that works for all filaments and absolutely excels at high temperatures.

 May 09, 2025  

MPs have urged the government to overhaul gambling laws to tackle gambling-related harm. 

In a letter to Ashley Dalton, the minister in England responsible for overseeing health issues associated with gambling and other addictions, the Commons Health and Social Care Committee called for tougher regulations on gambling advertising, promotion, and sponsorship.

It cited serious harms linked to gambling, including financial, physical and mental health consequences.

In an evidence session last month, the committee heard that gambling had become “prevalent and normalised” in society, with 80% of the population being exposed to some form of gambling advertising on a weekly basis.

One academic witness described “intrusive and targeted” promotions by gambling firms, with accounts of “people receiving offers of free bets in the middle of the night”, the letter said.

Committee chair Layla Moran MP recommended banning gambling ads before the 9 pm watershed, curbs on sports sponsorship, and restrictions on content designed to appeal to children and young people.

Moran also noted evidence from the charity Gambling with Lives concerning the lack of public awareness about gambling harms, including suicide.

The 2023 National Suicide Prevention Strategy identified gambling as one of six factors linked to suicide at a population level. The committee highlighted evidence that an estimated 117 and 496 suicides were associated with problem gambling or gambling disorder in England in 2021-2022.

A lack of awareness amongst coroners of the link between gambling and suicide, and the fact that problem gambling, unlike smoking, alcohol, or drug use, was rarely recorded in an individual's medical notes meant that most gambling deaths were not properly investigated in a way that provided justice for families or that learns the vital lessons which could save lives, Moran stressed. 

The letter called on the Department of Health and Social Care to outline what steps it would to raise awareness of suicides linked to problem gambling amongst coroners and others involved in the investigation of sudden deaths.

The committee recommended that the Office for Health Improvement and Disparities (OHID) should develop a public information campaign about gambling risks.

A 2023 review by Public Health England, whose public health functions have since been taken on by the OHID, estimated that 0.5% of the adult population had a problem with gambling, 3.8% were gambling at at-risk levels, and 7% were negatively impacted by another person's gambling. 

Guidance from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence earlier this year recommended that primary care clinicians should ask patients about their gambling habits.

A government spokesperson acknowledged receipt of the committee's letter and said it would formally respond in due course. In an emailed statement, the spokesperson added that the government recognised that gambling could be “hugely damaging for people and their loved ones” and that it is “committed to better protecting everyone from these harms”.

Dental caries, or tooth decay, is a common oral health condition that often causes significant pain and discomfort and may even lead to tooth loss. In severe and untreated cases, bacterial infection combined with the host's immune response can cause bone resorption, or the breakdown of bone tissue in the tooth root. Moreover, traditional treatments for advanced dental caries, such as surgery, can result in bone defects that require complex bone grafting procedures.

Building on this knowledge, bone tissue engineering and dental tissue regeneration have gained the attention of researchers worldwide. Recent reports suggest that microRNAs (miRNAs)-small, non-coding ribonucleic acid sequences-play a key role in bone tissue regeneration. However, the underlying mechanisms and pathways regulated by miRNAs remain unclear.

To investigate the intrinsic processes involved in dental bone repair, a team of researchers led by Associate Professor Nobuyuki Kawashima, graduate student Ziniu Yu, and Professor Takashi Okiji from the Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Institute of Science Tokyo (Science Tokyo), Japan, conducted a series of innovative experiments using human dental pulp stem cells (hDPSCs) and mice. Their findings were published in Volume 23 and Issue 189 of the Journal of Translational Medicine on February 16, 2025.

""hDPSCs are a type of mesenchymal stem cell that have the ability to differentiate into either odontoblasts or osteoblasts, key players in dental tissue repair,"" explains Kawashima. ""In our study, we focused on a molecule called miRNA-27a, which we found to exert an anti-inflammatory effect by suppressing the NF-κB pathway but may also promote tissue regeneration by activating Wnt and BMP signaling. By overexpressing miRNA-27a in hDPSCs, we explored how it might guide these cells toward becoming hard tissue-forming cells.""

Initially, the scientists utilized bioinformatics-based tools to investigate the effects of miRNA-27a overexpression in hDPSCs. They identified dickkopf-related protein 3 (DKK3) and sclerostin domain-containing protein 1 (SOSTDC1) as the primary target genes regulated by miRNA‑27a. In addition to DKK3 and SOSTDC1, other negative regulators of the wingless-type integration site family (Wnt) signaling pathway which play a key role in forming new bone and dental tissue. In addition to these, including axis inhibition protein 2 and adenomatous polyposis coli, were also down-regulated in hDPSCs overexpressing miRNA-27a. This suggests that miRNA-27a helps lift these biological brakes, allowing the cells to turn on bone-forming signals more efficiently.

In addition to stimulating the Wnt pathway, miRNA‑27a was found to significantly influence the odonto/osteoblastic differentiation of hDPSCs and activate the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) pathway. Activation of both the Wnt and BMP pathways suggested that hard-tissue-forming cells were promoted through differentiation of hDPSCs.

To validate their findings, the researchers transplanted collagen scaffolds containing miRNA-27a-expressing hDPSCs into the artificial defects introduced on the calvarial bone of mice. Subsequent analyses revealed the formation of new bone-like tissue, which was absent in the control group.

Kawashima concludes by highlighting the therapeutic potential of the research: ""These results suggest that miRNA-27a could play a pivotal role in encouraging bone-like tissue formation. This opens up exciting possibilities for advancing regenerative therapies aimed at repairing dental and craniofacial defects.""

In summary, this study underscores the significant translational potential of miRNA-27a in promoting dental tissue regeneration.

NWSL and WPSL are in the process of creating Division 2 leagues...how will this work?

If you buy something from an SB Nation link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement.

The women's soccer pyramid could be expanding in 2026, and we discuss it on Episode 153!

The NWSL has submitted a bid to create a second division league called NWSL Division 2 that would serve as a reserve league beginning in 2026. It would begin with 8 teams, with every NWSL team eventually having a reserve team in the league. There is also WPSL Pro, who also announced their intention to launch in 2026 with 15 teams. We quickly go through the new proposed leagues.

We then get into the evolving women's soccer pyramid in the United States and some of the things that these leagues will need to overcome. We also discuss soccer markets that are increasingly crowded as leagues rush to ride the coat tails of the 2026 World Cup. The eye should be on sustainability, and the legacy of 2026 doesn't have to mean that a league rushes to launch in 2026. As more information comes out about these leagues, we can continue to debate the pros and cons, but it's a discussion worth having to make sure that women's soccer remains successful and is not set up in a hurried manner that increases the potential for failure.

The USWNT star gave her thoughts on her career as she was inducted to the US Soccer Hall of Fame

If you buy something from an SB Nation link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement.

The best athletes come in a wide, wide variety of personality types. There are those who quietly go about their craft and go nearly unnoticed as they put together impressive and even legendary careers. Others bring attention to their every move and seem to bask not only in the praise of their success but the criticism of their failures. Some are intense, others playful, philosophical, or possessed by a single-minded focus on their work. In short, there is no one single archetype that makes an athlete world class.

Their careers also come at a cost and there are several sides to every athlete. Tom Brady was successful and played well into his 40s because he worked harder than nearly any athlete in terms of practice, nutrition, sleep, and even renegotiated his contract for teammates to be able to play on his teams. He was also successful because he choose football over his family. Michael Jordan had such a single minded focus on winning and pushed his teammates so hard that a fist fight with Steve Kerr was good for their relationship ahead of a season when the Chicago Bulls went 72-10. 

Carli Lloyd can say she is in the company of the greatest athletes ever and may lay claim to being the greatest American soccer player in history. She is second most in caps, fifth most in assists, and third most in goals. Those stats were racked up while spending a significant part of her career finding her best role on the team moving from defensive midfield to no. 10. Lloyd had mental qualities and embodied the USWNT's ability to impose unrelenting pressure on opponents through determination, athleticism, and skill. On a team of stars she was also capable of putting the team on her back. 

It's worth revisiting her 2015 World Cup Final performance against Japan which may be the single greatest individual performance the sport has seen at that level. Lloyd scored three goals in 16 minutes including an absolute worldie from the center circle. She is the only player to score a hat trick in regulation during in a World Cup Final. 

Making it that much more impressive is that Lloyd had to turn her career around to reach that point. She was cut from the USWNT U-21 team and then connected with personal coach James Galanis to reach her goal of playing for the full national team. He had high expectations telling her, “the first thing you need to change is your mind. And if you want to play for the full team, this sport has to be No. 1 in your life, before your boyfriend, before your family, before anyone.” 

Lloyd took that to heart and won a pair of Gold Medals and World Cups. She scored the game winner in the 2008 Olympic final... and both goals in a 2-1 win over Japan to win gold in 2012. She also scored a brace to win a bronze in 2020. Her individual training brought her to six World Cups, the most of any player in history. However, Galanis also influenced Lloyd to push away her family for the better part of a decade.

However, putting soccer No. 1 in her life came at a cost. Four years since retiring, Lloyd has had time to reflect on her life and career and shared her perspective during her induction into the US Soccer Hall of Fame. At the event she questioned if it was worth it speaking about parts of her that have emerged since retiring and becoming a mother, “Unlike during my playing career, I have been present. I have allowed myself to be vulnerable, emotional, and fully engaged in every moment I get to spend with her.” She also mentioned that she was an emotionless robot and wasn't there for teammates in ways they needed. 

Does she regret it? While she may have judgements about her time as a player and who she was as a person, that ruthless dedication to winning may not be that far from the surface. In typical Lloyd fashion she said, “As lonely and difficult as the journey was at times, I would do it all over again.” 

That said, she is aware of the cost saying, “There was nothing I loved more than winning, but winning comes at a cost, and I paid that price.” In Lloyd's case, becoming a ruthless competitor spilled took away from her personal life as it does for so many other great athletes. Her comments are a reminder that behind the moments that transcend the possible are human beings who have made choices and sacrifices to find glory.

Sergiño Dest may be a key player for the U.S. men's national team, but the defender has still yet to speak with head coach Mauricio Pochettino.

Dest returned to the pitch in March after he was sidelined for nearly a year with an ACL tear. The PSV fullback has made four total appearances this season, having also dealt with muscle injuries since his return.

Prior to his injury, Dest was locked in as the USMNT's starting right back. Though his importance to the national team has been unquestioned when healthy, Dest told CBS Sports show ""Morning Footy"" this week that he's only been in touch with Pochettino's assistants since the coach took over last fall.

Asked if he'd spoken to Pochettino yet, Dest replied: ""I've had conversations with assistant coaches, obviously they're watching me. We keep in contact but it's different to meet them all in person, to be in camp, be with the players again. Because obviously I miss the players as well.""

Dest is hoping to make his USMNT return this summer for the Gold Cup, which kicks off in June. The Concacaf tournament will be the last official matches the U.S. plays before co-hosting the 2026 World Cup.

""It's been way too long,"" said the 24-year-old, who last played for the USMNT in March 2024.

""We obviously have a World Cup coming up, and I want to spend as much time as possible with the players to be in the best shape to be ready for the World Cup. We have some work to do as a team.""

Speaking on the ""Call It What You Want"" show, former USMNT goalkeeper Tony Meola said it was a surprise to hear there's been no contact between the coach and one of his key players — even if he had been injured.

""I'm surprised Pochettino has not spoken to him,"" Meola said. ""Because I gotta think anyone from [U.S. Soccer vice president of sporting Oguchi Onyewu] down to whoever's in Mauricio Pochettino's ear that Sergiño Dest's name was going to come up at some point — he's going to be part of this process at some point. I am a little bit surprised by this.""

On the other hand, former USMNT striker Charlie Davies said that Pochettino was likely focused on communicating solely with the players who were available

""I'm not surprised. I think there's a lot of things at play now, and Mauricio Pochettino is clearly still trying to catch up to get up to speed,"" Davies said.

""And he probably was thinking, 'I've got to talk with the players that I have at the moment that I can use. I can't even think about what's next.' He's got to deal with everything in the moment.""","{'href': 'https://prosoccerwire.usatoday.com', 'title': 'Pro Soccer Wire'}","soccer"

As Europe's domestic seasons slowly draw to a close, the excitement builds for the showcase of football on show this summer as the USA hosts the FIFA Club World Cup, with every game live on DAZN. 

The tournament has been revamped for 2025 and will now see 32 of the world's greatest teams compete in a new format akin to a major international competition. 

It means fans in America and beyond will get to experience the buzz of a major finals, a year before they co-host the World Cup in 2026, a feeling that US legend Landon Donovan is already looking forward to. 

Speaking exclusively to DAZN, the former Everton, Bayern Munich and LA Galaxy player believes the US is the perfect setting for fans to come together and experience a feast of tournament football. 

""It is a World Cup, but just with your club team, right? That is quite literally what it is,"" he said.

""The beauty of the World Cup is that I've gone now as a fan and I've gone as a player, and I went when I was 12 years old in the Rose Bowl from my first ever professional soccer game that I got to see. I watched Argentina play Romania that day.

""You can sit at a table with someone from Algeria, next to someone from Sweden, next to someone from Argentina, next to someone from Egypt, and they're all hanging out, drinking beer, having fun and enjoying it together. 

""They don't speak the language. Nobody knows what anyone's saying, but they're just having fun together. And it's gonna be the same. 

""And the beauty of having it in America is that there will be Al Ahly fans, Boca Junior fans, Inter Milan fans, and obviously MLS fans. 

""I don't think there's another country in the world where you'd have fans from literally every single team participating that are gonna show up and support their teams.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=club+world+cup","Lothar Matthäus: Lionel Messi, Inter Miami can ""make a run"" at FIFA Club World Cup","https://www.mlssoccer.com/news/lothar-matthaus-lionel-messi-inter-miami-can-make-a-run-at-fifa-club-world-cup","Fri, 09 May 2025 15:23:07 GMT","



From Inter Miami CF's home ground of Chase Stadium to anywhere else in the world a soccer ball is being kicked around, the odds of seeing a Lionel Messi jersey are always high.

It's a phenomenon that even Germany and Bayern Munich legend Lothar Matthäus notices in his own country, despite his homeland producing some of the game's all-time greats.

“He is an idol for most kids. Not only in America. In Germany, too,” said Matthäus, who, like the superstar Argentine No. 10, has the rare distinction of winning both a FIFA World Cup and Ballon d'Or award.

“I have a son. He's 11 years old, and I sometimes follow his football games. And when they have training sessions, you see a lot of Messi shirts,"" he said. ""The old shirt from Barcelona, the new shirt from Inter Miami.

“This means that the name Messi is so important for football, not only what he's doing on the field, [but] what he's doing outside the field.”

That's the power of Messi and the Inter Miami project he's spearheaded since mid-2023, transforming the Herons into a global attraction with the help of fellow Barça alums Luis Suárez, Sergio Busquets and Jordi Alba.

The 2024 MLS Supporters' Shield winners and 2023 Leagues Cup champions are just over a month away from their next high-profile venture: competing at this summer's FIFA 2025 Club World Cup in the United States as the host side of the expanded, 32-team tournament that runs from June 14 to July 13.

Seattle Sounders FC, via their 2022 Concacaf Champions Cup (née League) title, will also represent Major League Soccer at the competition, while LAFC are set to face LIGA MX titans Club América for Club León's recently vacated spot.

For Matthäus, Messi gives Miami an unrivaled edge in a highly competitive Group A that also features Al Ahly (Egypt), FC Porto (Portugal) and Palmeiras (Brazil).

“It's not too much pressure because Messi has had pressure all his life: World Cup finals, Copa América, national [team] games, club games, Champions League finals, El Clásico in Spain between Real Madrid and Barcelona,” the five-time World Cup veteran said.

“He knows what pressure means.”

While Matthäus believes Messi and Miami can “make a run” at the CWC, the current pundit and Bayern Munich ambassador envisions an all-European semifinal bracket, given the sporting and financial implications of the competition that will distribute an unprecedented $1 billion prize pool.

“This is a tournament where you can win a very important title: best club in the world. And a lot of money,” he said. “I think every team is motivated.

“… They'll [be] playing with their best first XI, they will give their best to win the title.”

Still, Matthäus isn't taking Miami, Seattle and possibly LAFC lightly, given the worldwide exposure the league has received in recent years thanks to Messi and its historic broadcasting deal with Apple via MLS Season Pass.

“Twenty or 15 years ago, it was not possible for us Germans to watch MLS on our TVs,” he said. “Now it's possible and you can see how football [in the United States] is getting focus from other countries.”

#FIFACWC 2025: Group A. 🔢

This summer's Club World Cup comes a year before the United States will co-host the 2026 FIFA World Cup with Canada and Mexico. It's a full-circle moment for a country that hosted its first World Cup in 1994 - a watershed event that led to the birth of Major League Soccer.

Matthäus, who participated in that World Cup six years before spending the 2000 season with the New York/New Jersey MetroStars (now New York Red Bulls), is excited for how both upcoming tournaments will play out.

“I think now, especially a year before the World Cup starts in the U.S. in 2026, this is good preparation for the organization in the U.S. - the stadiums, the security and everything,” he said.

“… It's a good test for the World Cup in 2026, and the clubs are motivated.”

According to Matthäus, that motivation will make for some riveting club soccer across the United States come this summer.

“Everything is possible,” he said. ""Like at the World Cup in 2026, you have the favorites and you have the teams who are maybe not so famous, but make surprises.

“And this is football.”","{'href': 'https://www.mlssoccer.com', 'title': 'MLSsoccer.com'}","soccer"

With just over a year until the 2026 FIFA World Cup takes the United States, Canada, and Mexico by storm, fans might need to start squirreling cash away now in order to afford tickets.

The first packages of World Cup tickets went on sale earlier this week in the form of hospitality packages on the higher end of the pay scale. 

While many fans likely won't be able to afford the suites that start at $3,500 and run as high as over $70,000, the average ticket price won't be much better. 

As reported by Adam Crafton of The Athletic, the united bid for the World Cup estimated that the average cost of a group stage ticket would be around $305.

Of course, non-hospitality tickets have yet to go on sale and those prices could change drastically between now and then.

But football fans have already voiced their anger on social media over the tournament that has been a pet project of President Donald Trump.

Full-session hospitality tickets for every game at MetLife Stadium cost up to $73,000

'305 for group stage tickets?? Weasels. Thieves. Rat bastards. Robbery in broad daylight and FIFA's holding the flashlight,' one user posted on X, formerly Twitter.

Another remarked, 'Hmmm that's quite expensive.'

'Made by the poor, stolen by the rich,' said another user.

'Way to ruin the world cup,' one user complained.

'Can almost see it now, half empty stadiums and terrible atmosphere. They don't want the average working person anymore. All corpo and celebrity's,' predicted another.

One post read, 'America hosting a world cup is woke nonsense and the stadium and fans are cringe.'

'Don't send a world cup to the USA ever again,' one person posted.

Another remarked, 'Pure f**kery, FIFA is literally extorting the US market.'















Fans have taken their anger to social media to express their outrage at FIFA and the tournament

Among the ticket packages already on sale in hospitality includes a full eight-game package for every match in New York - including the Round of 32, Round of 16, and the Final.

Those tickets start at $25,800 and balloon up to $73,200 for the higher end.

On the opposite coast, a similar package is being sold for Los Angeles - where the United States national team will play its first and final games of the group stage. SoFi Stadium is also set to host two Round of 32 games and a quarterfinal match.

Tickets for LA will begin at $20,300 and go up to $35,350.

Among the full-slate ticket packages, the cheapest could be found in Santa Clara in the Bay Area - where fans can pay $8,275 for tickets to all six matches to be played at the Levi's Stadium, including one Round of 32 match. 

The draw for the World Cup will take place in December.

ATLANTA, Ga. (Atlanta News First) - A busy MARTA station in Downtown Atlanta with an often-confusing name will now be rebranded in time for the FIFA World Cup.

During a meeting Thursday, MARTA's board of directors approved renaming the Georgia World Congress Center/CNN Center station to the Sports, Entertainment and Convention District, or SEC, station.

Along with the World Congress Center and the former CNN Center, the station sits right next to State Farm Arena and near Mercedes-Benz Stadium, which will host eight World Cup games next summer.

RELATED: Atlanta chosen as a host city for 2026 FIFA World Cup

MARTA leaders decided to rename the station as the more generic SEC District to cut down on confusion for visitors attending the games.

The name is also out of date. In April 2024, the new owners of the iconic CNN Center building announced they were renaming it “The Center.”

Signs and maps will be updated by Jan. 1, nearly six months before the first matches.

“The world coming to Atlanta for FIFA, the vast majority of patrons of FIFA will probably have English as a second language,” MARTA board member Thomas Worthy said during Thursday's meeting. “I think this will be their number-one station that they use. I think it needs to be clear.”

The World Cup games are expected to bring as many as 300,000 visitors to the city.

The rebranding of the GWCC/CNN Center station is just the latest of several name changes over the decades. When it opened in the early 70s, the station was simply called the Omni station for the nearby Omni Coliseum. The Omni was demolished in the late 90s and replaced with Philips Arena, which was eventually renamed State Farm Arena.

The playmaker feels scorned by his club asking him to leave and he has every right to stay in England and make them live to regret their decision

When a footballer leaves the club that they have served for the majority of their career and where they have spent their best years, they have roughly three routes to take. The first is to do what Ryan Giggs, Paul Scholes, Jamie Carragher and Gerard Pique did, among many others, and retire from football altogether, ensuring that you never betray the fans who you built such a strong connection with.

The second and most common route is to continue playing but to move abroad, ideally to a league where you can take things easy and where you are unlikely to come up against your beloved club again. Steven Gerrard, Xavi Hernandez and Andres Iniesta followed this path, leaving as legends but still having a bit of an adventure at the end of their playing days having long passed their peak.

Then there is the third road, the least travelled and most controversial: move to one of your rivals, beating your former employers to a huge title and making them forever regret letting you go. Luis Figo and Sol Campbell are the most famous examples although both players made unilateral decisions to leave and burned their reputations with their ex-teams in the process. But what about those players who had no say in leaving their club and felt hugely aggrieved about effectively being kicked out, with little thanks for everything they had given them?

It is a conundrum that Kevin De Bruyne is currently weighing up in his mind as he considers his next move after being forced out of Manchester City. It was first thought that he would take the second option and see out his career comfortably in the MLS, with Inter Miami, San Diego FC and Chicago Fire all possible destinations. But there is a growing possibility of him remaining not just in Europe, but in the Premier League and coming back to haunt City.

Liverpool have reportedly already reached out to the Belgian to discuss a contract. And considering his recent talismanic performances, plenty of other clubs should be queuing up to try to convince him to extend his stay in the best league in the world...","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

GOAL takes a look at some key storylines heading into Matchday 12 of MLS action in 2025

The weekend promises fireworks in MLS, with three of the season's potentially best matches yet on tap. 


First, it's a rematch of the 2024 MLS Cup final, the LA Galaxy clash with the New York Red Bulls - and though both teams are on a bit of a rocky course of late - the circumstances of the match present each club with a unique opportunity to capitalize on the moment.


 Minnesota United host Lionel Messi and Inter Miami in a rare cross-conference meeting, as the two clubs meet for the first time since the Argentine's arrival to the league. The Loons, who sit second in the West, will look to keep their red-hot form to start 2025 going against the Herons in a clash at Allianz Field.


And atop the Eastern Conference, the first-place Columbus Crew take to the road this weekend to take on second-place Philadelphia Union in a meeting between the conference's best teams heading into the Matchday.


As Matchday 12 kicks off, these fixtures promise to deliver some of the most exciting action yet this season.

Daniil Medvedev is the latest player to share his thoughts on Jannik Sinner's return to the ATP Tour.

The World number one is free to return to action after his three-month doping ban came to an end on May 4.

Sinner's first tournament is on home soil at the Italian Open and the 23-year-old is relishing the chance to start competing again.

Sinner will play his first match since January on Saturday against Mariano Navone, and while his return has been met with a positive response, Daniil Medvedev has now shared his point of view.

There were multiple points of view that were given about Sinner's three month ban from professional tennis. Three-time Grand Slam champion Sinner tested positive for clostebol at the 2024 Indian Wells Masters.

This resulted in a suspension, and while some players criticised the decision for Sinner to be banned, others took an opposing view.

Now Medvedev has shared his view on his rival's return, and said the ATP Tour just continued as usual in his absence, but he is pleased Sinner is now back.

“I honestly first of all did not speak to any other player about it. But tennis is such a strange sport where everything goes very fast and I really love what Casper said about the hamster in the wheel,” Medvedev told Sky Sports.

“It is an individual sport, so I would even continue what he said. It is a hamster in the wheel but there are 100 of us near each other and unfortunately when you replace one of the hamsters they don't really care.

“I actually saw something Jannik said and I can tell from my side I am really happy to have him back. I respect Jannik a lot and I am really happy to see him back on tour.”

During Sinner's absence he missed four Masters 1000 tournaments, in addition to some important 500 events such as the Rotterdam and Barcelona Open events.

But Carlos Alcaraz as well as Alexander Zverev, who are closest to Sinner in the rankings, each won a title in the three-time major winner's absence.

However, they were unable to produce the consistency to close in on or dethrone Sinner as the number one player. This surprised Medvedev, especially in the case of Alcaraz.

“I know Carlos and Sascha had big chances to get a lot of points and catch him. But they played strong opponents and everyone wants to win,” Medvedev said.

“Carlos said that it did put pressure on him but I would be a little bit surprised because Carlos is so strong. He can beat anyone on a good day.

“I think he may just have had some bad days. So surprised? Not really. It is a tough sport and we are all trying our best and sometimes it works out, but let's see what happens now he's back.”","{'href': 'https://www.thetennisgazette.com', 'title': 'The Tennis Gazette'}","tennis"

Novak Djokovic will for the second consecutive year play in an ATP 250 tournament the week before the French Open after making a late change to his calendar.

The 24-time Grand Slam winner has accepted a late wildcard entry into the Geneva Open with the move coming on the back of his withdrawal from the Italian Open.

The world No 6 will join Taylor Fritz (No 4), Casper Ruud (No 7), Grigor Dimitrov (No 15) and Tomas Machac (No 20) as the highest-ranked players in the draw at the event.

It is certainly a move away from the traditional schedule for the top-ranked players as they often prefer not to play competitive matches the before a Grand Slam.

Djokovic will start the tournament on a three-match losing streak as he lost in the final of the Miami Open and followed it up with defeats in his opening matches at the Monte Carlo Masters and the Madrid Open.

Having played only two competitive matches on clay – one each in Monte Carlo and Madrid – his decision to skip the Rome ATP Masters 1000 event raised eyebrows as many felt he was undercooked on the surface.

But Djokovic has maintained in recent years that his main focus is the Grand Slams and he hopes to peak at Roland Garros.

“I was hoping I can play one more match than I played in Monte Carlo,” he said after his defeat to Matteo Arnaldi in Madrid.

“Kind of new reality for me, I have to say. You know, trying to win a match or two, not really thinking about getting far in the tournament. 

“It's a completely different feeling from what I had in 20-plus years of professional tennis, so it's kind of a challenge for me mentally to really face these kind of sensations on the court, going out early now regularly in the tournaments.

“But, you know, that's, I guess, the circle of life and the career (smiling), eventually it was going to happen. 

“Now I'm trying to, you know, use this as a driving force for the future. Obviously Grand Slams, I was saying many times, are the most important tournaments for me.”

The Geneva Open – which runs from May 18-24 – will now give him an opportunity to get more matches on clay under his belt before the French Open starts on May 26.

Djokovic had a similar calendar in 2024 as he played at the Monte Carlo Masters and Italian Open, but skipped the Madrid Open and then signed up for the Geneva Open.

He will defend 100 points at the Swiss event as he defeated Yannick Hanfmann in his opener and Tallon Griekspoor in the quarter-final before going down in three sets against Machac in the last four.

Novak Djokovic has accepted a wild card into the Gonet Geneva Open, which runs from 18-24 May.

Djokovic will look to rediscover his form in Switzerland after losing his past two matches on clay in Monte-Carlo and Madrid. He did not compete in Rome.

Tsitsipas praised Badosa for taking the time to heal from a chronic back injury.ByDavid KanePublished May 09, 2025 copy_link

ROME, Italy—Only one half of “Tsitsidosa” is competing at the Internazionali BNL d'Italia this week, Stefanos Tsitsipas lending support to girlfriend Paula Badosa as she recovers from a recurring back injury that has ruled her out of action since the end of March.“I feel like currently, she's very close to 100% but not there yet,” Tsitsipas said after a 6-2, 7-6 (3) victory over Alexandre Müller. “I can sort of guess on the outside.Badosa began struggling with back issues in 2023, a year after her rise to No. 2 in the WTA rankings.

NBC will pitch its new and returning fall series to advertisers at Monday's upfront.



		By Rick Porter, Tony Maglio 

	May 9, 2025 10:50am	




NBC has canceled Lopez vs. Lopez and Night Court after three seasons apiece. The cancellations come on the final business day before NBC's upfront — when networks pitch advertisers on their coming slates — on Monday.


Night Court aired its third season finale, which will now serve as a series ender, on Tuesday — although sources say Warner Bros. TV, which produces the show with Universal TV, may try to find a new home for the series.




	This Night Court stars Melissa Rauch (who also executive produces) as Abby Stone, a judge in Manhattan's often chaotic night court and the daughter of Harry Stone, the lead character in the original 1984-92 series (who was played by the late Harry Anderson). John Larroquette reprised his role from the original series as attorney Dan Fielding; the season three cast also includes Lacretta, Nyambi Nyambi and Wendie Malick. Marsha Warfield made several appearances as Roz, her character in the prior series.

	Showrunner Dan Rubin executive produced Night Court with Rauch, Winston Rauch, Larroquette, Mat Harawitz, Lon Zimmet, Lindsey Shockley and Mona Garcea. 


Lopez vs. Lopez starred George Lopez and his real-life daughter Mayan Lopez. George (George) wrestles with his sobriety and getting older while Mayan (Mayan) is getting married. Lopez vs. Lopez also starred Selenis Leyva, Brice Gonzalez, Matt Shively and Al Madrigal.


	Universal Television produced Lopez vs. Lopez in association with Mohawk Productions, Travieso Productions, Mi Vida Loba and 3 Arts. Creator and showrunner Debby Wolfe (The Conners, One Day at a Time) executive produces with Bruce Helford, George Lopez, Michael Rotenberg and Katie Newman.


	NBC will likely reduce the number of primetime hours devoted to entertainment programming next season as it makes room for primetime NBA telecasts. The network has renewed first-year comedies Happy's Place and St. Denis Medical, along with its Chicago and Law & Order drama franchises. Still awaiting word on next season are Lopez vs. Lopez on the comedy side and dramas Brilliant Minds, Found, Grosse Pointe Garden Society, The Hunting Party, The Irrational and Suits LA.

The NBC spinoff of the beloved USA Network legal drama won't be returning for a second season.



		By Jackie Strause, Tony Maglio 

	May 9, 2025 12:34pm	




Suits LA is ending its run. Yes, already.


	NBC has canceled the spinoff series of the beloved USA Network courtroom dramedy. The first season will conclude with its forthcoming May 18 finale, The Hollywood Reporter has confirmed.




	The 13-episode NBC series brought back original stars Gabriel Macht as Harvey Specter, David Costabile as Daniel Hardman and the remaining episodes are set to see Rick Hoffman return as Louis Litt.


Suits LA, however, launched with a focus on a new set of lawyers, led by Stephen Amell as entertainment lawyer Ted. After the legal drama exploded on Netflix in 2023, creator Aaron Korsh decided to expand the Suits universe with the franchise's second spinoff, setting the story on the West Coast.

	The original Suits, which brought the world Meghan Markle, ran from 2011-2019 on USA Network. It did well for USA, but the show really exploded after heading to Netflix in a syndication (of sorts) deal. 


	On Netflix, Suits became the undisputed show of summer 2023 — and really of 2023 as a whole. Suits was Nielsen's No. 1 streaming series for a record 12 straight weeks, passing Ozark. Suits was streamed for nearly 58 billion minutes in 2023. The show was also on Peacock during that time period, but almost all of the viewership came on Netflix.


Suits LA did not share much in the resurgence of its source series. Netflix had an opportunity to purchase the spinoff show, but the streamer passed.


	NBC also canceled sitcoms Lopez vs. Lopez and Night Court on Friday — they ran for three seasons apiece — as well as The Irrational and Found. NBC will host its upfront on Monday at Radio City Music Hall, and the network is cleaning house for when the NBA returns to its airwaves this fall.

EXCLUSIVE: It's one and done for NBC's legal drama Suits LA headlined by Stephen Amell, a spinoff of the long-running USA Network series Suits.


	Given the high-profile IP involved, NBC had high expectations for the series from Suits creator Aaron Korsh. They never materialized: after an OK premiere, viewership for the offshoot, which airs on Sunday, has remained low.


	That is with NBC and Korsh pulling out all the stops and bringing back popular original cast members to play with the new cast. They included Gabriel Macht, who reprised the role of Harvey Specter in a three-episode arc, Rick Hoffman as eccentric Louis Litt in episode 112 and David Costabile as Daniel Hardman in episode 109.

	Additionally, in an effort to bring in more eyeballs, NBC staged a Thursday night Suits LA takeover with a three-hour marathon of repeats on March 27.


	There have been modest week-to-week ratings bumps here and there but overall, viewership has remained low, hovering over the 1 million mark on linear in Live+Same Day the last couple of weeks. The series did not become a major streaming draw either, despite the mothership's recent resurgence on Netflix, which prompted NBC to pursue an offshoot.


RELATED: ‘The Irrational' Canceled By NBC After 2 Seasons


	This is now the second Suits spinoff to run for one season, following USA's Pearson.


	It's been a tough day at NBC, which needs to make space on the schedule for NBA coverage last season. Suits LA joins dramas The Irrational and Found and comedies Night Court and Lopez vs Lopez, which also just have been axed.


RELATED: ‘Lopez Vs. Lopez' Canceled After 3 Seasons At NBC


Suits LA is centered on Ted Black (Amell), a former federal prosecutor from New York who has reinvented himself by representing the most powerful clients in Los Angeles. His firm is at a crisis point, and to survive, he must embrace a role he held in contempt his entire career.


	The series also stars Lex Scott Davis, Josh McDermitt, Bryan Greenberg, Troy Winbush, Rachelle Goulding, Azita Ghanizada, Maggie Grace, and Alice Lee. Matt Letscher, Sofia Pernas and Maggie Grace recur.


	Guest stars included John Amos, in his final role, Victoria Justice, Patton Oswalt, Yvette Nicole Brown, Brian Baumgartner, and Enrico Colantoni.

	











	Aaron Korsh is the creator and executive producer of Suits and Suits LA. David Bartis, Doug Liman, Gene Klein, Anton Cropper, Genevieve Sparling, Rick Muirragui, and Jon Cowan also executive produce. The series is produced by UCP, a division of Universal Studio Group.

Ahmir “Questlove” Thompson had a tall order to one-up himself after he and producer Joseph Patel won the Best Documentary Feature Oscar in 2022 for “Summer of Soul.” But he found it with “Sly Lives!,” the story of Sly Stone and his revolutionary music with Sly & the Family Stone. Beyond just a biographical account, the documentary, subtitled “(aka The Burden of Black Genius),” examined something bigger: The extraordinary representational burden Black artists carry. 

Asking the 20 or so artists who appear in “Sly Lives!” about that — from Jimmy Jam to D'Angelo to André 3000 — Questlove had a realization: It's “probably the most frightening question they've ever been asked,” he said at a Q&A for the film, which occurred at IndieWire's Pass the Remote event, presented by Disney and Hulu. The screening and Q&A at Vidiots Foundation in Los Angeles on May 3 drew a packed house, and Questlove and Patel both mingled with attendees afterward at the beer and wine reception in the lobby that followed, much as the interviewees did for our previous Pass the Remote panels in April about casting and TV music. (Watch the full panel above.)

But as celebratory as the event was, it was thoughtful — and thought-provoking — too. Questlove said that asking that question of his interviewees was like “Jedi mind tricking people.” Stone's life meandered from extraordinary creative highs to long periods of creative inactivity marked by questionable choices, in his career and in his life. “What we're not trying to do is pile on,” Questlove said. (See photos from all our 2025 Pass the Remote events here.)

“It would've been so easy just to tell the worst stories and the worst experiences and take advantage of peoples' poor choices in life just to benefit our film and tell a more sensational story,” the director continued. “Especially with Black artists, they're not treated as human beings. Even the Family Stone members [we interviewed] were like, ‘Boy, what is this? Therapy? You trying to make me go to therapy?' That sort of thing. A lot of them aren't asked half the time how they feel. I put out feelers to about 19, 20 of my peers. I wish I could probably say this is probably the most frightening question they've ever been asked. And a lot of them didn't want to do it because they couldn't allow themselves to go there. Some agreed to do it and then day of, hours before were like, ‘Are you showing up?'”

 










Needless to say there was a lot of anxiety there, because the experience of having to be all things to all people as a Black artist — while putting the best foot forward to represent Black excellence — and continually delivering at the highest level, is pretty universal. With all of that pressure, fissures can reveal themselves. “This is also Lauryn Hill's story,” Questlove said. “This is also D'Angelo's story. This is Frank Ocean's story. This is Kanye's story right now. You have everything you ever wanted in the world. Why are you purposely trying to mess this up? And it's so much deeper. From afar, we think we want things. But there's so much under the surface that we have to explore it. And I think that's frightening for people sometimes.”

Producer Patel added, “D'Angelo [who's interviewed in the film] also suffered through some of the same things Sly did when he was successful, he put out one album and everyone called him the next Marvin Gaye. And then he does Voodoo and he releases a single, ‘How Does It Feel?,' with a video that people can't stop talking about. Ahmir was witness to D'Angelo struggling to go on stage, every night getting later and later, because he knows he has to be in top physical condition to perform that song with his shirt off to a screaming, sold out room every night. He's been through that. So everyone in the movie, whether people pick up on it or not, it was really intentional. We spent a lot of time in pre-production figuring out who are the people that could speak to Sly's story as proxies.”

 










That's also because the 82-year-old Stone wasn't interviewed for the movie. “Sly Lives!” is fundamentally more concerned with his impact and influence on other artists — one sequence narrated by Jimmy Jam showing how “Dance to the Music” influenced “Rhythm Nation” is particularly extraordinary — and what he represents about Black artistry, than it is about parsing his biography.

“When we really actually set out to work on this, I asked Ahmir, ‘What's the story?'” Patel said. “And he said, ‘It's about Sly. But also when you trace back all the Black artists who find success,' including Ahmir, including his peers. He was like, ‘Sly was really the first to go through this thing that we all experience.' And I think for us and the films that we do together, it's about one specific thing, but really something that resonates more to a bigger idea. And so he, Ahmir, in the very first conversation was like, ‘It's about Sly, but it's really about the burden of Black genius.'”

The film is also about how artists are remembered, and the particular set of circumstances that result in certain artists being particularly celebrated. It makes a convincing case Sly Stone is one of the most influential artists of all time… so why isn't he revered even more?

 










“We talked about very, very, very early was telling Sly's story with empathy,” Patel said. “That's important. But also the fact that he's still alive is important. It's why the film is titled ‘Sly Lives!' because had he passed away at 27, like a lot of people of his generation, famous and on top, would we revere him more? You know what I mean? And it's like he… Ahmir also talks about the run of genius. He talks about how most artists have a genius run of max seven years. And then a lot of those artists that he's referencing died before we could find out. Sly didn't, and Sly probably had more down years than up years, but does that mean he's any less of a genius? I think those are the subtext questions of the film.”

Watch the entire panel conversation with Questlove and Joseph Patel above.

Thom Yorke has quietly been on a bit of a tear the last year or so. In 2024, his side project the Smile — with Radiohead guitarist Jonny Greenwood and jazz drummer Tom Skinner — put out two dazzling albums of crinkly art-rock, Wall of Eyes and Cutouts. He also recently wrapped up a short solo tour doing expansive, gripping renditions of songs from throughout his career. Now, he's back with this engrossing little side-project detour, a collaboration with producer Mark Pritchard, whose roots in the U.K.'s experimental electronic music scene go back decades. Pritchard contributed a frenetically vertiginous reworking of Radiohead's “Bloom” to the 2011 King of Limbs remix record KOL RMX 1234567, and he collaborated with Yorke on the 2016 track “Beautiful People.” They've been working on this project since the dark days of 2020, passing tracks back and forth, with Yorke adding vocals that are hauntingly opaque and ensnaringly eerie even by his high standards.

	The album, which is being released alongside a film by visual artist Jonathan Zawada, sort of squares a circle for Yorke. It's his debut release for the storied techno label Warp, home of artists like Aphex Twin and Autechre, whose glitchscape innovations were a big influence on Kid A and Amnesiac-era Radiohead. This is almost certainly the first record on Warp to feature one of the greatest singers of all time in a lead role, and Pritchard wisely keeps his tracks uncluttered and varied, offering Yorke endless room to stretch out. “Bugging Out Again” wafts his doom-angel falsetto atop an oozing keyboard abstraction that sounds like a John Carpenter horror movie soundtrack heard down a distant hallway, offering a new twist on that quintessentially Yorkean sense of empathetic terror. On “Ice Shelf,” a particularly unnerving moment, his voice is mutated into a robotic wallow over gray-noise ambience and subterranean drum boom, but it still comes out offhandedly captivating. “The White Cliffs” waltzes through wintry minimalism, while “The Conversation Is Missing Your Voice” is like a photo negative of an R&B banger, with Yorke crooning soulfully over a hand-clap beat. Pritchard likes using vintage gear, and several of these songs bring to mind Eighties synth pop and video games, like the 8-bit bounce of “Gangsters,” the electro-goth nightmare “Back In the Game,” and “A Fake In a Faker's World” — a synth-drone freakout made playful by cybernetic bloops and squiggles.

	Despite the album's general tone of glacial torment, only a couple moments deviate into feeling overly harsh or stupidly indulgent; feel free to skip “Happy Days,” which gnashes along in a deranged death march, as Yorke repeats the phrase “Happy days/Death and taxes.” (OK, we get bored of reruns with the Fonz too, but it's not that bad.) Paradoxically, the track with a title that sounds like a sketch-comedy parody of a song on a moody Thom Yorke solo record – “The Men Who Dance In Stags Heads” – ends up being a truly transcendent moment. It's the most organic-feeling song on the record, a beautiful tribute to the Velvet Underground's “All Tomorrow's Parties” with Yorke's gently imperious talk-sing sounding like Lou Reed singing a lullaby. He mumbles stuff about the gallows pole and the sun going out, but it sounds like he's greeting the dawning of a Sunday morning. This is a detour that leads to new epiphanies.

Lauren Alaina wishes she had the chance to attend the 2025 ACM Awards. On Thursday night, the country singer shared a vulnerable Instagram Reel following the awards show, saying she felt “left out” and “left behind” after having to watch the show from home.


	“I get so excited for everyone because I have the same dream, and I wanna be there and I wanna be getting these awards and having these performances and presenting the awards,” Alaina said, congratulating the winners of the show. “But I'm home, 37 weeks pregnant. I'm home this year, and I just wanna be honest about something: I'm feeling left out. I'm feeling sad.”


	“I'm feeling so many feelings because I have this little girl in here, and I want her to dream big, and I want her to believe in herself and go for whatever she wants to do,” she added.


	Alaina explained that these last few years have been a period of “transition” for her music, and she feels “kind of left behind” with it. The country singer added that she might “regret” posting the video, but she ultimately wanted to be honest with her fans.

	“I've gotta create all this content and try to do all these things to try and have all these moments online. And it's not just about writing music and putting songs out anymore; you have to do all these other things,” Alaina said, hoping that she could be an example for people who might also feel behind in their dreams.


	“I felt this way last year,” she added. “I didn't go to the ACMs last year either, and I just desperately want to be there. I want to be up for these awards and be able to even present the awards and walk the carpet and be with my friends.”


	In the comments of her post, numerous country stars shared supportive messages for the singer.

One year ago last week, Kendrick Lamar set flames to Drake's reputation that the rap world is still feeling the embers from. In just a week, songs like “Euphoria,” “6:16 In LA,” and yes, “Not Like Us,” bested Drake's offering in their quick-draw war of words, and subsequently crowned Lamar the rapper of his generation in the eyes of many. He rode that momentum into GNX, a 12-track album that debuted at Number One on the Billboard 200. That's the tidal wave of energy he rode into the MetLife Stadium stop of his Grand National Tour, alongside Jersey girl SZA. He and SZA are in high demand. The 35-year-old singer-songwriter is a bona fide music superstar in her own right, and the two offered the tristate area a special main event concert.


	The show started with DJ Mustard, who did his best to warm up the crowd with rap standards before Lamar and SZA hit the stage. The stage design somewhat resembled the diamond design of Lamar's Super Bowl halftime set, with a giant stage leading out toward three smaller bases. The design gave the two ample room to roam and get decent face time with fans in the lower levels, which they both took advantage of throughout the set. (The stage also rose during the show.) Behind them was a giant three-panel screen. From my stage-right vantage point, I could see how the two used the stage's angles to project a panoramic view of certain visuals. The screen served different purposes at different junctures. For SZA, there were multiple serene landscapes aiding her dreamy catalog, while Lamar used videos of himself in March 1992 during “DNA,” and hammered home his attack on Drake's identity with a collage of Black iconography during “Not Like Us.”

	Lamar came out first, rising from a black Grand National car below the stage and tearing into “Wacced Out Murals” (the Grand National SZA rose from was naturally covered with ivy). The two alternated between sets all night with a slick interplay. Lamar turned the mood down with “Man at the Garden,” leading into SZA's “Scorsese Baby Daddy,” while she ended her solo set with “Kiss Me More,” leading into Lamar's final tracks; they also had moments when they did collaborations such as “30 for 30” and “Luther.” Their switches also gave the two time to switch attire multiple times. While Lamar alternated from a mostly camo fit, putting his jacket on and off, SZA was in full starlet mode, with four different outfits. But no matter what they were wearing, they had the crowd captivated. SZA stuck to lights and fireworks, whereas Lamar had fireballs going off, especially during his Drake disses.

	The mixed-aged crowd, seemingly mid-thirties and down, likely discovered Lamar and SZA at various points along their decades-plus journeys, and some may have just tapped in last year. It seems like Lamar's more recent output got the most recognition. He even noted the dynamic, jokingly telling fans to turn to their neighbors, church-style, and ask if they knew one of his earlier singles. I've seen Lamar play arenas and festival stages multiple times, and he carried the same craft into his stadium show, delving into his rapid-fire rhymes without missing a beat. He also introduced some flourishes for his live show, performing a new verse on “Family Ties” and remixing songs like “mA.A.d city” over Anita Baker.


	While the tour's title and the moment at large belonged to Lamar, the Jersey crowd loved SZA. They popped for her pop hits, like “Kill Bill,” and for heartrending tracks, like “Nobody Gets Me,” which were all sung solidly with no backing vocals. She had guitarists play during multiple songs, including “F2F.” She acknowledged the magnitude of the moment by raving, “Am I home or what?” And later declared alongside Kendrick that “the myth of New York having no energy is over.” And though she didn't do her in-air routine because of the Northeast winds, she still gave a varied set, dancing all over the stage. 


	Both artists took the elephant in the room head on. Lamar performed his verse of “Poetic Justice,” while SZA recited her verse on “Rich Baby Daddy.” Curiously, Lamar refrained from saying “Oakland” when he rhymed “That __ show gonna be your last stop” on “Not Like Us.” But that's not to be confused with mercy. Lamar performed “Euphoria” and “Not Like Us,” with the former song inspiring his barest, most intentional usage of the giant screen behind him (placing “Lies About Me, Truth About You” in red font over a black background). And while the crowd went up for “A minor…,” and “we don't wanna hear you say nigga no more,” it wasn't a bash-Drake event. The audience seemed just as excited to sing the “Don't Kill My Vibe” chorus and “I do,” during SZA's rendition of “I Hate U.”

	Both artists tore through their catalog standards, utilizing the full stage, as did dancers accompanying them in various fashions. When several women popped their asses out as Lamar rapped “Show me something natural” during “Humble,” they were a visual ad-lib. Some of them picked up SZA during one track, and bolstered her choreography on many others. When a man did a solo dance routine at the end of “Squabble Up,” he felt like a co-star.

	Between songs were humorous clips of the two being “deposed.” While the clip that played before “Not Like Us” has gone viral, the show displayed several other clips. In one, Lamar chides the interviewer for nonsensically implying he disappears from the public yet seeks attention. In another clip, they struggle to pronounce SZA's name, which may have something to do with her saging the room in another snippet. And toward the end of the set, the two dig into their natural-comedian bags during a clip of a gas station snack run. Their years of musical chemistry played out well onscreen and onstage.


	Both artists tried their best to engage the hefty crowd, and mostly succeeded with movement, strong vocals, and a mesh of creative screen animations, pyrotechnics, and lighting. While the set lasted two and a half hours, it rarely lulled, with both doing a solid job of imbuing their set portions with energetic songs to keep the crowd into it. Lamar and SZA are seasoned veterans at this point in their respective careers, and that was reflected even during their first stadium tour. They were strictly business — in a good way.

Pearl Jam brought out surprise guest Peter Frampton during their concert Thursday in Nashville, with the two Rock Hall-inducted artists linking up for a rendition of the band's “Black.” 


	“This gentleman was someone we looked up to before the Ramones. Some of our first guitar heroes, [like] Jimmy Page and Pete Townshend, he was right up there,” Eddie Vedder told the crowd before the Frampton Comes Alive rocker took the stage. 


	“It was one of reasons why we loved live records, and later we decided to release bootlegs because of his influence. He's such an incredible human being on top of it. It is our honor, because at this point he's become a good friend to the group. He's recorded with Mike [McCready] and [drummer] Matt Cameron and we get to play with him tonight.”


	Frampton, a longtime resident of Nashville, then joined the band to perform the Ten classic, wailing away alongside McCready on guitar solos that included Vedder teasing Frampton's own “Do You Feel Like We Do.”

	Frampton will embark on a North American tour later this month, six years after the guitarist announced a farewell tour due to his battle with inclusion body myositis. However, as evidenced by Frampton's “Black” solo, the rocker has soldiered on despite the degenerative disease.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q='unidentified+flying+objects'","Scientists studying ‘UFO orb' that ‘landed in Colombia' claim mysterious object is ‘alien' after scanning it with X-rays","https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/34881444/scientists-ufo-orb-alien-xray/","Fri, 09 May 2025 17:37:36 GMT","

SCIENTISTS are studying a mysterious ""UFO orb"" which landed in Colombia and is said to be ""alien"".

Boffins released X-ray images of the mind-boggling sphere, after witnesses claimed to have seen it flying over the town of Buga in March.

It was said to have been zig-zagging through the skies in an unconventional flying pattern.

The ""UFO sphere"" was reportedly recovered shortly after landing.

It has since been analysed by scientists who have now revealed their groundbreaking research on the ""extraterrestrial item"".

They discovered that it featured three layers of metal-like material and 18 micro-spheres inside which surrounded a central nucleus.

Scientists are calling this core ""a chip"".

A radiologist who examined the sphere Dr Joe Luis Velazquez said that they found ""no welds or joints"", which usually indicate human production.

The scientist concluded: ""It is of artificial origin, in that it shows no evidence of welding, and its internal structure is composed of high-density elements. 

""More testing is needed to establish its origin.""

The mind-blowing object also displayed symbols that the team compared to ancient scripts. 

These included runes, Ogham and Mesopotamian writing systems.

The scientists used AI to help them decode the bizarre text.

They interpreted it as saying: ""The origin of birth through union and energy in the cycle of transformation, meeting point of unity, expansion, and consciousness—individual consciousness.""

The researchers said that they understood the text to be a ""message to humanity, encouraging a collective shift in consciousness to help Mother Earth"".

The object was recovered on March 2 by a group of people who said it weighed about four and a half pounds.

They described it as having ""the temperature of a refrigerator"" when they touched it.

One of the individuals who recovered the object David Velez el Potro said that the object was authentic, and claimed to have found it in the woods in Buga.

He also said the man who found and touched it, Jose, felt sick for days after touching the alien sphere.

Velez el Potro said: ""When I poured water on it, it started to smoke and the water vaporised instantly.""

There are yet to be any official reports or scientific analysis to confirm claims of a sphere falling over Buga - only eyewitness reports.

Velez el Potro added the government contacted him to hand over the sphere, but he refused, arguing that it would ""never be seen again"".

Researchers found that the sphere had irregular edges which indicated ""that it is a solid object"".

The outer layer was said to be the most dense area, almost possessing human bone density.

The breakthrough research suggests that the outer layer could be made of titanium or steel.

The ‘Night of the UFOs' is among many famous unexplained encounters with strange objects in the sky that have happened down the years.

Perhaps the most striking was a video known as the 'Tic-Tac' – which showed an unidentified object being pursued by fighter planes.

While flying off the coast of California 2004, two pilots from the USS Nimitz on a routine training mission spotted an object ""shaped like a 40ft Tic Tac sweet"".

Then in 2005, a veteran pilot of an F/A - 18 fighter aircraft witnessed a raft of strange objects in the sky during a training exercise off the coast of Florida.

The two videos were sensationally released by the Pentagon in 2017.

Tragically the pursuit of UFOs has also claimed lives, notably that of US Air Force Captain Thomas Mantell.

He died after being sent to chase a mysterious object in his fighter aircraft in 1948.

Other encounters with the air force include a claim that UFOs disabled weapons at a nuclear base.

Captain Robert Salas said the bizarre incident unfolded in 1967 while he was the on-duty commander of a secret underground launch control facility at Montana's Malmstrom Air Force Base.

US forces based in Britain also had an encounter with a strange glowing in the sky in Rendlesham Forest in Suffolk.

Two airmen, Staff Sgt Jim Penniston and Airman John Burroughs, claim they got so close to a triangular craft they actually touched it.

Earlier this year, US military documents were released showing how a warship was shadowed by two ""ball of light"" UFOs deepening the mystery around the case.

But the scientists still need a full composition analysis to confirm this.

The 18 smaller spheres within the object's centre appeared to be aligned in a non-randomised pattern.

Boffins are currently referring to the 18 points as ""a chip"" due to their precise arrangement and location within the spherical object.

The team also observed a central band composed of a different material, which contained more small spheres.



They think that these may have been placed inside before the object was sealed.

But the X-rays did not reveal any visible signs of assembly techniques by humans.

Pour some coffee for our exclusive chat with the talented Scandinavian filmmaker, Victor Danell, as he talks about the influence of Spielberg, nostalgia, and the Swedish tradition of Fika.

When XYZ Films' Swedish sci-fi adventure movie ""Watch the Skies"" has its American debut on May 9, 2025, Hollywood and fans will also get a remarkable look at its AI-driven TrueSynch “visual dubbing” administered by the British startup firm Flawless AI.

This nostalgic feature film is set in 1996 and focuses on a small town teenage girl named Denise, whose father mysteriously vanished one night years ago while investigating a flying saucer sighting in the nearby forested hills. Determined to unravel the reality behind his disappearance, the feisty girl bonds with a group of antisocial enthusiasts at a local UFO club called UFO Sweden, who aid her in searching out the truth about her dad in true ""The X-Files""-like fashion.

Directed by Victor Danell for his Crazy Pictures production shingle, ""Watch the Skies"" will be the first flick to demonstrate this immersive technology, where the film's original Swedish-speaking cast has re-recorded their lines in English for AI tools to match lip movements. Once foreign films leave their home territory, an immediate language barrier exists. This pioneering new AI technology of ""visual dubbing"" opens up a whole new way to release and introduce their Swedish film (and countless others) to a far wider audience and helps retain the actors' screen performances.

Part of the movie's originality and warmth comes from the natural inclusion of cultural customs unique to the Swedish people, and that means the obligatory communal sipping of coffee and munching on tarts.

""It's a traditional Swedish thing that we do called Fika, where you have kind of a coffee break,"" Danell explains to Space.com. ""Especially in these types of volunteer associations, what you do is have meetings where you're drinking coffee and having Fika and eating buns and tarts. And that's something we wanted to bring into the movie, because it's a bunch of outsiders that want to solve this big mystery, but they also just want to be together having Fika, coffee, and tarts.""



The misfit UFO cult that forms ""Watch the Skies""' core is based on an actual flying saucer society in the country called UFO Sweden, giving the project an engaging authenticity.

""We all grew up in the '80s and '90s with these old-fashioned sci-fi movies as our base in our filmmaking,"" he adds regarding project influences. ""Who doesn't love early Steven Spielberg and films like that? So we were inspired by those movies and we heard about this group in Sweden, a real association called UFO Sweden. We saw a documentary about them and knew we had to look them up. Are they for real? What we found out is that UFO Sweden is based in our hometown called Norrköping.

""Not only that, but their headquarters are across the street from my apartment. So we just went down the street and knocked on the door and asked if we could come in to learn about their work. So we all sat down for Swedish Fika and they told us that they're a UFO investigation group and if you see something in the sky you can call them and they'll help find out what you saw. They're gathering an archive of UFO sightings from around the world in their basement and it's the largest UFO archive in the world. They showed us around and when we left their headquarters we knew that this was our next movie. We just needed to find a story that could take these lovely guys out on an adventure larger than they usually went on.""



""Watch the Skies"" is imbued with a heartfelt reality even though its story is rooted in paranormal events, and its striking cinematography enhances a certain retro appeal.

""The cinematographer is Hannes Krantz, one of our partners in Crazy Pictures. Actually, I built the lenses for this movie myself. It's a mix of old Contex still photography lenses with the anamorphic block off an old projector combined together. It's kind of nerdy but the look of the movie is a big part of making the audience feel like this is an old nostalgic throwback to the ‘70s and ‘80s. It was hard work making that look.

""Sweden doesn't do a lot of genre movies. We went into this thinking it would be quite hard to make a Swedish science fiction movie. It actually wasn't. I think the Swedish audience also is ready for one so it went quite easily. But it's still hard to make a good sci-fi movie. We're so excited to see what will happen with this movie. We released it in Sweden and now it's coming out in the U.S. and we're so thrilled to see how it will go.""

""Watch the Skies"" stars Inez Dahl Torhaug, Eva Melander, Jesper Barkselius, Sara Shirpey, Håkan Ehn, Isabelle Kyed, Niklas Kvarnbo Jönsson, and Mathias Lithner.

The Boys has been igniting rumors of a Supernatural reunion since Soldier Boy's inclusion in The Boys season 3, but now that they are confirmed, I'm amazed by how good it sounds. When I heard that Eric Kripke was behind Prime Video's seminal The Boys, I couldn't believe my luck. Kripke had secretly been one of TV's most hilarious writers and showrunners for decades, long before The Boys rose to prominence. In Supernatural, Kripke proved why he was perfect to tackle The Boys — and now he can bring both shows together.

Launching in 2005, Supernatural managed to run until 2020, presenting America's longest-running live-action fantasy TV show. The Boys appears to be adopting the opposite tactics, with Kripke putting a hard stop to it at the end of The Boys season 5. Knowing that The Boys was due to end in season 5, I was watching season 4 anxiously for a sign of the Supernatural reunion I've been longing for since Jensen Ackles joined the cast. Kripke finally confirmed that it will indeed be coming, and it's beyond my wildest dreams.

Kripke has confirmed to TV Insider that the Supernatural reunion of everyone's dreams will include not just Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki, but also Misha Collins. By the ending of The Boys season 4, it was starting to look like Ackles and Padalecki, who played Sam and Dean Winchester in Supernatural, might never reunite in The Boys. Some were even hoping for Collins to join the proceedings. Collins played Castiel, an angel who was the Winchesters' ally from Supernatural season 4 to its final, epic season, ending on November 19, 2020.

As if all the actors appearing in the same season of The Boys wasn't enough, having them share a story is bound to be epic.

Frenchie and Kimiko's hookup in The Boys was one of the highlights of the whole show, but I'm relieved to know that Kripke hasn't yet pulled all of his tricks out of his sleeve just yet. Kripke may have saved the coup de grâce to The Boys' competition for season 5, finally treating fans to a reunion between Ackles, Padalecki, and Collins in the same season — and in the ""same frame"" and ""same storyline"" as well. As if all the actors appearing in the same season of The Boys wasn't enough, having them share a story is bound to be epic.

In his interview with TV Insider, Kripke did not reveal the parts that Padalecki and Collins will play in The Boys season 4, but they will inevitably be wickedly appropriate. Ackles is incredible as Soldier Boy, and I can't wait to see his old chemistry with Padalecki and Collins fired back up. I'm even more intrigued to see which absurd subversion of American culture and superhero tropes Kripke will be pasting onto this trio. I hope the trio's roles in The Boys will somehow parallel their roles in Supernatural.

I can see Padalecki playing a supe opposite Ackles in The Boys.

If anyone is capable of performing such blatant fan service in a way that slots perfectly into the plot of season 5, it is Kripke. Soldier Boy's appearance in Gen V proved his ongoing importance to the overall The Boys franchise, so Kripke clearly has no intention of sidelining him in season 5. Ackles' role will get bigger, as it seems that Homelander may wake him up from his slumber. I can see Padalecki playing a supe opposite Ackles in The Boys, paralleling Ackles and Padalecki's partnership in Supernatural, before Padalecki is killed off in some hilarious way.

The Boys franchise is a satirical and dark superhero series based on the comic book by Garth Ennis and Darick Robertson. It explores a world where superheroes, or ""Supes,"" are corrupt, violent, and morally bankrupt, all controlled by the powerful corporation Vought International. The story centers around two opposing groups: The Boys, a vigilante team aiming to expose and defeat the corrupt heroes, and The Seven, Vought's elite team of Supes led by the ruthless Homelander.

With HBO's celebrated comedy series The Righteous Gemstones coming to an end, here's how all four seasons stack up against each other.

Andor season 2, episodes 7-9 is the best Star Wars story ever told, with strong action scenes, intense emotion, and brilliant performances.

The Handmaid's Tale season 6, episode 7 sees June come up with an all-new plan of attack, but it risks leading to the death of Nick Blaine.

The first episode of Poker Face season 2 features several new characters, primarily Cynthia Erivo in multiple roles, and the return of Charlie Cale.

The Lincoln Lawyer isn't just a great small-screen legal drama. The show warrants comparisons with some of the big-screen legal thrillers, too. 

Piper ended up backing out of her original Thailand plans in The White Lotus season 3, which would have resembled a season 1 character's story.

If you've ever cried during a medium's reading, you're not alone. And if you've ever cried during a courthouse wedding post, well—same hat, different tears.

Celebrity clairvoyant and former Kardashian spiritual consultant (yes, that's a job) Tyler Henry just announced that he's officially off the market, having married longtime partner Clint Godwin in what can only be described as a gay millennial's dream ceremony: low-key, high-love, and very Beverly Hills.

RELATED: Tyler Henry's Supernatural Abilities are Gay

With a single understated Instagram photo and the caption, “Today, we are married! Life with you is an endless sleepover with my best friend and life's just getting started,” Tyler delivered the soft-launch of a lifetime. And yes, in case you were wondering, the sleepover line made half the internet dissolve into a mist of feelings and glitter.

For anyone who's followed Tyler's journey—from emotional readings with Ricki Lake and Chrishell Stause to having the Kardashians on speed dial—it's touching (and a little poetic) that his most meaningful connection was never with a celebrity, but with someone who DM'd him after watching Keeping Up with the Kardashians. Real gay love in the time of reality TV.

“He had seen me on [Keeping Up With the Kardashians]. He messaged me and said that he'd be interested in a reading,” Tyler told GLAAD in 2022. But the moment they met, this wasn't just another booked session. “I knew the second I saw him that I had something that I needed to share with him regarding his grandfather, who had died.” That reading turned into a relationship, and that relationship turned into marriage. Honestly? Netflix could never.

Tyler added, “His grandfather had recently taken his own life. As I connected with him, I relayed exactly why that decision was made. Immediately, I found myself a part of his family, being immersed in what they were going through.” It's a heavy beginning for a love story—but it's also heartbreakingly beautiful. Because queer love often starts in the trenches and builds cathedrals out of shared grief, trust, and resilience.

While no public engagement was ever announced (psychics, they're just like us—secretive about proposals), Tyler told E! News back in 2019 that he'd likely be the one to propose. He didn't spill when or how, but we can only assume it involved candles, possibly crystals, and a sense of otherworldly knowing.

The newlyweds didn't opt for a Kardashian-scale spectacle (no Versace tuxedos or drones), but the intimacy of their courthouse ceremony was perfectly on-brand. The cake? Coconut-covered and topped with two little men, because if gay weddings have taught us anything, it's that dessert can be political.

The couple has been making us soft for years. On Valentine's Day, Tyler shared a photo of the two in wetsuits (the gayest beach uniform, no notes), writing: “We've grown up together and there's no one else I'd rather grow through time with. Whether I'm 29 or 92, this love will always be my guiding force, a reprieve from all of life's heaviness. That's what @clintxgodwin is for me.”

In March, Clint's birthday got another loving tribute: “Hurtling toward 30 isn't so bad with coconut cake and good company.” Who said psychics can't be poets?

As for the rest of us? We'll be here—ugly crying into our matcha lattes, scrolling back to their cake pic, and maybe DMing a psychic just in case our own love story is waiting in the stars… or the comment section.

What kind of wedding story makes your inner queer romantic scream-cry the most?

A wild conspiracy theory has emerged from the depths of the internet, claiming that new Mountain Dew flavors have foretold deadly disasters across the US. 

The unusual claim comes from content creator Maverick Bailey, known for his unconventional takes, who believes major events have strangely coincided with the launch of certain Mountain Dew flavors.

'It seems like every time they make a big push with a new flavor, it correlates with a certain event,' Bailey said during a recent interview.

He pointed out that Star Spangled Splash was released in 2024, shortly before the collapse of the Francis Scott Key Bridge—its patriotic name eerily echoing the national symbolism of the event. 

Similarly, hit shelves just three months before 9/11, with theorists drawing a connection between the flavor's name and the emergency alert status that followed the attacks.

Bailey also connected other flavors to the Maui wildfires and the global CrowdStrike blackout that crippled millions of Windows devices last year.

Now, he's sounding the alarm over Mountain Dew's upcoming flavor, Baja Midnight, set to launch this summer.

'This new flavor could be referring to the Witching Hour, which is at 12:00,' Bailey shared in an Instagram video.

'My guess is that we are going to see something very weird, on a paranormal level, or something that is going to make us question everything.' He added that it could even signal a devastating cyber blackout.

Mountain Dew commented on Bailey's Instagram video discussing the wild theory, saying: 'Keep your voice down.' 

While Mountain Dew made a joke about the theory, there is no evidence to support any of Bailey's claims 

Bailey shared his latest update on The Maverick Files, where he outlined connections he's drawn between Mountain Dew flavors and major disasters. 

He pointed to Code Red that launched in May 2001, just months before the 9/11 attacks—an event widely referred to as a 'Code Red' emergency.

In 2019, Mountain Dew introduced Maui Burst, a pineapple-flavored soda. 

Bailey claims it foreshadowed the 2023 wildfires that devastated Maui.

While the devastating event happened in 2023, years after the flavor hit shelves, Bailey and other conspiracy theorists are sure there is a link.

A Facebook user shared an image showing a can of Maui Blast with the caption: 'No such thing as coincidence.

'It's not predictive programming. It's the script—they know it, write it, and implement it.'

On August 8, 2023, high winds and dry weather caused wildfires to develop in Lāhainā, Upper Kula, Upper Makawao and Olinda on the island of Maui.

These wildfires affected approximately 1,550 parcels and 2,200 structures and were one of the deadliest US wildfires in at least the past 100 years.

At least 201 people were confirmed dead as a result. 

Bailey claims it foreshadowed the 2023 wildfires that devastated Maui. While the devastating event happened in 2023, years after the flavor hit shelves, Bailey and other conspiracy theorists are sure there is a link

While Mountain Dew made a joke about the theory, there is no evidence to support any of Bailey's claims

Bailey also linked the 2024 flavor Star Spangled Splash to the collapse of Baltimore's Francis Scott Key Bridge, noting that Key wrote the 'Star-Spangled Banner.' 

The patriotic theme, he suggests, is no accident.

On March 26, the ship suffered a power outage and crashed into one of the Key Bridge's support columns, causing the entire bridge to come down and killing six construction workers.

Mountain Dew reintroduced its Pitch Black in 2023 for a limited-time and made it exclusive in October 2024.

Bailey believes the flavor foretold the July 2024 CrowdStrike outage that caused widespread IT disruptions.

Bailey also linked the 2024 flavor Star Spangled Splash to the collapse of Baltimore's Francis Scott Key Bridge, noting that Key wrote the 'Star-Spangled Banner'

Bailey also believes Mountain Dew's Pitch Black predicted the CrowdStrike blackout, which affected more than eight million devices around the globe

He pointed out that Pitch Black, with its ominous name and dark branding, coincided eerily with what he called the 'biggest IT blackout of all time.'

The CrowdStrike blackout affected more than eight million devices around the globe, shutting down airlines, airports, public transit, healthcare and financial services.

Bailey's theory was discussed on the Sunday Cool podcast this month, which focuses on comedy and conspiracy theories.

The hosts, Josh Hooper and and Andy DeNoon, also highlighted that Mountain Dew is owned by Pepsi that worked with the CIA in the 1970s.

Worried that President Salvador Allende's socialist agenda could jeopardize PepsiCo's operations in Chile, then-chairman Donald Kendall contacted President Nixon directly. 

Following Kendall's requests, the CIA organized a plot to overthrow Allende, including providing arms to the Chilean opposition. 

'Does the CIA work with Pepsi?' Hooper asked during the podcast.

DeNoon replied: 'I think it is confirmed at this point.'

The Vatican has been buzzing with the news that Cardinal Robert Francis Prevost is the newly elected Pope Leo XIV, sparking debates about the influence of affluent MAGA Catholics on this crucial choice.

On May 8, it was officially declared by the Vatican that Cardinal Prevost will take up the papal mantle following the passing of Pope Francis last month.

Originating from Chicago, 69-year-old Cardinal Prevost's election is a momentous occasion as he becomes the first American to head the worldwide Catholic Church and its roughly 1.4 billion adherents, reports Daily Express US.

US President Donald Trump wasted no time in offering his congratulations to the new Pope on Truth Social, stating, ""Congratulations to Cardinal Robert Francis Prevost, who was just named Pope.""

Trump added with evident excitement, ""It is such an honor to realize that he is the first American Pope. What excitement, and what a Great Honor for our Country. I look forward to meeting Pope Leo XIV. It will be a very meaningful moment!""

Yet amidst the fanfare, there are lingering doubts; writer Gareth More suggested possible clandestine maneuvers in his piece published two days earlier, on May 6 - before the Conclave's decision on Leo XIV.

More referred to a significant photo showing Cardinal Juan Luis Cipriani Thorne, 81, paying respects next to the open casket of Pope Francis before the funeral.

The scandal broke out as Cipriani, clad in cardinal attire - a direct defiance of Francis' ban due to allegations of sexually abusing a minor in 1983 - showed no signs of remorse. The 81-year-old, who is Opus Dei's first cardinal, represents a conservative stronghold within the Catholic Church that is accused of exerting significant influence.

More weighed in on the controversy, stating: ""Ultra-conservatives have spent the last 12 years quietly – and sometimes not so quietly – seething at Pope Francis' progressivism and his attempts to open up the Church.""

His analysis of Cipriani's bold move suggests turmoil ahead for the Vatican hierarchy.

""They have longed for a return to tradition and have been emboldened in recent years by a resurgence in support for right-wing, traditionalist political parties across the globe. The time is ripe for a MAGA-style papacy, they argue,"" More asserted.

However, More is not the only one expressing concerns about the upcoming Papal conclave. American news program The Young Turks released a video on May 7, entitled MAGA lobbies Vatican with lavish gifts to pick the 'right' Pope.

Reporter Yasmin Khan provided insights into the Papal Foundation, an exclusive Catholic nonprofit with a steep membership fee, sharing details from a recent gathering in Rome.

Khan reported: ""One guest did tell reporters, this room could raise a billion to help the church so long as we have the right Pope. ""

Recently in Rome, the NAPA Institute, described as a Catholic group with ties to the MAGA movement by the Daily Beast, made an appearance.

Its members attended a dinner at the prestigious Pontifical University of St. Thomas Aquinas, also referred to as the Angelicum or Collegio Angelico.

During the event, Tim Busch, the institute's founder, treated cardinals to wine bottles valued at up to $125.

Busch has previously lauded the Trump administration as ""the most Christian"" he's ever encountered, despite President Trump himself admitting to a deficiency in ""charity.""

The U.K. government is developing a program that seeks to identify murderers before they commit the ultimate crime. The real-world application of this type of tool will have devastating consequences.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Describing the horrors of communism under Stalin and others, Nobel laureate Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn wrote in his magnum opus, ""The Gulag Archipelago,"" that ""the line dividing good and evil cuts through the heart of every human being."" Indeed, under the communist regime, citizens were removed from society before they could cause harm to it. This removal, which often entailed a trip to the labor camp from which many did not return, took place in a manner that deprived the accused of due process. In many cases, the mere suspicion or even hint that an act against the regime might occur was enough to earn a one way ticket with little to no recourse. The underlying premise here that the officials knew when someone might commit a transgression. In other words, law enforcement knew where that line lies in people's hearts.



The U.K. government has decided to chase this chimera by investing in a program that seeks to preemptively identify who might commit murder. Specifically, the project uses government and police data to profile people to ""predict"" who have a high likelihood to commit murder. Currently, the program is in its research stage, with similar programs being used for the context of making probation decisions.

Such a program that reduces individuals to data points carries enormous risks that might outweigh any gains. First, the output of such programs is not error free, meaning it might wrongly implicate people. Second, we will never know if a prediction was incorrect because there's no way of knowing if something doesn't happen — was a murder prevented, or would it never have taken place remains unanswerable? Third, the program can be misused by opportunistic actors to justify targeting people, especially minorities — the ability to do so is baked into a bureaucracy.

Consider: the basis of a bureaucratic state rests on its ability to reduce human beings to numbers. In doing so, it offers the advantages of efficiency and fairness — no one is supposed to get preferential treatment. Regardless of a person's status or income, the DMV (DVLA in the U.K.) would treat the application for a driver's license or its renewal the same way. But mistakes happen, and navigating the labyrinth of bureaucratic procedures to rectify them is no easy task.

In the age of algorithms and artificial intelligence (AI), this problem of accountability and recourse in case of errors has become far more pressing.

Mathematician Cathy O'Neil has documented cases of wrongful termination of school teachers because of poor scores as calculated by an AI algorithm. The algorithm, in turn, was fueled by what could be easily measured (e.g., test scores) rather than the effectiveness of teaching (a poor performing student improved significantly or how much teachers helped students in non quantifiable ways). The algorithm also glossed over whether grade inflation had occurred in the previous years. When the teachers questioned the authorities about the performance reviews that led to their dismissal, the explanation they received was in the form of ""the math told us to do so"" — even after authorities admitted that the underlying math was not 100% accurate.

If a potential future murderer is preemptively arrested, ""Minority Report""-style, how can we know if the person may have decided on their own not to commit murder? 

As such, the use of algorithms creates what journalist Dan Davies calls an ""accountability sink"" — it strips accountability by ensuring that no one person or entity can be held responsible, and it prevents the person affected by a decision from being able to fix mistakes.

This creates a twofold problem: An algorithm's estimates can be flawed, and the algorithm does not update itself because no one is held accountable. No algorithm can be expected to be accurate all the time; it can be calibrated with new data. But this is an idealistic view that does not even hold true in science; scientists can resist updating a theory or schema, especially when they are heavily invested in it. And similarly and unsurprisingly, bureaucracies do not readily update their beliefs.

To use an algorithm in an attempt to predict who is at risk of committing murder is perplexing and unethical. Not only could it be inaccurate, but there's no way to know if the system was right. In other words, if a potential future murderer is preemptively arrested, ""Minority Report""-style, how can we know if the person may have decided on their own not to commit murder? The UK government is yet to clarify how they intend to use the program other than stating that the research is being carried for the purposes of ""preventing and detecting unlawful acts.""



We're already seeing similar systems being used in the United States. In Louisiana, an algorithm called TIGER (short for ""Targeted Interventions to Greater Enhance Re-entry"") — predicts whether an inmate might commit a crime if released, which then serves as a basis for making parole decisions. Recently, a 70-year-old nearly blind inmate was denied parole because TIGER predicted he had a high risk of re-offending..

In another case that eventually went to the Wisconsin Supreme Court (State vs. Loomis), an algorithm was used to guide sentencing. Challenges to the sentence — including a request for access to the algorithm to determine how it reached its recommendation — were denied on grounds that the technology was proprietary. In essence, the technological opaqueness of the system was compounded in a way that potentially undermined due process.

Equally, if not more troublingly, the dataset underlying the program in the U.K. — initially dubbed the Homicide Prediction Project — consists of hundreds of thousands of people who never granted permission for their data to be used to train the system. Worse, the dataset — compiled using data from the Ministry, Greater Manchester Police of Justice, and the Police National Computer — contains personal data, including, but not limited to, information on addiction, mental health, disabilities, previous instances of self-harm, and whether they had been victims of a crime. Indicators such as gender and race are also included.

—Climate wars are approaching — and they will redefine global conflict

—'It is a dangerous strategy, and one for which we all may pay dearly': Dismantling USAID leaves the US more exposed to pandemics than ever

These variables naturally increase the likelihood of bias against ethnic minorities and other marginalized groups. So the algorithm's predictions may simply reflect policing choices of the past — predictive AI algorithms rely on statistical induction, so they project past (troubling) patterns in the data into the future.

In addition, the data overrepresents Black offenders from affluent areas as well as all ethnicities from deprived neighborhoods. Past studies show that AI algorithms that make predictions about behavior work less well for Black offenders than they do for other groups. Such findings do little to allay genuine fears that racial minority groups and other vulnerable groups will be unfairly targeted.

In his book, Solzhenitsyn informed the Western world of the horrors of a bureaucratic state grinding down its citizens in service of an ideal, with little regard for the lived experience of human beings. The state was almost always wrong (especially on moral grounds), but, of course, there was no mea culpa. Those who were wronged were simply collateral damage to be forgotten.

Now, half a century later, it is rather strange that a democracy like the U.K. is revisiting a horrific and failed project from an authoritarian Communist country as a way of ""protecting the public."" The public does need to be protected — not only from criminals but also from a ""technopoly"" that vastly overestimates the role of technology in building and maintaining a healthy society.

A Greek woman decided to divorce her husband of 12 years after ChatGPT told her he was having an affair, simply by “reading” the coffee grounds in his coffee cup.

OpenAI's ChatGPT chatbot is great for a lot of things, but it can ruin your life if you blindly put your trust in it. One Greek man recently appeared on the Greek TV morning show To Proino to complain about ChatGPT destroying his marriage by painting him as an adulterer simply by interpreting the coffee grounds in a cup of coffee he had posed with for his wife. Allegedly following a social media trend, the man's wife thought it would be fun to have the world's most popular chatbot “read” their coffee cups in a sort of modern twist on the art of tasseography. She made coffee for both of them and then uploaded photos of the grounds in their cups for ChatGPT to “read”. The chatbot claimed that the woman's husband was having an affair with another woman, which made his wife furious enough to file for divorce without even asking him if it was true.

“I laughed it off as nonsense,” the husband said on the show. “But she took it seriously. She asked me to leave, told our kids we were getting divorced, and then I got a call from a lawyer. That's when I realized this wasn't just a phase.”

According to ChatGPT, the man was fantasizing about a mysterious woman whose name started with the initial “E”,  and with whom he was destined to begin a relationship. To make matters worse, the chatbot's interpretation of the wife's coffee cup revealed that her spouse was already cheating and that this mystery woman was hell-bent on destroying their family.

After he refused to agree to a separation, the poor husband was served divorce papers just three days later. However, his lawyer warned that they would contest the divorce actions because the claims made by an AI chatbot have no legal standing, and his client was innocent until proven guilty.

Apparently, the woman is very sensitive to divinatory practices. The husband said that a few years ago, she visited an astrologer and became obsessed with astrology. “It took a whole year for her to accept that none of it was real,” the man said.

After the bizarre divorce case went viral in Greece, seasoned tasseography practitioners explained that reading into a cup of coffee involves more than the grounds. Masters of the trade also analyze the foam and the saucer, and ChatGPT is definitely not a master.

Ras Baraka, who has spoken out against Trump's immigration policies, was at the center with Democratic members of Congress

The mayor of Newark, Ras Baraka, was arrested for trespass at an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) detention center in New Jersey on Friday as Democratic members of Congress also attempted to conduct what they say was a visit to the controversial facility to conduct “federal oversight”.

News of Baraka's arrest at Delaney Hall was reported on X by Alina Habba, the acting US attorney for the district of New Jersey, and a former personal attorney and adviser to Donald Trump.

“The Mayor of Newark, Ras Baraka, committed trespass and ignored multiple warnings from Homeland Security Investigations to remove himself from the ICE detention center in Newark, New Jersey this afternoon,” Habba wrote.

“He has willingly chosen to disregard the law. That will not stand in this state. He has been taken into custody. No one is above the law.”

Kabir Moss, spokesperson for the Baraka for Governor campaign, said in a statement that he was taken to a Customs and Border Protection (CBP) office a few miles from the facility and remained in detention.

“We are actively monitoring and will provide more details as they become available,” Moss said.

The New Jersey Globe published a photograph of him being led away in handcuffs by officers in jackets marked “Police Ice”. The newspaper does not have a reporter at the scene, but said observers at Delaney Hall said there had been “a scuffle”.

Baraka, who spoke out against Trump's immigration policies in January after an immigration raid in Newark he said Ice agents conducted without a warrant, was at Delaney Hall with Democratic New Jersey Congress members Bonnie Watson Coleman, LaMonica McIver and Rob Menendez.

The politicians have accused the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) of reopening the detention facility, in contravention of local ordinances and without the necessary permits.

It is the largest such facility in the north-eastern US, and was the first to open after Trump's second term of office began in January, according to the Ice website.

Coleman, in a tweet, said the visit was an attempt to establish conditions inside. “We've heard stories of what it's like in other Ice prisons. We're exercising our oversight authority to see for ourselves,” she wrote.

            Trump administration officials are weighing a change that would shift responsibility for US security interests in Greenland to the military command that oversees America's homeland defense, underscoring the president's focus on the strategically important territory that he has repeatedly said he wants to acquire, three sources familiar with the deliberations told CNN.
    


            The change under consideration would move Greenland out of US European Command's area of responsibility and into US Northern Command, the sources said.
    


            On its face, the idea of putting Greenland under NORTHCOM authority makes some logical sense given it is part of the North American continent, though politically and culturally, it is associated with Europe and is a semiautonomous territory of Denmark. Some of the discussions pre-date Trump's return to office this year, the sources said.
    


            US Northern Command declined to comment. CNN has reached out to the Office of the Secretary of Defense as well as Danish and Greenlandic officials for comment.
    


            Still, several US officials expressed wariness about the move because of Trump's repeated insistence that the US “needs” Greenland and his refusal to rule out military action to obtain it.
    


            In an interview with NBC that aired last weekend, Trump renewed that threat.
    


            “I don't rule it out,” he said. “I don't say I'm going to do it, but I don't rule out anything.”
    


            “We need Greenland very badly,” Trump said. “Greenland is a very small amount of people, which we'll take care of, and we'll cherish them, and all of that. But we need that for international security.”
    


            US Northern Command is chiefly responsible for protecting US territory and currently oversees missions like the southern border task force.
    


            Trump's rhetoric has also caused major friction with Denmark and with Greenland itself.
    


            Putting Greenland under US Northern Command would at least symbolically split Greenland from Denmark, which would still be overseen by US European Command.
    


            Danish officials are concerned about the message that could send suggesting that Greenland is not a part of Denmark, one of the sources familiar with the deliberations said.
    


            Proponents of the move have pointed out that despite there being a US military base there and Greenland being seen as a vital outpost in competition with Russia and China for access to the Arctic — a major bipartisan national security priority — it sometimes gets overlooked by US European Command because of its distance from the command center in central Europe, one US official said.
    


            For US NORTHCOM, though, Greenland is an important vantage point for any potential enemy craft coming from that direction towards the United States. The unclassified version of the US intelligence community's annual threat assessment mentioned Greenland four times, within the context of adversaries like China and Russia seeking to expand their influence there.
    


            The discussions about moving Greenland into NORTHCOM come amid another high-profile spat between American and Danish officials over Greenland.
    


            Danish Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen said this week that he plans to “call in” the US acting ambassador to Denmark for talks after a Wall Street Journal report said Washington had ordered US intelligence agencies to increase spying on Greenland.
    


            They were directed to learn more about Greenland's independence movement and attitudes towards American resource extraction, the Journal reported.
    


            “I have read the article in the Wall Street Journal, and it worries me greatly because we do not spy on friends,” Rasmussen told reporters in Warsaw on Wednesday, during an informal meeting of EU foreign ministers.
    


            “We are going to call in the US acting ambassador for a discussion at the foreign ministry to see if we can confirm this information, which is somewhat disturbing,” Rasmussen added.

The problems keep piling up at Newark Liberty International Airport.

The Federal Aviation Administration said that an air traffic control equipment outage at the Philadelphia approach control facility, which guides aircraft in and out of Newark, occurred around 3:55 a.m. on Friday morning.

The agency said it affected communications and radar displays for ""approximately 90 seconds.""

It's the facility's second outage since April 28, when screens went dark for 60 to 90 seconds and prevented controllers from talking to aircraft.

Operational issues, coupled with bad weather and runway construction, have caused hundreds of delays and cancellations at the airport over nearly two weeks.

United CEO Scott Kirby has called on the government to designate Newark as a ""level 3"" airport, meaning it would run on a slot system that limits the number of planes that could take off and land at certain times to manage capacity.

In July, some controllers were moved from an approach control facility in New York to one in Philadelphia to address understaffing issues, but the facility is still facing shortages.

Kirby said in a letter to customers in May that the Philadelphia center has been ""chronically understaffed for years"" and that Newark ""cannot handle the number of planes that are scheduled to operate there in the weeks and months ahead.""

The airline, which holds the largest market share at Newark, has since axed 35 daily flights, or about 10% of its schedule at the airport, to deal with overcapacity and compounding air traffic problems.

The airport is also grappling with the closure of its main runway, which won't be operational until at least mid-June.

An FAA advisory said that as of 12 p.m. ET on Friday, Newark is facing arrival and departure delays of up to four hours because of overcapacity, runway construction, and bad weather.

United does not fly out of New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport, which has not been affected by the Philadelphia control problems, meaning rivals Delta and American have not experienced the same disruptions to flights and customers.

Recent air traffic control issues have highlighted the US's ongoing battle to update aging equipment and hire more controllers at facilities around the country.

The FAA said in May 2024 that it was short about 3,000 controllers but was meeting its hiring goals to catch up.

Still, the entire infrastructure needs work, an issue made clear by the recent problems in Newark and the January midair collision over Washington, DC. A preliminary investigation found that the DC airport tower was understaffed at the time of the crash.

The Trump administration announced a ""supercharge"" program in February to accelerate hiring. This program includes offering bonuses to new hires, reducing the hiring process by months, and creating new opportunities for veteran controllers.

In March, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy announced a plan to upgrade the national airspace system with modernized technology and infrastructure.

 Bitcoin (BTCUSD) will remain in the spotlight Friday after surging above the closely watched $100,000 level on Thursday for the first time since early February.


 The legacy cryptocurrency rallied along with stocks after President Donald Trump announced that the U.S. had reached a trade agreement with the U.K. The president also said that further deals could be on the way and expressed optimism about trade talks with China that are slated to take place this weekend.


 Bitcoin's price had fallen sharply between February and April, weighed down by uncertainty about tariffs and their potential impact on the economy, as well as disappointment with the pace of reforms by the Trump administration to support the crypto industry. With the latest surge, bitcoin is nearly 40% above last month's low and up 10% from the start of the year.


 Bitcoin was trading at $102,700 late Thursday evening, up from an intraday low of around $96,000.


 Below, we take a closer look at Bitcoin's chart and apply technical analysis to identify crucial price levels worth watching out for.


 After reclaiming the 200-day moving average (MA) last month, bitcoin traded within a narrow consolidation period before today's strong breakout above the all-important $100,000 mark. The move sets the stage for a potential retest of the cryptocurrency's record high established at $109,000 in late January.


 Meanwhile, the relative strength index confirms bullish price momentum with a reading above the 70 threshold, though the indicator also cautions overbought conditions that could lead to short-term profit-taking.


 It's important to note that trading volumes on Coinbase (COIN), the largest crypto exchange in the United States, have declined since bitcoin's move higher started in early April, indicating larger market participants may be sitting out the current rally.


 Let's identify two crucial overhead areas on bitcoin's chart worth watching while also locating key support levels to monitor.


 The first overhead area to watch sits around $107,000. This location will likely attract significant attention near the prominent December and January peaks that marked a double top pattern on the chart.


 Investors can forecast an overhead area to watch above the cryptocurrency's record high by using bars pattern analysis. 


 To apply this technique, we take the price bars comprising bitcoin's move higher that preceded the recent consolidation period and reposition them from today's breakout point. The analysis projects a potential upside target of around $120,000 assuming a continuation move plays out.


 Short-term profit-taking could see the cryptocurrency's price revisit the $100,000 level. Following today's breakout above this key psychological area, the region may flip from prior resistance into future support.


 However, inability of bulls to successfully defend this level could trigger a more significant retracement in bitcoin's price to $92,000. This region finds a confluence of support from the nearby upward sloping 200-day MA and a trendline that connects a range of corresponding trading activity on the chart stretching back to late November last year.

FIFA announced Friday its plans to expand the Women's World Cup to 48 teams starting in 2031.

""This is not just about having 16 more teams playing in the FIFA Women's World Cup but taking the next steps in relation to the women's game in general by ensuring that more FIFA Member Associations have the chance to benefit from the tournament to develop their women's football structures from a holistic point of view,"" FIFA president Gianni Infantino said.

Infantino added that the move ""ensures we are maintaining the momentum in terms of growing women's football globally.""

A 48-team field puts the Women's World Cup in line with the men's tournament. The 2026 World Cup will be the first to welcome 48 teams, up from 32.

More games inevitably means more revenue for FIFA and its individual federations, money that will get funneled down to the players.

However, some are likely to question the value of expanding the Women's World Cup for many of the same reasons that the idea of a 48-team men's event sparked criticism.

Matches in the group stage won't carry the same stakes when eight third-place finishers move on to the knockout phase. The gap between the best and worst teams in the World Cup is widening as well.

Exacerbating the second facet, women's soccer hasn't had as much time to build a broad infrastructure compared to when FIFA made 48 teams a reality on the men's side.

Whereas the men's World Cup dates back to 1930, the Women's World Cup was first staged in 1991. Established European powers such as England, Spain, and France only started to fully invest in their national teams within the last decade. Spain, which won the 2023 World Cup, didn't qualify for the first time until 2015.

Countries without prestigious domestic leagues or a successful men's national team are further behind the curve.

At the 2023 World Cup, Vietnam had a minus-12 goal differential in the group stage. The Philippines scored one goal and allowed eight in three matches. In Group C, Zambia and Costa Rica combined to earn three points with a minus-15 goal differential.

Even with the expected growth of women's soccer, lopsided games are bound to be more frequent at the 2031 World Cup. 

Some may argue that's an acceptable cost if it ultimately yields more money that can be spent to help raise the standard of the sport, though.","{'href': 'https://bleacherreport.com', 'title': 'Bleacher Report'}","soccer"
