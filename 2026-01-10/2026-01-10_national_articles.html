President Donald Trump discusses how companies can help rebuild Venezuela following the capture of dictator Nicolas Maduro. President Donald Trump has signed an executive order blocking U.S. courts from seizing Venezuelan oil revenues held in American Treasury accounts. The order states that court action against the funds would undermine U.S. national security and foreign policy objectives. President Donald Trump is pictured signing two executive orders on Sept. 19, 2025, establishing the "Trump Gold Card" and introducing a $100,000 fee for H-1B visas. He signed another executive order recently protecting oil revenue. Trump signed the order on Friday, the same day that he met with nearly two dozen top oil and gas executives at the White House. The president said American energy companies will invest $100 billion to rebuild Venezuela's "rotting" oil infrastructure and push production to record levels following the capture of Venezuelan dictator Nicolás Maduro.

New video shows hooded figure walking near Ohio home where Spencer and Monique Tepe were killed in December. Columbus Police Chief Elaine Bryant is speaking out about the murder of an Ohio dentist and his wife, calling the case "disturbing." Spencer Tepe, 37, and his 39-year-old wife, Monique, were found shot to death inside their Weinland Park home in Columbus on Dec. 30. Investigators have ruled out a murder-suicide and released surveillance video of a person of interest seen walking through a nearby alley near the couple's home in the lead-up to the murders. "We know that there are a lot of concerns and a lot of questions surrounding this case. Unfortunately, there are some things that we can't talk about for the integrity of the investigation," she continued. Spencer and Monique Tepe were preparing to celebrate their five-year wedding anniversary. "It puts a lot of stress on us, but I just want to reiterate, while this case is getting a lot of national attention, we look at all of our homicides in that manner," she also told the station. "They all bring us stress because someone lost their lives." Investigators believe the killings occurred between 2 a.m. and 5 a.m. on Dec. 30, and authorities are urging anyone with video, photos or other digital evidence from that timeframe to contact police. Spencer and Monique Tepe are pictured on their wedding day. Newly released body camera video this week also showed a Columbus police officer going to the wrong address during an initial welfare check. Ohio dentist Dr. Spencer Tepe and his wife, Monique Tepe, were found shot to death inside their home in Columbus, Ohio. While their two children were discovered unharmed, authorities reportedly believe their deaths were not the result of a murder-suicide. "The officer did everything that he was supposed to do," Bryant said, adding the response was later determined to be at the wrong address.

It is clear that Rodgers has enjoyed his time in Pittsburgh — after making the playoffs himself for the first time in four years, how could he not? Rodgers was asked about what he likes about the Steelers organization, and he took a not-so-subtle shot at his last team, the New York Jets. Aaron Rodgers of the Pittsburgh Steelers celebrates following an NFL football game against the Baltimore Ravens at Acrisure Stadium on Jan. 4, 2026 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. "One thing I really love, and it's kind of the antithesis of where I was — there's not really any leaks in the boat," Rodgers told reporters this week. "Every year, you have difficulties and adversity, both on the field and off, and to go through a season like this and be able to focus on football and not have a lot of other little bulls--- out there has been really nice." During his time with the Jets, Rodgers was adamant that media leaks were a "problem with the organization." "There's no place in a winning culture (for this)," Rodgers said on a December 2023 edition of "The Pat McAfee Show." Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback Aaron Rodgers (8) passes in the first half of an NFL football game against the Cleveland Browns in Pittsburgh, Sunday, Oct. 12, 2025. And even if they are, is that really what you want to be about? I think it's chicken s--- at its core, and I think it has no place in a winning organization… Put your name on something and stand behind it." "If you want to be a winning organization and put yourself in a position to win championships and be competitive, everything that you do matters," Rodgers told reporters in January 2024. The Jets decided to move on from Rodgers while hiring first-year head coach Aaron Glenn, and it seems Rodgers has the last laugh. Pittsburgh Steelers' Aaron Rodgers reacts after a touchdown during the second half of an NFL football game against the Detroit Lions in Detroit, Michigan, on Dec. 21, 2025. Gang Green also became the first team in NFL history to go an entire season without recording an interception. They ended the year losing each of their last five games by 23 or more points — a feat never before seen.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A Biden-appointed federal judge on Friday blocked President Donald Trump‘s funding threat regarding changes to states' voting systems and voter registration forms. The judge, U.S. District Judge John Chun, ruled that Trump's threat to pull funds from the Election Assistance Commission puts unconstitutional pressure on states. “The President has no authority to unilaterally impose new conditions on federal funds,” Chun wrote in a 75-page ruling. He also wrote that the court determined Trump's executive orders constitute a violation of the separation of powers. Chun argued that the president's powers are aimed at overseeing laws, not to be a lawmaker. “The Court concludes that Plaintiffs have plausibly alleged, and for some provisions proved, that the EO violates separation of powers,” he wrote. Chun is the third federal judge to block Trump's March 25 executive order, “PRESERVING AND PROTECTING THE INTEGRITY OF AMERICAN ELECTIONS.” The order set new standards for election integrity, including on mail-in ballots. A White House spokesperson told Politico that Trump “cares deeply about the integrity of our elections and his executive order takes lawful actions to ensure election security.” The administration is expected to appeal the latest ruling and has also appealed rulings by Washington, D.C. U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly, an Obama appointee, and Massachusetts U.S. District Judge Denise Casper, also an Obama appointee. Trump has made claims that the 2020 election was rigged and that former President Joe Biden was an illegitimate president.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This photo provided by the Ukrainian Security Service on Friday, Jan. 9, 2026, shows a fragment believed to be a part of a Russian Oreshnik intermediate range hypersonic ballistic missile that hit the Lviv region. KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — A Ukrainian drone strike sparked a fire at an oil depot in Russia's southern Volgograd region, officials said Saturday, after Russia launched a powerful hypersonic missile along with drones and other weapons that disrupted Kyiv's power supply and heating. There were no immediate reports of casualties, Volgograd Gov. Ukraine's General Staff said Saturday it had struck the Zhutovskaya oil depot overnight. In a statement on Telegram, it said the depot is supplying fuel to Russian forces, adding that damage was being assessed. Ukraine's long-range drone strikes on Russian energy sites aim to deprive Moscow of the oil export revenue it needs to pursue its full-scale invasion. Saturday's attack came the day after Russia bombarded Ukraine with hundreds of drones and dozens of missiles overnight into Friday, according to Ukrainian officials, killing at least four people in the capital. For only the second time in the nearly 4-year-old war, it used a powerful new hypersonic missile that struck western Ukraine in a clear warning to Kyiv's NATO allies. Stéphane Dujarric, spokesman for the U.N. secretary-general, said Friday's attacks “have resulted in significant civilian casualties and deprived millions of Ukrainians of essential services, including electricity, heating and water at a time of acute humanitarian need.” Ukrainian Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko said heat supply would be fully restored in Kyiv by the end of Saturday. She said areas on the right bank of the Dnieper River would gradually lift emergency blackouts and return to scheduled outages. But resuming power supply on the left bank, where Russian attacks were concentrated, is more complicated due to significant damage to the power grid, she added. Russia's Defense Ministry said Saturday that its forces used aviation, drones, missiles and artillery to strike Ukrainian energy facilities and fuel-storage depots. Russia struck Ukraine with 121 drones and one Iskander-M ballistic missile, according to the Ukrainian air force. Separately, the Russian Defense Ministry said 59 Ukrainian drones were neutralized overnight over Russia and occupied Crimea. Ukraine's military said that besides the oil depot in Volgograd, it had struck a drone storage facility belonging to a unit of Russia's 19th Motor Rifle Division in Zaporizhzhia, southern Ukraine, as well as a drone command and control point near the eastern city of Pokrovsk.</p>

For years, the people of Venezuela have endured a nightmare imposed by socialist tyranny. Under President Nicolás Maduro, a once-prosperous nation was reduced to deprivation, violence and despair. Venezuela became a case study in how socialism destroys everything it touches. That dark chapter has come to an end. I have always believed that Maduro must go, and will always be proud of the Trump-Pence administration's work on Venezuela. Together, we led the charge against Maduro, building an unprecedented coalition of over 60 nations and forging bipartisan consensus in Congress to recognize the illegitimacy of the dictator's power. We froze regime assets so they could not use the funds to empower their human rights abuses, while providing nearly $1 billion in aid for the Venezuelan people. For the first time since Sept. 11, 2001, we invoked the Western Hemisphere's version of a mutual defense pact to show our commitment to Venezuelan security and freedom. Venezuelans celebrate in Santiago, Chile, Saturday, Jan. 3, 2026, after President Donald Trump announced that President Nicolas Maduro had been captured and flown out of Venezuela. His grip on Venezuela has been broken, and a long-suffering people now have a historic opportunity to reclaim their freedom and rebuild their nation. For years, the United States rightly recognized that Maduro was a dictator with no legitimate claim to rule. He stole elections, jailed political opponents, silenced the free press and turned the machinery of government into a criminal enterprise. Trump deserves the gratitude of all who cherish freedom for taking bold and historic action to end this socialist catastrophe. No free people knowingly trades prosperity for poverty. Maduro and his predecessor, Hugo Chávez, forced that decision on Venezuela — replacing free markets with centralized control, seizing the oil industry, commandeering electricity and telecommunications, and crushing private enterprise. The results were as predictable as they were devastating: food shortages, rolling blackouts, massive inflation and the collapse of civil society. I met displaced families who had fled with nothing but the clothes on their backs. Their heartbreaking stories left no doubt that Maduro's regime was not merely incompetent, but profoundly cruel. That cruelty spilled across Venezuela's borders and spread misery throughout the Western Hemisphere. Many eventually made their way to the United States, some illegally and others by exploiting a broken asylum system. At the same time, Maduro's regime became deeply entangled in international drug trafficking, flooding American communities with poison and destroying countless lives. Even the Biden administration acknowledged the criminal nature of Maduro's rule, placing a multimillion-dollar bounty on his capture for narco-terrorism and corruption. Maduro also invited America's adversaries into our own hemisphere. Russia, Iran, Cuba and communist China expanded their influence under his protection, turning Venezuela into a platform for hostile powers operating dangerously close to our shores — a clear and present national security threat to the United States. Trump deserves the gratitude of all who cherish freedom for taking bold and historic action to end this socialist catastrophe. The progressive left and some on the populist right have criticized Trump's decision to move forward with absolute resolve in bringing Maduro to justice. The Constitution, however, vests the president with broad authority as commander-in-chief to take limited but decisive action to protect our nation, and he has an obligation to faithfully execute our nation's laws, including the criminal laws that Maduro stands accused of breaking. Presidents of both parties have exercised these authorities for generations. To deny them now would dangerously weaken future presidents and place America at greater risk. They deserve a rebirth of freedom — a new Venezuela governed by Venezuelans, rooted in the recognition of God-given liberties, committed to free markets and sustained by free and fair elections. Today, thanks to President Trump and the brave men and women of our armed forces, that future is within reach. And as freedom takes root again in Venezuela, it will strengthen security and prosperity across our entire hemisphere — just as America has always stood ready to do. Mike Pence is the former vice president of the United States and founder of Advancing American Freedom. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed.

For the past few weeks, Elon Musk's Grok AI bot has been generating pornographic images of women and underage girls, without their consent, at an astounding rate. On Friday, X at last put some minor guardrails on the tool, with a new policy that only paying subscribers can use Grok to generate or alter images. Grok has long been one of the more suggestive of the major AI models, with “spicy” and “sexy” settings that can be toggled on and off. There is a certain amount of truth to Musk's take. The porn industry tends to reward early adopters, and the money to be made in porn means that it has impressive leverage when it comes to choosing between two competing and incompatible forms of technology. Yet the idea that porn as an industry, neutral and amorphous, settles tech wars doesn't show us the whole truth. It would be more accurate to say that the technologies we use to generate and share images are, more often than not, shaped by people distributing images of women's bodies — often with dubious consent from the women themselves. In that sense, Grok's abilities are par for the course. Porn didn't only help VHS win over Betamax. (Like VHS, Blu-rays held a lot more data than its competitors, which is especially attractive in the porn market.) A surprising amount of them revolved around people trying to share sexualized images of women's bodies as quickly as possible — only in these cases, the people whose images getting distributed weren't necessarily consenting adults who were getting paid for their trouble. Google Images was developed because so many people went searching for pictures of Jennifer Lopez in her famously low-cut Versace gown in 2000, a distinction Lopez has treated as a feather in her cap. The impetus for YouTube came when developers wanted to watch Janet Jackson's 2004 wardrobe malfunction and were frustrated that it took so long to find video of it on the internet. Jackson has always maintained that she did not intend for her breast to be seen on national TV, so here, we're dealing with nonconsensual nudity. Meanwhile, Mark Zuckerberg's progenitor for Facebook was Facesmash, a Hot or Not rip-off developed to compare the women of Harvard University's student body to farm animals. The intent here was less to create nonconsensual pornography than it was to perform a sexualized humiliation of nonconsenting women — an act that turned out to be so popular that it overwhelmed Harvard's servers the night it launched. So Musk is not entirely wrong when he says that technologies with what he euphemistically refers to as “spicy mode” tend to do well. A more accurate phrasing, however, might be to say that in our misogynistic society, objectifying and humiliating the bodies of unconsenting women is so valuable that the fate of world-altering technologies depends on how good they are at facilitating it. AI was always going to be used for this, one way or the other. But only someone as brutally uncaring and willing to cut corners as Elon Musk would allow it to go this wrong. Trans advocates would face a difficult road in the sports cases, even if the Court weren't dominated by Republicans. Is the internet really worse than it used to be, or are some of us just getting older?</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Then I almost bumped into a four-legged doglike robot behind me. They're just a couple of the many robots I encountered this week designed for a range of purposes, from playing chess to performing spinal surgery. Every January, companies from around the world gather to flaunt new technologies, products and services. The show is just as much spectacle as it is substance; many of the most eye-catching wares either haven't come to fruition (like flying cars) or are wildly expensive and impractical (think TVs that cost tens of thousands of dollars). But CES provides a glimpse into the bets being made by industry giants like Nvidia, Intel, Amazon and Samsung. Companies showed off everything from humanoid robots they claim will staff factories to refrigerators you can open with your voice to the next-generation chips that will power it all. CES, in some ways, turned the Strip into a bubble of its own, shielded from AI skepticism. CNN asked a handful of tech executives at CES about an AI bubble and how it might impact their businesses. Some said their businesses aren't relevant to the bubble concerns, while others expressed optimism about AI's potential and said they are focused on building products that show it. “We're in the earliest stage of what's possible. So when I hear we're in a bubble, I'm like… This isn't a fad,” said Panos Panay, Amazon's devices and services chief. Tech companies poured more than $61 billion into data center investments in 2025, according to S&P Global, fueling concerns that investments may be far outpacing demand. And investments are only expected to grow, with Goldman Sachs reporting that AI companies are estimated to invest more than $500 billion in capital expenditures this year. Julien Garran, researcher and partner for research firm MacroStrategy Partnership, said in a report last year that the AI bubble is 17 times bigger than the dot com bubble. Most of the concerns around an AI bubble have centered on investments in data centers built for AI tasks that are too power-hungry for devices like laptops and smartphones to handle alone. When asked about the AI bubble, executives from chipmakers Intel and Qualcomm pointed to their respective companies' efforts to improve how computers process AI tasks locally rather than in the cloud. Qualcomm, which makes chips for smartphones and other products, announced last year that it's expanding into data centers. But that represents a very small part of its business. “As far as we're concerned, where we operate is not where the bubble conversation exists,” Akash Palkhiwala, Qualcomm's chief financial officer and chief operating officer, told CNN. CK Kim, executive vice president and head of Samsung's digital appliances business, said in an interview through an interpreter that it's not for him to say whether the industry is in an AI bubble. Humanoid robots were a big part of that equation for companies like Nvidia, Intel, Hyundai and Qualcomm, all of which announced new tech to power human-shaped robots. Boston Dynamics and Hyundai debuted Atlas, a humanoid robot developed in partnership with Google's DeepMind AI division designed for industrial work like order fulfillment. It'll be deployed to Google DeepMind and Hyundai's Robotics Metaplant Applications center in the coming months, and additional customers will adopt it in early 2027. “With one investment, we can explore any application in the world, from industrial use cases to retail use cases to home use cases,” Aya Durbin, who leads Boston Dynamics' humanoid application product strategy, said in an interview at Hyundai's booth when asked what's driving the interest in humanoid robots. (Hyundai owns a controlling stake in Boston Dynamics.) Tech companies have also been chasing the next big product following the smartphone and think AI could be key to finding it. At CES, a wave of companies introduced discrete listening devices that can record conversations or voice notes. Speaking to gadgets is often faster than typing, but Amazon and Nirva also see their devices as another means to gather data that can provide insights about a user's life, though doing so will surely raise privacy concerns. Business leaders seem to agree that AI is here to stay — even for those like Pete Erickson, CEO of tech events and education company Modev, who said the industry is indeed in a bubble. But Erickson also believes AI is “just a part of our lives” now. “I don't think it's going anywhere,” he said. CNN International's Leif Coorlim contributed to this report.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>They stood a few yards apart on the confetti-strewn field, one a redshirt senior offensive lineman who serves as the anchor of his team, the other a sophomore defensive lineman who has yet to log his first career start. “We're afraid to death of complacency,'' said Pat Coogan, the lineman. “We never want to be complacent,'' said Daniel Ndukwe, the defensive lineman. No one wants to settle at anything but the human spirit being what it is, invariably it happens. Except, apparently, among the Hoosiers who play football as if not playing football hard would be an unforgivable sin. The reckoning in college football is not coming via financial windfall, as everyone thought that it might in the NIL era. It is coming via old-school values that tend to seep into the soil in the Midwest. Indiana is not the “Hoosiers” of film fame. They are not, in fact, the plucky little upstarts going against the big city bad guys. Do not let Fernando Mendoza's earnestness fool you. As Carter Smith made his way to the celebratory post Peach Bowl stage he yelled, “Excuse me,'”over and over again as he zigged and zagged his way through the media. With a 56-22 dismantling of Oregon, Indiana has romped through this College Football Playoff like nothing the sport has seen in years, if ever. In the last three games, the Hoosiers have held Ohio State to 10 points, Alabama to three and Oregon to 21, though that should come with an asterisk. That is, to underscore, Ohio State, Alabama and Oregon. The first two have won 25 national titles between them. Indiana has lost more than 700 games in its history and now is one game away from a national title. Next up is none other than The U, yet another member of the college football hoi polloi, in a championship game that might require organ donation to get a ticket. The Miami Hurricanes are at home, while the entire state of Indiana – save for some in West Lafayette – is content to abandon their homes to enjoy this unexpectedly stupefying playoff march. College football's calendar chaos runs square into the biggest games of the season Lest anyone try to bill this as some sort of morality play, the good boys from Indiana versus the meanies from Miami, it is best to remember that Indiana is the top seed; it's Miami that had to fight its way into the bracket. “They're complete,'' Oregon coach Dan Lanning said. “There's not a weakness in their game. So you see a really complete, well-coached team. They obviously have a ton of belief and deservedly so.'' It's almost like a bait and switch. Fret about finding ways to score and the offense punishes you. And then special teams piles on. On the first play from scrimmage in the game, D'Angelo Ponds expected an RPO play from Oregon quarterback Dante Moore. If you want to know what it sounds like when an entire state erupts, listen to the replay. The Hoosiers' defensive stalwartness has not exactly been lost; they are ranked No. Indiana's defense is masterful, a plug-and-play roster that is annihilating opponents without its leading tackler. Stephen Daley suffered a freak injury celebrating the Big Ten championship and hasn't played in the playoff. The Hoosiers simply find other guys. Ndukwe had all of eight tackles in his first 14 games; he had three against Oregon, including two sacks, the forced fumble and then the blocked punt cherry on top. “When you have good people and they buy in and they prepare the right way, we have  a lot of those guys,'' head coach Curt Cignetti said “They're high character, smart guys.'' Like Cignetti, defensive coordinator Bryant Haines came up the old-fashioned way, starting at schools most folks don't know exist – Manchester, a Division 3 school in Fort Wayne; Adrian, another D-3 outpost in Michigan. He's now one of the highest paid coordinators in college football, courtesy of a mad scientist approach to defense. The 40-year-old cooks up ways to make quarterbacks miserable in his sleep, devising schemes that are meant to lure as much as they are intended to confuse. He says he's toned things down as he's gotten older, learned when to take risks and how to better mix up his coverages. “That's what I call him, a mad scientist,'' said Ndukwe, who grew up in Lithonia, Georgia, and relished the home game. “I'm doing things that I've never done before and you can just see other teams, they get confused. You can feel how it affects them.”' Moore looked at times overwhelmed, either dancing in the pocket anxiously trying to find an open receiver or swarmed as the pocket collapsed. Ohio State's Justin Sayin threw a pick and was sacked five times, and Alabama's Ty Simpson threw for only 67 yards before leaving with a cracked rib. “They show you one thing,” Lanning said earlier this week, “and take something else away. They're really good at post-snap movement, which makes it difficult for the quarterback. Their defensive line plays with relentless effort. They're tough to block up front. And then the technique continues to show up.” Everything at Indiana continues to show up again and again like a metronome of consistency, their mantra so ingrained even the university president sings the same tune. While booster Mark Cuban barked “Hoo hoo Hoosiers!” outside the locker room with fans, Pamela Whitten unassumedly walked past the locker room before stopping to chat with a pair of reporters. “But we still have one more game.''</p>

Indiana quarterback Fernando Mendoza (15) throws a touchdown pass against Oregon during the first half of the Peach Bowl NCAA college football playoff semifinal, Friday, Jan. 9, 2026, in Atlanta. For Hoosiers quarterback Fernando Mendoza, that means a chance to end a fairytale season in the place where his story first began. It's been a historic season for Indiana, and Mendoza is largely to credit. Indiana won its first Big Ten title since 1967, beat Ohio State for the first time since 1988, earned the No. 1 seed in the College Football Playoff, won its first Rose Bowl, and in December, Mendoza became the program's first Heisman Trophy winner. After a five touchdown performance and 56-22 rout of Oregon in the Peach Bowl, there's now just one item left on the checklist for Mendoza and the Hoosiers — and that's beating Miami on its home turf in the championship game. It will be a homecoming for the quarterback, who grew up in Miami and attended Christopher Columbus High School, roughly 30 minutes south of Hard Rock Stadium. “I've actually not played in Hard Rock before, but I've been to a lot of games there,” Mendoza said. If you open Google Maps and put my address to the University of Miami campus, it's under a mile away.” Mendoza said he often biked and walked over, played rec basketball and spent the offseason training on campus, but the Miami and Mendoza connections don't end there. Mendoza's dad was a high school teammate of with Hurricanes coach Mario Cristobal. He faced his hometown team once, in October 2024, and threw for 285 yards, two touchdowns and an interception in a 39-38 loss. “They did switch defensive coordinators and last year was a very different offensive scheme as well,” Mendoza said. Cam Ward, who ended up being the No. It was heartbreaking, so just looking for the opportunity to play them again.” Mendoza has performed well under bright lights, and the Peach Bowl was no exception. He finished the game completing 17 of 20 passes for 177 yards and five touchdowns. He added 28 rushing yards on six carries and had a passer rating of 241.8.</p>

A spokesperson for the Kennedy Center said in a statement, “After careful consideration, we have made the difficult decision to part ways with the WNO due to a financially challenging relationship. We believe this represents the best path forward for both organizations and enables us to make responsible choices that support the financial stability and long-term future of the Trump Kennedy Center.” Kennedy Center president Richard Grenell, who was appointed by Trump's hand-picked board, said on X, “Having an exclusive relationship has been extremely expensive and limiting in choice and variety.” Grenell added, “Having an exclusive Opera was just not financially smart. Inside Trump's transformation of the Kennedy Center Since taking the reins at the center, Grenell has cut existing staff, hired political allies and mandated a “break-even policy” for every performance. “The Center's new business model requires productions to be fully funded in advance—a requirement incompatible with opera operations,” the opera said. “In the coming years, as we explore new venues and new ways of performing, WNO remains committed to its mission and artistic vision,” she said. The performing arts center has been hit with a string of abrupt cancellations from artists in recent weeks including the jazz group The Cookers and New York City-based dance company Doug Varone and Dancers who canceled their performances after Trump's name was added to the center - a living memorial for assassinated President John F. Kennedy. American banjo player Béla Fleck withdrew his upcoming performance with the National Symphony Orchestra, saying that performing at the center has become “charged and political.” The Brentano String Quartet, who canceled their February 1 performance at the Kennedy Center, said they will “regretfully forego performing there.” CNN's Betsy Klein and Nicky Robertson contributed to this report.</p>

Oregon quarterback Dante Moore (5) passes against Indiana during the second half of the Peach Bowl NCAA college football playoff semifinal, Friday, Jan. 9, 2026, in Atlanta. ATLANTA (AP) — The very first snap of the Peach Bowl pretty much summed up what kind of night it would be for Oregon. A pick-6 put Dante Moore and the Ducks in an immediate hole. That was only the beginning of their misery. If this had been a heavyweight fight, the refs would've stepped in before the halftime show. 1 Indiana romped into the national championship game with a 56-22 blowout of fifth-seeded Oregon in the College Football Playoff semifinal on Friday, a one-sided affair that was essentially over by the time the Ducks dragged themselves to the locker room — presumably to discuss seating arrangements for the long flight home even with another half still to go. Needing a near-perfect game, Oregon (13-2) instead gifted the mighty Hoosiers 21 points off three turnovers by Moore, resulting in a 35-7 deficit at the break. It was a bitter blow for the Ducks, who had hoped to capture the school's first national championship in football. 10 seed Miami, dismantling their Big Ten rivals after a much more competitive contest in Eugene during the regular season. “It was a great Indiana defense,” said Moore, who hasn't decided if we will enter the NFL draft or return to Oregon for another season. Back on the second Saturday of October, Indiana prevailed over Oregon 30-20 in a game that was tied in the final quarter. It didn't take long to see how this one would go. Moore went for a seemingly safe throw on first down, a quick toss in the left flats. He didn't stop running until he was in the end zone, 25 yards later. Eleven seconds into the game, it was Indiana 7, Oregon 0. “That's a damn good Indiana team. It's not just what we need to do. For the second year in a row, Oregon's season ended with a blowout loss in the CFP. A season ago, it was a 41-21 setback to eventual national champion Ohio State in the Rose Bowl quarterfinal. “It (stinks) right now, I'm not gonna lie,” senior linebacker Bryce Boettcher said. “This is not how I envisioned it whatsoever.” To their credit, the Ducks bounced back from that shocking start, driving 75 yards in 14 plays — converting three times on third down — to even the score on Moore's 19-yard scoring strike to Jamari Johnson. Especially for Moore, who had played such a key role after taking over this season for Dillon Gabriel. First, it was Heisman Trophy winner Fernando Mendoza reclaiming the lead for good for the Hoosiers with a 75-yard drive of his own. Then, all Indiana had to do was sit back as Moore and the Ducks self-destructed. Backed up deep in his own territory, Moore set for another short throw but struck running back Dierre Hill Jr. in the elbow as he cocked his arm. A 36-yard touchdown pass from Mendoza to Charlie Becker made it 28-7 late in the second quarter, essentially putting the Ducks in a must-score position before halftime. Instead, Moore turned it over yet again. This time, the pigskin popped free on a crushing sack by Daniel Ndukwe. Naturally, they punched it in for another score.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>FILE -Olive, 4, deposits an election ballot into a drop box in Seattle, Wash. under the supervision of her mother, on Nov. 4, 2025. SEATTLE (AP) — A federal judge on Friday blocked President Donald Trump's administration from enforcing most of his executive order on elections against the vote-by-mail states Washington and Oregon, in the latest blow to Trump's efforts to require documentary proof of citizenship to vote and to require that all ballots be received by Election Day. U.S. District Judge John H. Chun in Seattle found that those requirements exceeded the president's authority, following similar rulings in a Massachusetts case brought by 19 states and in a Washington, D.C., case by Democratic and civil rights groups. “Today's ruling is a huge victory for voters in Washington and Oregon, and for the rule of law,” Washington Attorney General Nick Brown said. The executive order, issued in March, included new requirements that people provide documentary proof of citizenship when registering to vote and a demand that all mail ballots be received by Election Day. It also put states' federal funding at risk if election officials didn't comply. Officials in Oregon and Washington, which accept ballots as long as they are postmarked by Election Day, said that could disenfranchise thousands of voters. During the 2024 general election, officials in Washington counted nearly 120,000 ballots that were received after election day but postmarked by it. Oregon officials received nearly 14,000 such ballots. Oregon and Washington said they sued separately from other states because, as exclusively vote-by-mail states, they faced particular harms from the executive order. Trump and other Republicans have promoted the idea that large numbers of people who were not U.S. citizens might be voting. However, voting by noncitizens is rare and, when they are caught, they can face felony charges and deportation.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Longtime FBI insider Christopher Raia has been tapped to replace Dan Bongino as the agency's deputy director. Bongino's nomination was met with skepticism in Washington, as he had no direct experience working at the FBI. He held years of experience in the Secret Service and was known in conservative circles as the host of a popular political podcast. 2 role, as he holds over two decades of experience at the bureau. Raia was most recently appointed assistant director of the New York field office, one of the bureau's most coveted roles, in April. He also served as deputy assistant director in the Counterterrorism Division at Headquarters in 2024, overseeing all international counterterrorism program management for the FBI. Bongino hasn't disclosed details regarding his resignation less than a year after he started as deputy director. President Donald Trump suggested last month he missed hosting his podcast, saying Bongino “wants to go back to his show.” “It was a busy last day on the job,” Bongino said in a statement posted to X last week. It's been an incredible year thanks to the leadership and decisiveness of President Trump.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As he approached Renee Good's vehicle on a Minneapolis street on Wednesday, Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent Jonathan Ross held up his phone camera and recorded video. That extraordinary footage, along with video shot by bystanders and a 3D model created by CNN of the confrontation, shows Good and her wife challenging ICE officers – but also raises new questions about Ross's tactics and decision to use deadly force. CNN's analysis found that while the Department of Homeland Security claims that Good was “blocking” ICE agents, multiple cars – including one driven by Ross – were able to drive around Good's vehicle before the shooting. “If you're an agent … then you should not be encumbered by anything in your hands,” said  Jonathan Wackrow, a CNN law enforcement analyst. “This footage corroborates what DHS has stated all along — that this individual was impeding law enforcement and weaponized her vehicle in an attempt to kill or cause bodily harm to federal law enforcement,” said DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin in a statement. But a former senior law enforcement official with knowledge of DHS found Ross's actions deeply concerning. “I would have been livid if one of my folks were doing that,” the former official, who requested to speak anonymously, told CNN. Seconds before the shooting, Good and her wife are seen talking to Ross. Good can be seen saying to Ross she's “not mad” at him. “I think the part of it that's the most telling is when he walks by her and she's smiling,” said former Philadelphia police commissioner Charles Ramsey, who is a CNN contributor. “She doesn't look anything like a domestic terrorist. That's for sure … although you don't know what's in her mind.” ICE doesn't have a definitive policy on recording interactions or incidents on cell phone devices, either personal or government, according to a federal law enforcement source. However, the agency's Office of Professional Responsibility can review a government device upon request. A warrant or subpoena is generally required to access the officers' personal phone. Ross, a law enforcement veteran with nearly two decades experience in the Border Patrol and ICE, was among a group of agents working in south Minneapolis on Wednesday when they encountered Good, who had stopped her burgundy SUV perpendicular in the road. They had guns,” she wrote, an apparent reference to activists who warn of ICE activity by blowing whistles. Noem and others have described Good as “impeding” ICE activities on Wednesday. Videos viewed by CNN don't shed light on any potential earlier encounters between Good and ICE agents. Bystander footage shows that shortly after he got out of his SUV and approached Renee Good's vehicle, Ross pulled out his cell phone and recorded. His video footage shows him recording Good in the driver's seat. Good appeared calm and had both of her hands visible as she said, “That's fine dude. Becca Good, who had been a passenger but got out of the SUV, held her own phone toward Ross and said, “You wanna come at us? I say go get yourself some lunch, big boy.” Ross was still filming as he walked in front of Good's vehicle. Good first put her vehicle in reverse, and then accelerated forward. Renee Good appeared to turn the steering wheel away from Ross as she pulled forward. With his cell phone still gripped in one hand and recording, Ross yelled “Woah,” pulled his gun with the other hand and fired into the car – killing Good, whose vehicle continued accelerating down the street before crashing. Trump administration officials have shared the footage captured by Ross, arguing that it vindicates his decision to use deadly force. “Many of you have been told this law enforcement officer wasn't hit by a car, wasn't being harassed, and murdered an innocent woman. The reality is that his life was endangered and he fired in self defense.” Wackrow said there are occasions where it's appropriate for law enforcement officials to use cell phones to document incidents, particularly if they are designated with that job from the outset. But he said Ross's cell phone activity throughout could be troubling. You should be ready to address any type of threat or issue that presents itself,” said Wackrow. The deadly shooting shows why it's important for all agencies to equip their officers with body-worn cameras, Ramsey said. “In my view, officers, federal, local, state should be wearing body-worn cameras,” he said.
