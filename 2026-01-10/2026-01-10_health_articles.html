                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Researchers from Tokyo Metropolitan University have developed a suite of algorithms to automate the counting of sister chromatid exchanges (SCE) in chromosomes under the microscope. Conventional analysis requires trained personnel and time, with variability between different people. The team's machine-learning-based algorithm boasts an accuracy of 84% and gives a more objective measurement. This could be a game changer for diagnosing disorders tied to abnormal numbers of SCEs, like Bloom syndrome. DNA, the blueprint of life for all living organisms, is found packaged inside complex structures called chromosomes. When DNA is replicated, two identical strands known as sister chromatids, each carrying exactly the same genetic information, are formed. Unlike in meiosis, sister chromatids do not need to undergo recombination during mitosis, and in most cases they are transmitted intact to the daughter cells. During this repair process, it often happens that specific segments of the sister chromatids are exchanged with each other. During this repair process, it often happens that specific segments of the sister chromatids are exchanged with each other. This "sister chromatic exchange" (SCE) is not harmful itself, but too many can be a good indicator for some serious disorders. Examples include Bloom syndrome: affected people can have a predisposition to cancer. To count SCEs, normal methods involve experienced clinicians looking at stained chromosomes under the microscope, trying to identify the telltale "swapped" segments of sister chromatids. Not only is this labor intensive and slow, but it can also be subjective, dependent on how the human eye perceives features. Now, a team led by Professors Kiyoshi Nishikawa and Kan Okubo from Tokyo Metropolitan University have developed a suite of algorithms using machine learning to count SCEs in images. They found an accuracy of 84.1%, a level which is enough for practical applications. To see how it performed with real data, they collected images of chromosomes from cells with an artificially knocked out BLM gene, the kind of suppression seen in Bloom syndrome patients. The team's algorithm was able to give counts for SCEs which were consistent with those given by human counters. The team believes that replacing manual counting with full automation will help realize faster, more objective clinical analysis than ever before, and that this is only the beginning for what AI can bring to medical research.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>You understand what needs to be done, yet taking that very first step feels surprisingly hard. When this difficulty becomes severe, it is known medically as avolition. People with avolition are not lazy or unaware: they know what they need to do, but their brain seems unable to push the "go" button. Research in neuroscience and psychology has suggested that before we act, the brain weighs how much effort a task may cost. But until now, it has been unclear how the brain turns this judgment into a decision not to act. To explore this question, a research team at WPI-ASHBi applied an advanced genetic technique called chemogenetics to highly intelligent macaque monkeys, allowing them to adjust communication temporarily and precisely between specific brain regions and identify a circuit that acts like a brake on motivation. The monkeys were trained to perform two types of tasks. In one, completing the task earned a water reward. Before each trial, the monkeys saw a cue and could freely decide whether to start or not. But when the task involved an unpleasant air puff, they often held back, even though a reward was still available. In contrast, in tasks involving an unpleasant air puff, the mental brake to starting had eased: the monkeys became much more willing to start. Importantly, the monkeys' ability to judge rewards and punishments did not change. What changed was the step between knowing and doing. The researchers took a closer look at what was actually happening in these brain regions during this process. Together, these findings show that the VS to VP pathway functions as a "motivation brake" that suppresses the internal "go" button, particularly when facing stressful or unpleasant tasks. This discovery of the VS–VP "motivation brake" may shed light on conditions such as depression and schizophrenia, where severe loss of motivation is common. In the future, interventions such as deep brain stimulation, non-invasive brain stimulation, or new drug strategies might aim to fine-tune this brake when it becomes too tight. In other words, the VS–VP circuit may help keep motivation within a healthy range. In modern society, especially at a time when burnout is at an all-time high, these findings invite us to rethink what "motivation" really means. The brain can actively dampen the drive to act when tasks are unpleasant or stressful, so getting started is not simply about willpower. Rather than trying to forcibly boost motivation, the focus should shift toward how society can better support people in coping with stress. This is a question that warrants broader societal dialogue.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Environmental antimicrobial resistance is turning rivers, soils, and even the air into hidden highways for "superbugs," according to a new review that calls for urgent, coordinated action across human, animal, and environmental health. Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) occurs when bacteria and other microbes evolve the ability to survive medicines that once killed them, making common infections harder or impossible to treat. The review highlights several major environmental "hotspots" where resistance builds up and spreads.​ Across these sites, resistance genes can hitchhike on mobile genetic elements such as plasmids, making it easier for bacteria to "swap" resistance traits and create multidrug resistant strains.​ Most AMR surveillance still focuses on clinical samples, but the authors argue that environmental monitoring needs to catch up. Genotypic methods such as high throughput quantitative PCR, CRISPR based assays, and metagenomic sequencing can detect hundreds of resistance genes at once, and identify which bacteria carry them.​ "No single method can capture the full story of environmental resistance. The authors also highlight emerging "green" solutions, such as enhanced biodegradation of antibiotics, design of more biodegradable drugs, and alternative antimicrobials like peptides and phages.​ On the process side, improved wastewater treatment and waste management are crucial. Conventional disinfection can reduce many resistant bacteria but may leave resistance genes intact, especially in solid waste streams. More advanced approaches such as hyperthermophilic composting, advanced oxidation, membrane processes, nanomaterials, bacteriophage based treatments, engineered DNA scavenging bacteria, and CRISPR based tools show promise but require further research, safety evaluation, and cost reduction.​ Host pathogenicity: whether the bacterial hosts are capable of causing disease in humans or animals.​ Multi resistance: whether genes and their hosts resist multiple key antibiotics, limiting treatment options.​ "Environmental AMR is not just about how many resistance genes we can find" said corresponding author Feng Ju. The authors call for global, standardized protocols that make environmental AMR data comparable across countries and over time. Without such standards, they warn, the world will struggle to spot emerging threats early enough and to design effective One Health interventions that protect both people and the planet.​ Environmental antimicrobial resistance: key reservoirs, surveillance and mitigation under One Health.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Earthworms could become unexpected allies in the global fight against antibiotic resistance, by helping farmers turn manure into safer, high-value organic fertilizer through a process called vermicomposting. Researchers report that this low energy, nature-based technology can remove antibiotic resistance genes far more consistently than conventional composting, while also improving soil health and supporting sustainable agriculture. When animals receive antibiotics, resistance genes accumulate in their manure, and if that manure is spread on fields without proper treatment, those genes can move into soil, water, crops and eventually the human gut. Vermicomposting uses earthworms and their associated microbes to transform raw manure into a stable, crumbly product known as vermicast. Under carefully controlled moisture, temperature and nutrient conditions, this mesophilic process not only recycles waste into fertilizer but also achieves multi pathway reduction of antibiotic resistance genes. Studies summarized in the new review show that vermicomposting can reduce the total abundance of resistance genes by roughly 70 to 95 percent and mobile genetic elements by up to 68 percent, often outperforming traditional compost piles.​ "By reshaping microbial communities and disrupting gene transfer, they help cut the chain of antibiotic resistance spread from farms to people. The authors describe vermicomposting as an integrated physical, chemical and biological barrier against antibiotic resistance. A key advantage lies in how earthworms restructure the microbial community. Their activity shifts the system away from fast growing opportunistic bacteria that frequently host resistance genes toward more stable, functionally beneficial groups involved in decomposition and nitrogen fixation. Laboratory studies cited in the review show that coelomic fluid can cut multidrug resistant Escherichia coli populations by several orders of magnitude within hours and remove over 90 percent of extracellular resistance genes through DNA cutting activity.​ Mucus also alters microbial behavior by interfering with bacterial communication systems and gene expression. In one mechanistic study, exposure to earthworm coelomic fluid led to thousands of bacterial genes being up or down regulated, disrupting pathways that bacteria rely on for coordination and conjugation. Performance improves further when vermicomposting is combined with functional materials such as biochar, zeolite or clay minerals. In trials summarized by the authors, pairing earthworms with biochar or mineral amendments increased earthworm growth, accelerated organic matter degradation, improved humification and raised removal rates for both resistance genes and heavy metal resistance markers.​ Together, earthworm activity, mucus derived biochemistry and tailored additives create a multi level containment system that acts from molecules to whole ecosystems. The result is a more robust, stable reduction of antibiotic resistance genes than is typically achieved in conventional composting alone, while producing a high quality organic fertilizer that can improve soil structure, water retention and plant nutrition.​ Despite these advantages, the authors caution that significant challenges remain before vermicomposting can be deployed widely as an antibiotic resistance control strategy. Large scale systems must also address climate sensitivity, reactor design, automation and the logistics of maintaining healthy earthworm populations at industrial scale.​ The review calls for multi year field studies and realistic risk assessments to understand whether residual genes can be reactivated under new stresses such as heavy metals or additional antibiotic use. The authors argue that future work should integrate multi omics tools, artificial intelligence models and engineered treatment trains that combine thermal pretreatment, vermicomposting and targeted polishing steps such as enzyme or phage applications.​ "Antibiotic resistance is a complex, system wide problem and no single technology will solve it," Yang notes.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This system solves the key problems of traditional antigen-capturing nanocarriers, such as their tendency to non-specifically bind to serum proteins during systemic circulation and their low antigen capture efficiency, providing a novel strategy for personalized tumor immunotherapy. The high heterogeneity of tumor antigens in cancer patients is a key limiting factor for improving the efficacy of tumor vaccines, with significant differences in antigen characteristics among different patients and even different lesions within the same patient. In situ tumor vaccine strategies, by directly utilizing endogenous antigens in the tumor microenvironment, eliminate the need for complex antigen separation processes, effectively overcoming this heterogeneity challenge. Currently used antigen release methods such as phototherapy and radiotherapy have limitations, including shallow tissue penetration and potential damage to normal tissues. Ultrasound technology, with its deep penetration and high biocompatibility, has become an ideal stimulus for in situ vaccine development. This study designed ultrasound-responsive antigen catchers, S-nanocatchers, with polyglutamic acid (PLG) as the main chain, bonded with a thioether-containing antigen-catching group (S-ACG) and the sonosensitive agent pyrophyllofoetate a (PPA). After self-assembly, the hydrophobic S-ACG and PPA are encapsulated in the nanoparticle core, avoiding non-specific interactions with serum proteins during systemic circulation. When subjected to ultrasound therapy, the reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated by PPA not only induce immunogenic death (ICD) of tumor cells to release antigens, but also oxidize the thioether to hydrophilic sulfones or sulfoxides, exposing the antigen-catching group on the nanoparticle surface, achieving efficient capture of thiol-containing small molecules, peptides, and tumor antigens. The control group (C-nanocatchers) had its thioether replaced with a carbon chain, and showed no significant antigen-binding ability regardless of whether it was sonicated, confirming the sulfur oxidation-dependent switching mechanism. This system efficiently activates dendritic cell (DC) maturation and migration. This study combines ultrasound-guided antigen capture with in situ vaccine synthesis, achieving precise spatiotemporal capture of tumor antigens through a "smart switch" mechanism of thioether oxidation, effectively solving the non-specific binding problem of traditional nanocarriers. Ultrasound-responsive antigen catchers (S-nanocatchers) can not only efficiently induce local tumor immune responses but also activate systemic anti-tumor immunity through combination with immune adjuvants, providing a new solution for overcoming tumor heterogeneity and distant metastasis.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new study suggests that the immune checkpoint inhibitor, durvalumab, may offer new treatment options for patients living with small cell lung cancer (SCLC). However, its cost raises questions about sustainability, prevention and access. The findings, published in the Dec. 19, 2025, issue of JCO Global Oncology, are accompanied by an editorial, titled "Durvalumab in Limited-Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer: Clinical Triumph and Toward Sustainable Value." Known for its rapid progression and poor prognosis, it has long been treated with a standard regimen of chemotherapy and radiation-a formula that has barely changed in decades. Five-year survival rates hover around 25% to 30%, leaving patients and families with limited hope. Durvalumab has emerged as a promising addition to the treatment landscape for limited-stage disease. Backed by the ADRIATIC trial, this therapy offers something patients have desperately needed: more time. "Durvalumab represents a turning point in maintenance therapy for SCLC," said Chinmay Jani, M.D., first author on the study and chief fellow in hematology and oncology at Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, part of the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine. "We're seeing survival gains that were unimaginable just a few years ago." The ADRIATIC trial evaluated durvalumab as maintenance therapy following chemoradiation. The study revealed that durvalumab therapy costs $163,722, compared with $25,816 for standard care. "Cost-effectiveness isn't just a metric-it shapes real-world access," said Gilberto Lopes, M.D., chief of the Division of Medical Oncology and associate director for global oncology at Sylvester. This suggests that precision medicine-tailoring therapy to specific patient profiles-could optimize both outcomes and affordability.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Planning to save time by doing your shopping online? If so, it's possible you're not doing your well-being any favors. A study from Aalto University in Finland has found that online shopping is more strongly linked to stress than reading the news, checking your inbox or watching adult entertainment. 'Previous studies have shown that social media and online shopping are often used to relieve stress. However, our results show that a rise in social media use or online shopping is linked to an increase in self-reported stress across multiple user groups and across devices,' he says. The study found that users of YouTube and streaming services, as well as online gamers, also reported increased stress levels. Meanwhile, across many user groups, those who spent more time reading emails and news, or watching adult entertainment, reported lower stress-levels –– although the researchers note that they looked only at the time spent on news sites, not their content. 'Somewhat surprisingly, people who spent a lot of time on news sites reported less stress than others. On the other hand, those who already experienced a lot of stress didn't spend much time on news sites –– and that's consistent with previous research that shows that stress can reduce news consumption,' Belal says. Overall, the study found a strong connection between internet use, in general, and heightened stress, especially among those who already experienced a lot of stress in daily life. The de-stressing effect of adult entertainment may be explained by the fact that it was usually consumed in small doses, acting as a short-term stress or boredom reliever. For example, a recent ban in Australia on social media for children has the rest of the world watching closely. 'It leaves a huge critical gap in understanding how online behaviors impact stress and well-being,' Belal points out. With the aim of closing this gap, the study is among the first to use a tracking programme installed on users' devices, rather than asking subjects to self-report their usage, explains assistant professor Juhi Kulshrestha. 'Are people more stressed because they are spending more time online shopping or on social media, or are such sites offering them an important support in times of duress? It's really crucial that we study these issues further so we can solve that chicken and egg problem,' says Kulshrestha. 'Putting a blanket ban or upper limits on certain kinds of internet usage may not actually end up solving the issues, and could even take away a vital support for people who are struggling.' In future, they plan to examine the consumption of different types of news, such as political, entertainment, or sports news, and how it relates to stress and other well-being variables. The hope is that better data will lead to helping internet users maintain a healthy balance. 'As we gain increasingly accurate information about people's internet usage, it will be possible to design new kinds of tools that people can use to regulate their browsing and improve their well-being,' says Kulshrestha.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Scientists have made a discovery that helps explain why humans and animals are so susceptible to contracting tuberculosis(TB) – and it involves the bacteria harnessing part of the immune system meant to protect against infection. Despite more than 100 years of research, tuberculosis remains one of the deadliest bacterial infections in humans, resulting in 1.5 million deaths each year. These responses are mediated by receptors – molecules on the surface of immune cells that can recognise microbes. However, MTB has evolved a range of strategies to overcome these defences, manipulating host cells so they can survive and replicate. Now, an international research collaboration co-led by the University of Exeter has discovered that MTB survives within the cells of its host by targeting Dectin-1. Published in Science Immunology, the finding gives new insight into how TB takes hold to cause disease. Dr. Max Gutierrez, of the Francis Crick Institute said: "TB is a major killer worldwide, yet we still know very little about how it is so effective at causing infections, in both humans and in animals. Our discovery of a new mechanism by which Mycobacterium tuberculosis is able to subvert host immunity is a key step in understanding the basis of susceptibility to TB." When this Dectin-1 pathway was absent, both human and mouse cells could control MTB infection. Indeed, mice lacking Dectin-1 were much more resistant to MTB infection. Professor Sho Yamasaki, Osaka University, said: "Our results are surprising, because Dectin-1 is a key part of the body's defence system to protect against fungal infections, yet we've shown it's detrimental for MTB infections and actually promotes bacterial survival." Associate Professor Claire Hoving, UCT, said: "This research is a true international collaboration, with each institution bringing a distinct area of expertise. Professor Gordon Brown, of the University of Exeter's MRC Centre for Medical Mycology, said: "This discovery is the first step – and opens the door to exciting new prospects including, for example, if we could knock out this receptor in cattle to make them more resistant to infection."
