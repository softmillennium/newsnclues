                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Two Manchester United players faced off in the Africa Cup of Nations quarter-finals on Friday, with Noussair Mazraoui's Morocco knocking out Bryan Mbeumo's Cameroon 2-0. Morocco took the lead in under half an hour when former Manchester City midfielder Brahim Diaz bundled in from close range. Abde Ezzalzouli's free-kick evaded everyone in the box and fell to Ismael Saibari, who drilled low and hard into the bottom corner. This means that Mazraoui's absence from United will be prolonged until at least late next week, but Mbeumo will likely be heading back to Manchester this weekend. The Red Devils had Mbeumo, Mazraoui and Amad Diallo head off to represent their respective nations this winter and have seen their options, particularly on the right-hand side of the pitch, depleted significantly. When the forward left for international duty, Portuguese tactician Ruben Amorim was still in the dugout and, in spite of a mixed season, appeared to be relatively secure in his position as head coach. United and Scotland legend Darren Fletcher has been named as the interim boss and will oversee their game against Brighton on Sunday. The FA Cup third round will come too soon for Mbeumo, but the attacking player will have his eyes locked on the Manchester derby next weekend and his return to the pitch at Old Trafford will be just what Pep Guardiola's side will have hoped to have avoided. City will be frustrated to have to come up against the Cameroon forward next weekend and would have fancied their chances against a weakened United. Guardiola's team have squandered their slender pre-Christmas lead over Arsenal and now sit six points behind the Gunners. Yet, they will be boosted by the introduction of their own marquee forward signing with Bournemouth's Antoine Semenyo completing his move to the Etihad on Friday. Add GOAL.com as a preferred source on Google to see more of our reporting The current availability of elite managers is slim pickings and given United have been so poor at recruiting managerial staff, they will be determined to avoid yet another disaster, Amorim clung on to the position for just over a year and United forked out millions upon millions of pounds to help bring in players suitable for his rigid 3-4-3 formation.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Two of Africa's most storied football nations meet in a high-stakes quarter-final at the Africa Cup of Nations in Agadir, Morocco, today. However, their route to the last eight has been far from straightforward. They eventually prevailed as 3-1 winners to book their spot in the quarter finals, with their star man, Mohamed Salah, scoring a late winner. The Liverpool man has been pivotal with 3 goals so far in AFCON, and will continue to shoulder much of the scoring duties alongside Manchester City's Omar Marmoush. Coach Hassan has kept a resilient but sometimes unconvincing run going, with Egypt not considered top favourites by some, despite advancing to this stage. In contrast, the Ivory Coast have looked more comfortable in the knockout rounds so far and will not be short of confidence after some solid performances. Emerse Fae's side arrives as defending champions, determined to prove that their triumph two years ago on home soil was no one-off. They cruised to a 3-0 win over Burkina Faso to reach the quarter-finals, with Manchester United's Amad Diallo starring with a goal and assist. As reigning champions, the Elephants have shown strong attacking balance and overall control of games; however, this might not be easy to achieve against Egypt. Nevertheless, they are expected to dominate possession, using their powerful midfield to dictate tempo and stretch the pitch with the likes of Franck Kessié and Seko Fofana. For Egypt, Mahmoud Hassan Trezeguet remains a doubt, but has shown positive signs and could well be fit enough to take to the field. Mohamed El-Shenawy, the goalkeeper of Al Ahly and the Egyptian national team, is expected to be fit, despite rumours of an injury. Ivory Coast coach Emerse Fae has a clean bill of health and will be able to pick his best team for this important match. Recent AFCON meetings have included tight contests, including a penalty shoot-out win for Egypt in 2021. Egypt last defended their own AFCON title in 2010; Ivory Coast are the first defending champs to reach this stage since then.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>United had started the brighter and Arsenal's Anneke Borbe was forced into an incredible fingertip save to push Fridolina Rolfo's header from a Jessica Park cross onto the bar after just five minutes. Tullis-Joyce made one fine stop from Olivia Smith from close range following a six-yard box scramble in Arsenal's best chance of the half. Sloppy passes and individual errors plagued the players who at times looked like they were still on their winter break. With 25 minutes to go, United right-back Riviere was sent off for a ridiculous lunge which earned her a deserved second yellow card. With United shutting up shop and determined to cling onto a point, Arsenal turned up the heat on the Red Devils. The Gunners' forwards had chances: Alessia Russo pounced upon a loose ball to fire low and Stina Blackstenius produced a clever flick, but both were denied by the USWNT goalkeeper. GOAL rates Manchester United's players from the Emirates Stadium... Was a dominant presence in her penalty area and came up with a series of strong stops to keep the Gunners at bay. A moment of madness for the 24-year-old who almost cost her side. The Manchester United skipper stood up to the test and led her defence well, especially when reduced to 10 players. A reliable figure at the heart of the Red Devils' midfield, Miyazawa rarely set a pass astray and helped relieve pressure on her team. Similarly tidy to Miyazawa, the Sweden international played in a double pivot and allowed Park the freedom to roam. A bright spark and did her best to drive the visitors up the pitch, but struggled to showcase her talent with the Gunners so dominant in possession. The former Barcelona star was taken off in a quiet second half. Terland was a passenger for much of the hour she was on the pitch and replaced by Lea Schuller.

The midfielder was brought on after an hour, but subbed off 10 minutes later after Riviere was given her marching orders.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Amorim was sacked as the Red Devils coach last week after he exploded in a post-match press conference and made a number of pointed comments aimed at the club's hierarchy. After the Red Devils struggled to a 1-1 draw against Premier League rivals Leeds United, Amorim came out in his conference with a point to make. It is now understood this was aimed towards Wilcox, who had been initially hesitant to appoint Amorim in November 2024. When asked if he still has the board's backing, Amorim said: “To start with that, I noticed that you received selective information about everything. He continued to say that he is not Thomas Tuchel, Antonio Conte or Jose Mourinho – three managers known for their hands on approach when it comes to recruitment and club management – but added that: “I'm the manager of Manchester United. I will do my job until another guy is coming here to replace me.” The Portuguese coach was supposedly unhappy that a move for Antoine Semenyo was not sanctioned, with the Ghanaian moving to Manchester City instead. The deep factions and rifts continue to plague United. The club have long suffered with poor recruitment of both coaching and playing staff, creating a mixed bag of a squad and even more inconsistent results. This created huge scrutiny on the former Sporting CP man who was accused of being too risk averse and predictable. The Portuguese boss was able to spend significantly in the summer and added an entire new-look frontline including Mathues Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko. Amorim also brought in wing-backs to suit his formation which relied heavily of pace and energy down the flanks. Add GOAL.com as a preferred source on Google to see more of our reporting Darren Fletcher has taken temporary charge of the Red Devils and oversaw a 2-2 draw with Burnley earlier this week. It is unclear if and when a permanent appointment will be made, with some reports suggesting that they will wait until the summer to name a new boss. Pep Guardiola's men are currently six points behind league leaders Arsenal, but will be determined to hunt down that gap. They have drawn their first three games of 2026 to fall away in the title race, being held by Brighton, Chelsea and Sunderland.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>One of two NJ Transit buses wrapped in anti-human trafficking messaging that is touring the state, in recognition of January being National Human Trafficking Prevention Month. With several FIFA World Cup soccer matches taking place in New Jersey this summer, NJ Transit has launched a “Safe Passage” antihuman trafficking awareness campaign. New Jersey is often considered a hub for human trafficking because of its proximity to several major metropolitan areas, including New York City and Philadelphia, as well as for its dense and diverse population, and the extensive transportation routes that connect the state to the entire Northeast. There is little empirical evidence that ties an increase in human trafficking to major sporting events. Korin Arkin, the director of survivor care and outreach at Polaris, a nonprofit organization that works to combat human trafficking, said that the state playing host to World Cup games does raise a red flag. The tristate area will welcome more than 1 million visitors for the FIFA World Cup 2026, which begins at Met Life Stadium in East Rutherford on June 13. “Obviously when you have a lot of people gathering in one place, there could be a lot more exploitation opportunities that occur.” Arkin said human trafficking is an underreported crime across the nation. She said in 2024, which is the most recent data available, the National Human Trafficking Hotline received 884 calls, emails, texts and webchats from individuals in New Jersey. “It does indicate people in New Jersey were reaching out to the hotline quite a bit,” she said. The agency will also distribute victim-support materials targeted at moments of potential separation from traffickers. For the rest of this month, in recognition of National Human Trafficking Prevention Month, two NJ Transit buses wrapped in antihuman trafficking messaging will operate statewide. During a press conference at Newark Penn Station on Thursday, NJ Transit President and CEO Kris Kolluri said the agency's most important obligation is to be a good community partner. “I think of no greater calling or privilege to make sure we protect our fellow human beings.” With several FIFA World Cup soccer matches taking place in New Jersey this summer, NJ Transit has launched a “Safe Passage” antihuman trafficking awareness campaign.

NJ Transit Police Chief Christopher Trucillo said human trafficking often occurs in plain sight anonymously, in situations when people are distracted by getting from point A to point B, so law enforcement needs to be vigilant. According to Trucillo, 1,500 frontline employees are receiving training, but he stressed that members of the traveling public are often the first to notice when something doesn't look right. Anyone can be victimized by a labor trafficker, but certain people are far more vulnerable than others. Economic need is a key risk factor and immigrants – including immigrants who are in this country legally – are particularly vulnerable to labor trafficking. Kidnapping or physical force are rarely part of how labor trafficking situations begin,” Polaris said. Traffickers can also be victims' families or legal guardians, including parents, spouses and intimate partners. Physical indicators: Bruises, burns, tattoos, which are often used for branding, or multiple cellphones. Online solicitations: Communication with unknown adults or receipt of inappropriate content. Officials said mass transit passengers can send an anonymous text message to NJTPD or call 911 if they believe something is wrong.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Very few European clubs are truly at a high enough level to be right for elite U.S. talent. Although some of Lindsey Heaps' games in Europe aren't easy for American fans to watch, the chances that do come along show why she's so comfortable there. It's easy to focus on Heaps not scoring, especially given that she started her career as a forward before moving into midfield. But her last game for OL, against Spain's Atlético Madrid in the Champions League, showed a different side of Heaps. She completed 42 of 44 passes that night, continuing a pace of a 90% pass completion rate in Champions League games this season, and had eight defensive recoveries. The club was the standard-bearer in Europe long before American businesswoman Michelle Kang bought it in 2023 (she also owns the NWSL's Washington Spirit and England's London City Lionesses), and it has remained at that level. Nor is any team in Europe close to OL's eight Champions League triumphs from 2011-22, even though Barcelona is the continent's top team right now. OL is running away with the French league, and earned a round-of-16 bye in the Champions League thanks to an unbeaten group stage run. “It's unbelievable, I think this year especially,” she told The Inquirer. » READ MORE: A look back at Jonatán Giráldez's time with the Washington Spirit … I'm very happy to have her in the team.” That counts for a lot, especially among U.S. national team stalwarts. For lack of a better way to put it, the top American players have long relished getting their butts kicked on a daily basis, whether by the NWSL's competitive balance or the famed ferocity of U.S. practices. » READ MORE: The USMNT, USWNT, and your kid's youth team are all different. Heaps is the latest in a lineage from Mia Hamm through Abby Wambach, Heather O'Reilly, Julie Ertz, and Carli Lloyd, all of whom spoke just as bluntly (and sometimes more so). She gets to do that in Lyon, not just with the national team. Unfortunately, Yohannes hasn't gotten to play much in the Champions League this season. She didn't play at all against Atlético Madrid, where the tactical matchup would have been a great lesson. And like I said before, it is just such a competitive environment.” » READ MORE: Lily Yohannes and Alyssa Thompson have arrived at their star turns with the USWNT But Heaps is not immune to the buzz around Yohannes, and didn't mind indulging in some. “I just said to her that no matter what, in a few years from now, you're going to remember games like this that maybe you don't come into. But you're going to be a starting player and a non-stop player, and I believe the best midfielder in the world soon to come.” The American contingent across the Atlantic keeps growing, with Penn State product Sam Coffey soon to join it at England's Manchester City. Her standoff with the NWSL over getting paid what she's worth — with Kang on her side, trying to structure a contract within the league's salary rules — has naturally led to European suitors chasing her. » READ MORE: Trinity Rodman returns to the USWNT for January camp even though she isn't with a club right now It might also reveal a truth that Europe's chattering class doesn't like admitting. Very few European clubs are truly at a high enough level to be right for elite U.S. talents. Barcelona is another, but the Spanish giants don't sign Americans. Manchester City, Arsenal, and Chelsea measure up in England, but Chelsea's roster looks too loaded to have room for Rodman right now. Paris Saint-Germain was in that class, but has fallen hard this year. Germany's Wolfsburg is far from its past glories, and Bayern Munich still has a ways to rise. Real Madrid and Manchester United have stars, but their ownerships aren't trusted to build truly top programs. OL averages just over 5,000 in a 59,000-seat stadium despite all its stars. PSG plays almost all its French league games at a 1,500-seat field within the bigger club's practice facilities, far out in the Paris suburbs. Both are a far cry from the 15,259 that Washington averaged this year, or the even bigger crowds in Los Angeles and Portland. Not for nothing, then, did U.S. legend Tobin Heath — who played for PSG, Manchester United and Arsenal amid many years in American leagues — recently say Rodman should stay in the NWSL. “I advise a lot on players going or staying, and 95% of the time, I will usually say go,” she said in an interview on fellow former superstar Megan Rapinoe's podcast. “I think that her game will be 1000% louder here. She had heard about it, but the details hadn't all been published yet — including the controversial rules on how players qualify. So Heaps chose her words carefully, but she had plenty of them. “I don't think it's a bad idea,” she said, tying in what she has seen over the years from MLS's Designated Player rule. (Her husband Tyler is San Diego FC's sporting director.). » READ MORE: USWNT star Tierna Davidson visits Kensington to inspire a new generation of young soccer players It was also easy to think Rodman's situation would be settled by now. Heaps wondered if it might not just come down to salary, but she encouraged Rodman to do what she feels is right. “Trinity needs to do what's best for her,” Heaps said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Four countries - Cape Verde, Curacao, Jordan and Uzbekistan - will be making their first appearances at the prestigious tournament, where they will face formidable competition. England and Scotland have already secured their places at the World Cup. Meanwhile, Wales, Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland are all eagerly awaiting the play-off rounds, hoping to clinch their spots. Thousands of supporters will be making the journey over for various stages of the tournament and will be looking to secure tickets for their nation's group stage matches and potentially beyond. Here's all the information on the World Cup 2026 ticket prices and how you can get your hands on them. Grabbing tickets for the FIFA World Cup 2026 involves navigating several sales phases, as FIFA is using a lottery system to distribute tickets. To purchase official entry into the World Cup 2026, you'll need to access the FIFA ticketing portal and register for a FIFA ID. The registration window for tickets closes on January 13, so fans must act swiftly if they want a chance to secure their seat. Until this date, fans can submit an application for the matches and categories they're interested in but it's not on a first-come, first-served basis. If your application is successful (or partially so), you'll be informed in late January, with automatic charges applied in February 2026. Any leftover tickets will be sold on a first-come, first-served basis from spring onwards. Those who aren't lucky enough to secure tickets initially can turn to the official FIFA resale marketplace to find tickets that original buyers no longer want. This may include adverts from us and 3rd parties based on our understanding. Set Daily Express as a 'Preferred Source' to get quicker access to the news you value. These seats are often reserved for residents of the host nations or supporter groups from each country. FIFA has also introduced a supporter entry tier ticket, priced at roughly £45 ($60), available for all 104 matches.
