                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ethereum's staking landscape has shifted sharply over the past month as institutional investors, led by BitMine and new ETFs, have saturated the network. This influx has created a logistical bottleneck, forcing new participants to wait roughly a month before their staked assets begin earning returns. On January 9, blockchain analyst Ember CN reported that BitMine has moved more than 1 million ETH (over $3.2 billion) into Ethereum's proof-of-stake system over the past 30 days. This single allocation, comprising roughly a quarter of BitMine's total corporate treasury, has swollen the entry queue to 1.7 million ETH, its highest level since 2023. The payouts demonstrated that traditional investment vehicles can successfully pass protocol-level earnings to shareholders. Notably, this institutional momentum comes even as the network's staking rewards have compressed significantly. This data highlights that investors remain willing to stake their assets despite significantly lower returns. Despite the influx of regulated US entities, ETH's staking control remains concentrated among a few incumbents. According to data from Dune Analytics, decentralized autonomous organization Lido DAO retains dominance with 24% of all staked Ether, followed by Binance at 9.15% and Ether.fi at 6.3%. Perhaps most significant is the persistence of anonymous actors.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Altcoins now account for 50% of crypto trading volume as Bitcoin trades near $90,600 and capital rotates into higher-beta assets. Price stability at these levels has coincided with a sharp change in trading behavior across the crypto market. As Bitcoin paused, traders redirected activity toward alternative cryptos, driving a notable surge in altcoin trading volume. Bitcoin represents about 27% of activity, while Ethereum contributes close to 23%. Total market participation remains elevated, yet liquidity has moved toward higher-volatility assets that tend to outperform during consolidation phases. Historical patterns show similar volume rotations when Bitcoin trades sideways after a strong rally. Several altcoins have posted outsized gains during this period. Polygon rallied more than 50% on the week following its Open Money Stack launch, drawing fresh speculative interest. Solana-based memecoins also gained traction, with BONK rising 28% as decentralized exchange activity surged. BNB advanced about 3.4% over seven days amid reports of Binance expanding operations across Asia. These moves helped lift the Altcoin Season Index from December lows, signaling increasing momentum toward non-Bitcoin assets. Despite the volume surge, Bitcoin dominance by market cap remains elevated at 58.51%. This divergence between volume and market cap suggests short-term trading activity rather than a structural leadership change. Ethereum continues to act as the liquidity backbone for altcoin markets. On January 9, U.S. spot ETH ETFs recorded $93.82 million in net outflows, marking the third consecutive day of withdrawals. These flows align with profit-taking following Ethereum's 113% rebound from April 2025 lows. ETF assets under management now sit about 7.6% below their December peak, which has limited near-term price discovery. On-chain data from CoinCodex shows altcoins outperforming Bitcoin in the short term, supported by rising volumes in DeFi, memecoins, and infrastructure tokens. At the same time, institutional exposure remains concentrated in Bitcoin and Ethereum through regulated products. The Fear and Greed Index sits near 41, signaling neutral sentiment rather than euphoria. Bitcoin trades below its 200-day simple moving average and shows muted momentum despite price stability. These conditions often encourage traders to seek higher returns elsewhere, reinforcing the current volume imbalance. Analysts note that Ethereum often leads these cycles, followed by large-cap altcoins before smaller tokens participate. For now, volume concentration remains selective, not broad-based. If Bitcoin breaks decisively from its range, the balance could change quickly. Until then, altcoins appear to hold the trading spotlight, even as Bitcoin retains its market cap crown.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Virtual currency kiosks are often the catalyst for cryptocurrency scams. Technology allows scams to run rampant—“particularly, they are on steroids because of cryptocurrency,” said Sergeant Nathan VanCleave of the Evansville Police Department, who spoke Tuesday at the House Financial Institutions Committee. It met at the Statehouse to hear House Bill 1116, which aims to increase the regulation of these kiosks and specifically targets and prevent fraud. People can insert a card or cash into the machine, and their selected amount of money is transferred to a digital wallet as cryptocurrency. Someone may choose to use cryptocurrency as a way to invest their money, make secure online payments or hold their money outside a centralized bank. But transactions are often irreversible, making it easier for scammers to take advantage of vulnerable populations. Scammers contact people in a variety of ways, such as through phone calls, text messages and emails, claiming that the victim must transfer money at a specified virtual currency kiosk and creating a false sense of urgency. HB 1116, authored by Rep. Wendy McNamara, R-Evansville, aims to strengthen the protection of consumers when using virtual currency kiosks and focuses on scam prevention. The bill would provide additional regulations for kiosk operators, such as requiring them to be licensed in Indiana as money transmitters and imposing a daily $1,000 transaction limit and 3% fee cap. Operators fall under federal regulation but have very little oversight by the state. Clara Wulfsen, associate director of government affairs for CoinFlip, said she agrees with 95% of the bill and believes state regulation is needed, but she called for amendments regarding transaction limits and fee caps. The manager of governmental relations for Bitcoin Depot, Michael Geiselhart, also emphasized her concerns, stating that a 3% cap would be an “eviction notice” for kiosk companies. Because the kiosks are privately owned, their upkeep incurs costs that regular ATMs do not have. “We need something on a statewide level matching what 20 other states have already done,” said VanCleave.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Stablecoins are going mainstream, and Ethereum is positioning itself as the place those dollars ultimately settle. In its 2026 Global Outlook, the BlackRock Investment Institute argued that stablecoins are widening beyond exchanges and becoming integrated into mainstream payment systems. The point here isn't whether stablecoins are good for crypto. The question is whether they're on track to become a settlement rail that sits beside, and sometimes inside, traditional finance. If they do, which blockchains will end up acting like the base layer for final settlement, collateral, and tokenized cash? “Stablecoins are no longer niche,” the report quotes Samara Cohen, BlackRock's global head of market development. They're “becoming the bridge between traditional finance and digital liquidity.” Dollar-pegged tokens solved that operational problem by giving traders a 24/7 unit of account and settlement asset. The firm said integration into mainstream payment systems and cross-border payments is a natural next step, especially where latency, fees, and correspondent banking friction remain stubbornly high. In the US, the GENIUS Act was signed into law on July 18, 2025, creating a federal framework for payment stablecoins, including reserve and disclosure requirements. That kind of legal clarity doesn't guarantee mass adoption. But it changes the risk calculus for banks, large merchants, and payment networks that have to answer to compliance teams and regulators. Total stablecoin value stood around $298 billion as of Jan. 5, 2026, with USDT and USDC still dominating the stack. BlackRock's report, using CoinGecko data through Nov. 27, 2025, notes stablecoins hit record highs in market cap even as crypto prices fluctuated. It highlights their role as the system's primary source of “dollar liquidity and on-chain stability.” That combination of legal recognition and sheer size is why stablecoins have started to show up in places they never used to, like the back office of global payments. The company said it had launched USDC settlement in the US, allowing issuer and acquirer partners to settle with Visa in Circle's dollar stablecoin. It framed the move as a way to modernize its settlement layer with faster movement of funds, seven-day availability, and resilience across weekends and holidays. Stablecoins are moving into the part of finance that's usually invisible until it breaks: settlement. As stablecoins move toward more complex uses, such as collateral, treasury management, tokenized money-market funds, and cross-border netting, the base layer matters more than marketing. That layer needs predictable finality, deep liquidity, robust tooling, and a governance and security model institutions can trust for decades, not just a cycle. Ethereum's value proposition in 2026 isn't that it's the cheapest chain for sending a stablecoin. The case for Ethereum is that it has become the anchor layer for an ecosystem that treats execution and settlement as separate functions. Ethereum's own documentation makes that explicit in the context of rollups, where Ethereum acts as the settlement layer that anchors security and provides objective finality if disputes occur on another chain. So when users move fast and cheap on L2s, the base chain still plays referee. The report describes stablecoins as a “modest but meaningful step toward a tokenized financial system,” where digital dollars coexist with, and sometimes reshape, traditional channels of intermediation and policy transmission. Tokenization turns that abstract idea into a balance-sheet reality. Stablecoins then serve as the cash leg for subscriptions, redemptions, and secondary-market trading. On that front, Ethereum is still the center of gravity. RWA.xyz shows Ethereum hosting about $12.5 billion in tokenized real-world assets, roughly a 65% market share as of Jan. 5, 2026. Its tokenized money-market fund, BUIDL, debuted on Ethereum and later expanded to multiple chains, including Solana and several Ethereum L2s, as tokenized Treasuries became one of the clearest real-world use cases for on-chain finance. Even on a multi-chain footprint, the institutional pattern is telling: start where liquidity, custody integrations, and smart contract standards are most mature, then extend outward as distribution channels develop. The bank launched a tokenized money-market fund with shares represented by digital tokens on Ethereum. This suggests stablecoins don't just need a fast network for payments. They also need a credible settlement fabric for tokenized collateral, yield-bearing cash equivalents, and institutional-grade finance. In emerging markets, it notes stablecoins could broaden dollar access while challenging monetary control if domestic currency use declines. Stablecoins aren't all the same, and market structure can turn on trust. S&P Global Ratings downgraded its assessment of Tether's reserves in November 2025, citing concerns about limited transparency. Despite a downgrade from S&P, Tether's gold and Bitcoin stockpile is seen as strength by crypto markets. Ethereum also isn't guaranteed to be the only settlement layer that matters. Visa's USDC settlement work shows large players are willing to route stablecoin settlement over other chains when it fits their operational needs. Circle positions USDC as natively supported across dozens of networks, a strategy that makes stablecoin liquidity portable and reduces dependence on any single chain. As stablecoins spread, the premium shifts to layers that can provide credible settlement, integration with tokenized assets, and a security model strong enough to persuade institutions they can park real cash and real collateral on-chain without waking up to a governance surprise. That's why ETH is a likely wager on the settlement standard for tokenized dollars. If stablecoins are becoming what BlackRock says they are, a bridge between traditional finance and digital liquidity, the bridge still needs bedrock.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As of January 10, trading volume data shows that altcoins now account for more than 50% of all cryptocurrency trading activity. On-chain data from CoinMarketCap indicate that altcoins are currently outperforming Bitcoin in the short term. The change suggests that traders are shifting toward riskier assets in an effort to increase profits. Altcoins have experienced significant market gains over the past month. Ripple's UK FCA registration drove XRP to a 5.01% weekly gain. XRP is currently trading at $2.09, representing a 4.52% increase from the previous month. The digital asset has a 24-hour trading volume of $3.02 billion, down 25.06%. Solana-based memecoins, such as WHITEWHALE, gained 250% despite record DEX volumes. The memecoin has a 24-hour trading volume of $45.77 million, which is up 32.92%. Binance ecosystem tokens, such as BNB, performed better last week, driven by news of the company's expansion in Asia. High-beta alternatives are attracting capital due to regulatory clarity and the memecoin frenzy. The framework is designed to help financial institutions and fintech businesses move money on-chain more efficiently by providing a comprehensive yet adaptable system for payments and settlements. In the last 24 hours, Polygon's price increased by 2.78% to 0.21. Other high-beta tokens also gained, highlighting strong speculative interest across DeFi markets. DeFi aggregator Beefy (BIFI) saw a gain of 29.7% in the last seven days. This demonstrated sector movement into utility-driven alternatives, in contrast to Bitcoin's +1.11% weekly return. BIFI is currently trading at $193.20, representing a 9.1% increase over the previous 24 hours. The DeFi aggregator reached a 24-hour trading volume of $43,804,596. According to data from CoinMarketCap, the CMC Altcoin Season Index increased to 38/100 (from 27 the previous week), indicating rising altcoin momentum but remaining in neutral territory, while Bitcoin dominance remained at 58.51%. Capital rotation into alternative assets is reflected in this change, with ASI's 37% weekly increase representing the quickest improvement since September 2025. Bitcoin (BTC) is currently trading at approximately $90,534.18, representing a 0.6% increase over the last day. The market cap dominance of Ethereum dropped to 12.05%, down 0.71% month-over-month. Ethereum remains the liquidity anchor for alternative markets, even as it controls liquidity and potentially restricts its own growth. Ethereum is currently trading at $3,087.74, representing a 3.85% decrease from last month. On January 9, SoSoValue data revealed that there were $93.82 million in net withdrawals from U.S. spot ETH ETFs, marking the third consecutive day. Early investors are collecting profits following ETH's 113% recovery from its April 2025 lows. Price discovery is hindered by the $17.91 billion ETF AUM, which remains 7.6% below its December peak.

Shareholders are becoming impatient with concepts that have good sound but slow delivery. Top experts note that speculative tokens are now losing investor attention as volatility increases, commodities like Silver spearhead new bull runs and regulations become stricter. Capital is shifting to systems that address actual issues, in particular, linking crypto tools to daily financial services. With crypto becoming increasingly closer to mainstream usage, utility-oriented platforms are taking over the dialogue, and the disparity between promise and performance is becoming too difficult to overlook. Let's do a deep dive into two emerging altcoins: Bitcoin Hyper and Remittix that are currently at the forefront of every watchlist today. Late last year, this project was everywhere, promising to revolutionize blockchain technology with a Layer-2 solution designed to make Bitcoin faster and cheaper. It followed a classic high-hype presale model, and for a moment, it looked like the Best Crypto To Buy Now. However, as we settle into 2026, the cracks are starting to show. While the concept of boosting Bitcoin's utility is sound, market sentiment can be fickle. The presale price has been creeping up, but on-chain activity suggests that whale interest is cooling off. Analysts are concerned that without a concrete product launch to match Remittix's February rollout, HYPER might be relying too heavily on the “Bitcoin” brand name rather than its own merit. Bitcoin Hyper remains a high-risk, high-reward play. If the crypto bull run goes parabolic, HYPER could certainly catch a bid. But with crypto regulation looming and investors demanding transparency, the lack of a live app or confirmed platform launch date makes it a riskier bet compared to its utility-focused competitors. Let's be real, most presales are smoke and mirrors. Remittix (RTX)  is breaking that mold by positioning itself as a legitimate financial ecosystem rather than just another speculative token. This isn't a “coming soon” tease. This move toward actual utility, allowing users to bridge digital assets to real-world bank accounts, is exactly what analysts look for when determining the Best Crypto To Buy Now. For crypto investors tired of waiting for “the next big thing,” Remittix is delivering it next month. The offer made this time is limited however, since it is estimated that only 5,000,000 tokens are assigned to the New Year round so one should start early in their participation or else there are chances of going into the year 2026 without momentum. Discover the future of PayFi with Remittix by checking out their project here: Bitcoin Hyper may appeal to investors bullish on Bitcoin scaling solutions, but it carries higher risk and depends heavily on execution, adoption, and broader market conditions. It will be based on your objectives, but utility-based initiatives such as Remittix, which have already been confirmed to launch products (Feb 9th) and have bonuses running will currently be ranking higher than speculative coins. They have the potential to be very profitable when you are early enough, but they are risky; you should seek audited teams (such as CertiK audits) and working products.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Despite market volatility and shifting narratives, billions of dollars continued to pour into digital assets, with capital rotating away from Bitcoin (BTC) and toward a small group of dominant altcoins.

Earn rewards worth up to 5,000 USDT on your first deposit Rather than exiting the market, investors increasingly rotated capital into newly launched altcoin investment products, including Solana (SOL) and XRP ETFs, which debuted in the third quarter of last year. This shift suggests that Bitcoin is no longer viewed as the sole anchor of crypto portfolios, as investors seek higher growth opportunities across alternative networks. Ethereum (ETH) led the rotation, recording $12.7 billion in inflows, a 138% year-over-year (YoY) increase, driven by continued ecosystem upgrades, staking demand, and expanding DeFi use cases. XRP followed with a 500% YoY surge to $3.7 billion, supported by legal clarity and renewed enterprise adoption. Solana posted the sharpest growth, with inflows jumping 1,000% YoY to $3.6 billion, reflecting strong interest in high-throughput applications, NFTs, and gaming. In contrast, the broader altcoin category outside these major tokens saw inflows fall 30% YoY to $318 million, pointing to a selective, “winner-takes-most” environment where capital concentrates around proven networks. Overall, the data suggests a maturing market where investors favor utility-driven blockchains rather than speculative breadth. Notably, Europe showed signs of revival as Germany shifted from $43 million in outflows in 2024 to a substantial $2.5 billion in inflows, signaling a renewed investor appetite that may have been fueled by improving economic conditions or favorable policy shifts. Canada mirrored this turnaround, moving from $603 million outflows to $1.1 billion inflows, while Switzerland posted a steady $775 million, up 11.5% YoY, highlighting its role as a stable hub for crypto products. These regional shifts suggest a broadening of the investor base beyond North America, with Europe emerging as a key growth area in 2025.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ethereum co-founder says "PeerDAS" and zk-proofs have finally broken the scaling ceiling, leaving Bitcoin's conservative design looking intentionally slow. It is what makes Bitcoin feel like bedrock. It is also why every bull market ends up replaying the same argument. Block space gets tight, fees jump, users complain, and builders promise solutions that live somewhere above the base layer. This week, Vitalik Buterin showed up with a very different claim about Ethereum's future, one that lands directly on Bitcoin's turf. In a post on X, he argued the blockchain “trilemma” is solved by pairing PeerDAS on mainnet with zkEVMs reaching “alpha” performance, while security work continues. He sketched a 2026–2030 path where proofs increasingly replace re-execution as the way Ethereum validates blocks. He also pointed to a third pillar: more distributed block building over time, so transaction inclusion is harder for a small club of builders to capture. Vitalik Buterin outlines how Ethereum's world computer roadmap aims to challenge the subscription-based internet model If you mostly live in Bitcoin land, it is tempting to shrug. Ethereum always has a roadmap, always has a new acronym, and Bitcoin keeps doing what it does. It is less about another upgrade and more about shifting what a “decentralized network” can do, at least in theory, with code already shipping. Ethereum's Fusaka upgrade activated on Dec. 3, 2025, at a specific mainnet slot. PeerDAS is one of those ideas that sounds abstract until you reduce it to a single question. Nodes subscribe to a small slice of the blob data. The math behind it uses erasure coding, so missing pieces can be reconstructed if enough of the full set exists. The plain-English point is that Ethereum is trying to raise throughput while keeping the “regular node” workload from exploding. Ethereum.org's own explanation says a default node receives roughly one-eighth of the original blob data under PeerDAS, because it listens to eight of 128 subnets, and blobs are extended for sampling. When the cost of staying synced climbs, home operators drop off. The network can look distributed while behaving like a handful of professional operators. Fusaka also introduced something that feels small but can become huge over time: blob parameter-only forks. These are preprogrammed mini-upgrades that adjust blob targets and maximums without the full drama of a traditional hard fork. The idea is to let Ethereum raise blob capacity in steps as the network proves it can handle it. Coin Metrics framed this as the start of Ethereum treating blob throughput like a dial it can turn. That “barely charging” issue is why another EIP keeps showing up in the background. It sets a reserve price so blob base fees do not collapse to near zero relative to execution costs. If you are a Bitcoiner, this should already sound familiar. Ethereum is trying to grow blob space for rollups without turning it into a free lunch that invites spam and centralizes validation. The zkEVM claim is about what happens next. Here is why that matters for Bitcoin. Bitcoin's base-layer security story is simple enough to explain at a dinner table. Miners hash, nodes verify, invalid blocks get rejected, and the network moves on. Ethereum's story is trending toward a world where the network can accept far more activity because validators verify succinct proofs instead of replaying every step of execution themselves. It is still decentralized in the sense that anyone can verify, but it leans more on cryptography, implementation correctness, and the economics of who produces proofs. Vitalik's post sketches 2026 as the year of big gas-limit increases driven by other upgrades, and the first real chances to run a zkEVM node. For a long time, Bitcoin's strongest competitive edge has been decentralization plus a base layer that stays understandable, conservative, and brutally hard to change. Ethereum's edge has been flexibility and a willingness to scale through new primitives, then lean on rollups to carry most user activity. If Ethereum can scale data availability while keeping node requirements bounded, and push proof-based validation without breaking trust assumptions, the market gets a second credible “settlement-style” network. It would be able to handle high-bandwidth activity without looking like a permissioned data center. If Ethereum succeeds, Bitcoin's block space remains premium. But the use cases that demand premium settlement may narrow toward high-value transfers, long-term custody moves, and settlement of layered systems. A lot of crypto's “real world” pitch, tokenized dollars, on-chain equity, supply-chain settlement, lives or dies on cost and throughput. Base's scaling write-up says its median fees fell from about $0.30 to fractions of a cent during frequent capacity increases. It also points to Ethereum's data availability roadmap, including PeerDAS and further blob increases, as the next unlock. When that kind of user experience exists at scale, capital and builders follow. Bitcoin's role becomes more clearly monetary and less general-purpose. Others will see it as Ethereum absorbing the parts of crypto that attract mainstream users. Calls for decentralization grow as Bitcoin's transaction security is challenged by central mining pools. Ethereum's next risks concentrate in prover markets and block building, which Vitalik acknowledged by talking about distributed block building and mechanisms like inclusion lists. On the Ethereum roadmap, the tools that show up here include enshrined proposer-builder separation, fork-choice-enforced inclusion lists, and block-level access lists. Nobody gets to declare victory in crypto without a few “if” statements, and Ethereum's own sources are clear that zkEVM safety is still the main work. So the honest way to cover this is with scenarios. Scenario one: slow and careful, fewer surprises. PeerDAS keeps expanding blob capacity through scheduled parameter forks. zkEVM security milestones take time, and proof-based validation remains optional longer than enthusiasts want. In this world, Ethereum improves the fee experience for rollups. Bitcoin remains the most conservative monetary base. The competitive tension stays ideological and investor-driven. Scenario two: demand pulls the roadmap forward. Rollups soak up blob capacity quickly, usage stays high after each BPO step, and Ethereum keeps turning the dial upward. In this world, the “cheap crypto UX” narrative consolidates around Ethereum's rollup stack. Bitcoin becomes even more clearly a settlement and savings layer. The market starts asking whether Bitcoin's L2 ecosystem can offer a similar experience while retaining Bitcoin's social and technical conservatism. Scenario three: zk proofs become normal, and the argument changes. Ethereum hits its security targets, proof verification becomes the default for validators, and higher gas limits become more feasible without raising hardware requirements for everyone. Bitcoin's differentiation leans harder on simplicity, immutability, and monetary policy. The investor conversation shifts toward two base layers with different philosophies, rather than one base layer and a crowd of alt chains racing for speed. The planned jump in capacity relies on a fragile shift to ZK-proof verification that could buckle under network stress. Most users do not wake up excited about data availability sampling. Bitcoiners know this pain too, especially when the mempool gets crowded, and fees price out casual users. Ethereum's promise here is a future where the base layer stays decentralized enough for ordinary validators, while the user experience happens on rollups with costs that feel like app fees, not settlement fees. If that happens, it does not kill Bitcoin. Vitalik all but says so when he highlights distributed block building as unfinished business. Vitalik's “trilemma solved” line is a headline. Bitcoin should care because the strongest argument for Bitcoin as crypto's only credibly neutral base layer weakens if Ethereum can scale without pricing out regular validators. It is restraint, predictability, and a base layer that remains legible under stress. That is the kind of competition crypto needs: two networks pushing different definitions of trust, and forcing the rest of the market to stop confusing speed with decentralization. Also known as "Akiba," Liam Wright is a reporter, podcast producer, and Editor-in-Chief at CryptoSlate. He believes that decentralized technology has the potential to make widespread positive change. Switch categories to dive deeper or gain broader context. Stablecoins are going mainstream, and Ethereum is positioning itself as the place those dollars ultimately settle. Vitalik says Ethereum's “game” isn't convenience or marginal yield boosts; it's worst-case survivability and permissionless access.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As the US Congress gears up to mark up the long-awaited crypto market structure bill on January 15, industry representatives are actively engaging in discussions regarding the critical elements of this legislation. While she expressed gratitude to Senate leadership for their efforts, she underscored the necessity of addressing several “non-negotiable issues” to ensure that the bill remains durable, workable, and supportive of innovation. Additionally, Mersinger highlighted the need to amend “outdated laws,” which she alleges poses risks of meritless criminal prosecutions for developers simply writing code for non-custodial technologies. Another critical point made by Mersinger is the preservation of decentralized finance (DeFi). She emphasized that DeFi must not be legislated out of existence, stating that open and decentralized innovation is vital for US competitiveness in the global market. She stressed that more than 110 organizations and companies have voiced similar sentiments, as illustrated by an August 2025 letter sent to the Senate advocating for developer protections. Stablecoin policy also emerged as a significant topic in Mersinger's remarks. She urged Congress to safeguard a bipartisan compromise established in the GENIUS Act, warning against measures that would impose yield bans, which could constrain lawful rewards and favor large banking institutions over new entrants to the market. Mersinger stressed that market structure reforms should facilitate competition between emerging players and legacy institutions, rather than entrench existing advantages. Should this process proceed smoothly, the bill could reach President Trump's desk for signing, with Terret estimating that this could happen as early as March.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After weeks of choppy trading, ETH remains caught between fading bullish attempts and persistent overhead resistance, leaving analysts sharply divided on what comes next. A minority still expects Ethereum to regain strength and eventually challenge its all-time highs, while the dominant narrative points toward a bearish 2026 marked by weaker demand and tighter liquidity conditions. The analysis focuses on Ethereum's Accumulating Addresses Realized Price, a metric that tracks the average cost basis of addresses that consistently accumulate ETH rather than trade it actively. Unlike momentum indicators, this measure reflects where long-term participants are willing to commit capital over extended periods. Even during the severe 2022–2023 drawdown, when ETH price corrected sharply, long-term holders largely held their ground instead of capitulating. That behavior established a durable foundation beneath the market. Today, this realized price has stabilized in the $2,700–$2,800 range, effectively forming a structural cost zone for Ethereum. As ETH hovers just above this area, the market faces a critical question: whether this long-term support continues to anchor price, or if shifting macro conditions finally challenge a regime that has held for years. Since 2022, most altcoins have suffered deep drawdowns without ever forming a durable accumulation cost base. That absence of consistent long-term buying helps explain why recoveries across the altcoin complex have been weaker and more fragile. Ethereum, by contrast, has repeatedly demonstrated an ability to retain long-term holder conviction through multiple stress periods, including 2018, 2020, 2022, and even the volatility seen in 2025. However, markets evolve, and structural regimes do not last forever. As long as ETH price trades near or above its accumulation cost, it signals that long-term buyers remain engaged, reinforcing Ethereum's relative resilience compared with most altcoins. On the other hand, a sustained break below this cost zone would imply a meaningful behavioral shift among long-term holders—one that could challenge the idea that Ethereum has permanently escaped its pre-2020 valuation framework. In today's environment, short-term price swings dominate attention, but it is this structural battle beneath the surface that may ultimately define Ethereum's next major cycle. Ethereum is currently consolidating around the $3,100 level after failing to reclaim higher resistance zones, reflecting a market caught between stabilization and continuation risk. The chart shows ETH trading below its short- and medium-term moving averages, with the 50-day and 100-day averages now acting as dynamic resistance rather than support. Price has repeatedly defended this zone, suggesting the presence of demand and short-term accumulation. However, upside momentum remains limited, as each bounce has been met with selling pressure near descending moving averages. From a structural perspective, ETH remains above the long-term moving average, which continues to slope upward. This indicates that the broader macro trend has not fully broken down, even though short-term momentum is weak. Volume has also declined during recent rebounds, reinforcing the idea that buyers lack conviction. Until then, Ethereum appears locked in a consolidation phase, with downside risks persisting if the $3,000 support fails to hold. CUSIP Database provided by FactSet Research Systems Inc.
