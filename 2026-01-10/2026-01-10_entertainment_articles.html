                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A warrant has reportedly been issued in New Mexico for actor and director Timothy Busfield, with the thirtysomething and West Wing performer facing charges on two counts of criminal sexual contact of a minor and one count of child abuse. The allegations, per People, stem from Busfield's time on Fox's now-canceled crime drama The Cleaning Lady, where he served as an executive producer and periodic episode director during its third and fourth seasons. The accusations have been levied by the family of two now-11-year-old boys, who told parents and mental health professionals that Busfield had touched them inappropriately when they were working on the series at the ages of 7 and 8. The boys' mother reportedly filed a police report in October of 2025, telling Child Protective Services that “her children both disclosed that there was sexual abuse by Timothy from around November 2022 to Spring 2024.” Quotes from the warrant state that Busfield had befriended the family during his time as a producer and director on the show, including spending time with them outside of filming, and states that the parents apparently became worried after hearing allegations that the actor had been “handsy” on past sets. (Busfield was accused of sexual assault in 1994, by a 17-year-old extra he'd appeared with in Little Big League, eventually settling the suit.) When the parents asked the children if they'd ever been touched in a way that made them feel uncomfortable on the set of the show, they allegedly responded “You mean like Uncle Tim?” One of the children, who was diagnosed with moderate post-traumatic stress disorder and anxiety, eventually told a therapist that Busfield “had touched and rubbed his penis 3 or 4 times.” The police warrant alleges that Busfield “exploited the hectic film sets to tickle and touch [the child] on his penis and buttocks, masking it as play.” The warrant also quotes police interviews with Busfield, who told investigators that Warner Bros. Television, producer on The Cleaning Lady, had launched a third-party investigation into the allegations. Busfield, also known for roles in films like Field Of Dreams and as a regular on the TV directing circuit, has so far neither commented on the charges, or reportedly been detained. Warner Bros. Television has issued a statement in response to the news, saying, “The health and safety of our cast and crew is always our top priority, especially the safety of minors on our productions.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A resurfaced podcast interview with Rob Reiner's son, Nick, that was recorded in September 2016 sheds new light on what Nick's relationship with the famed director was really like. Nick is charged with the murders of his parents Rob and Michele Reiner, and currently being held at the Twin Towers jail in Los Angeles. It was released four months before Nick spoke on the podcast. It was just released in like a couple theaters,” he said. You kind of have to be a poster boy for recovery. I'm gonna have to go onto these talk shows.' The host then told Nick, “I'm sure it put you in a really bad spot,” to which he replied, “It did. But I felt like it was part of the job. I'd smoke a joint on the roof of my apartment. I would not ever go onto these things coked up or anything like that. Do as best I could on it, and then afterwards, enjoy a joint.” Nick said he stayed away from harder substances during at the time, and hadn't done coke “in three to four years.” Nick said his dad knew he was “getting stoned,” but didn't get angry about it. “He's a hippie,” Nick said, before praising his parents and saying, “They're very understanding.” “TMZ Investigates: The Reiner Murders: What Really Happened” premiered tonight, January 9, at 8 p.m. on Fox. But if you missed it, don't worry. The special investigation will be available for streaming on Hulu starting tomorrow, Saturday, January 10. TMZ announced the special would cover Nick's “mental breakdown” after having his psychiatric medications for schizoaffective disorder rapidly changed.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Sources made the revelations surrounding Nick's 2020 diagnosis and subsequent struggles with his medication regimen in TMZ's new documentary, “The Reiner Murders: What Really Happened,” which aired on Friday. In December, the outlet reported that Nick, 32, was diagnosed with schizophrenia — and in the weeks leading up to his parents' deaths, the meds he was taking allegedly made him “erratic and dangerous.” Nick reportedly received care from a Los Angeles-based rehab facility in the weeks leading up to his parents' murders. Insiders added that Rob and Michele Reiner were aware of the troubling updates with their son, but were unsure of what to do. Start your day with Page Six Daily.

Doctors also allegedly decided not to place Nick on a temporary psych hold to stabilize him during this time, the sources continued. Nick's attorney, public defender Kimberly Greene, did not immediately respond to Page Six's request for comment. Rob and Michele were found fatally stabbed to death in their Los Angeles home on Dec. 14, 2025, after having been involved in a heated argument with Nick the night before. The young filmmaker, who has had a notoriously rocky relationship with his parents and publicly struggled with drug addiction for years, was arrested hours after his parents' bodies were discovered. After changing out his representation from famed attorney Alan Jackson to Greene, it was reported that Nick doesn't understand why he's in jail. While he is aware of his alleged crime, the insiders added that he's experiencing a break from reality.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In a statement shared with Billboard late Friday night (Jan. 9), DHS assistant secretary Tricia McLaughlin began, “Clearly, Billie Eilish has not seen the newly released footage, which corroborates what DHS has stated all along — that this individual was impeding law enforcement and weaponized her vehicle in an attempt to kill or cause bodily harm to federal law enforcement.” Sharing a link to a video on X of the Jan. 7 shooting — seemingly taken by the officer who pulled the trigger, later identified as Jonathan Ross — McLaughlin said that Ross had been “in fear of his own life [and] the lives of his fellow officers and acted in self-defense,” adding, “The American people can watch this video with their own eyes and ears and judge for themselves.” The assistant secretary's statement aligns with previous remarks from the DHS, President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance, who have all insisted that Ross was simply defending himself when he shot and killed 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good in her car during an ICE operation in Minnesota. In her statement to Billboard, McLaughlin went on to share a defense of ICE's protocols and cited an internal investigation into the alleged “increase in vehicle rammings” against immigration enforcement officers, which the DHS published one day after Ross shot Good. “Parents are asked if they want to be removed with their children, or ICE will place the children with a safe person the parent designates. It's garbage rhetoric from the likes of Billie Eilish that is leading to a 1,300% increase in assaults and 3,200% increase in vehicle rammings against our brave law enforcement.” Billboard has reached out to Eilish's reps for comment. Though the singer herself did not comment on what happened in Minneapolis prior to McLaughlin's response, Eilish did share a number of posts from other creators onto her Story on Friday. One of them called ICE a “federally funded and supported terrorist group” that is “tearing apart families, terrorizing citizens, and now murdering innocent people” under the Trump administration. Another post Eilish reshared on her Story called on the U.S. to “abolish ICE,” while a third post encouraged people to contact their representatives in Congress to demand that Ross be arrested and charged for killing Good. Backlash to ICE's ongoing crackdown on immigrant communities has reached a fever pitch in the days since it was shared, though the agency's actions have repeatedly come under fire throughout Trump's first year back in office. In the aftermath of Good's death, countless Minneapolis residents have rallied together to grieve her loss and protest ICE's presence in their city.

Dolly Parton has revealed that she will not attend her 80th birthday celebration at the Grand Ole Opry. “Well, hey there Grand Ole Opry family,” Parton said. She continued, “Some of my favorite memories happened right here onstage at the Grand Ole Opry, and I wish I could be there in person, but I'll be sending you all my love for sure. The Jan. 17 event, titled “Opry Goes Dolly,” will celebrate the “9 to 5” singer's 1980s era and feature appearances by Opry members Lainey Wilson, Vince Gill, Rhonda Vincent and songwriter Trannie Anderson, with more performers to be announced. The venue added that the event will include birthday cupcakes, a “larger-than-life” birthday card for fans to sign, photo opportunities with a Dolly impersonator, “Dolly-themed” drinks, and other tributes. Parton's announcement comes several months after the “Jolene” hitmaker postponed her Las Vegas concert residency at the Colosseum at Caesars Palace due to undisclosed medical procedures. “I don't think God is through with me and I ain't done workin',” the Country Music Hall of Famer said in a video on Oct. 8.

Kristen Stewart doesn't love the logline to her new movie, “The Chronology of Water,” based on Lidia Yuknavitch's acclaimed memoir: “After an abusive childhood, restless Lidia escapes into competitive swimming, sexual experimentation, toxic relationships, and addiction before finding her voice through writing.” “And so the movie needed to be unwieldy, or else it would've been like [in a mockingly preachy voice], ‘You should trust yourself.' One of the things Stewart loved about the way Yuknavitch pieced together the memories of her life was that there was no present tense, allowing for a bold use of editing, as the juxtaposition of Lidia's memories flows like water. It's not an approach that translates to a traditional script, especially one that gets greenlit, even if you are Kristen Stewart. To which Stewart offered this piece of advice, “Don't take notes.” If she had, she “would've never made this movie.” That discovery process was one Stewart worked on for eight years, writing 500 drafts of the screenplay – a number she insists is not hyperbole — to unlock how she would capture that emotional connective tissue. “If you remember [when] you're seven, there are shockingly striking images and feelings that can rush back into your body as if they are present as hell,” said Stewart. “ And so, I am my 7-year-old self right now. I am every person I've ever been, if you let yourself drift into the waters of your physicalized memory, and that's hard to do sometimes – we live in a world that's so exterior, where we're concern about how we present ourselves.” The film is an exercise in tapping into the emotional memory we store in our bodies, and sound became Stewart's most valuable tool for unlocking it. Stewart referred to the sound design, led by supervising sound editor Brent Kiser, as being akin to a “skipping record,” as the film's sonic landscape fluctuates to follow Lidia's backwards-and-forwards journey between self-soothing, self-assurance, self-hatred, and self-laceration. “And so it just feels like the movie is your memory as it starts to progress, and the sound becomes more complicated.” While there is some traditional voice-over in the film, the recordings and vocal performances (some more vocalization than voice-over) of Poots vary widely, often within the same scene, and in a way, Stewart said most sound professionals walked away from, as she struggled to find the right post-production collaborators. Talking about sound is not some nerdy technical thing for Stewart, but rather how she excavated the film's ideas and emotions. I can't wait to make another movie. I can't wait to do the female ‘Taxi Driver' where we just get like a real solid slew of inner perspective that never stops.” To hear Kristen Stewart's full interview, subscribe to the Filmmaker Toolkit podcast on Apple, Spotify, or your favorite podcast platform.

While the children did not disclose any sexual contact in their initial discussions with hospital staff — only unwanted tickling — subsequent interviews with a social worker reportedly revealed that Busfield inappropriately touched the children's private areas over their clothing, the arrest warrant states. However, the mother of the two children filed a police report in October 2025, told Child Protective Services that “her children both disclosed that there was sexual abuse by Timothy from around November 2022 to Spring 2024.” One of the children told the therapist that he was “having nightmares about the director touching him and waking up scared” and claimed Busfield “had touched and rubbed his penis 3 or 4 times and appeared to be ashamed.” The child was diagnosed with moderate post-traumatic stress disorder and anxiety. I don't really remember picking those boys up,” Busfield told investigators, per the warrant. Officer Marvin Kirk Brown, who issued the arrest warrant, wrote, “In my training and experience, pedophiles often infiltrate families under a trusted role, like Timothy, who, as a producer, exploited the hectic film sets to tickle and touch SL on his penis and buttocks, masking it as play.” Was a Crazy Anti-Authoritarian Political Thriller Quietly Disappeared From Theaters? That Horny, Era-Appropriate Soundtrack Was Pivotal to ‘Heated Rivalry,' Says Creator Messy Breakups and That ICE Song: 5 Takeaways From Zach Bryan's New Album Brown continued, “He would invite the family to off-set gatherings, with his wife buying Christmas gifts to foster closeness, making SL feel special and dependent— classic grooming to erode boundaries, isolate the victim, and silence suspicions by blending abuse into normalcy.” Busfield has appeared in films like Revenge of the Nerds, Field of Dreams, and Little Big League, and won an Emmy for his role on the drama series Thirtysomething. In 1994, Busfield was accused in a lawsuit of sexual assault by a 17-year-old female extra on the set of Little Big League; the lawsuit was later settled.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>EXCLUSIVE: Buzz about the next James Bond has always existed in its own reality. But not all Bond rumors are created equally. This is the inside story of that hoax, which serves as a cautionary tale about the efforts some will go to deceive journalists and how AI is supercharging the ability to spread disinformation. Ultimately, the hoax proves an old reporting maxim: If a story is too good to be true, it often is. Like many reporters, I have an encrypted email account, through which I encourage sources to send me sensitive information that could ultimately lead to a story. In August 2025, a person identifying himself as Michael Lawrence sent me an eye-catching message, in which they claimed to have evidence showing that an unknown British actor was being seriously considered as the successor to Daniel Craig. “I am providing one redacted casting email (of two in my possession) that proves actor Scott Rose-Marsh has been seen by the Bond producers and is being actively considered for the role of James Bond,” the message read. Attached was a heavily redacted screenshot of a macOS Mail account, claiming to show a casting brief for a role named “Bond/Cavalier” in a film code-named “Project Knight.” The email was purportedly sent on June 24, 2025, days before Denis Villeneuve was confirmed by Amazon MGM Studios as Bond 26's director, and months before Peaky Blinders scribe Steven Knight was officially installed as the movie's writer. Send me an email like this, and you have my attention. But something was a little off about the message. There were inconsistencies and a peculiar focus on horsemanship, which is not something naturally associated with Bond. The email is structured in a way that resembles how AI spits out information, with subheads, bullet points, and robotic language. Indeed, when run through two artificial intelligence detector tools — which are unreliable but can provide circumstantial evidence — both indicated a high probability that the email was written using ChatGPT or similar. I pressed him for more information, but the tipster declined to declare his identity, his connection to Rose-Marsh, or how he came into possession of confidential material. Nevertheless, Michael shared two scripts, which he claimed were read by Rose-Marsh during an audition. Michael made repeated requests that the material not be shared or published. The script was heavily redacted, which served to heighten its mystique and cement the impression it was being shared illicitly. It did, however, contain the somewhat ironic direction: “James Bond leaves the office in which he just found a conclusive piece of evidence.” The script was not a conclusive piece of evidence (it was, as I would later discover, a fake), but it was enough for us to make further inquiries in an attempt to corroborate the claims. As it turned out, Hollywood sources scoffed at the tipster, indicating what my colleague Baz Bamigboye later reported: that casting for Bond would not begin in earnest until Villeneuve had completed Dune: Part Three. In other words, the Rose-Marsh audition timeline did not fit. We decided against publication on this basis, but there were other red flags, not least a failed attempt to get Michael on the phone (he wrongly claimed my Signal account was not registered). I thought little more of the tip-off until a week later, when The Hollywood Reporter published a gossip column suggesting that Rose-Marsh tested for Bond, reading sides from GoldenEye and potential material from Knight. Amazon MGM Studios did not knock the story down (as is tradition with Bond casting rumors), and then — perhaps the most telling intervention — Rose-Marsh capitalized on the interest by granting an interview to Australian publication Man of Many, under the headline: “Meet Scott Rose-Marsh, the man who might be James Bond.” Asked if he had auditioned for Bond, the actor cryptically replied: “I can't confirm or deny.” He added: “Whether it was to be me or anybody else, I would support whoever it is.” Over Christmas, the Bond rumors kept coming — and Rose-Marsh continued to be mentioned. Reports about Callum Turner being the frontrunner featured references to Rose-Marsh, while GQ named him among the contenders in a listicle. Bookmakers are taking bets on Rose-Marsh being Bond, with comparison website Oddschecker putting his chances at 33-1 (incidentally, there have been many reports about Rose-Marsh based on betting odds, a couple of which pre-dated efforts to plant the audition story). When I confronted Rose-Marsh, the actor said the speculation “may have arisen from a previous ‘Bond-related' audition,” but he declined to provide more information because of an NDA. Rose-Marsh did not directly answer questions about whether he was aware of the hoax or if he knew the identity of Michael Lawrence. “I do not agree with or condone hoaxers,” he said, adding: “I don't comment on rumors, but since being in the public eye, it's humbling that people think a rising actor like me could really be James Bond — and, of course, being Bond has been the dream of many actors.” Gregg Millard, Rose-Marsh's agent, advised his client against the Man of Many interview, telling him it would be naive. Millard said he was baffled at the level of “unfounded speculation” and that the story was not killed by Bond producers. “I know nothing about any suggested hoax,” he added. When confronted with our evidence over email on Thursday, Michael Lawrence did not reply. It will be a thrilling moment, injecting fresh life into one of cinema's most iconic franchises. But until that time, the Rose-Marsh hoax is a reminder not to be left shaken or stirred by rumors about 007. Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As long as we've known about him, we've heard that Robin Hood's thing is that he steals from the rich and gives to the poor. “People speak of Robin Hood, tell his stories… they're all lies,” we hear early in the clip. Of course, it's Robin Hood (Hugh Jackman) himself telling us these things, so perhaps he has an ulterior motive. “Grappling with his past after a life of crime and murder, Robin Hood finds himself gravely injured after a battle he thought would be his last,” reads an official synopsis for the film. “In the hands of a mysterious woman, he is offered a chance at salvation.” From the looks of it, at least some of this salvation will come from Robin's relationship with a little girl whom he teaches to use a bow and arrow. This leaves him conflicted, given his new distaste for murder and pillaging, so he later promises to keep her safe. The Death Of Robin Hood comes from A Quiet Place: Day One and Pig director and screenwriter Michael Sarnoski. Jackman stars alongside Jodie Comer, Bill Skarsgård, Murray Bartlett, and Noah Jupe. The film is slated for a 2026 release, though there's no firm theatrical release date as of this writing.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>NBC4 added that the gun will be destroyed if Rourke does not retrieve it after a year. The news arrives amid a fundraising fiasco involving Rourke and his manager. Back in December, The Wrestler actor was sued by his landlord, who alleged that Rourke owed nearly $60,000 in rent on his bungalow just south of West Hollywood. After the actor found himself facing eviction, Kimberly Hines, who's been Rourke's manager for over a decade, and her assistant launched a GoFundMe. Despite more than $90,000 being raised, Rourke shared an Instagram video on Jan. 5 stating that he was not involved with the fundraiser and said, “If I needed money, I wouldn't ask for no fucking charity,” adding, “I'd rather stick a gun up my ass and pull the trigger. Goldie later sued Rourke for unpaid rent, but Hines claimed that the house was “uninhabitable,” with “black mold” and “no running water.” “A GoFund is set up for him, and now he's rejecting it?

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Reality television star Tammy Kaye Donath, who became known when appearing on “Love After Lockup,” passed away at the age of 63 on December 31, 2025, the family announced in an online obituary. She is remembered for her “bright, loving soul, intelligence, honesty, and straightforward demeanor.” She is survived by her daughter's Kristianna Miller, Terra Kaylea Sprague and her son Christopher Roth, along with her siblings Robin Donath, Linda Schoenberger (Donath), Dennis (Bud) Donath, and Rebecca Donath, as well as her grandchildren, Dethan Moore, Mackenzie Cook, Payton Cook, and great-grandchildren, Malakai Cook, Seth Fuoco Jr., Jak Moore, and Gunnar Fuoco, the obituary says. On the same page as Donath's online obituary, there was a tribute wall where many people left comments. “I miss you so much MOM,” Christopher Roth wrote. “You were the smartest, sweetest, most loving caring and forgiving Mother and The Best Mother any Son could ever want,” he continued. “I Love And Miss You So Much Mother. When it rains I will dance in it as much as possible because I know it is your tears of joy from you and you are watching over us forever and always. “Love After Lockup” is a show that follows couples who meet while one is incarcerated and shows their story once they are released from prison. Donath appeared on the show while it followed her daughter, Kristianna Miller's, love story after she was incarcerated in 2020. It followed her relationship with John Miller, and the two eventually got married, but split and went through a divorce in 2022. Miller has also struggled throughout the years, having been incarcerated again in 2024 due to a probation violation, the Sun reports.
