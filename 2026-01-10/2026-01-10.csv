            President Donald Trump continued his threats towards Greenland on Friday, as he insisted that if the United States did not act Russia or China could occupy it in the future.
    


            Trump said that if he is unable to make a deal to acquire the territory “the easy way,” then he will have to “do it the hard way.”
    


            “We are going to do something in Greenland, whether they like it or not, because if we don't do it, Russia or China will take over Greenland, and we're not going to have Russia or China as a neighbor,” Trump told reporters at the White House.
    


            Greenland's party leaders, including the opposition, issued a joint statement saying: “We do not want to be Americans, we do not want to be Danes, we want to be Greenlanders. The future of Greenland must be decided by the Greenlandic people.”
    


            The US president and his White House officials have been discussing a range of options on how to bring Greenland under US control amid renewed interest in the strategically significant Danish-controlled territory, and has not ruling out a military intervention. The governments of Greenland and Denmark continue to publicly and privately insist it is not for sale.
    


            It remains unclear how other NATO members would respond if the US decided to take Greenland by force. European leaders have warned that such a move would have serious consequences for the military alliance. In a joint statement the leaders of France, Germany, the UK, Italy, Poland and Spain said Greenland belongs to its own people.
    


            “I would like to make a deal the easy way but if we don't do it the easy way, we're going to do it the hard way. And by the way, I'm a fan of Denmark too. I have to tell you, they have been very nice to me. I'm a big fan,” Trump said.
    


            He claimed that the move was necessary to prevent Russia or China from taking Greenland at some point in the future.
    


            Asked about a recent report that the US was weighing making payments to Greenlanders to convince them to join the US, Trump said, “I'm not talking about money for Greenland yet.”
    


            Many Greenlanders have already rejected the idea of accepting money to become part of the US. “No thank you. It's absolutely certain that we don't want that,” one resident of the capital city of Nuuk, Simon Kjeldskov, told Reuters.
    


            Another resident, Juno Michaelsen, said: “Any number in the world and we will say no. It belongs to us and only us.”
    


            The top Washington-based diplomats for Greenland and Denmark met with White House officials on Thursday. Denmark's Ambassador Jesper Møller Sørensen and Greenland's head of representation to the US Jacob Isbosethsen met with Trump advisers, diplomats familiar with the matter told CNN.
    


            Greenland's Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen alongside four other party leaders once again rejected Trump's calls to acquire the semi-autonomous territory in a statement release Friday night and seen by Reuters.
    


            The leaders said a planned meeting of Greenland's parliament, the Inatsisartut, to discuss its response to the Trump administration's threats would be brought forward. The date of the meeting has not yet been determined. Greenland's parliament last met in November and had been scheduled to meet again on February 3.

            President Donald Trump this week lashed out at congressional Republicans like he rarely has before.
    


            He got so mad at a handful of Senate Republicans on Thursday that he said five of them – roughly 1 out of every 10 – “should never be elected to office again.” His list of offenders even included one, Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, who might be the most vulnerable Republican in the 2026 election. (One of Collins' Democratic opponents, Maine Gov. Janet Mills, had some fun with this.)
    


            It was an extraordinary day for Republicans, from whom Trump expects fealty, showing their nerve.
    


            The signs have been growing for a while now that Republicans are starting to grow a little more comfortable casting votes against Trump, most notably at the state level last month in Indiana. And this week such votes in Congress came fast.
    


            Most or all of the votes are likely to be symbolic and don't appear to have adjusted the president's course – at least yet. And there remains plenty of evidence that fear of Trump is still an animating principle in the GOP.
    


            But the rebukes were symbolic on some pretty significant issues. And they provide growing evidence that Trump, whose power relies on the domination of his party, is losing his iron grip on it.
    


            Perhaps most striking was the five Senate Republicans who voted to advance a measure limiting Trump's power to launch further military strikes in Venezuela – the vote that drew Trump to lash out on social media. The measure is expected to pass the chamber next week.
    


            While some GOP defections were expected, the volume of them was surprising. Trump even lost the vote of oft-loyalist Sen. Josh Hawley of deep red Missouri.
    


            The vote also raises the real prospect that both Republican-controlled chambers of Congress could vote to check Trump's power here, when the House votes later this month on a similar measure.
    


            (Two House Republicans bucked Trump last month before the Venezuela strike, when a similar vote narrowly failed. And the GOP's majority in that chamber has since shrunk.)
    


            Even if both chambers passed the same piece of legislation checking Trump's authority, he could just veto it.
    


            But the symbolism here is huge – especially as the president eyes a more in-your-face and expansionist foreign policy in the Western Hemisphere, including with his play for Greenland (which we'll get to). Much of that relies on the threat of military force, whether explicit or implicit, but Congress and these Republicans aren't playing ball and are undermining his leverage.
    


            Thursday was a particularly inauspicious day for Trump in the House.
    


            Across a trio of votes – two attempting to override his vetoes on local projects and a much-bigger vote to extend the lapsed enhanced Obamacare subsidies for three years – Trump lost the votes of 35, 24 and 17 House Republicans.
    


            As percentages of House Republicans voting, those amounted to 16.5%, 11% and 8% of the conference. Those are not overwhelming percentages, but they do represent significant portions of the party, the likes of which we don't often see, all the same day.
    


            And the Obamacare vote is especially troubling for Trump. The subsidies were the crux of the government shutdown late last year, and Trump has resisted extending them. He has instead signaled a desire for a more GOP-friendly proposal. But Republicans seem to be losing patience and worrying greatly about the expiration of the subsidies blowing back on them in the midterms.
    


            (A handful of them previously cued up this vote by signing a “discharge petition” forged by House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries – a hugely symbolic rebuke of the president in and of itself.)
    


            Much has yet to play out, but the pressure is growing on Trump to consent to something that would once have been unthinkable for him: subsidizing Obamacare. And Thursday's vote, which succeeded easily, 230-196, clearly upped the pressure.
    


            A couple other developments are also worth noting in this context.
    


            One was Republican Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina forcing through a bill by unanimous consent that would display a long-delayed plaque honoring law enforcement who defended the US Capitol on January 6, 2021.
    


            The reason that was significant? It came just days after Trump's White House launched one of its most brazen efforts to rewrite the history of January 6 – effectively blaming the police for the riot in a factually ridiculous timeline released on the fifth anniversary.
    


            And on the foreign policy front, we saw a rather remarkable number of warning shots – from Senate Republicans, especially – when it came to Trump's designs on adding Greenland through coercion or even military force. Several regular Trump allies cast his play as ridiculous and potentially damaging to the NATO alliance.
    


            Trump's critics will be tempted to label some or all of these rebukes as thin gruel. None of the measures that passed Thursday thanks to GOP crossovers are likely to become law. Republicans could certainly go a lot further to bind Trump's hands on something like Greenland, if they wanted to.
    


            There is also thus far limited evidence that any of their efforts to check Trump have forced him to change his course and relent.
    


            And in fact, CNN's Annie Grayer reported Friday on how Trump's threats after the Senate war powers vote actually dissuaded some House Republicans from voting to override Trump's vetoes. Clearly, Trump's wrath still matters.
    


            But many of these examples apply significant pressure, even just as statements of intent. Republicans seem to be warning Trump to avert his course on some huge issues – especially his taste for imperialism and the health care debate.
    


            And the fact remains that this just isn't normal. I wrote in October about how rare it was for congressional Republicans to vote against Trump. Now we have it happening on multiple issues … in both chambers … on the same day.
    


            And that's a dangerous development for Trump, because he needs these Republicans to fear him and stay in line in order to continue wielding his often-unchecked power. For whatever reason, his and the White House's response to the Indiana vote last month didn't do the trick. Republicans appear emboldened to vote against him.

            Bones and skulls visible in the back seat of a car near an abandoned cemetery on Philadelphia's outskirts led police to a basement filled with body parts, which authorities say were hoarded by a man now accused of stealing about 100 sets of human remains.
    


            Officers say a Tuesday night arrest culminated a monthslong investigation into break-ins at Mount Moriah Cemetery, where at least 26 mausoleums and vaults had been forced open since early November.
    


            Investigators later searched the Ephrata home and storage unit of Jonathan Christ Gerlach, 34, and reported finding more than 100 human skulls, long bones, mummified hands and feet, two decomposing torsos and other skeletal items.
    


            “They were in various states. Some of them were hanging, as it were. Some of them were pieced together, some were just skulls on a shelf,” Delaware County District Attorney Tanner Rouse said.
    


            Most were in the basement, authorities said, and they also recovered jewelry believed to be linked to the graves. In one case, a pacemaker was still attached.
    


            Police say Gerlach targeted mausoleums and underground vaults at the 1855 cemetery. It's considered the country's largest abandoned burial ground, according to Friends of Mount Moriah Cemetery, which helps maintain the 160-acre landmark in Yeadon that's home to an estimated 150,000 grave sites.
    


Jim Morrison's stolen grave bust found after 37 years



            Police had been looking into the string of burglaries when an investigator checked Gerlach's vehicle plates and found he had been near Yeadon repeatedly during the period when the burglaries occurred. Police say the break-ins centered on sealed vaults and mausoleums containing older burials, which had been smashed open or had stonework damaged to reach the remains inside.
    


            He was arrested as he walked back toward his car with a crowbar, police said, and a burlap bag in which officers found the mummified remains of two small children, three skulls and other bones.
    


            Gerlach told investigators he took about 30 sets of human remains and showed them the graves he stole from, police said.
    


            “Given the enormity of what we are looking at and the sheer, utter lack of reasonable explanation, it's difficult to say right now, at this juncture, exactly what took place. We're trying to figure it out,” Rouse told reporters.
    


Judge accepts guilty pleas from Colorado funeral home owners who acknowledged abusing 191 corpses



            Gerlach was charged with 100 counts each of abuse of a corpse and receiving stolen property, along with multiple counts of desecrating a public monument, desecrating a venerated object, desecrating a historic burial place, burglary, trespassing and theft.
    


            He is jailed on $1 million bond. No lawyer was listed in court records. A message seeking comment was texted to a cellphone linked to him.

US President Donald Trump has signaled that he could order strikes against drug cartels on Mexican territory.

He renewed the threats against America's southern neighbor after US commandos abducted Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro during a lightning raid on his compound in Caracas last week. The US government accuses Maduro of narcotics trafficking, which he has denied.

Trump has also accused Mexico of “flooding” the US with drugs and illegal immigrants, many of whom he has described as violent criminals. Since September 2025, the US has struck at least 35 alleged cartel boats in the Caribbean.

“We've knocked out 97% of the drugs coming in by water, and we are going to start now hitting land with regard to the cartels,” Trump told Fox News' Sean Hannity on Thursday night.

“The cartels are running Mexico. It's very, very sad to watch and see what's happened to that country,” Trump said.

Speaking at a press conference on Friday, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum downplayed Trump's rhetoric as “part of his communication style.”

She added that she had instructed Mexican Foreign Minister Juan Ramon de la Fuente to speak with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and, “if necessary, with Trump to strengthen coordination.”

Last week, the Mexican Foreign Ministry condemned the US military raid in Venezuela as “a serious threat to regional stability.”

Following the abduction of Maduro, Trump also traded insults with Colombian President Gustavo Petro, whom he labeled a “sick man.” The leaders spoke by phone on Wednesday to defuse tensions, with both describing the conversation as cordial.

GENEVA, January 10. /TASS/. Today's European leaders have not lived through world wars and therefore lack the historical perspective needed to properly assess the situation around Ukraine, Swiss politician, journalist, writer, and member of the Geneva cantonal parliament Guy Mettan told TASS in an interview.

""With the exception of [Hungarian Prime Minister] Viktor Orban, [Slovak Prime Minister] Robert Fico, and [Belarusian President] Alexander Lukashenko, none of the current European leaders are capable of conducting a rational analysis of the situation,"" he said.

According to Mettan, today's European leaders ""did not experience World War II and came of age only at the end of the Cold War."" As a result, ""they possess neither the historical background nor the geopolitical competence required to manage complex situations,"" he explained.

In his view, true courage on the part of Europeans under the current circumstances ""would be to acknowledge that they have chosen the wrong path and to do everything possible to bring the war"" in Ukraine to an end. Mettan stressed that the conflict is devastating Europe and Ukraine ""far more than it is affecting Russia."".","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

Online campaign for US woman shot and killed by ICE agent in Minneapolis significantly surpasses initial $50,000 goal

An online campaign meant to financially support the family of Renee Nicole Good – the US woman shot to death Wednesday by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agent – raised more than $1.5m before organizers closed it Friday.

“Thank you. Thank you. Thank you,” said the page of the GoFundMe campaign benefiting Good's family, which also explained the money raised would be placed in a trust. “We are here brokenhearted and in awe of your generosity.”

The campaign's initial goal was $50,000. In a substantial show of public support, the campaign – verified by GoFundMe as legitimate – had generated more than 30 times that amount when it was closed Friday. Contributions came from roughly 38,500 donors who were asked on the fundraising platform to “support the widow and family of Renee Good as they grapple with the devastating loss of their wife and mother”.

“Renee was pure sunshine, pure love,” a message from the fundraiser's organizers said. “She will be desperately missed.”

Good, a 37-year-old mother of three, was shot to death as she tried to drive her car away from federal agents conducting an immigration sweep in Minneapolis at the behest of the Trump administration. Video taken by the agent who shot Good showed her saying everything was “fine” and “I'm not mad at you” while he approached and she was behind the wheel of a car stopped across a street.

Then a different ICE officer demanded she open her door and grabbed its handle. Good began pulling forward to drive away and slowly brushed the first officer, who was easily able to retain his balance.

The officer at that point shot Good multiple times, fatally wounding her while a voice on video is heard saying: “Fucking bitch.”

The ICE agent who killed Good has been identified as Jonathan E Ross. In June, he had been dragged by a vehicle while participating in the arrest of an undocumented immigrant with an open ICE detainer and a criminal conviction for sexually assaulting his 16-year-old stepdaughter in 2022.

Minnesota officials and residents have sharply rebuked the Trump administration's narrative that Good was engaging in domestic terrorism when Ross killed her. Notably, Minneapolis mayor Jacob Frey implored ICE to “get the fuck out” of the city. Some congressional Democrats have threatened to withhold funding for the Department of Homeland Security that contains ICE.

Thousands have protested near the site of Good's killing, which was less than a mile from where Minneapolis police murdered George Floyd in plain view of a cellphone camera five years earlier, igniting worldwide protests.

Good's widow, Rebecca Good, who witnessed her wife's killing, published a statement on the GoFundMe saying “the kindness of strangers is the most fitting tribute” for Renee. Rebecca Good said she and her wife were supporting their neighbors amid the ICE sweep at the time of Renee's killing.

“We were raising our son to believe that no matter where you come from or what you look like, all of us deserve compassion and kindness,” Rebecca Good's statement said. “Renee lived this belief every day.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Blocking immigration will not make Trump's America great again – for the US to shine, he must let it get browner

Here's one reason Donald Trump seems perennially in a bad mood: he has probably figured out that the America he fantasizes about is out of his reach.

However many immigrants he manages to deport or prevent from entering the country, the white paradise he is promising his Maga base, free of Somalis, Mexican “rapists” and generally people from “shithole countries” – closer in hue to the America where he was born – is not his to offer.

He can, however, do a lot of damage. By doing his best to make the US unbearable both to foreigners and, more generally, people from ethnicities that do not mesh with his picture of the American family, Trump is not Making America Great Again. He is ensuring America will be smaller, older, weaker and easier to push around.

Even zeroing-out immigration altogether will be insufficient to restore the bygone America that Trump yearns for. Whatever he does to get rid of immigrants will not stop the non-Hispanic white footprint from shrinking.

Trump is not the first politician to try to protect their conviction about the whiteness of America's racial stock from “foreign” contamination. The national-origin immigration quotas in the Johnson-Reed Act of 1924 were quite successful at doing this. In 1960, 75% of immigrants to the US came from Europe.

But the levee broke. The Hart-Celler Act of 1965 replaced national-origin with family ties. These days only about 10% of immigrants hail from Europe. More than half come from Latin America. When Trump was four, white people accounted for nine in 10 Americans (the census did not ask about Hispanic ethnicity). By 2024, the non-Hispanic white share had slid to 57.5%.

Nothing Trump does to stop immigration can change this trajectory. Because the non-Hispanic white population will keep on shrinking regardless, the Census Bureau projects that it will lose 3.6 million people over the next five years, almost 11 million in the decade after that and more than 14 million in the subsequent one.

And that means that if Trump and his ethnonationalist sidekick Stephen Miller achieve their goal of cutting future immigration down to nothing, the US population will shrink pretty sharply. It will be 6% smaller by mid-century, 10% smaller by 2060 and one-third smaller in 2100. The president may not fully realize this – his grasp of economics has proven tenuous – the demographic squeeze would come at a substantial cost.

The population will not merely shrink. It will get old, because the population of working age will shrink even faster. Today, people over 65 account for about one-fifth of the population. In a zero-immigration scenario, their share will rise to one-quarter by mid-century and over one-third by its end, supported by a shrinking labor force.

The data does preoccupy people in the White House. Their prescription, however, is as unrealistic as the rest of their dreams: to boost American fertility, which has been falling over the last two decades and is now at 1.6 children per woman of reproductive age, substantially below the roughly 2.1 replacement rate needed to stabilize the population.

Part of the problem is that declining fertility is a global phenomenon that scholars do not fully understand. It is happening not only in rich and middle-income countries but also in the world's poorest countries, where fertility remains comparatively high. Pronatalist policies in developed nations, including child benefits, broader provision of childcare and other family supports, have had a limited impact on families' propensity to have kids.

The other problem is that the proposed solutions from the Trump administration border on the absurd. They include a “National Medal of Motherhood” for particularly fecund mothers, fertility tracking classes and $1,000 to be deposited into “Trump accounts” for babies born during his presidency. These come amid a torrent of policies that will make childbearing tougher, such as cuts to federal support for children's healthcare and nutrition, courtesy of the president's tax-cutting bill.

Trump's problem, in a nutshell, is that the one straightforward policy approach to ease America's demographic challenge is to rely on people for whom he has expressed unconstrained disgust: non-white immigrants.

In the Census Bureau's high immigration scenario – in which net immigration averages some 1.5m per year – the US population would grow 13% by 2050 and 28% by the end of the century. The 65-plus share would not hit one quarter until 2070.

One challenge to this scenario is that there may not be sufficient immigrants available to keep propping up the American population, especially as fertility rates drop in Latin America and Asia too. Net immigration to the US averaged 1.8m per year between 2020 and 2024, driven by a surge after the Covid pandemic. But it only hit about 900,000 a year in the decade before that.

The bigger conundrum for the president is another, though. The unadulterated, non-Hispanic white footprint will shrink under any scenario. But if immigration is high, it will drop faster: from 58% of the population this year to under 47% in 2050. The Hispanic share would rise from just under 20% to almost 26%.

The challenge must be torturing the guy: if Trump wants to keep America great, he must let it get browner.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Five parties issue joint statement after US president warns he would acquire the island ‘the nice way or the more difficult way'

Greenlanders “don't want to be Americans” and must decide the future of the Arctic island themselves, politicians in the self-governing Danish territory have said, after Donald Trump warned the US would “do something whether they like it or not”.

The leaders of five political parties in the Greenlandic parliament issued a united statement on Friday night, soon after the US president reiterated his threats to acquire the mineral-rich island.

“We don't want to be Americans, we don't want to be Danish, we want to be Greenlanders,” said the group, which included the island's prime minister, Jens-Frederik Nielsen. “The future of Greenland must be decided by Greenlanders.”

Stressing the desire of the people of Greenland, a former Danish colony, to have self-determination, they said: “No other country can meddle in this. We must decide our country's future ourselves – without pressure to make a hasty decision, without procrastination, and without interference from other countries.”

The statement was signed by Nielsen, his predecessor as prime minister, Múte B Egede, and Pele Broberg, Aleqa Hammond and Aqqalu C Jerimiassen.

At a meeting with oil and gas executives at the White House earlier on Friday, Trump had said Greenland was crucial for US national security. “We're not going to have Russia or China occupy Greenland. That's what they're going to do if we don't. So we're going to be doing something with Greenland, either the nice way or the more difficult way,” he told reporters.

Trump is “actively” discussing making a potential offer to buy the island with his national security team, the White House confirmed earlier this week.

Greenlanders have repeatedly expressed their refusal to be part of the US, with 85% of the population rejecting the idea, according to a 2025 poll.

Polling also shows only 7% of Americans support the idea of a US military invasion of the territory, which the Danish prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, recently said would mean the end of “Nato and therefore post second world war security”.

She has urged Trump to stop threatening to take over the country, saying the US has “no right to annex any of the three countries in the Danish kingdom [meaning Denmark, Greenland and the Faroe Islands]”.

Trump said on Friday: “If it weren't for me, you wouldn't have a Nato right now.” When asked whether his priority was preserving the alliance or acquiring Greenland, he previously told the New York Times: “It may be a choice.”

Asked about Trump's statement, the head of Nato's forces in Europe, US Gen Alexus Grynkewich, said he did not wish to comment on whether the alliance – which includes Denmark – would survive without the US.

But he responded on Friday by saying Nato was far from being in a crisis.

“There's been no impact on my work at the military level up to this point … I would just say that we're ready to defend every inch of alliance territory still today,” he said.

“So I see us as far from being in a crisis right now,.”

The US has operated a military base on the northwestern tip of Greenland since the second world war, where more than 100 military personnel are permanently stationed. Existing agreements with Denmark would allow Trump to bring as many troops as he wanted to the island.

But Trump told reporters on Friday that a lease agreement was not enough. “Countries have to have ownership and you defend ownership, you don't defend leases,” he said. “And we'll have to defend Greenland,.”

Trump previously made an offer to buy the island in 2019, but was told it was not for sale. Since then he has claimed that Greenland, which has vast natural resources including rare-earth minerals and potentially huge oil and gas reserves, “is covered with Russian and Chinese ships all over the place”.

In an interview with the Guardian on Friday, Jess Berthelsen, the chair of SIK, Greenland's national trade union confederation, said people in the territory did not recognise the US president's allegations that Russian and Chinese ships were scattered throughout its waters. “We can't see it, we can't recognise it and we can't understand it,” he said.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

A recent Microsoft survey ranked Taiwan 23rd in the world in artificial intelligence (AI) use, with 28.4 percent of Taiwanese reporting that they use the technology. 

The Microsoft Al Economy Institute in a release on Thursday said that 16.3 percent of the global population used AI tools last year, showing the technology's accelerating adoption worldwide. 

In Taiwan, AI use last year increased to 28.4 percent, from 26.4 percent, overtaking the US (28.3 percent) by a small margin.

Although the US is the world's leading country in AI research and development, the technology's spread in the workforce has been slower than medium and small economies with a higher level of reliance on AI technology and digitization, the institute said. 

The poll identified a divide between developed and developing economies, with AI usage rates of 24.7 percent and 14.1 percent respectively. 

The United Arab Emirates had an AI usage rate of 54 percent, the highest in the world, the institute said. 

Abu Dhabi in 2017 established the Emirati Ministry of State for Artificial Intelligence, Digital Economy and Remote Work Applications, boosting public trust in the technology to 67 percent, compared with 32 percent in the US, it said. 

South Korea last year recorded the biggest increase in AI utilization, moving from 25th to 18th, the institute said. 

The change can be attributed to an increase in algorithmic models' Korean-language capabilities, it said. 

Seoul's passage of an AI basic law and creation of a strategic office to govern the technology and the trend of using ChatGPT to generate anime images resembling Studio Ghibli's style have also played a role in increasing the technology's popularity in the nation, it said. 

China's open-source AI DeepSeek successfully garnered a large number of users in its own territories, along with Russia, Belarus and Iran, it said. 

The main challenge for the industry is spreading the benefits of AI to more regions to bridge the diffusion gap between nations, it added.

After US President Donald Trump on Saturday launched a series of airstrikes in Venezuela and kidnapped Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, concerns have been raised as to whether China would launch a similar “decapitation strike” on Taiwan.

According to a report published  on Thursday by The Reporter, the incident occurred after the flight's Malaysian first officer tried to warn the Taiwanese pilot, surnamed Wen (文), that he was taxiing faster than the speed limit of 30 knots (55.6kph).

A rare copy of the comic book that introduced the world to Superman and also was once stolen from the home of actor Nicolas Cage has been sold for a record US$15 million.

The private deal for Action Comics No. 1 was announced on Friday. It eclipsed the previous record price for a comic book, set in November last year when a copy of Superman No. 1 was sold at auction for US$9.12 million.

The Action Comics sale was negotiated by Manhattan-based Metropolis Collectibles/Comic Connect, which said the comic book's owner and the buyer wished to remain anonymous.

The comic — which sold for US$0.10 when it came out in 1938 — was an anthology of tales about mostly now little-known characters. Over a few panels, it told the origin story of Superman's birth on a dying planet, his journey to Earth and his decision as an adult to “turn his titanic strength into channels that would benefit mankind.”

Its publication marked the beginning of the superhero genre. About 100 copies of Action Comics No. 1 are known to exist, Metropolis Collectibles/Comic Connect president Vincent Zurzolo said.

“This is among the Holy Grail of comic books. Without Superman and his popularity, there would be no Batman or other superhero comic book legends,” Zurzolo said. “It's importance in the comic book community shows with his deal, as it obliterates the previous record.”

The comic book was stolen from Cage's Los Angeles home in 2000, but was recovered in 2011 when it was found by a man who had purchased the contents of a storage locker in southern California. 

It was eventually returned to Cage, who had bought it in 1996 for US$150,000. Six months after it was returned to him, he sold it at auction for US$2.2 million.

Metropolis Collectibles/Comic Connect CEO Stephen Fishler said the theft eventually played a big role in boosting the comic's value.

“During that 11-year period [it was missing], it skyrocketed in value,” Fishler said. “The thief made Nicolas Cage a lot of money by stealing it.”

Fishler compared it to the theft of Mona Lisa, which was stolen from the Louvre in Paris in 1911.

“It was kept under the thief's bed for two years,” Fishler said. “The recovery of the painting made the Mona Lisa go from being just a great Da Vinci painting to a world icon — and that's what Action No. 1 is — an icon of American pop culture.”

North Korea's military accused South Korea of flying drones across the border between the nations this week, yesterday warning that the South would face consequences for its “unpardonable hysteria.”

Seoul quickly denied the accusation, but the development is likely to further dim prospects for its efforts to restore ties with Pyongyang.

North Korean forces used special electronic warfare assets on Sunday to bring down a South Korean drone flying over North Korea's border town.

The drone was equipped with two cameras that filmed unspecified areas, the General Staff of the North Korean People's Army said in a statement.

South Korea infiltrated another drone into North Korean airspace on Sept. 27 last year before it was forced to crash following electronic strikes by North Korea, the statement said, adding that authorities found the drone also contained videos of major objects in North Korea.

“We strongly denounce the hooligans' serial outrageous encroachment upon our sovereignty and undisguised provocative acts against us,” it said. “The ROK military warmongers will be surely forced to pay a dear price for their unpardonable hysteria.”

The ROK is the abbreviation of the Republic of Korea, South Korea's official name.

The South Korean Ministry of National Defense said it did not operate drones on the dates cited by North Korea and South Korean President Lee Jae-myung ordered a thorough investigation of the claim.

Since taking office in June, Lee's government has pushed hard to reopen talks with North Korea and reconcile, but Pyongyang has steadfastly rebuffed his overture.

Pyongyang has shunned talks with Seoul and Washington since North Korean leader Kim Jong-un's high-stakes nuclear diplomacy with US President Donald Trump fell apart in 2019 due to wrangling over international sanctions. 

North Korea has since focused on building more powerful nuclear weapons and declared a hostile “two-state” system on the Korean Peninsula to terminate relations with South Korea.

Drone flights are a source of animosity between the two Koreas, with the rivals accusing each other of flying drones into their respective territories in recent years.

North Korea accused South Korea in October 2024 of flying drones over Pyongyang to drop propaganda leaflets three times.

South Korea's military said it could not confirm whether the North's claim was true.

Tensions rose sharply at the time, as North Korea threatened to respond with force, but neither side took any major action and tensions gradually subsided.

South Korea also has accused North Korea of occasionally flying drones over South Korea. 

In December 2022, South Korea announced it fired warning shots, scrambled fighter jets and flew surveillance drones over North Korea in response to what it called North Korea's first drone flights across the border in five years.

Ukraine and the U.S. are expected to sign an economic deal aimed at spurring Ukraine's postwar recovery at a gathering of world leaders and business leaders at Davos. 

President Volodymyr Zelensky and U.S. President Donald Trump plan to finalize the deal at the World Economic Forum's flagship annual summit, held in Switzerland on Jan. 19–23, the Telegraph reported on Jan 9. 

Backed by European allies, Ukraine has rushed to seize the initiative in peace negotiations after a Russia-U.S. peace plan emerged in November 2025. Crafted without Kyiv's input, the document included Russian maximalist demands that were tantamount to Kyiv's capitulation. 

Ukraine is hoping that economic diplomacy will coax robust security guarantees from the U.S. as part of a renegotiated peace framework. The deal is also likely to appeal to the Trump administration's transactional approach to foreign policy. 

President Zelensky first floated the so-called Economic Prosperity Plan at the end of December, describing it as a package ""for economic recovery, restoring jobs, and bringing life back to Ukraine.""

While Zelensky had originally hoped to sign the deal on a trip to the White House as early as next week, European allies instead suggested Davos was a more appropriate venue in order to not rush proceedings, according to the Telegraph. 

Prone to touting Kremlin talking points, President Trump and other elements of his administration have adopted a tougher stance on Putin in recent weeks.

Ukrainian officials say that the country's recovery and reconstruction will require $800 billion over 10 years — roughly four times its prewar domestic gross product. Ukraine hopes that the prosperity plan will mobilize both public and private investment into the country. 

The deal follows the blueprint of the so-called ""minerals deal,"" a 2025 agreement giving preferential access to U.S. investors through a U.S.–Ukraine reconstruction fund. 

That deal has borne fruit, with Ukraine awarding a lithium project on Jan. 9. to a consortium of investors including TechMet, a mining company backed by the U.S. government.

Russian authorities in Volgograd Oblast reported a drone attack overnight on Jan. 10, that sparked a fire at an oil facility in the region's Oktyabrsky district.

Debris from a downed drone reportedly fell on the territory of an oil depot, igniting a fire at the site. 

Volgograd Oblast Governor Andrey Bocharov said Russian air defense units were responding to what he described as a drone attack targeting the oblast. 

Emergency services, firefighters, and municipal officials were deployed to the scene to contain the blaze. 

Local authorities said a temporary evacuation center was prepared at a nearby school in case residents needed to be evacuated. 

According to preliminary information, there were no casualties.

Ukraine routinely launches deep strikes against military and industrial facilities in Russia, primarily relying on domestically developed drones.

Russia's oil and gas production has continued to come under attack as Kyiv attempts to cripple Moscow's primary source of funding for its war in Ukraine.

Volgograd is located about 354 kilometers (220 miles) from Ukraine's eastern border with Russia and approximately 500 kilometers (310 miles) from Ukrainian-controlled territory near Kramatorsk, Donetsk Oblast.

Iraq is setting up a special government commission to investigate and prevent the recruitment of Iraqi youth to fight in Russia's war against Ukraine, the ""I Want to Live"" project reported. 

Launched in September 2022 by Ukraine's Military Intelligence, the 24-hour ""I Want to Live"" hotline helps Russian soldiers willingly surrender themselves or their units to the Ukrainian army.

Iraq's Charge d'Affaires in Ukraine, Tarek Kazem, told Ukrainian officials that Baghdad is concerned about young Iraqis being drawn into the ranks of the Russian military. 

The commission will work in coordination with Iraq's Supreme Judicial Council and is intended to curb recruitment efforts and address related legal violations.

“The Iraqi side also noted that under the country's Criminal Code, mercenarism carries severe liability up to life imprisonment,” Kazem said. 

Iraqi officials also framed the decision within the country's broader foreign policy stance.

“Iraqi diplomats confirmed the state's firm position on neutrality and non-interference in the internal affairs of any other country, in accordance with the Constitution of the Republic of Iraq,"" the statement read.

In December alone, more than 150 foreign nationals from 25 countries were identified as having been recruited into the Russian army, with about 200 more preparing to join, said Oleh Ivashchenko, the former head of Ukraine's Foreign Intelligence Service.

Financial incentives, simplified access to Russian citizenship, and amnesty for convicted criminals are among the main motivations for foreigners joining Russia's military, Ivashchenko said.

Donald Trump's maneuvers in Venezuela are creating a heightened geopolitical risk for Canadian businesses in the region

Neil Woodyer was on top of the world heading into 2026. The company he runs, Vancouver-based Aris Mining Corp., operates two gold mines in Colombia, and over the past year its share price more than quadrupled thanks to the trifecta of record gold prices, an inclusion in the S&P/TSX Composite Index, which exposed Aris to a wider range of investors, and settling a long-running arbitration case with the Colombian government. By year end, Aris was worth $4.5-billion.

But over the course of 48 hours last weekend, the geopolitical picture grew complicated. After U.S. President Donald Trump captured Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, asserting Mr. Trump's control over the country and its vast oil reserves, he quickly pivoted to Colombia and called its President, Gustavo Petro, “a sick man who likes making cocaine and selling it to the United States.”

“He's not going to be doing it for very long,” Mr. Trump said, suggesting Mr. Petro was on borrowed time. He even floated the idea of a military operation against Colombia, which has yet to shed its reputation as the cocaine capital of the world.

The U.S. President has a history of making threats, only to get distracted by a shiny new object. (Mr. Trump and Mr. Petro have already had a phone call and both men have dialled down their rhetoric since.) Latin Americans also have thick skin after decades of coups and dictatorships, so daily life hasn't ground to a halt. 

Yet Mr. Trump also can't be ignored, considering he is creating uncertainty for the more than 650 million people who live in Latin America and the Caribbean. It's a puzzle for Canadian resource companies that have poured tens of billions of dollars into the region over the past three decades. Miners, in particular, have significant skin in the game. Teck Resources Ltd., First Quantum Minerals Ltd., Agnico Eagle Mines Ltd., Sherritt International Corp., Pan American Silver Corp. and Aris are all heavily invested across the region. 

As foreign companies put money in Latin America over those decades, the hope was that the erratic policies and nationalist campaigns that had plagued the region were a thing of the past. Thanks to sudden new aggression from Mr. Trump, that instability is now roaring back.

There isn't any evidence yet of panic. If anything, some chief executive officers and investors see opportunity. “There are some countries that are too excessively involved in narcotics. People are very suspicious of them when it comes to investment,” Mr. Woodyer said. “If that could be removed, then I think investment would be much easier.”

He also doubts that the U.S. will force a regime change in Colombia. “Trump plays an unusual game. I think people understand that,” he said. “They also understand that there is actually an elected government in the country.”

Bank of Nova Scotia chief executive officer Scott Thomson echoed that sentiment at an investor conference this week. “Longer-term, this is a good thing for the Western Hemisphere. It's a good thing for the U.S. It's a good thing for the Bank of Nova Scotia,” he said, referring to the U.S. reasserting its influence. Scotiabank is a major lender in Latin America, with sizable operations and investments in Mexico, Chile, Peru and Colombia. The bank has also seen the region's nasty side and was forced to cut and run from Argentina in the early 2000s, booking a big loss along the way.

But it's still early days and sustained U.S. pressure for regime change across multiple countries could destabilize the region for years, rather than produce calm.

In a sense, nobody should be surprised that Mr. Trump is suddenly acting with wanton aggression. In fact, it was hiding in plain sight for months. In November, the U.S. released a new National Security Strategy, and it lays out the President's desire for much more influence in Latin America. 

“After years of neglect, the United States will reassert and enforce the Monroe Doctrine to restore American preeminence in the Western Hemisphere, and to protect our homeland and our access to key geographies throughout the region,” the strategy states. The doctrine was then-president James Monroe's vision in 1823 to keep Europe out of Latin America, while agreeing to stay out of European affairs across the Atlantic Ocean.

Mr. Trump has essentially reworked that ethos for the present day, and it is being dubbed the “Donroe Doctrine.” But this time, the focus isn't so much about keeping Europe at bay as it is about China. Restoring American pre-eminence in Latin America puts Mr. Trump on a collision course with the U.S.'s rival superpower, which has invested around US$240-billion in Latin America in energy, mining, manufacturing and technology. China has built and acquired critical infrastructure assets, including a brand new billion-dollar megaport in Peru. 

It's possible the two countries will fight for control by using cheques as carrots, but lately Mr. Trump and his homeland security adviser, Stephen Miller, have shown a proclivity for aggressive tactics. 

The U.S. may demand, for instance, that more Latin American infrastructure assets fall out of China's hands, in the same way it already forced a sale of port facilities in the Panama Canal. But the rival superpower isn't going to roll over. “Ousting China won't be easy for the U.S.,” said Rafael Ch, a senior analyst for Latin America at Signum Global Advisors, a geopolitical consultancy.

Mr. Trump also wants to diminish the influence of other hostile foreign actors such as Hezbollah and Russia, which exert influence in Venezuela and Cuba. And he views Mexican drug cartels as direct threats to the U.S., and his security strategy involves flexing military might to defeat them, “including where necessary the use of lethal force.”

Because Latin America is so vast, spanning Central America, the Caribbean and South America, it is impossible to paint the entire region with the same level of risk. Venezuela, for instance, was unique before Mr. Maduro was captured, and the potential for civil instability in his wake makes it even more of an outlier. 

In the wake of Maduro's capture, Venezuelans have reported an increase in the number of security forces on the streets, including a militia of armed civilians known as 'Colectivos.'THE NEW YORK TIMES/The New York Times

“I don't think you can overestimate how much of a ticking time bomb the situation is right now,” said Rebecca Hanson, a professor with the Center for Latin American Studies at the University of Florida, who has spent years studying Venezuela's rival gangs, armed groups and military leaders, who are all now vying for power. 

There is also an open question of whether Mr. Trump will want anything in return for his influence, and how open he is to sharing Latin America's riches with the region's own people. In Ukraine, he tried to force President Volodymyr Zelensky to sign away rights to the country's critical minerals in return for a security guarantee. In Venezuela, he's already taking oil to the U.S. that was trapped by a naval blockade. 

Oddly enough, the newfound uncertainty is a reminder of why many Latin American countries opened their borders to foreign investment in the first place. Until the 1990s, the region was full of strongmen who favoured nationalist policies. But after some brutal economic downturns, countries such as Mexico, Brazil, Peru and Chile started privatizing state assets and opened their borders to outside investment, giving foreigners the same investment protections as locals. 

It hasn't always been a smooth transition. During Venezuela's Apertura Petrolera, or oil opening, in the 1990s, foreign producers such as Chevron Corp., ConocoPhillips and Exxon Mobil Corp. poured money in, but then Hugo Chávez was elected president in 1999 and he eventually seized control over most of those operations. ConocoPhillips and ExxonMobil ultimately fled, among others. Mr. Chávez also implemented “21st-century socialism,” which emphasized state-run companies. The country's downfall continued under Mr. Maduro, who narrowly won election in 2013, and shored up his support over time by using state assets to enrich military generals and political allies.

But there has been real progress elsewhere, and Canadian companies are in on it. Beyond the miners, Saputo Inc. bought one of Argentina's major dairy processors in 2003 and is now a major dairy products exporter in the region; Brookfield Corp. owns power generation and transmission assets in Brazil and Colombia; and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board has owned a major natural gas pipeline in Peru.

As Latin American countries developed, their standards of living soared. Since 1990, poverty rates have slumped in many countries, and life expectancy has jumped – in Chile it is now 81 years, just shy of 82 years in Canada.

Despite this progress, foreign investors have been realistic. Miners know, for instance, that Peru, which has had six different presidents since 2020, it isn't the same as Canada or Australia. Assets in less stable jurisdictions “typically trade at lower valuations because of the risks associated with the change of government,” said Onno Rutten, a resource portfolio manager with Mackenzie Investments.

A similar logic applies to Cuba, another country on Mr. Trump's hit list. (On Sunday, the President said the communist island “looks like it's ready to fall.”) Sherritt has mined nickel and cobalt there for decades, and the political uncertainty and U.S. sanctions have clouded its fortunes the entire time.

For Mr. Rutten, the Trump factor is simply another ingredient to be added to the risk soup of international investment. “It's not as if we today decide that Mexico is not investable,” he said.

But even in a positive long-term scenario, the transition period could be messy. In Venezuela, there is the risk of lawlessness in the void Mr. Maduro left behind. For all his power, he didn't run the whole country, said Prof. Hanson at the University of Florida. “There are lots of territories the government did not have a handle on,” she said, and there's no telling what the armed groups who run them are going to do now. 

Mr. Maduro, she added, also shored up his support by giving military heads and political allies private contracts. They're not going to simply give these up and lose out on their riches without a fight.

And even though the U.S. is a superpower, any intervention won't be taken lying down. Christopher Ecclestone is a mining strategist at Hallgarten & Co. in London, but he previously lived in Buenos Aires and is extremely skeptical of the idea that Mr. Trump could effectively use military force in Mexico to solve the drug problem.

“If Trump thinks he's going to do anything about cartels, there will be rows of American heads on flyovers over freeways in Mexico,” he said.

If there is more chaos in Latin America, the private sector support Mr. Trump boasts of may not materialize. “Oil companies are going to be very wary,” Mr. Ecclestone said. “They operate at the international level in all sorts of places that are dodgy, but they're used to doing it on a low-profile basis.”

“Trump is pushing them out into the middle of the stage and saying, ‘Okay, you guys are going to be our representatives on the ground,'” he added. “But these big companies are just looking around saying, ‘No, that's not how we operate. … We're not going to be the battering ram.'”

Like everything with Mr. Trump, plans could change. The U.S. Senate has already advanced a motion that would block the President from more military action in Venezuela without congressional approval, and without some sort of military force on the ground, his dream of controlling Venezuelan oil may never come true.

But one thing is very clear: The uncertainty he sows is now spreading across Latin America, and anyone with business ties to the region has to add a new risk premium and more flexibility to their financial models. It's the cost of doing business under the Donroe Doctrine.

“If you can find the right way to operate in the country, as we did in some of the West African countries, then you could go a long way,” Mr. Woodyer said, referencing his past experiences managing operations in Mali and Burkina Faso. ”But you have to adapt to the country, that's the important thing.”

The nation of Bolívar once believed oil would be its new liberator. Instead, it ruined them. Maduro is not the only one to blame

During his childhood in a frontier oil-drilling town amid the rain forests of eastern Venezuela in the 1960s, Miguel Tinker Salas witnessed firsthand what Venezuelans had long been taught: That their country was a special place, not subject to the usual rules of economics or politics.

“During my youth, and for decades after, Venezuela saw itself as an exceptional country. It looked northward; it didn't look southward. Because of its fortune, Venezuela didn't consider itself part of mainstream South America,” Dr. Tinker Salas, now a historian of Venezuelan politics and economics, said in an interview this week.

During decades when the rest of Latin America was struggling out of poverty, Venezuela seemed wealthy and highly developed, its big middle class claiming more ties to Miami-Dade County than to neighbouring Colombia or Brazil. While emigrants fled the poverty and violence of other South American countries, multicultural Venezuela took in hundreds of thousands of immigrants. During decades when the continent was rocked with guerrilla insurrections and far-right dictators, Venezuela enjoyed half a century of democratic stability under moderate, liberal governments. And when neighbouring countries were subject to gunboat diplomacy and Washington-imposed strongman leaders, Venezuelans quietly got along with the Yankees.

That exceptionalism sprang from the sea of low-grade crude oil beneath its territory – the largest reserve in the world, though among the hardest to extract – which provided its governments with an easy revenue stream from the 1930s onward.

Generations of Venezuelans came to believe that oil wealth was their natural gift, much as many believed it no coincidence that it was a Venezuelan, Simón Bolívar, who had liberated South American countries from their colonial masters in the early nineteenth century. Both had seemingly delivered salvation and independence that many Venezuelans came to consider their birthright.

The current confrontation between U.S. President Donald Trump and Venezuela – which culminated in the Jan. 3 capture of authoritarian President Nicolas Maduro and his wife in a military raid, and the imposition of U.S. control over the country and its oil industry, while keeping Mr. Maduro's illegitimate regime in power – is in many ways the culmination of this myth of oil-fueled exceptionalism.

That myth suffered a catastrophic decline in the 2010s as Venezuela became an autocratic and impoverished failed state under Mr. Maduro, and the combination of starvation-level economic ruin and widespread state violence forced eight million Venezuelans to flee. But there were two places where the myth of salvation through Venezuelan heavy crude still held sway: Within President Maduro's inner circle, and in the imagination of President Trump.

“I think the redemptive power of oil – which was very much part of the culture growing up in the 1950s and 1960s, and even the 1970s – is gone,” Dr. Tinker Salas said. “That notion – that oil would be the vehicle by which Venezuela achieved modernity, that it would become a first-world country – that idea is long gone. I don't think people believe oil is going to save Venezuela any more.”

In fact, far from saving it, oil has failed Venezuela. That failure was visible long before Mr. Maduro's rule. Even at Venezuela's peak in the 1970s, when Venezuela's oil exports were bringing in annual revenues of more than USD $3,000 per capita, it was apparent that this wealth and its effects on the currency and balance of payments had destroyed the foundation of any other major industries, such as Venezuela's once formidable agriculture sector. It also made the livelihoods of millions highly vulnerable to oil price swings. 

In 1976, in the midst of what was by most measures his country's greatest moment, Venezuela's former Minister of Hydrocarbons, Juan Pablo Pérez Alfonzo, made a dark and accurate prediction: “Ten years from now, twenty years from now, you will see, oil will bring us ruin,” he told U.S. scholar Terry Lynn Karl, drawing on an old Indigenous term for petroleum to make his most famous pronouncement: “We are drowning in the devil's excrement.”

Yet it was the same Mr. Pérez Alfonzo, two decades earlier, who had given the world the modern concept of the petro-state, and effectively turned Venezuela, for a while, into its most successful exemplar.

In 1958, Venezuela became one of the first reliably democratic South American countries, ending a lengthy U.S.-backed military dictatorship. Venezuela's major centre-left and centre-right parties signed a treaty to hold free and fair elections and honour their results, which was generally respected for the next 55 years.

The first Venezuelan president elected under this pact, the social democrat Rómulo Betancourt, set the pattern for the next half century of leaders: He secured reasonably good relations with the United States and its oil companies, and used the oil revenues to modernize the country with new infrastructure and institutions.

The next year, U.S. President Dwight Eisenhower, fearing that his country's dependence on foreign oil was a security threat, imposed the Mandatory Oil Import Program, designed to ensure that most U.S. fuel was sourced domestically or from Canada or Mexico. Venezuela, at that time the largest oil exporter after the United States, was the main victim of the program.

In 1960, Mr. Pérez responded by inviting the leaders of Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Iraq and Iran to Caracas to sign on to his new idea: The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, an international cartel to control supply of crude oil. 

A decade later, OPEC would rapidly quadruple worldwide oil prices, creating the 1970s oil crisis, serious inflation in many countries – and a time of staggering riches for Venezuelan governments.

The country's annual revenues tripled overnight, and those governments made the fatal error of assuming that this windfall would be permanent. 

They poured money into the economy, driving up the currency; instead of investing in refineries and research and development, they created hundreds of state-owned companies run by cronies, none of them profitable. Venezuela still relied on imports for much of its refined gasoline, and subsidized fuel prices so Venezuelans paid only a penny a litre at the pump. The country's vast arable lands remained mostly undeveloped. Oil revenues provided the majority of government income.

In 1976, the oil industry was nationalized to create the monolithic state firm PDVSA, which remained dependent on U.S. companies for many extraction operations, and encountered many of the problems of big state monopolies: Corruption was estimated to have siphoned off billions.

“Venezuela became a different country when it discovered crude. The agricultural nation became a petro-state,” writes Raul Gallegos, an energy-industry analyst. “Venezuelans became accustomed to generous governments and quick riches. People's ideology, their habits, even their tastes changed.”

In the 1980s, as oil prices slumped and borrowing costs rose, Venezuelan governments maintained their spending levels and ran up huge debts. 

Only in 1989, facing a default, did long-serving President Carlos Andrés Pérez institute reforms – including a doubling of gasoline prices and a steep hike in public-transit fares. These provoked six days of brutal riots known as the Caracazo, seen by many as a turning point in Venezuelan democracy. Four years later, President Andrés was impeached for corruption.

The dark and disillusioned political environment of the 1990s created an opening for revolutionary politics. Lieutenant Colonel Hugo Chávez made his first bid for power with an unsuccessful coup in 1992, then won the presidency in the 1998 election. His “Bolivarian Revolution” – which created a cult of personality casting him as the political heir to Simón Bolívar – promised innovative social programs, health care institutions and housing for the millions in poverty, at least if they were members of his party.

But the Chavistas weren't a break from the Venezuelan myth of oil-fueled exceptionalism – rather, they were its apotheosis.

“Chávez increased the dependence on oil in ways we had not imagined,” says Dr. Tinker Salas. “He helped promote the certification of Venezuela as having the largest oil reserves in the world. He was the one who said that, with oil profits, you could have expansive social programs – medicine, housing, eye surgeries, and so on. He bought into that process, into that belief. So he was as much a product of it as anyone else.”

The oil industry was already nationalized. Mr. Chávez went a step further, turning the PDVSA into an effective branch of his party. He crushed the oil workers' union and fired thousands of employees and managers, replacing them with party loyalists who didn't necessarily have technical skills. (Though at least one U.S. company, Chevron, continued to operate in Venezuela). Facilities deteriorated, driving down output. And then, after 2008, oil prices sank – particularly bad news for Venezuela, whose extra-heavy crude, similar to Alberta oil sands, is only profitable to extract at higher prices.

By the time Mr. Chávez died in 2013 and his minister Nicolas Maduro took his place, Venezuela's economy had entered a death spiral. Oil revenues continued to stagnate; this meant key industries, which had been nationalized by Mr. Chávez in the 2000s, didn't have public funds to operate. Public debt mounted, a monetary crisis leading to a rapid devaluation of the currency and out-of-control inflation; Mr. Maduro responded with price controls which led to goods shortages and mass nationwide riots in 2014. Mounting public debt led to a default in 2017 and further riots. 

In 2018, Mr. Maduro's government barred most opposition figures from running in the national election; in 2024, they ignored what United Nations observers said was a two-thirds majority victory by the opposition. The U.S., Canada and the European Union began applying sanctions in 2015, and Washington had trade embargoes on Venezuelan oil during part of the decade, which were only partially compensated with sales to China and Russia.

Ironically, it was only during this period of economic collapse and isolation in the 2010s that secondary industries, especially agriculture, began to develop in Venezuela. For the first time since 1935, Venezuela is no longer a net importer of food – though food shortages and malnutrition have become chronic. The inability of Venezuelans to feed themselves and make a living, combined with threats of violence and repression from Mr. Maduro's regime, provoked a mass exodus of citizens, beginning with middle-class Venezuelans around 2015 and now encompassing more than a quarter of the population – and there are new fears that Mr. Trump's military action and support for the Chavista regime will provoke further departures.

With President Trump's Jan. 3 military strike and announcement that America will “run” the country, Venezuela suddenly ceased to be the Latin American exception. It has now faced what most other South and Central American countries have at least once in their history: A direct takeover by the United States.

And Mr. Trump's demand this week that Venezuela “turn over” 30 to 50 million barrels of oil to the United States – reportedly at market price – marked a symbolic end to the myth of petroleum salvation, the end of the oil-soaked pathway to modernity. That demand was presented as a sort of bounty, but in fact is what every Venezuelan leader has sought – a return to sales of petroleum to the United States. Only this time, unlike in 1960, nobody in Venezuela really believes it will lead to a middle-class economy.

Today Venezuela accounts for only 1 per cent of world oil exports. Analysts say that could double in a couple years if technology and trade relations return to their norms – still only creating a fraction of Venezuela's twentieth-century revenues. And most industry voices say that a second doubling would take a decade or more and many billions in investments – the sort of long-term play that hardly anyone wants to take on, given deep uncertainty about future petroleum demand, never mind about the future stability of Venezuela.

There is still hope among many of the eight million exiled citizens that Venezuela will once again be a good and safe place to live. Another restoration of democracy, like the one in 1958, is certainly possible in coming years. But it won't be oil riches that bring anyone back. That story, of a pot of black gold beneath the jungle, has now been relegated to the fevered imagination of Donald Trump.

Six movements to help with range of motion and muscle toning

Whether you train in your living room or a posh fitness facility, simplicity is the key. That's why I love dumbbells – they're the perfect tool for training with both power and precision. Dumbbells offer the versatility to safely load major muscle groups, like those in the back and chest, while also providing the isolation needed to sculpt smaller muscles, like the shoulders.

Here are six exercises that hit the entire upper body with just a single pair of dumbbells and a bench, proving that you can build a strong, defined upper body without needing an entire gym's worth of equipment. No bench? No problem. You can use a durable stability ball to support your back, or even take the exercises to the floor. 

What it does: The dumbbell bench press is a compound exercise that builds strength and size in your pectoral (chest) muscles. It also engages the anterior deltoids (front of your shoulders) and your triceps (the back of your arms), two muscle groups that assist with pushing movements.

How to do it: Start seated on the edge of a flat bench, a pair of moderately heavy dumbbells in each hand, the weights resting on your thighs. As you lie back on the bench, bring the weights to your chest. Exhale as you press the weights straight up over your chest until your arms are fully extended. Inhale as you slowly lower the weights, pausing when your elbows are just below the bench. That's one rep. Perform two to three sets of eight to 12 reps.

What to focus on: Control the dumbbells in a smooth and deliberate manner, especially as you lower the weights to your chest. As you press, think of squeezing your armpits together at the top of the motion. Try not to let your elbows flare out too far from your body.

Modification: You can emphasize different parts of the chest by changing the angle of your bench. Setting the bench to a 30-degree incline will engage more of the upper chest; setting the bench to a 30-degree decline will engage more lower chest.

What it does: The dumbbell bench fly is an isolation exercise that builds size and definition in the chest. Unlike the bench press, the fly minimizes involvement from the triceps and deltoids, making it a good option for anyone with elbow or shoulder issues.

How to do it: Lie flat on a bench, holding a light-to-moderate dumbbell in each hand directly above your chest with palms facing each other. Keep a slight, fixed angle at your elbows – this angle must not change. Slowly lower the weights out to the sides in a wide arc until your upper arms are just a bit below parallel to the floor. Think of squeezing your armpits together as you reverse the motion, bringing the weights back up to the starting position. That's one rep. Perform two to three sets of 10 to 15 reps.

What to focus on: A slow, controlled tempo is essential, especially as you lower the weights. You should feel a stretch in your chest at the bottom end of the movement, but be careful not to let your elbows drop too far below the bench, as this can put excessive stress on the shoulder joints. Avoid letting the dumbbells touch at the top.

Modification: As with the dumbbell bench press, you can emphasize different parts of the chest by changing the angle of your bench. 

What it does: Also called the military press, the shoulder press is a compound exercise that builds the front and side heads of the deltoids (shoulders), while also giving the triceps some attention. Because of their unstable nature, dumbbells encourage more involvement from the rotator cuff muscles, leading to improved overhead strength and mobility.

How to do it: Stand tall with your feet shoulder-width apart, a dumbbell in each hand at shoulder height. Your palms can face forward or they can face each other. Squeeze your glutes and brace your abs. While maintaining this rigid core tension, press the weights overhead in a straight path until your arms are fully extended. Slowly return the weights to the starting position, making sure to follow the exact same path of motion. That's one rep. Perform two to three sets of eight to 12 reps.

What to focus on: Imagine your body is a pillar planted in the ground – only your arms should move. If you can't press the weight overhead without arching your back or dipping your hips, use a lighter weight.

Modification: Performing the shoulder press from a seated position will offer more core stability, making the lift a little easier. The seated variation can be done with back support (bench angle set to 90 degrees) or without (bench flat).

What it does: The deltoid (shoulder) is divided into three distinct portions. As the name implies, the lateral raise isolates the outside aspect of the delts. Great for building a wide, tapered upper body, this movement pattern also improves shoulder mobility by strengthening the rotator cuff muscles.

How to do it: Stand tall with a dumbbell in each hand, arms hanging by your sides, palms facing inward. Brace your core and, while maintaining a slight bend at the elbows, slowly lift the dumbbells out to the sides. Continue lifting until your arms are parallel to the floor. Your body should form a “T” shape. Pause for a moment, then slowly lower the dumbbells back to the starting position. That's one rep. Perform two to three sets of 10 to 15 reps.

What to focus on: Light weights are essential for this exercise. If you can't hold the top position for a few seconds, lighten the load. Keep your torso as still as possible – no rocking or swaying. Let your shoulders lift the weights, not your hands. Keeping a slight angle at the elbow will help protect your shoulder joint from excessive strain.

Modification: The seated lateral raise will help to reduce excessive momentum. An even better option, though, is the reverse incline variation: set your bench to around a 75-degree angle and lay down with your chest high up on the bench. You will now be in the perfect position to target the lateral delts – your shoulders will have no choice but to do all the work.

What it does: When it comes to building a strong back, the bent-over row is hard to beat. This compound exercise works just about every major muscle group in the back, along with the biceps and the rear shoulders. Strengthening these “pulling” muscles helps to counteract excessive rounding of the shoulders and spine that often occurs from too much sitting or from focusing too much on “pushing” exercises.

How to do it: Stand with feet shoulder-width apart, holding a dumbbell in each hand with a neutral grip (palms facing each other). Keeping a soft bend in your knees, push your hips back until your torso is at a 45-degree angle to the floor. Let the dumbbells hang down in front of your shins, arms fully extended. Now pull the dumbbells up towards your lower chest or the side of your rib cage. Focus on driving your elbows back and squeezing your shoulder blades together at the top of the movement. Pause for beat, then slowly lower the weights back to the starting position in a controlled manner. That's one rep. Perform two to three sets of eight to 12 reps.

What to focus on: Maintain a neutral spine (avoid rounding your back) and keep your core braced. Resist the urge to yank the weights with your hands and arms; let your back do as much of the work as possible. Allow your shoulder blades to squeeze together and spread apart as your arms move through the range of motion.

Modification: The chest-supported dumbbell row hits all the same muscles but is much easier on the lower back. Set a bench to a low incline, somewhere between a 30- to 45-degree angle. With a pair of dumbbells in your hands, lie facedown on the bench with your chest up near the top of the edge. Now perform a row following the same instructions as above.

What it does: Another isolation exercise for the shoulders, this time targeting the rear aspect. Strengthening this area helps to prevent muscular imbalances that can lead to shoulder injuries and also combats the rounded “hunchback” posture that is all too common in our sedentary world.

How to do it: The setup for this exercise is exactly the same as the bent-over row. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, with a soft bend in your knees, hips pushed back, torso at a 45-degree angle to the floor, arms hanging towards the floor – but this time, maintain a bend in your elbows. Squeeze your shoulder blades together as you slowly lift the dumbbells out to the side in a wide arc, stopping when your upper arms are parallel to the floor. Slowly return the weights to the starting position, following the same path of movement. That's one rep. Perform two to three sets of 10 to 15 reps.

What to focus on: Think about leading the movement with your elbows, as if you're pulling the weights apart rather than just lifting them to the ceiling.

Modification: If the hip hinge position aggravates your lower back, make use of an incline bench. The setup is the same as the chest-supported row described previously, and you'll perform the movement exactly as you would the traditional reverse fly, only with a more stable base.

Mass protests over the dire economic situation in Iran continue to grow across the country. Iranian authorities have imposed an internet blackout in a bid to quell the unrest. DW has more.

This blog has been closed. Thank you for reading. For the latest developments on Saturday, follow our updates.

Below is a roundup of the latest developments on the protests in Iran on Friday, January 9, 2025:

Reza Pahlavi, the son of the last shah of Iran who has been calling Iranians to take to the streets en masse this week, has hailed the protesters who turned out in force on Friday night.

In a post on X, Pahlavi, who lives in exile in the United States, said, ""I am certain that by making our street presence more targeted, and at the same time, by cutting off the financial lifelines, we will completely bring the Islamic Republic and its worn-out and fragile repression apparatus to its knees.""

Pahlavi urged workers from Iran's key economic sectors, particularly transportation, oil, gas and energy, to go on a nationwide strike to ramp up the pressure on Iran's ruling clerics.

He called for more protests on Saturday and Sunday evenings, urging Iranians to ""claim public spaces as your own.

""Our goal is no longer merely to come to the streets; the goal is to prepare for seizing the centers of cities and holding them,"" Pahlavi said, urging people to ""gather the necessary supplies."" 

He concluded his latest message by saying he was preparing to return to the country from exile, ""so that at the time of our national revolution's victory, I can be beside you, the great nation of Iran. I believe that day is very near."" 
 

US President Donald Trump has said Iran is in ""big trouble"" as protests spread, again warning he could order military strikes.

Speaking on Friday, Trump said, ""Iran's in big trouble. It looks to me that the people are taking over certain cities that nobody thought were really possible just a few weeks ago.""

Asked about his message to Iran's leadership, Trump said, ""You better not start shooting because we'll start shooting too.""

""If they start killing people like they have in the past, we will get involved,"" he added.

Trump said any action would stop short of deploying troops. ""That doesn't mean boots on the ground, but it means hitting them very, very hard where it hurts.""

Major street protests have erupted again in Iran's main cities, including the capital, Tehran, and the second most populous city Mashhad.

Videos shared widely on social media showed crowds gathering in central areas of the cities.

People in Tehran's Sadatabad district banged pots and chanted anti-government slogans including ""death to Khamenei"" — a reference to supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, a video verified by the AFP news agency showed. Meanwhile, cars honked in support.

Other footage could not be independently verified and the scale of the protests was initially unclear.

The New York-based Center for Human Rights in Iran said it received credible eyewitness accounts that hospitals in Tehran, Mashhad, and Karaj were overwhelmed with injured demonstrators.

One activist video showed chaotic scenes in Tehran's Saadat Abad district, with fires burning as a voice said a mosque had been set ablaze and protesters chanted ""Death to the dictator.""

Students reported a heavy security presence, with the student newsletter Amirkabir saying special forces armed with Kalashnikov rifles were stationed about every 10 meters along a main road.

Tehran Mayor Alireza Zakani said unrest on Thursday night saw more than 50 banks and several government buildings set on fire. ""More than 30 mosques went up in flames,"" he said in a video distributed by the state-linked Mehr News Agency.

German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, French President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer issued a joint statement condemning the Iranian government's crackdown on demonstrators. 

""We are deeply concerned about reports of violence by Iranian security forces, and strongly condemn the killing of protesters,"" the statement said. 

""The Iranian authorities have the responsibility to protect its own population and must allow freedom of expression and peaceful assembly without fear of reprisal,"" the statement added. ""We urge the Iranian authorities to exercise restraint, to refrain from violence, and to uphold the fundamental rights of Iran's citizens.""      

Iranian Nobel Peace Prize winner Shirin Ebadi said the Iranian security forces may use the ongoing internet shutdown to carry out a ""massacre."" 

Internet monitoring organization Netblocks said the internet shutdown in Iran had been going on for over 24 hours. 

""What make tonight especially dangerous is the deliberate darkness: internet and phone networks pushed toward collapse so that families cannot find their loved ones, journalists cannot document, and the world cannot witness,"" Ebadi posted on Telegram. ""A blackout is not a technical failure in Iran; it is a tactic.""   

Ebadi said that on Thursday night there were reports that at least 400 people in Tehran ""were taken to a single hospital with severe eye injuries caused by pellet gun fire.""

""Even more alarming are reports that security forces attacked hospitals and tried to arrest the wounded,"" Ebadi said. ""A state that hunts the injured in hospital corridors has crossed a line that no society should accept and no world should ignore.

""To Western governments and international institutions: silence is not prudence. It is permission. Your inaction lowers the cost of murder,"" Ebadi said.  

Ebadi, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2003, currently lives in London, but was born in the western Iranian city of Hamadan, where protests have been reported. She has worked to protect human rights in Iran and founded the Defenders of Human Rights Center in Iran.    

The internet is down across most of Iran as the ongoing protests escalate towards a potential turning point in the country's history.

""This is a matter of survival for the regime,"" cybersecurity expert Amir Rashidi told DW.

Read more on what the unrest means for the Iranian government.

The US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA) said at least 62 people have died as anti-government protests continue into their 13th day.   

HRANA said 14 security personnel and 48 protesters had died so far since the start of the protests on December 28.

HRANA also said 2,300 people have been detained in Iran as the government cracks down on the demonstrations.

Meanwhile, another NGO called Iran Human Rights (IHRNGO) said 51 protesters have been killed so far, including nine children. IHRNGO said the demonstrators have been killed not only in Tehran but also the cities of Mashad, Karaj and Hamedan.  

IHRNGO said hundreds more have been injured since the demos began. 

""The nationwide internet shutdown is reminiscent of the bloody crackdown on the November 2019 protests when several hundred protesters were killed,"" IHRNGO Director Mahmood Amiry-Moghaddam said. ""Over the past 13 days, the extent of the government's use of force against protesters has been increasing, and the risk of intensified violence and the widespread killing of protesters after the internet shutdown is very serious.""

Amiry-Moghaddam called on the international community to tell the Iranian government that ""the world will not tolerate the killing of protesters.""    

Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei dismissed anti-regime protests, claiming demonstrators were vandals and saboteurs. The regime has shut down the internet and cut off international calls — and is promising to punish protesters.

DW has spoken to a nurse in Iran who has described how the country's security forces ""behaved with savage brutality"" when they recently stormed a hospital in Ilam province. 

Read more on what happened at the Imam Khomeini Hospital in Ilam, western Iran in our report.

Iran's foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, has accused Israel and the United States of being behind the growing anti-government protests spreading across the country.

Speaking during a visit to Lebanon, Araghchi said ""the Americans and Israelis ... are directly intervening in the protests"" and are ""trying to transform the peaceful protests into divisive and violent ones.""

Araghchi also dismissed the possibility of imminent military action by the US or Israel.

""We believe there is a low possibility of this because their previous attempts were total failures,"" he said.

Israel, with the support of the US, waged a brief war against Iran last summer that American and Israeli officials said was aimed at dismantling Iran's nuclear capabilities.

European officials have voiced their support for the demonstrators in Iran.

In a post on X on Friday, the European Union's foreign policy and security chief Kaja Kallas condemned the response by Iranian security forces as ""disproportionate and heavy-handed.""

""The Iranian people are fighting for their future. By ignoring their rightful demands, the regime shows its true colours,"" she wrote. ""Any violence against peaceful demonstrators is unacceptable. Shutting down the internet while violently suppressing protests exposes a regime afraid of its own people."" 

Kallas' remarks come a day after Germany's foreign minister, Johann Wadephul, also highlighted that ""peacefully expressing their opinion"" is the Iranian people's right.

""I therefore condemn the excessive use of violence against peaceful demonstrators and call on the Iranian authorities to adhere to their international obligations,"" Wadephul said.

The demonstrations began in late December with protests and strikes in the capital, Tehran, over Iran's deep economic woes and plunging currency

Inflation has soared to over 42%, while the rial has plummeted to around 1.7 million per US dollar, an all-time low

The unrest has spread from Tehran to towns and cities across the country

Now in their 12th day, the protests have since grown into broader anti-government demonstrations calling for regime change

The Islamic Republic of Iran has been ruled by a hardline clerical regime since the country's last shah was overthrown in the 1979 revolution

The rallies are the most significant challenge to the Islamic regime since the 'Women, Life, Freedom' movement of 2022 following the death in police custody of Jina Mahsa Amini

The son of Iran's last shah, Reza Pahlavi, has issued another call for fresh protests in Iran on Friday evening.

The exiled crown prince urged his supporters and opponents of the Iranian government to take to the streets.

In a post on his social media channels, Pahlavi said he was ""proud of each and every one of you who took over the streets across Iran on Thursday night.""

""Those of you who were hesitant, join your fellow compatriots on Friday night, and make the crowd even larger so that the regime's repressive power becomes even weaker,"" he said.

Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei insisted on Friday that the clerical regime he leads will ""not back down"" in the face of the growing social unrest and rare public calls for regime change and his ouster.

In his first comments on the protests since they began, a defiant Khamenei called the protesters ""vandals"" and ""saboteurs"" during a speech that was broadcast on Iranian state television.

Khamenei said the demonstrators were ""ruining their own streets to make the president of another country happy,"" in reference to US President Donald Trump, who has threatened strikes on Iran if protesters are killed.

In an apparent reference to June's brief war between Iran and US-supported Israel, Khamenei said Trump's hands were ""stained with the blood of more than a thousand Iranians.""

Khamenei said the ""arrogant"" US president would face a similar fate to that of the shah of Iran, who was overthrown in the 1979 revolution that established the clerical regime.

""Last night in Tehran, a bunch of vandals came and destroyed a building that belongs to them to please the US president,"" Khamenei told his supporters, as men and women in the audience chanted ""Death to America.""

Anti-government protests in Iran continued into Friday morning after calls for demonstrations from the exiled crown prince, Reza Pahlavi.

The demonstrations have persisted after Iran's clerical authorities cut internet and international phone services on Thursday night.

In a post on X, Pahlavi called for Western leaders to pressure the Tehran government to ""restore communication to the Iranian people so that their voice and their will can be heard and seen. Do not let the voices of my courageous compatriots be silenced.""

Videos shared online before communications were shut showed crowds chanting slogans including ""Death to the dictator"" and ""Death to the Islamic Republic"" in Tehran and other cities.

The footage showed buildings and vehicles being set alight as thousands of people marched through the streets of cities across the country.

The Norway-based Iran Human Rights NGO reported that 45 demonstrators have now been killed by Iranian security forces since the unrest began in late December.

Another report by the US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA) said more than 2,200 people have been arrested.

Iranian state media acknowledged the protests on Friday, admitting to casualties without further details, and accused ""terrorist agents"" backed by the United States and Israel of inciting violence.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:dw.com","Australia: State of disaster declared amid Victoria fires","https://www.dw.com/en/australia-fires-wildfires-bushfires-victoria-state-of-disaster-declared/a-75458348","Sat, 10 Jan 2026 07:23:29 GMT","

Thousands of firefighters are working to douse several bush fires that are still raging in Australia's southeast. The fires erupted as a massive heat wave gripped much of the country.

Authorities in the southeastern Australian state of Victoria declared a state of disaster on Saturday amid bush fires that have destroyed homes, caused large-scale power outages and razed huge swaths of bushland.

The fires have been described as the worst to hit the state since the Black Summer blazes of 2019-2020, which burne out 240,000 square kilometers (93,000 square miles) and killed 33 people.

The fires, most of which broke out earlier in the week, have so far burnt across more than 300,000 hectares (741,316 acres) of bushland, authorities said on Saturday.

They said 10 large bushfires were still burning.

Most of the worst blazes have hit sparsely populated rural areas. 

The heavily forested region near the town Longwood, about 112 km (69.6 miles) north of the state capital, Melbourne, has been one of the worst affected, with a bushfire there burning across 150,000 hectares (370,000 acres).

Emergency Management Commissioner Tim Wiebusch said at least 130 structures, including houses, sheds and other buildings had been destroyed across the state.

The fires erupted amid a heat wave in the state, with temperatures surpassing 40 C (104 F).

Hundreds of firefighters from across the country have been called in to help douse the fires, which have also left around 38,000 residences ‌and businesses without power.

The declaration of a state of disaster by state premier Jacinta Allan gives firefighters emergency powers to force evacuations.

""It's all about one thing: protecting Victorian lives,"" she said. ""And it sends one clear message: if you have been told to leave, go.""

""Where we can, fires will be being brought under control,"" Allan said in a televised media conference from Melbourne.

She said three people missing inside one of the state's most dangerous fire regions had been found.

Wiebusch, the emergency management commissioner, said the 10 blazes that are still ongoing would ""continue to burn for days, if not weeks.""

He added that lightning caused by the intense heat from the blazes could cause more fires on Saturday.

Extreme weather events on land and at sea have increased in frequency in Australia, whose land surface researchers say has warmed by an average of 1.51 C since 1910.

The country is still one of the world's largest producers and exporters of gas and coal, two fossil sources of energy that are key drivers of global warming.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:dw.com","Donald Trump's Venezuela attack stuns Europe's far-right","https://www.dw.com/en/donald-trumps-venezuela-attack-stuns-europes-far-right/a-75450701","Sat, 10 Jan 2026 11:49:53 GMT","

Right-wing Trump supporters in Central and Southeastern Europe have operated in a legal gray area for years. After the US's attack on Venezuela, there's a growing awareness that Trump could pose a threat to them, too.

For years, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban has tirelessly praised Donald Trump as a ""man of peace."" He sang the president's praises for brokering the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas. Orban also repeated Trump's claims that, if he had been US president in 2022, Russia would never have started its war against Ukraine. This is all part of Orban's ""peace rhetoric"" — a cornerstone of the Hungarian prime minister's current election campaign.

But, when the ""man of peace"" attacked Venezuela on January 3 and kidnapped its leader, Nicolas Maduro, Orban's channels went silent for hours. In the evening, two terse sentences appeared on the prime minister's Facebook page: There were ""no Hungarian casualties or injuries"" following the military action in Venezuela. Contact had been made with Hungary's embassies in the region to ensure that no Hungarians were in danger.

It was not until two days later, at his regular press conference at the beginning of the year, that Orban found a way to explain Trump's attack on Venezuela. It was about ""eliminating a narco-state,"" he said, adding that this was ""good news"" for Hungary.

Later, the prime minister posted a short video on Facebook showing Hungarian police officers conducting an anti-drug raid. Orban has not yet made any statements relating to the international legality of the US military intervention. 

Trump's attack on Venezuela and Maduro's arrest caught the countries of Central and Southeastern Europe, most of which are considered friendly to the US, off guard — especially those where populists and authoritarian Trump supporters are in power. Although many of the latter rule by circumventing existing legal systems at will, the attack on Venezuela plunged them into tight-lipped silence, with some even expressing horror.

In the weekly magazine HVG, Hungarian journalist Imre Para-Kovacs highlighted how there is a growing risk that other leaders could suffer a similar fate: ""Venezuela is the first country. But even the thick-headed politicians of Europe could quickly find themselves in a New York prison.""

Other observers point out that Russia is now the main threat to Central and Southeastern Europe in Trump's new world order. For Poland, journalist Artur Bartkiewicz sees ""very dark clouds gathering on the horizon,"" as he wrote in the newspaper Rzeczpospolita. Polish security expert Justyna Gotkowska posted on Facebook that Russia will ""put the US and its willingness to defend the borders it has maintained so far to the test.""

Poland's right-wing populist leader, President Karol Nawrocki, meanwhile, has not yet made his position clear. To date, he has said nothing about the US attack on Venezuela. In general, Polish right-wing populists and right-wing extremists have tended to be extremely cautious about responding to the attack.

Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski took a sarcastic tone on X: ""Another day goes by without our nationalists defending Venezuela's national sovereignty. Does it only apply to the European Union, which poses no threat?""

In Czechia, right-wing populist Andrej Babis, who has been back in office as head of government for a few weeks, also reacted cautiously and with a concerned undertone. ""Let's hope that all this will lead to the citizens of Venezuela being able to enjoy freedom and democracy and that they will elect a democratic government.""

Babis, a billionaire, is sometimes referred to as the ""Czech Trump"" and is known for quickly adjusting his stance depending on the political climate or his interests. He has been under investigation for years for subsidy fraud and has also been criticized for conflicts of interest between politics and business activities.

Unlike his Central European allies in Poland, Czechia, and Hungary, Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico reacted to the news. ""International law no longer applies, military power is being used without a UN mandate, and anyone who is big and strong does whatever they want to assert their own interests,"" Fico wrote on Facebook hours after the US attack on Venezuela. ""As prime minister of a small country, I must resolutely reject such a violation of international law. I am curious to see how the EU will respond to the attack on Venezuela, which deserves to be condemned.""

A day later, Fico softened his tone slightly, saying he would do everything in his power to ensure that Slovakia ""never gets involved in military adventures."" 

Unlike Nawrocki, Babis, and Orban, Fico has a rather distant relationship with Trump. The Slovak prime minister is technically a social democrat, but in recent years he has increasingly shifted toward nationalist right-wing populism. He is currently trying to transform Slovakia along the lines of Orban's model. He increasingly claims that any criticism of this agenda is an anti-Slovak conspiracy, especially after an assassination attempt on him in May 2024, which he narrowly survived.

Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic also reacted in shock to the US attack on Venezuela. ""The international legal order and the UN Charter no longer work,"" Vucic said at a meeting of the National Security Council in Belgrade on January 3. ""The world is ruled by the law of force, the law of the strongest, and that is the only principle of modern politics that exists in the world today.""

These words sound cynical coming from the Serbian leader, a nationalist and right-wing populist, and a former information minister under dictator Slobodan Milosevic. He has ruled the largest country in the Western Balkans autocratically for over ten years, often operating on the edge of legality. He has tried to curry favor with Trump in various ways, most recently with a controversial real estate project in Belgrade led by Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner, which ultimately failed. Serbia's oil industry is currently under severe pressure due to US sanctions against the Russian energy sector. In addition, ongoing civil protests have been challenging Vucic's power for over a year.

Overall, Trump's policies reveal how politically isolated Central and Southeastern Europe's nationalist and populist rulers actually are. This is particularly true of Viktor Orban, who for years has been trying to forge an alliance of populists and right-wing extremists — with limited success.

Orban could now also become the biggest victim of the policies of the man he has been flattering vigorously for years. Hungary's prime minister has long boasted that he is the US president's closest ally in Europe. He has pushed the narrative that he, alongside Trump, stand for peace in Europe and the world — while ""warmongers"" are in power in Brussels. This line of argument collapsed overnight with Trump's military intervention.

Orban seems aware how this could rattle parliamentary elections in April. On January 9, he posted a personal letter from Trump (dated from early December) on Facebook. In it, the US president thanks Orban for an invitation to Hungary, but leaves open whether or not, and when, he will come. His post underscores how, for Orban, a visit by Trump during the election campaign would represent a huge boost.

The Trump administration announced that this week it will start forcibly collecting money from student loan debtors.

Truthout is a vital news source and a living history of political struggle. If you think our work is valuable, support us with a donation of any size.

“I like debt for me,” said then-2016 presidential candidate Donald Trump. While defending himself against attacks by Hillary Clinton, Trump referred to himself as the “king of debt,” touting his classic business skills in renegotiating debts for his financial gain. Trump flipped the script on how many think about debt, which has long been held as a deep moral obligation to be paid in every account. Rather, Trump told the truth about debt: that the debtor-creditor relationship, much like the worker-boss relationship, implies financial power on both ends. Today, however, Trump finds himself not as the debtor, but as the creditor, set to use the broad powers of the federal government to push the masses even further into poverty.

For the first time since the onset of COVID-19, the Trump administration is set to garnish U.S. workers' wages for defaulted student loans. The Department of Education has announced that beginning this week it will send at least 1,000 borrowers a notice of intent to garnish wages, sending additional notices every month as it expands its efforts to forcibly collect money from millions of borrowers in default.

This is a cruel, harsh policy that the Trump administration does not have to implement — and it shouldn't.

Most Americans with student loan debt cannot afford to keep up with their payments, which average over $400 a month. With stagnant wages, record-high household debt burdens, the rising cost of college, and ballooning interest, the student debt crisis has only worsened since its inception. Student debt is often difficult to discharge in bankruptcy. Unlike mortgages and every other type of debt, student loan interest can capitalize — forcing debtors to pay interest on the interest on the principal. The Saving on a Valuable Education (SAVE) plan, the most affordable repayment plan ever introduced in the U.S., has been effectively undermined by the Trump administration, causing expected payments to skyrocket. And of course, cancellation plans that grant debtors relief after 10 or 20 years have been bungled or thwarted.

Nearly a third of debtors have reported going without food, medicine, or other necessities to keep up with student loan payments.

Student debt garnishments can take up to 15 percent of a workers' paycheck, enough to push people who need every penny they earn off the edge. Nearly a third of debtors have reported going without food, medicine, or other necessities to keep up with student loan payments, and more than 9 in 10 debtors who have experienced wage garnishment say it caused them financial hardship.

Like much of the story with student loans, garnishment isn't cleanly administered. Employers often incorrectly take much more of a worker's paycheck than what is legally allowed or continue to garnish wages after a loan has been paid in full, leaving borrowers with zero dollars in their bank account and stealing their time by forcing them to navigate a byzantine system to correct these errors. According to public legal filings, nearly 400,000 debtors received refunds totaling more than $185 million for wages illegally garnished in 2021 — refunds that, while borrowers waited for them, caused workers to lose their homes and suffer other financial hardships.

As an organizer with the Debt Collective, the nation's first union of debtors, I know the toll that garnishment can take. For many, it results in harm to their stomachs as they skip meals, harm to their teeth as they avoid the dentist, and harm to their mental health, their kids, their dreams, and even their own lives. One of our members, Jessica Madison, died after the federal government repeatedly illegally garnished money from her account, rendering her unable to see a doctor for her cancer.

Jessica Madison died after the federal government repeatedly illegally garnished money from her account, rendering her unable to see a doctor for her cancer.

It's not just that student debtors fall behind on their payments. The borrowers in default are those who struggle the most in our economy. Nearly 1 million borrowers have loans that have been in continuous default for 20 years or more. Many of the borrowers in default attended a predatory for-profit college that preyed on their desire to get an education before defrauding them. Older borrowers, the fastest-growing population of student debtors who often are on fixed incomes, experience default at higher-than-average rates. Forty percent of student debtors have debt with no degree, often having been unable to complete their college education due to the high price or life-changing circumstances. In other words, garnishing wages for those unable to pay is like trying to draw water from stones.It's not too late for the Trump administration to reverse course on what would be an economically devastating policy for U.S. families and our economy. In June 2025, the Trump administration was set to continue a shameful policy that the Biden administration was set to implement as well: garnish older adults' Social Security checks for defaulted student loans. Instead, the administration decided to (temporarily) reverse course, noting that Social Security provides the last few dollars that many older Americans have.

But debtors shouldn't feel hopeless. The truth is, there are a host of options at debtors' disposal that the Department of Education does not tell borrowers about. Many borrowers who receive default notices will actually be eligible for debt cancellation, whether they know it or not.

Cancellation programs like Total and Permanent Disability, False Certification, and Borrower Defense can provide relief for millions of borrowers who deserve it because their university cheated them or closed down while they were enrolled. Another little-known option that borrowers have is to apply for a hardship exemption if wage garnishment causes them financial hardship. While temporary, and certainly not a solution to the student debt crisis, debtors can apply to pause or reduce forced collections if they are in difficult circumstances.

Forty percent of student debtors have debt with no degree, often having been unable to complete their college education due to the high price or life-changing circumstances.

There is also a solid chance that debtors are in default because of an error caused by their student loan servicer. Servicers, the middle-men of the student debt system, have gross financial incentives to steer borrowers into the wrong payment plan. As borrower balances get transferred from one servicer to another, and as payments and documents and interest accumulates, errors occur. Many borrowers are told the wrong balance, estimated for the wrong payment and told that years of payments don't exist. Though rarely granted by the Department of Education, debtors in forbearance of deferment who went into default due to a loan servicer error can challenge the default status and have it reversed.

Some borrowers — such as those who are incarcerated or facing unique circumstances — could also appeal to the Department of Education and request a “compromise” or “write-off” of student loans to prevent administrative wage garnishment.

It's not just borrowers who should be making noise about the affront that is wage garnishment for student loans. Labor unions should be fighting tooth and nail to ensure that employers protect their workers from illegal forced collections. The more extraction from student debtors, the more there is a drag on our economy — making it harder for businesses to thrive, homes to be purchased, or families to be started.

Student debtors would be wise to fight back at every opportunity, urging the federal government to negotiate student debt on different terms. The Department of Education isn't just our creditor expecting payments, it is also a democratically elected body that is susceptible to political power from below. To accept the terms and conditions of harsh debt collection is to succumb to a broken system run by unqualified billionaires. To fight back against our debts, as Trump put it, is “a smart thing, not a stupid thing.”

As Trump cracks down on political speech, independent media is increasingly necessary.

Amid outrage over the killing of Renee Good, Democratic leaders are declining to use their leverage to fight the agency.

Support justice-driven, accurate and transparent news — make a quick donation to Truthout today! 

The killing of Renee Good by a federal immigration officer in Minneapolis this week came as Republicans in Congress were planning to bring a homeland security spending bill to the House floor, deciding on whether the agency that's surged thousands of armed agents into communities across the country should have increased funding — and progressive lawmakers are demanding that the Democrats use the upcoming government funding deadline to hopefully reduce the department's ability to wreak further havoc.

“I just don't understand how we provide votes for a bill that funds the extent of the depravity,” Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) told CNN Thursday. “I know we can't fix everything in the appropriations bill but we should be looking at ways we can put some commonsense limitations on their ability to bring violence to our cities.”

But the top Democratic leaders, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (NY) and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (NY) both appeared to have little interest in discussing how their party can use the appropriations process as leverage to rein in US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and other Department of Homeland Security (DHS) agencies that have taken part in President Donald Trump's mass deportation operation.

Both Schumer and Jeffries sharply criticized Wednesday's shooting and the Trump administration's insistence that, contrary to mounting video evidence, the ICE agent who shot Good was acting in self-defense.

But Jeffries said Thursday that he was focused on passing other appropriations bills that were ultimately approved by the House.

“We'll figure out the accountability mechanisms at the appropriate time,” Jeffries told reporters.

Democrats refuse to use their power in the appropriations fight to rein in ICE. They don't care if you live or die. https://t.co/gFXhyfzA12

With Congress facing a January 30 deadline for approving government spending packages — and with public disapproval of ICE at an all-time high — several lawmakers have said this week that right now is the “appropriate time” to rein in the agency in any way the Democrats can.

“Statements and letters are not enough, and the appropriations process and the [continuing resolution] expiring January 31 is our opportunity,” Rep. Delia Ramirez (D-Ill.) told Axios.

Schumer also refused to say whether the Democrats would use the appropriations process as leverage to cut funding to ICE, whose budget is set to balloon to $170 billion following the passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act last year. Republicans will need Democratic support to pass a spending bill in the Senate, where 60 votes are required.

oh cool the guy responsible for failing to protect our healthcare by orchestrating a total cave-in to Republicans is also caving in on the murder of americans by gestapo death squads LOVE IT https://t.co/q0xEWNsTOX

The Senate leader said only that he has “lots of problems with ICE” when asked whether he would support abolishing the agency — a proposal whose support has gone up by 20 percentage points among voters in just one year, according to a recent survey. Both leaders also would not commit to slashing the homeland security budget should the Democrats win back majorities in Congress this year.

“It's hard to be an opposition party when you refuse to oppose the blatantly illegal and immoral things being done by the opposition,” said Melanie D'Arrigo, executive director of the Campaign for New York Health.

Sharing a clip of Jeffries' remarks to reporters about the agency's funding, historian Moshik Temkin said that “people need to understand that at its core ICE is a bipartisan project, increasingly funded and normalized over multiple Democratic administrations and congressional majorities, and a few of them (not this guy) are starting to realize how foolish, weak, and misguided they were.”

Reps. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) are among the progressive lawmakers calling on the Democrats to demand reduced funding for ICE — even if it means another government shutdown months after the longest one in US history late last year, which began when the Democrats refused to join the GOP in passing a spending bill that would have allowed Affordable Care Act tax credits to expire. Ultimately, some Senate Democrats caved, and the subsidies lapsed.

“We can't just keep authorizing money for these illegal killers,” Jayapal told Axios. “That's what they are, this rogue force.”

Ocasio-Cortez told the Independent that Democrats should “absolutely” push to cut funding.

“This Congress, this Republican Congress, while they cut a trillion dollars to Americans' healthcare, and they exploded the ICE budget to $170 billion making it one of the largest paramilitary forces in the United States with zero accountability as they shoot US citizens in the head — absolutely,” she said.

On the podcast The Majority Report, Emma Vigeland and Sam Seder called on progressive Democrats to demand Schumer's ouster in light of his refusal to take action to rein in ICE as its violence in American communities escalates.

It's time for Democrats to oust Chuck Schumer from leadership pic.twitter.com/ByWMJ495zb

“Change the news cycle and show that you'll be an opposition party,” said Vigeland. “Call for his ouster.”

Seder added that Schumer “has the ability to wage a fight to prevent the funding of DHS. He has the ability to do that and he doesn't want it. He's running away from any leverage he has, deliberately.”

As Trump erodes press freedoms, the resurgence of Mvskoke Media offers lessons on how to protect independent media.

Truthout is a vital news source and a living history of political struggle. If you think our work is valuable, support us with a donation of any size.

To say press freedoms in the U.S. have taken a knock during the first year of Donald Trump's second term would be a gross understatement. 

Perhaps the most glaring example is the Department of Defense's new policy requiring journalists covering the Pentagon to sign a pledge promising not to use any information that hasn't been explicitly authorized. But the Trump administration's attacks on a free press have also included other tactics, like the effort to dismantle Freedom of Information Act processes across federal departments.

The administration's explicit attempts at censorship work alongside the more insidious ways in which press freedoms are eroded, like the right-wing capture of legacy media institutions and social media platforms by ideologues and billionaires. 

“To be clear, all presidents and all elected officials have always objected to their coverage,” David Loy, legal director with the First Amendment Coalition, a nonpartisan nonprofit that seeks to promote and protect press freedoms, told Truthout. “But the Trump administration has mounted unprecedented attacks on freedom of the press.”

These attacks on press freedoms don't stop at the federal level, however; they are also being inflicted by local governments seeking to undermine already-embattled local media. In Northern California's Shasta County, for example, the region's registrar of voters, Clint Curtis, singled out a local media outlet for exclusion on a press release distribution list after the publication had reported on serious questions about his proposed changes to the electoral process.

It hasn't been all bad news, with the courts remaining a vital bulwark against such attacks. 

In November, Marion County in Kansas agreed to offer an apology and pay a $3 million settlement to end a lawsuit stemming from police raids on the small Marion County Record newsroom and two homes in August of 2023, including that of Record vice president and associate publisher, 98-year-old Joan Meyer, who died of a heart attack the following day. The raids were precipitated by a news tip the Record had received about the driving record of a local restaurant owner who was applying for a liquor license. The police chief alleged incorrectly that the paper had illegally accessed these records. 

In October, a California district court judge sided with the Los Angeles Press Club in striking down an attempt by the Los Angeles Police Department to lessen use-of-force restrictions against journalists covering protests across the city. 

Against this backdrop, the small and scrappy news outlet that serves the Muscogee (Creek) Nation of Oklahoma — the fourth-largest federally recognized tribal nation in the U.S. — offers a stark lesson of what happens when cherished press freedoms are lost altogether, as well as a blueprint for how to restore and protect these important civic checks and balances. 

Just over four years ago, Muscogee voters approved a constitutional amendment guaranteeing the nation's free and independent press, along with a stable funding source for Mvskoke Media, a tribal news agency. It's the first tribal nation to tweak their constitution to cement and secure an independent press in this manner. 

The road to that moment was a long and rocky one, characterized by corruption in high office, a small newsroom hamstrung by government censorship, and a community forced to reckon with the potential loss of a key mechanism for holding their leaders accountable. The story is documented in the roller-coaster 2023 documentary Bad Press by filmmakers Joe Peeler and Rebecca Landsberry-Baker, the latter a member of the Muscogee Nation and a former editor of Mvskoke Media.

“Part of being a good journalism outlet is always advocating for press freedom and the First Amendment rights of our citizens,” said current Mvskoke Media Director Angel Ellis. “And now, we are in better shape to do that advocacy work and deliver the news as we should.”

The nation has been served by a monthly newspaper since 1970, The Mvskoke News, which is now housed at Mvskoke Media, an editorial and creative outlet. The nation's journalists had already built a reputation for holding its leaders' feet to the fire. But not everyone appreciated this public accounting, especially those in charge. 

Ellis broke a major government corruption story in 2011 about the misuse of tribal gaming funds. It won her an award from the Native American Journalists Association, but Ellis's department manager fired her for insubordination shortly after this coverage went to print. 

A few years later, in 2015, the Muscogee Creek Nation passed a law codifying its free press, in the process protecting the work of the journalists Ellis had left behind. At the time, it was one of just a handful of tribal nations to have enacted such a law. Even today, only about 11 of the 574 federally recognized Native American tribes are protected by some sort of press freedom, either by a law written into their books or by a court ruling defending that nation's independent news coverage, said Ellis. 

As easily as a law can get passed, however, it can just as easily be rolled back.

In 2017, Mvskoke Media investigated the tribal council speaker, Lucian Tiger III, for sexual misconduct, in an explosive story that rattled the tribal nation. The newsroom received warnings from within the government that council members wanted to nuke the nation's free press law to gag reporters. The following year, they did. The council voted 7-6 to repeal the law. Tiger was the decisive tie-breaker.

The vote dissolved the paper's editorial board and gave council members the ability to edit and approve stories. Many of Mvskoke Media's reporters — whose digital communications were suddenly open for scrutiny by government leadership — resigned, appalled at being professionally handcuffed. Ellis, who had been rehired in 2018, just before the repeal of the law, was one of the few who stayed on.

In 2019, the tribal council passed another bill somewhat restoring the Mvskoke Media's press independence. But it was far from perfect. And the newsroom's ability to check power remained limited under a law that could once again be revoked. 

In a democracy where governmental authority isn't properly held accountable, elections are among its most corruptible parts. After the tribal attorney general called the elections later that year “fatally flawed,” the Muscogee Creek Nation Supreme Court nullified the results and called for a redo, finding the election board's handling of ballots opened the door to tampering. 

If the wheels of democracy were to spin unimpeded, an independent free press was vital. A constitutional amendment would cement it in stone. Come the elections of 2021, Muscogee citizens got their chance to weigh in. 

In the lead up to the vote, the Mvskoke Media championed the amendment, with Ellis, a heavy-smoking, straight-talking force of nature, its loudest bullhorn. Part of that role required convincing community members of its necessity, some of whom believed Mvskoke Media's journalists were just scared of losing their livelihoods.

“I didn't argue with them. I'm like, ‘Yeah, we're a news organization. And news organizations are run by people who do the job and people need to be paid,'” said Ellis, describing “hundreds and hundreds of hours of outreach speaking candidly one-on-one” with the community. 

“We got really transparent with the public and showed them how we operated and what those funding revenue streams looked like and how they were being administered by our department. It felt risky to expose all of our funding streams and our financials,” said Ellis. “We did that so that they understood exactly how those public funds were being spent.”

Her work paid off in September 2021, when the Muscogee Creek Nation voted for the free press constitutional amendment by a whopping 76 percent. Its passage came with immediate tangible effects, for both Mvskoke Media and the Muscogee Creek Nation as a whole. Since then, “democracy has been carried out in a very cohesive and boring manner,” said Ellis.

The constitutional amendment built a firewall between Mvskoke Media and government officials. So far, it's held firm. “There's nothing threatening coming down the pipeline, but we don't want to rest on our laurels,” said Ellis. 

As part of that proactive approach, Ellis has found the publication independent legal counsel. They've also moved the newsroom's headquarters from one owned by the Creek Nation to an independent location in Tulsa.

“If they ever wanted to come and shut our doors, they could have,” said Ellis, about the impetus behind the location change. 

Another vulnerability came from the fact the newsroom's IT services ran through the tribe. “Are they reading our emails? Were they able to shut us down in terms of our digital electronic functions?” said Ellis, replaying some of her fears. In response, the organization has adopted its own independent IT system. 

All of this has cost money, which brings up another remarkable evolution of Mvskoke Media: funding.

Although the newsroom still receives statutory funding, about 60 percent of its money now comes from merchandizing: think sweatshirts, hoodies, and t-shirts. Mvskoke Media operates two brick-and-mortar gift shops, and while it doesn't have a commercial printing press, it has printers perfectly suited for commercial business cards, flyers, and brochures. 

“In the midst of all of the upheaval we were experiencing, a lot of the citizens were really behind us and we started selling t-shirts that were culturally branded,” said Ellis, explaining the genesis of the idea. “We started out with about $10,000 worth of just t-shirts. We sold them. And everything we sold, we put right back into it. And now, we've grown that into over half a million dollars of revenue.”  

It hasn't all been smooth sailing. Before the free press law was repealed in 2018, the Mvskoke Media newsroom employed 12 people. “As we sit today, I only have five,” said Ellis. “I'm desperately trying to rebuild capacity. When you lose 90 years-worth of experience in a newsroom, it's damn near impossible to replace that.”

Ellis has taken her story to newsrooms large and small around the U.S. imparting words of hard-earned wisdom. One of her pieces of advice is to embrace public criticism. For the Mvskoke Media, a frequent critique, Ellis explained, surrounds the sort of coverage the community can feel paints the tribe in a negative light. 

Another is to eschew the old profit-driven funding model built around advertising. “I've trained some very prestigious newsrooms and my message is always this: ‘Indigenize your process and get away from the capitalism,'” said Ellis, who explained that while the Mvskoke Media still accepts advertising dollars, it's far from a central focus of their revenue-building efforts. “Your bottom line will improve if you live in service to your community.”

“It's always in the nature of power to resist accountability,” said Loy, offering a reminder that press freedoms need eternal vigilance. “Free speech begins at home. It's just as vitally important that free speech and a free press be defended at the grassroots.”

Ellis, meanwhile, can now start to look back on years of frustration, fear, and no small amount of hard work with the sense of a job well done. “To see progress and to be able to provide an example of a success story for our industry that doesn't have a ton of reasons to celebrate right now, it feels very, very good,” she said. “It's very gratifying work.”

            A 42-minute video from a conservative content creator in Minnesota has provided the Trump administration with yet another opportunity to argue that federal safety net programs are plagued by widespread fraud.
    


            Though investigations have yet to show that child care centers in the state were committing fraud to obtain federal funds, as the video claims, the administration has frozen all federal child care payments to Minnesota and rescinded a Biden-era rule that it says increased the risk of fraud. It has also moved to audit the state's Medicaid billing and is freezing funds for other programs in five Democrat-led states as it investigates additional potential fraud.
    


            What's more, the administration will soon name an assistant attorney general tasked with investigating and prosecuting fraud, Vice President JD Vance said Thursday. And the Treasury Department is stepping up its oversight of financial institutions in Minnesota to make sure they are following the rules designed to detect money laundering and other illicit activity — an effort the agency expects to roll out nationally.
    


            While waste, fraud and abuse in the federal government have long been a Republican fixation, President Donald Trump and his officials have taken it to an even higher level — citing fraud in the dispensation of benefits for food stamps, Social Security, Medicaid and Obamacare as reasons to make changes to those programs and others. But some experts argue the administration's claims are inaccurate or exaggerated.
    


            It's difficult to pin down just how pervasive fraud is in federal programs, though many examples exist, including in Minnesota, which has suffered from a series of scandals involving social service programs in recent years.
    


            The Government Accountability Office estimated in 2024 that between $233 billion and $521 billion in federal dollars could be lost annually to fraud in a first-of-its-kind government-wide estimate. That represents 3% to 7% of average federal obligations, though the GAO noted the level of risk can vary substantially by agency and program.
    


            Relatedly, the federal government also made about $162 billion in improper payments across 68 programs in fiscal year 2024, according to the GAO's review of a small subset of federal programs. The vast majority were overpayments, including to dead people or those no longer eligible for the program. But not all improper payments are fraudulent — some may be due to administrative errors.
    


            The Covid-19 pandemic relief programs, including the expanded unemployment benefits, attracted a bevy of criminals who took advantage of the federal government's lowering of its guardrails to get money quickly into the hands of desperate Americans.
    


            “The lesson from the pandemic is how enterprising and opportunistic and coordinated and sophisticated the fraud actors were,” said Linda Miller, founder of the nonprofit Program Integrity Alliance and former senior executive in GAO's fraud unit. Agencies “were supposed to be learning since then.”
    


            While the GAO has long highlighted the vulnerabilities in federal departments and programs, they often aren't addressed. Concerns about costs, outdated technology, administrative burdens and privacy, along with pushback from industries and advocates, can get in the way.
    


            “There is a lack of attention, priority, commitment and decisive action at the highest level of agencies, regardless of administration,” said Seto Bagdoyan, a director on GAO's forensic audits and investigative service team, who believes the fraud estimates are likely understated.
    


            Trump officials have sought to enhance data sharing — both among federal departments and between the federal government and states — to help root out fraud, though such efforts have sparked concerns and lawsuits about privacy and the administration's targeting of immigrants. Some agencies, along with the GOP-led Congress, have also sought to increase verification requirements for federal benefits.
    


            Data matching, along with AI, can help detect and stem fraud, said Matt Weidinger, senior fellow at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. The government should make greater use of technology to make sure the right people are being paid the right amount.
    


            Weidinger also said he's not as concerned about the risks of the government sharing people's personal information considering what criminals already have access to from multiple data breaches in the private sector.
    


            Much of the fraud in federal programs is being perpetrated by transnational crime groups or by providers of services, not by individuals lying to meet eligibility requirements — though that also happens, Miller said.
    


            “There's so little understanding of the participation of these organized crime groups and how good they are,” she said. “So you look at this fraud, and then you want to blame individual people, especially if your world view is these welfare programs shouldn't exist.”
    


            Trump and top agency officials have called out instances of fraud in various programs to highlight the need for change.
    


Food stamps: In a cabinet meeting last month, Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins said her agency found that 186,000 dead people's Social Security numbers were being used to collect Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, benefits. Also, half a million people were receiving benefits more than twice, while “a couple of people” were receiving benefits in six states.
    


            Last year, the US Department of Agriculture requested for the first time that states provide it with their SNAP enrollee records, but a coalition of Democratic states sued and won a preliminary injunction.
    


            In a November letter to state officials, USDA said an estimated average of $24 million a day of federal funds is lost to fraud and errors undetected by states, based on the records it has received from 28 states. It expects the number to increase when additional states provide their data. Stopping such losses could save about $9 billion or more annually, according to the letter.
    


            Some $10.5 billion in improper payments were made in the food stamp program in fiscal year 2024, according to the GAO.
    


            As part of their “big, beautiful bill,” congressional Republicans approved a measure that will penalize states that have high improper payment rates. It's a provision that has gotten the attention of state officials and will force them to improve their payment accuracy and practices, Weidinger said.
    


            “When the states have a financial interest in making sure that benefits are not improperly paid, they're going to pay attention,” he said.
    


            One major fraud problem affecting food stamp recipients is when their benefits are stolen through card skimming. Criminals copy an enrollee's EBT card information by placing a device on a retailer's machine and then making fake cards to purchase groceries using the enrollee's benefits.
    


            Congress passed a law in 2022 temporarily allowing state agencies to use federal funds to replace the stolen benefits, but it expired at the end of 2024.
    


Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act: Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Administrator Mehmet Oz has repeatedly vowed to crack down on fraudulent and improper enrollment in his agency's health programs.
    


            Some 2.8 million people were enrolled in Medicaid or the Children's Health Insurance Program in two or more states or had Medicaid or CHIP coverage and a subsidized Affordable Care Act plan in 2024, the CMS announced in July. The agency said it would work with states to reduce duplicate enrollments.
    


            Also, states made nearly $208 million in payments to Medicaid insurers on behalf of deceased enrollees between July 2021 and the end of June 2022, according to a Department of Health and Human Services' Office of Inspector General report released in December. That included nearly $139 million in federal Medicaid support.
    


            What's more, the GAO's covert testing program found that the federal Affordable Care Act exchange approved coverage for nearly all of GAO's fictitious applicants in 2024 and 2025. CMS paid about $2,350 a month in federal premium subsidies for the four fictitious enrollees in 2024 and more than $10,000 a month for 18 fake applicants in 2025.
    


            GAO also found tens of thousands of Social Security numbers were used to receive more than a year's worth of coverage with premium subsidies in a single year, while it identified nearly 200,000 applications that likely had unauthorized changes by agents and brokers.
    


            Fraud among agents and brokers increased after the Biden administration approved a temporary enhancement to the premium subsidies in 2021. Biden officials later cracked down on agents and brokers, who were seeking to pad their commissions through the unauthorized enrollments and plan switches.
    


            The “big, beautiful bill” requires states to review the Social Security Administration's Master Death File on a quarterly basis and mandates that HHS establish a data sharing system to prevent duplicative Medicaid enrollments, though the provisions don't begin to take effect until 2027.
    


            Much of the fraud in Medicaid, as well as Medicare, stems from providers submitting fraudulent claims.
    


            The Justice Department announced in June that its annual National Health Care Fraud Takedown resulted in criminal charges against 324 defendants, including 96 doctors, nurses and other practitioners involving a record setting $14.6 billion in intended losses. In one operation, a transnational criminal organization bought dozens of medical supply companies and then used the stolen identities of more than 1 million Americans to submit $10.6 billion in fraudulent claims to Medicare for urinary catheters and other medical equipment.
    


Social Security: Soon after Trump took office last January, he and billionaire Elon Musk began implying that millions of dead people were receiving Social Security benefits. Musk's Department of Government Efficiency team at the agency argued they needed access to Social Security's databases to root out this fraud — an effort initially blocked by a federal court but eventually allowed to proceed by the Supreme Court.
    


            The agency also sought to implement various anti-fraud measures, including requiring all those filing benefit applications who could verify their identities through their online “my Social Security” account to visit a field office to complete the claim in person. It also began holding retirement benefit applications for three days to check for fraud. And it prohibited beneficiaries from changing their bank account information through the agency's call center.
    


            Some of the measures were eventually dropped amid an outcry from advocates or little evidence of fraud.
    


Child care: An estimated 3.6% of payments from the Child Care and Development Fund grant program were improper in 2023, according to a report from the Office of Child Care's National Center on Subsidy Innovation and Accountability. About 39% of the improper payments were due to missing or insufficient documentation, including paperwork verifying income, work and residency.
    


            HHS is now freezing child care and certain social assistance payments in several states in the wake of a widening probe into whether providers in Minnesota were collecting federal funds for children that were not attending their centers.
    


            Plus, HHS this week rescinded a 2024 rule that it said weakened oversight and increased the risk of fraud, waste and abuse in the Child Care and Development Fund program. The change allows states to require payment based on verified attendance, rather than enrollment, and to pay providers after care is delivered, rather than at the start of the month.
    


            “Loopholes and fraud diverted that money to bad actors instead,” HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. said in a statement. “Today, we are correcting that failure and returning these funds to the working families they were meant to serve.”
    


            But Ruth Friedman, who directed the Office of Child Care during the Biden administration, said that the Trump administration announced it was reviewing the rule last summer, well before the Minnesota scandal burst into the spotlight. Trump officials signaled to states at the time that the reason for updating the rule was to give states more flexibility and lower their costs.
    


            The rule was designed to help child care centers financially and was in line with private industry practices, she said, noting that nearly half of states — both red and blue — were already basing payment on enrollment.
    


            “The Trump administration's decision to rescind the Biden child care rule has nothing to do with fraud, but it does send a clear message that they aren't interested in helping families support child care, or the small businesses that keep our economies and communities working and help families afford child care,” she said.
    


            HHS did not respond to a request for comment.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+national+news+site:cnn.com","Indiana is no longer the underdog after stomping Alabama and Oregon. They're not taking their foot off the gas just yet","https://www.cnn.com/2026/01/10/sport/football-indiana-college-football-playoff-analysis","Sat, 10 Jan 2026 07:09:50 GMT","


            They stood a few yards apart on the confetti-strewn field, one a redshirt senior offensive lineman who serves as the anchor of his team, the other a sophomore defensive lineman who has yet to log his first career start.
    


            They were discussing the same big thing – the machine that is now the Indiana Hoosiers – but from entirely different perspectives. Yet both said the same word over and over again.
    


            “We're afraid to death of complacency,'' said Pat Coogan, the lineman.
    


            “We never want to be complacent,'' said Daniel Ndukwe, the defensive lineman.
    


            It sounds simple. It is not, of course. No one wants to settle at anything but the human spirit being what it is, invariably it happens. A slight ease off the gas pedal, a millisecond taking the eye off the prize, the need to catch one's breath.
    


            Except, apparently, among the Hoosiers who play football as if not playing football hard would be an unforgivable sin. It is the only way to explain what Indiana is doing right now because otherwise it is too absurd.
    


            The reckoning in college football is not coming via financial windfall, as everyone thought that it might in the NIL era. It is coming via old-school values that tend to seep into the soil in the Midwest. Work hard. Take nothing for granted. Don't settle. Never get complacent.
    


            Indiana is not the “Hoosiers” of film fame. They are not, in fact, the plucky little upstarts going against the big city bad guys. Do not let Fernando Mendoza's earnestness fool you. The Hoosiers are the bad guys, the bullies come to take your pride and your lunch money, albeit politely. As Carter Smith made his way to the celebratory post Peach Bowl stage he yelled, “Excuse me,'”over and over again as he zigged and zagged his way through the media.
    


With a 56-22 dismantling of Oregon, Indiana has romped through this College Football Playoff like nothing the sport has seen in years, if ever. In the last three games, the Hoosiers have held Ohio State to 10 points, Alabama to three and Oregon to 21, though that should come with an asterisk. The Ducks scored their last touchdown with 34 seconds left in the game.
    


            That is, to underscore, Ohio State, Alabama and Oregon. The first two have won 25 national titles between them. Indiana has lost more than 700 games in its history and now is one game away from a national title.
    


            Next up is none other than The U, yet another member of the college football hoi polloi, in a championship game that might require organ donation to get a ticket. The Miami Hurricanes are at home, while the entire state of Indiana – save for some in West Lafayette – is content to abandon their homes to enjoy this unexpectedly stupefying playoff march.
    


College football's calendar chaos runs square into the biggest games of the season



            Lest anyone try to bill this as some sort of morality play, the good boys from Indiana versus the meanies from Miami, it is best to remember that Indiana is the top seed; it's Miami that had to fight its way into the bracket.
    


            “They're complete,'' Oregon coach Dan Lanning said. “There's not a weakness in their game. They run the ball well. They stop the run well. They throw the ball well. They defend the pass well. They're great on special teams. So you see a really complete, well-coached team. They obviously have a ton of belief and deservedly so.''
    


            That is the crux of it; Indiana is good at everything. It's almost like a bait and switch. Worry about the offense and the defense gets you. Fret about finding ways to score and the offense punishes you. And then special teams piles on.
    


            If the offensive line deserved the MVP trophy in the Rose Bowl, the spoils should have gone to the defense here. On the first play from scrimmage in the game, D'Angelo Ponds expected an RPO play from Oregon quarterback Dante Moore. Ponds read Moore's eyes the whole way and when Moore threw the ball to the left side, Ponds jumped the route and sauntered 25 yards into the end zone.
    


            If you want to know what it sounds like when an entire state erupts, listen to the replay. All of Indiana cheered.
    


            The defense then proceeded to gift wrap 14 more points to the offense. It set up first-and-goal from the three after Mario Landino jumped on a Dante Moore fumble in the second quarter, and gave the Hoosiers the ball on the 21 when Ndukwe pancaked Moore to force another fumble. In the fourth quarter and the game well in hand, Ndukwe blocked James Ferguson-Reynolds' punt, handing IU the ball on the seven.
    


            The Hoosiers' defensive stalwartness has not exactly been lost; they are ranked No. 2 in the country but the surgical precision and disarming charm that Mendoza brings to the offense does tend to suck up a lot of the spotlight.
    


            It should not. Indiana's defense is masterful, a plug-and-play roster that is annihilating opponents without its leading tackler. Stephen Daley suffered a freak injury celebrating the Big Ten championship and hasn't played in the playoff.
    


            No matter. The Hoosiers simply find other guys. Ndukwe had all of eight tackles in his first 14 games; he had three against Oregon, including two sacks, the forced fumble and then the blocked punt cherry on top.
    


            “When you have good people and they buy in and they prepare the right way, we have  a lot of those guys,'' head coach Curt Cignetti said “They're high character, smart guys.''
    


            Like Cignetti, defensive coordinator Bryant Haines came up the old-fashioned way, starting at schools most folks don't know exist – Manchester, a Division 3 school in Fort Wayne; Adrian, another D-3 outpost in Michigan. He's now one of the highest paid coordinators in college football, courtesy of a mad scientist approach to defense.
    


            The 40-year-old cooks up ways to make quarterbacks miserable in his sleep, devising schemes that are meant to lure as much as they are intended to confuse. He says he's toned things down as he's gotten older, learned when to take risks and how to better mix up his coverages.
    


            “That's what I call him, a mad scientist,'' said Ndukwe, who grew up in Lithonia, Georgia, and relished the home game. “I'm doing things that I've never done before and you can just see other teams, they get confused. You can feel how it affects them.”'
    


            Moore looked at times overwhelmed, either dancing in the pocket anxiously trying to find an open receiver or swarmed as the pocket collapsed. He is in good company. Ohio State's Justin Sayin threw a pick and was sacked five times, and Alabama's Ty Simpson threw for only 67 yards before leaving with a cracked rib.
    


            “They show you one thing,” Lanning said earlier this week, “and take something else away. They're really good at post-snap movement, which makes it difficult for the quarterback. Their defensive line plays with relentless effort. They're tough to block up front. And then the technique continues to show up.”
    


            Everything at Indiana continues to show up again and again like a metronome of consistency, their mantra so ingrained even the university president sings the same tune.
    


            While booster Mark Cuban barked “Hoo hoo Hoosiers!” outside the locker room with fans, Pamela Whitten unassumedly walked past the locker room before stopping to chat with a pair of reporters.
    


            “This is great, isn't it?” she said. “But we still have one more game.''
    


            No time for complacency.

            The Washington National Opera on Friday announced it is parting ways with the Kennedy Center after more than a decade with the arts institution.
    


            “Today, the Washington National Opera announced its decision to seek an amicable early termination of its affiliation agreement with the Kennedy Center and resume operations as a fully independent nonprofit entity,” the opera said in a statement.
    


            The decoupling marks another high-profile withdrawal since President Donald Trump and his newly installed board of trustees instituted broad thematic and cosmetic changes to the building, including renaming the facility “The Donald J. Trump and The John F. Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts.”
    


            The opera said it plans to “reduce its spring season and relocate performances to new venues.”
    


            A source familiar with the dynamic told CNN the decision to part ways was made by the opera's board and its leadership, and that the decision was not mutual.
    


            A spokesperson for the Kennedy Center said in a statement, “After careful consideration, we have made the difficult decision to part ways with the WNO due to a financially challenging relationship. We believe this represents the best path forward for both organizations and enables us to make responsible choices that support the financial stability and long-term future of the Trump Kennedy Center.”
    


            Kennedy Center president Richard Grenell, who was appointed by Trump's hand-picked board, said on X, “Having an exclusive relationship has been extremely expensive and limiting in choice and variety.”
    


            Grenell added, “Having an exclusive Opera was just not financially smart. And our patrons clearly wanted a refresh.”
    


Inside Trump's transformation of the Kennedy Center



            Since taking the reins at the center, Grenell has cut existing staff, hired political allies and mandated a “break-even policy” for every performance.
    


            The opera said the new policy was a factor in its decision to leave the center.
    


            “The Center's new business model requires productions to be fully funded in advance—a requirement incompatible with opera operations,” the opera said.
    


            Francesca Zambello, the opera's artistic director, said she is “deeply saddened to leave The Kennedy Center.”
    


            “In the coming years, as we explore new venues and new ways of performing, WNO remains committed to its mission and artistic vision,” she said.
    


            The New York Times first reported the opera's departure.
    


            Founded in 1956 as the “Opera Society of Washington,” the group has performed across the district, taking permanent residency in the Kennedy Center in 2011.
    


            The performing arts center has been hit with a string of abrupt cancellations from artists in recent weeks including the jazz group The Cookers and New York City-based dance company Doug Varone and Dancers who canceled their performances after Trump's name was added to the center - a living memorial for assassinated President John F. Kennedy.
    


            The American College Theater Festival voted to suspend its relationship with the Kennedy Center, calling the affiliation “no longer viable” and citing concerns over a misalignment of the group's values.
    


            American banjo player Béla Fleck withdrew his upcoming performance with the National Symphony Orchestra, saying that performing at the center has become “charged and political.”
    


            The Brentano String Quartet, who canceled their February 1 performance at the Kennedy Center, said they will “regretfully forego performing there.”
    


            CNN has reached out to the Kennedy Center on the additional cancellations.
    


            The opera said, “The Board and management of the company wish the Center well in its own future endeavors.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+national+news+site:cnn.com","Cell phone footage raises new questions about ICE agent's tactics before fatal shooting","https://www.cnn.com/2026/01/09/us/ice-shooting-minneapolis-renee-good-cell-phone-invs","Sat, 10 Jan 2026 00:19:00 GMT","


            As he approached Renee Good's vehicle on a Minneapolis street on Wednesday, Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent Jonathan Ross held up his phone camera and recorded video.
    


            Less than a minute later, he was still recording when he drew his weapon and fatally shot Good as she accelerated.
    


            That extraordinary footage, along with video shot by bystanders and a 3D model created by CNN of the confrontation, shows Good and her wife challenging ICE officers – but also raises new questions about Ross's tactics and decision to use deadly force.
    


            The video evidence also appears to undermine elements of the government's narrative of what happened.
    


            CNN's analysis found that while the Department of Homeland Security claims that Good was “blocking” ICE agents, multiple cars – including one driven by Ross – were able to drive around Good's vehicle before the shooting.
    


            Some experts said Ross's decision to use a cell phone to record the encounter, including as he fired the fatal shots, could have hampered his ability to respond effectively in the moment.
    


            “If you're an agent … then you should not be encumbered by anything in your hands,” said  Jonathan Wackrow, a CNN law enforcement analyst. “That's what body worn cameras are for. But they're not wearing body-worn cameras.”
    


            Trump administration officials have defended Ross and said he acted out of self-defense, arguing that the video he recorded makes it clear he had no choice but to shoot. In the wake of the shooting, Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem described the incident as “an act of domestic terrorism.”
    


            “This footage corroborates what DHS has stated all along — that this individual was impeding law enforcement and weaponized her vehicle in an attempt to kill or cause bodily harm to federal law enforcement,” said DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin in a statement. “The officer was in fear of his own life, the lives of his fellow officers and acted in self-defense.”
    


            But a former senior law enforcement official with knowledge of DHS found Ross's actions deeply concerning.
    


            “I would have been livid if one of my folks were doing that,” the former official, who requested to speak anonymously, told CNN. “If you're so concerned about your safety … then why are you tying up your hands and attention on your cell phone? Clearly they didn't feel threatened.”
    


            Despite recording throughout the incident, Ross's cell phone is not trained on Good as the shooting occurs.
    


            Several experts who reviewed the incident remarked how quickly it escalated and how Ross limited his tactical response by positioning himself so close to the front of the vehicle during the confrontation.
    


            Seconds before the shooting, Good and her wife are seen talking to Ross. Their verbal exchanges are not heated. Good can be seen saying to Ross she's “not mad” at him.
    


            “I think the part of it that's the most telling is when he walks by her and she's smiling,” said former Philadelphia police commissioner Charles Ramsey, who is a CNN contributor. “She doesn't look anything like a domestic terrorist. That's for sure … although you don't know what's in her mind.”
    


            ICE doesn't have a definitive policy on recording interactions or incidents on cell phone devices, either personal or government, according to a federal law enforcement source. However, the agency's Office of Professional Responsibility can review a government device upon request. A warrant or subpoena is generally required to access the officers' personal phone.
    


            Ross, a law enforcement veteran with nearly two decades experience in the Border Patrol and ICE, was among a group of agents working in south Minneapolis on Wednesday when they encountered Good, who had stopped her burgundy SUV perpendicular in the road.
    


            Renee Good's wife, Becca Good, said in a statement to MPR News that they had “stopped to support our neighbors.”
    


            “We had whistles. They had guns,” she wrote, an apparent reference to activists who warn of ICE activity by blowing whistles.
    


            Noem and others have described Good as “impeding” ICE activities on Wednesday.
    


            “ICE officers and agents approached the vehicle of the individual in question, who was blocking the officers in with her vehicle. And she had been stalking and impeding their work all throughout the day,” Noem said.
    


            Videos viewed by CNN don't shed light on any potential earlier encounters between Good and ICE agents.
    


            However, while her vehicle was perpendicular to the roadway, the footage does show that several vehicles – including large SUVs – were able to drive around her as she moved back and forth on the street.
    


            That includes a light-colored SUV driven by Ross.
    


            Bystander footage shows that shortly after he got out of his SUV and approached Renee Good's vehicle, Ross pulled out his cell phone and recorded.
    


            His video footage shows him recording Good in the driver's seat. Good appeared calm and had both of her hands visible as she said, “That's fine dude. I'm not mad at you.”
    


            Becca Good, who had been a passenger but got out of the SUV, held her own phone toward Ross and said, “You wanna come at us? You wanna come at us? I say go get yourself some lunch, big boy.”
    


            Another officer in the footage can be heard telling Good, the driver, to “get out of the f****** car.”
    


            Ross was still filming as he walked in front of Good's vehicle. Good first put her vehicle in reverse, and then accelerated forward. “Drive, baby, drive!” Becca Good can be heard yelling from outside the vehicle.
    


            Renee Good appeared to turn the steering wheel away from Ross as she pulled forward. The angle of Ross's phone does not capture any contact between him and the car.
    


            With his cell phone still gripped in one hand and recording, Ross yelled “Woah,” pulled his gun with the other hand and fired into the car – killing Good, whose vehicle continued accelerating down the street before crashing.
    


            Footage shows that as Ross walked down the street in the moments after the shooting, he still had his phone out and his camera app open.
    


            Trump administration officials have shared the footage captured by Ross, arguing that it vindicates his decision to use deadly force.
    


            “Watch this, as hard as it is,” Vice President JD Vance tweeted, with a link to Ross's video. “Many of you have been told this law enforcement officer wasn't hit by a car, wasn't being harassed, and murdered an innocent woman. The reality is that his life was endangered and he fired in self defense.”
    


            Wackrow said there are occasions where it's appropriate for law enforcement officials to use cell phones to document incidents, particularly if they are designated with that job from the outset.
    


            But he said Ross's cell phone activity throughout could be troubling.
    


            “You should not have anything in your hands. You should be ready to address any type of threat or issue that presents itself,” said Wackrow.
    


            The deadly shooting shows why it's important for all agencies to equip their officers with body-worn cameras, Ramsey said.
    


            “In my view, officers, federal, local, state should be wearing body-worn cameras,” he said. “The majority of the time, it actually shows that the officer's actions were justified, as opposed to the other way around.”

ATLANTA (AP) — The very first snap of the Peach Bowl pretty much summed up what kind of night it would be for Oregon.

A pick-6 put Dante Moore and the Ducks in an immediate hole.

That was only the beginning of their misery.

If this had been a heavyweight fight, the refs would've stepped in before the halftime show.

No. 1 Indiana romped into the national championship game with a 56-22 blowout of fifth-seeded Oregon in the College Football Playoff semifinal on Friday, a one-sided affair that was essentially over by the time the Ducks dragged themselves to the locker room — presumably to discuss seating arrangements for the long flight home even with another half still to go.

Needing a near-perfect game, Oregon (13-2) instead gifted the mighty Hoosiers 21 points off three turnovers by Moore, resulting in a 35-7 deficit at the break.

Game over. 

“First things first: The quarterback has to protect the football,” said Moore, who fumbled twice in addition to the interception. “You can't win football games if you're causing turnovers.” 

It was a bitter blow for the Ducks, who had hoped to capture the school's first national championship in football.

Instead, it's the Hoosiers (15-0) moving on to South Florida to face No. 10 seed Miami, dismantling their Big Ten rivals after a much more competitive contest in Eugene during the regular season.

“It was a great Indiana defense,” said Moore, who hasn't decided if we will enter the NFL draft or return to Oregon for another season. “But at the end of the day, we beat ourselves.”




Back on the second Saturday of October, Indiana prevailed over Oregon 30-20 in a game that was tied in the final quarter.

On the second Friday of January, the Hoosiers followed up a 38-3 destruction of Alabama in the Rose Bowl with another postseason rout in the A-T-L, getting a big helping hand from the team in green.

It didn't take long to see how this one would go.

Comping off CFP wins over James Madison and Texas Tech, the Ducks returned the opening kickoff out to the 20. Moore went for a seemingly safe throw on first down, a quick toss in the left flats. But D'Angelo Ponds read the QB's eyes all the way, jumping in front of the intended receiver to make the interception.

He didn't stop running until he was in the end zone, 25 yards later. 

Eleven seconds into the game, it was Indiana 7, Oregon 0.

“You start off with a pick-6, you get in a little bit of a hole, you start to press a little bit,” Oregon coach Dan Lanning said. “That's a damn good Indiana team. You've got to give credit to them, too. It's not just what we need to do. it's what they did do.”

For the second year in a row, Oregon's season ended with a blowout loss in the CFP. A season ago, it was a 41-21 setback to eventual national champion Ohio State in the Rose Bowl quarterfinal. 

“It (stinks) right now, I'm not gonna lie,” senior linebacker Bryce Boettcher said. “This is not how I envisioned it whatsoever.”

To their credit, the Ducks bounced back from that shocking start, driving 75 yards in 14 plays — converting three times on third down — to even the score on Moore's 19-yard scoring strike to Jamari Johnson.

That would be their final highlight in a debacle of a first half. Especially for Moore, who had played such a key role after taking over this season for Dillon Gabriel.

First, it was Heisman Trophy winner Fernando Mendoza reclaiming the lead for good for the Hoosiers with a 75-yard drive of his own.

Then, all Indiana had to do was sit back as Moore and the Ducks self-destructed. 

Backed up deep in his own territory, Moore set for another short throw but struck running back Dierre Hill Jr. in the elbow as he cocked his arm. The ball popped out before the quarterback's arm went forward, with the Hoosiers recovering at the Oregon 3 to set up an easy TD that stretched the lead to 21-7.

A 36-yard touchdown pass from Mendoza to Charlie Becker made it 28-7 late in the second quarter, essentially putting the Ducks in a must-score position before halftime.

Instead, Moore turned it over yet again.

This time, the pigskin popped free on a crushing sack by Daniel Ndukwe. Mario Landino fell on it for the Hoosiers at the Oregon 21. Naturally, they punched it in for another score.

In a final slap in the face, the Ducks came up far short with a 56-yard field goal on the final play of the half.

It never had a chance.

Just like the Ducks.

ATLANTA (AP) — Indiana is headed to the national championship game for the first time in program history. For Hoosiers quarterback Fernando Mendoza, that means a chance to end a fairytale season in the place where his story first began.

It's been a historic season for Indiana, and Mendoza is largely to credit. Indiana won its first Big Ten title since 1967, beat Ohio State for the first time since 1988, earned the No. 1 seed in the College Football Playoff, won its first Rose Bowl, and in December, Mendoza became the program's first Heisman Trophy winner.

After a five touchdown performance and 56-22 rout of Oregon in the Peach Bowl, there's now just one item left on the checklist for Mendoza and the Hoosiers — and that's beating Miami on its home turf in the championship game. 

It will be a homecoming for the quarterback, who grew up in Miami and attended Christopher Columbus High School, roughly 30 minutes south of Hard Rock Stadium.

“I've actually not played in Hard Rock before, but I've been to a lot of games there,” Mendoza said. “It's a very full circle moment. If you open Google Maps and put my address to the University of Miami campus, it's under a mile away.” 

Mendoza said he often biked and walked over, played rec basketball and spent the offseason training on campus, but the Miami and Mendoza connections don't end there. Mendoza's dad was a high school teammate of with Hurricanes coach Mario Cristobal.




The Heisman winner is familiar with the Hurricanes. He played for two years at California, including the program's inaugural season in the ACC in 2024, before transferring to Indiana in 2025. He faced his hometown team once, in October 2024, and threw for 285 yards, two touchdowns and an interception in a 39-38 loss.

He's looking forward to a rematch.

“They did switch defensive coordinators and last year was a very different offensive scheme as well,” Mendoza said. “It was a tight game. Cam Ward, who ended up being the No. 1 overall pick. That game came down to the wire... We lost that one by one point. It was heartbreaking, so just looking for the opportunity to play them again.” 

Mendoza has performed well under bright lights, and the Peach Bowl was no exception. He finished the game completing 17 of 20 passes for 177 yards and five touchdowns. He added 28 rushing yards on six carries and had a passer rating of 241.8.

SEATTLE (AP) — A federal judge on Friday blocked President Donald Trump's administration from enforcing most of his executive order on elections against the vote-by-mail states Washington and Oregon, in the latest blow to Trump's efforts to require documentary proof of citizenship to vote and to require that all ballots be received by Election Day.

U.S. District Judge John H. Chun in Seattle found that those requirements exceeded the president's authority, following similar rulings in a Massachusetts case brought by 19 states and in a Washington, D.C., case by Democratic and civil rights groups.

“Today's ruling is a huge victory for voters in Washington and Oregon, and for the rule of law,” Washington Attorney General Nick Brown said. “The court enforced the long-standing constitutional rule that only States and Congress can regulate elections, not the Election Denier-in-Chief.”

The executive order, issued in March, included new requirements that people provide documentary proof of citizenship when registering to vote and a demand that all mail ballots be received by Election Day. It also put states' federal funding at risk if election officials didn't comply.

Officials in Oregon and Washington, which accept ballots as long as they are postmarked by Election Day, said that could disenfranchise thousands of voters. During the 2024 general election, officials in Washington counted nearly 120,000 ballots that were received after election day but postmarked by it. Oregon officials received nearly 14,000 such ballots.




The judge found that Trump's efforts violated the separation of powers. The Constitution grants Congress and the states the authority to regulate federal elections, he noted.

Oregon and Washington said they sued separately from other states because, as exclusively vote-by-mail states, they faced particular harms from the executive order. 

Trump and other Republicans have promoted the idea that large numbers of people who were not U.S. citizens might be voting. However, voting by noncitizens is rare and, when they are caught, they can face felony charges and deportation.

WASHINGTON (AP) — The Washington National Opera announced Friday that it will move performances away from the Kennedy Center in another high-profile departure following President Donald Trump's takeover of the U.S. capital's leading performing arts venue. 

The opera said it will seek to end its affiliation with the Kennedy Center through an “amicable transition” and will return to operating independently. It cited financial constraints imposed after Trump fired the Kennedy Center's board and installed allies to oversee it. 

The opera will reduce its spring season and move performances to other venues “to ensure fiscal prudence and fulfill its obligations for a balanced budget,” the opera said in a statement. 

The statement did not mention Trump or the decision by the Kennedy Center's new board to add the president's name to the venue. Though Congress still formally calls it the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, the building's exterior and website now refer to it as the Trump Kennedy Center. 

Ric Grenell, a Trump aide serving as the Center's interim executive director, said the venue has spent millions to support the Washington National Opera but it continues to operate at a deficit. 

Parting ways will provide “the flexibility and funds to bring in operas from around the world and across the U.S.,” Grenell wrote on X. 

Artists ranging from “Hamilton” creator Lin-Manuel Miranda to rock star Peter Wolf have called off events at the Kennedy Center since Trump ousted the previous leadership early last year and arranged for himself to head the board of trustees. The December rebranding as the Trump Kennedy Center led to a new wave of cancellations.




Opera officials said the Center's new business model requires productions to be fully funded in advance, which it said is “incompatible with opera operations.” Ticket sales cover only a fraction of production costs, and opera companies rely on grants and donations to make up the difference but can't secure them years in advance, when they're planning productions. 

The business model also doesn't accommodate the opera's model practice of using revenue from popular works to subsidize lower-grossing, lesser-known works, the opera said. 

“I have been proud to be affiliated with a national monument to the human spirit, a place that has long served as an inviting home for our ever-growing family of artists and opera lovers,” said Francesca Zambello, the Washington National Opera's artistic director for the past 14 years.

She vowed to continue offering a variety of shows, “from monumental classics to more contemporary works.”

Late Friday, WNO productions of “Treemonisha,” “The Crucible” and “West Side Story” were still listed on the Kennedy Center website.

A transfer portal spiraling out of control prompted the new regulatory body for college sports to issue a memo to athletic directors Friday night saying it has “serious concerns” about some of the multimillion-dollar contracts being offered to players.

The “reminder” from the College Sports Commission came out about an hour before kickoff of the semifinal between Indiana and Oregon in a College Football Playoff that has shared headlines with news of players signing seven-figure deals to move or, in some cases, stay where they are. 

The CSC reminded the ADs that, according to the rules, third-party deals to use players' name, image and likeness “are evaluated at the time of entry in NIL Go, not before, and each deal is evaluated on its own merits.” 

“Without prejudging any particular deal, the CSC has serious concerns about some of the deal terms being contemplated and the consequences of those deals for the parties involved,” the memo said. 

Under terms of the House settlement that dictated the rules for NIL payments, schools can share revenue with their players directly from a pool of $20.5 million. Third-party deals, often arranged by businesses created to back the schools, are being used as workarounds this so-called salary cap. 

The CSC, through its NIL Go portal, is supposed to evaluate those deals to make sure they are for a valid business purpose and fall within a fair range of compensation for the services being provided.




The CSC did not list examples of unapproved contracts, but college football has seen its share of seven-figure deals luring players to new schools since the transfer portal opened on Jan. 2. 

One high-profile case involved Washington quarterback Demond Williams Jr., who initially sought to enter the transfer portal and turn his back on a reported deal worth $4 million with the Huskies. Legal threats ensued and Williams changed course and stayed at Washington. 

“Making promises of third-party NIL money now and figuring out how to honor those promises later leaves student-athletes vulnerable to deals not being cleared, promises not being able to be kept, and eligibility being placed at risk,” the CSC letter said. 

The commission listed two rules about contracts it evaluates, some of which have been termed “agency agreement” or “services agreement” in what look like attempts to bypass the rules. 

—""The label on the contract does not change the analysis; if an entity is agreeing to pay a student-athlete for their NIL, the agreement must be reported to NIL Go within the reporting deadline.”

—""An NIL agreement or payment with an associated entity or individual ... must include direct activation of the student-athlete's NIL rights.” This is a reference to the practice of “warehousing” NIL rights by paying first, then deciding how to use them later.

An ‘All-Star' panel debates what comes next for the future of Venezuela after the capture of leader Nicolás Maduro on ‘Special Report.' 

For years, the people of Venezuela have endured a nightmare imposed by socialist tyranny. Under President Nicolás Maduro, a once-prosperous nation was reduced to deprivation, violence and despair. Families went hungry. Hospitals ran out of medicine. Millions fled their homes. Venezuela became a case study in how socialism destroys everything it touches. 

That dark chapter has come to an end. 

I have always believed that Maduro must go, and will always be proud of the Trump-Pence administration's work on Venezuela. Together, we led the charge against Maduro, building an unprecedented coalition of over 60 nations and forging bipartisan consensus in Congress to recognize the illegitimacy of the dictator's power.  

We froze regime assets so they could not use the funds to empower their human rights abuses, while providing nearly $1 billion in aid for the Venezuelan people. For the first time since Sept. 11, 2001, we invoked the Western Hemisphere's version of a mutual defense pact to show our commitment to Venezuelan security and freedom.

HE FLED THE ‘HUNGER GAMES' OF CUBA ONLY TO WATCH FREE AMERICANS CHEER COMMUNISM

While we ultimately fell short of our goal to free the people of Venezuela, I was heartened when the president ordered the military raid that captured Maduro and brought him to face justice in the United States. 

Thanks to the leadership of President Donald Trump and the professionalism of the United States armed forces, Maduro is gone. His grip on Venezuela has been broken, and a long-suffering people now have a historic opportunity to reclaim their freedom and rebuild their nation. 

For years, the United States rightly recognized that Maduro was a dictator with no legitimate claim to rule. He stole elections, jailed political opponents, silenced the free press and turned the machinery of government into a criminal enterprise. Trump deserves the gratitude of all who cherish freedom for taking bold and historic action to end this socialist catastrophe.

JAMES CARVILLE SAYS US WOULD BE 'RIPE FOR INVASION' IF TARGETING 'CORRUPT' REGIMES WAS LEGITIMATE

No free people knowingly trades prosperity for poverty. Maduro and his predecessor, Hugo Chávez, forced that decision on Venezuela — replacing free markets with centralized control, seizing the oil industry, commandeering electricity and telecommunications, and crushing private enterprise. The results were as predictable as they were devastating: food shortages, rolling blackouts, massive inflation and the collapse of civil society. 

I witnessed the toll of this tyranny firsthand during a visit to the Venezuelan border in 2019. I met displaced families who had fled with nothing but the clothes on their backs. Their heartbreaking stories left no doubt that Maduro's regime was not merely incompetent, but profoundly cruel. 

That cruelty spilled across Venezuela's borders and spread misery throughout the Western Hemisphere. Millions fled the country, triggering one of the largest refugee crises in modern history. Many eventually made their way to the United States, some illegally and others by exploiting a broken asylum system.

MADURO ARREST SENDS 'CLEAR MESSAGE' TO DRUG CARTELS, ALLIES AND US RIVALS, RETIRED ADMIRAL SAYS

At the same time, Maduro's regime became deeply entangled in international drug trafficking, flooding American communities with poison and destroying countless lives. Even the Biden administration acknowledged the criminal nature of Maduro's rule, placing a multimillion-dollar bounty on his capture for narco-terrorism and corruption. 

Maduro also invited America's adversaries into our own hemisphere. Russia, Iran, Cuba and communist China expanded their influence under his protection, turning Venezuela into a platform for hostile powers operating dangerously close to our shores — a clear and present national security threat to the United States.

Trump deserves the gratitude of all who cherish freedom for taking bold and historic action to end this socialist catastrophe.

The progressive left and some on the populist right have criticized Trump's decision to move forward with absolute resolve in bringing Maduro to justice. The Constitution, however, vests the president with broad authority as commander-in-chief to take limited but decisive action to protect our nation, and he has an obligation to faithfully execute our nation's laws, including the criminal laws that Maduro stands accused of breaking. Presidents of both parties have exercised these authorities for generations. To deny them now would dangerously weaken future presidents and place America at greater risk. 

Nicolás Maduro must answer for his crimes. He must answer for the corruption that hollowed out a nation, for the violence that muzzled dissent, and for the drug trade that took the lives of countless American citizens. Justice long delayed will finally be served.

The Venezuelan people now stand at the threshold of a remarkable opportunity. They deserve a rebirth of freedom — a new Venezuela governed by Venezuelans, rooted in the recognition of God-given liberties, committed to free markets and sustained by free and fair elections. They deserve a future defined not by fear, but by hope. 

Today, thanks to President Trump and the brave men and women of our armed forces, that future is within reach. Libertad can finally be restored. And as freedom takes root again in Venezuela, it will strengthen security and prosperity across our entire hemisphere — just as America has always stood ready to do.

Fox News senior strategic analyst Ret. Gen. Jack Keane says another round of conflict between Israel and Iran down the road is inevitable on ‘Special Report.' 

As anti-regime protests continue to spread across Iran and questions swirl about the durability of Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei's rule, a central question looms: Who would actually take power if the Islamic Republic were to collapse?

The answer, according to regional experts and Iranian opposition figures, is far from clear. It may depend less on ideology than on how the regime falls and whether Iran's security forces fracture or hold.

Behnam Ben Taleblu, a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, said the critical variable is not simply whether the regime collapses, but how it happens.

""Despite being supreme leader, one has to wonder, especially post-war and with limited public appearances, how much Khamenei is directly governing the affairs of the country,"" Ben Taleblu told Fox News Digital. He warned Western governments against backing a cosmetic transition that merely reshuffles elites.

""One thing I fear is the Western temptation for a Maduro-type or Egypt-type model,"" he said, referring to scenarios in which entrenched security forces retain power under new leadership. ""That will only be playing musical chairs at the top and will not provide the Iranian people a pathway for meaningful change.""

Ben Taleblu argued that Iran's opposition faces a logistical challenge more than an ideological one: translating sustained street protests into organized political power before security forces reassert control.

Multiple experts agreed that Iran's future hinges on whether the regime's coercive apparatus, including the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, the Basij militia and the regular military, remains intact.

Ben Taleblu said the key factor is whether segments of the security forces defect, refuse orders or fragment. ""What has to be chipped away is the regime's coercive power,"" he said, adding that a transition would require sustained protests, economic strikes and cracks within security units.

Without that, analysts warn, Iran could see a scenario in which clerical figureheads disappear but real power remains in the hands of armed institutions.

""That's the fear,"" Ben Taleblu said. ""If the state plays musical chairs, the street will not settle for it. That means a bumpier road ahead.""

Some analysts point to historical precedents, including Egypt, where the military stepped in amid unrest. Benny Sabti, an Iran expert at Israel's Institute for National Security Studies, said a military-led transition cannot be ruled out, but would be fraught.

""IRGC generals could theoretically attempt a coup,"" Sabti told Fox News Digital, stressing that Iran's military institutions are not monolithic. He distinguished between the IRGC, which he described as an ideological and asymmetric force, and the regular army, which he said is more professional and nationally oriented.

Sabti highlighted former armed forces chief Habibollah Sayyari as an example of a figure who has voiced limited criticism from within the system. Still, he cautioned that criticism alone does not make a leader and said charisma matters deeply in Iranian politics.

""There is a problem of charisma,"" Sabti said. ""In Iran, it is very important.""

Despite international attention on jailed activists, experts are skeptical that Iran's next political leadership would emerge from within the country's prison system.

Ben Taleblu said decades of repression have made it nearly impossible to cultivate political leadership inside Iran. ""What will come from within are the forces of revolution,"" he said. ""Political leadership has to be built outside.""

Sabti echoed that view, saying freed prisoners would likely become part of a broader system rather than dominant leaders.

""There won't be leaders coming out of prison,"" he said. ""They will be part of a new system, but not charismatic leaders.""

Supporters of Reza Pahlavi say he is emerging as a focal point for opposition mobilization amid escalating unrest. On January 8, Pahlavi publicly called on Iranians to chant at 8 p.m. from their homes or in the streets and his aides said large crowds responded across multiple cities, including Tehran, Mashhad, Isfahan, Ahvaz and Tabriz.

Those close to Pahlavi describe him as advocating a secular, democratic Iran committed to human rights, while rejecting claims that he is seeking to restore the monarchy. Pahlavi has repeatedly said the form of Iran's future system should be decided by the people through a free constitutional process.

""My role is not to tip the scales in favor of either monarchy or republic,"" Pahlavi said. ""I will remain entirely impartial in the process to help ensure that Iranians finally have the right to choose freely.""

Banafsheh Zand, an Iranian-American journalist and editor of the ""Iran So Far Away"" Substack, told Fox News Digital that Pahlavi is the only viable unifying figure capable of guiding a transition, a view strongly contested by others in the diaspora.

""The only person who can see this through is the crown prince,"" Zand said, arguing that any prominent figure inside Iran would be swiftly eliminated by the regime. She dismissed alternative opposition figures as lacking legitimacy inside the country.

Zand said chants supporting Pahlavi during recent protests reflect genuine sentiment, not fabrication, though such claims are difficult to independently verify amid internet shutdowns and state censorship.

Some experts caution that while Pahlavi has visibility in the West and among parts of the Iranian public, he remains a polarizing figure, particularly among Iranians wary of monarchy or external influence.

Another long-standing opposition movement, the Mujahedin-e Khalq, led by Maryam Rajavi, has received backing from some senior U.S. political figures from across the aisle over the years, including former Vice President Mike Pence, former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Rudy Giuliani. 

In a statement to Fox News Digital, Rajavi said change ""will not come from outside Iran, nor will it be delivered by the will of foreign capitals,"" arguing that only an organized, nationwide resistance can overthrow the Islamic Republic.

Rajavi pointed to the People's Mojahedin Organization of Iran and its ""Resistance Units"" as the core force behind recent uprisings, claiming they have played a decisive role in organizing protests and confronting security forces at the cost of heavy casualties. She said the National Council of Resistance of Iran does not seek power for itself, but instead proposes a six-month provisional period following the regime's overthrow, culminating in free elections for a constituent assembly to draft a new constitution for a democratic, secular republic.

""Once established, all authority will be transferred to that Assembly, which will both select the provisional government and draft the constitution of the new republic,"" Rajavi said. ""Gender equality in all its facets, the separation of religion and state, autonomy for Iranian Kurdistan and many other urgent matters have been ratified in detail by the NCRI.""

Rajavi also cited what she described as broad international backing for the NCRI's platform. Critics and analysts interviewed by Fox News Digital dispute the group's level of support inside Iran. Sabti said the MEK's history of violence in the 1980s and its rigid ideology have alienated younger Iranians.

Speaking to an NCRI conference in Washington D.C. last November, Pompeo pushed back against critics, stating ""A thriving, democratic, popular government in Iran—not a theocracy, not a monarchy, not an oppressive regime. This will be a great thing for the entire world. We are waiting for that day, and it will be a blessing to us all.""

Ben Taleblu also warned against Western governments ""playing favorites"" among exiled factions, saying legitimacy must ultimately come from inside Iran.

Despite intense speculation, experts agreed on one point: there is no clear successor waiting in the wings.

""We are not there yet,"" Sabti said, noting that Khamenei remains alive, and the security forces have not fractured.

Ben Taleblu described the moment as a marathon rather than a sprint, warning against simplistic narratives about regime collapse.

Minnesota Private Business Council President Jim Shultz blasts the decline of the state as anti-ICE protests rage and fraud investigations ramp up.

""I hereby plead incompetence and stupidity.""

That's probably the best defense that Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz can offer if he is criminally charged in the shocking multi-billion-dollar taxpayer ripoffs that grow larger by the day.

Given his earned reputation, his excuse of incompetence would be credible.

Nearly every social service program receiving federal dollars was fleeced by fraudsters right under Walz's nose, including child nutrition, daycare, healthcare, housing, and autism aid. Most of the perpetrators were Somalians who comprise a powerful voting block that the governor treasures like gold.

EMMER WARNS WALZ COULD END UP 'IN CUFFS' AMID MINNESOTA FRAUD CLAIMS

Walz was repeatedly warned of the swindles as far back as 2019 when he first took office. Instead of stopping the scams and prosecuting the grifters, he indulged them by establishing a culture of permissible fraud.

Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz has said ""Minnesota is a prosperous state, a well-run state."" (AP Photo/Meg Kinnard)

The scandal has already claimed Walz's political career, forcing him to abandon his bid for re-election. But if he reckoned that quitting would somehow shield him from legal culpability, he is mistaken. There is mounting evidence that Walz was willfully complicit, deliberately refusing to expose or pursue the monumental thefts and, instead, launching aggressive measures to scuttle any legal scrutiny and criminal consequence.  

The governor's own state workers at the Department of Human Services issued a blistering statement blaming him as 100% responsible. Witnesses say he retaliated against whistleblowers and schemed to discredit the well-documented fraud reports.

WALZ'S LONG-RUNNING FRAUD SCANDAL PUTS HARRIS CAMPAIGN JUDGMENT UNDER SCRUTINY

If true, Walz's aberrant actions run dangerously close to criminal behavior involving cover-ups and obstruction.  

Nine federal agencies, including the FBI, are now working to unravel the full breadth and depth of the colossal cons.  The Department of Justice (DOJ) has sent scores of investigators and lawyers to Minnesota to prosecute the web of fraud and deceit.

They will inevitably weigh whether Walz should face criminal charges himself.

MINNESOTA AG BLASTS HOUSE HEARING ON FRAUD SCANDAL IN HIS STATE : 'A LOT OF BULLS--- FROM REPUBLICANS'

There are several federal statutes to consider. 18 USC 371 makes it a crime to conspire with others to defraud the government. At present, there is no known evidence that Walz directly participated in the scams themselves or accepted money.

CHICAGO, ILLINOIS - AUGUST 21: Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison speaks on stage during the third day of the Democratic National Convention at the United Center on August 21, 2024 in Chicago, Illinois. Delegates, politicians, and Democratic Party supporters are in Chicago for the convention, concluding with current Vice President Kamala Harris accepting her party's presidential nomination.

However, if he plotted to cover up the fraud by impairing, obstructing or defeating efforts to bring the fraudsters to justice, the conspiracy statute is applicable. So, too, are the various obstruction of justice laws.

JASON CHAFFETZ: DEMOCRATS TURNED OUR TREASURY INTO A ‘PIGGY BANK FOR FRAUDSTERS'

There is also 18 USC 2, the aiding and abetting statute where accomplices are treated the same as the main perpetrators. That law gave rise to the ""willful blindness doctrine"" recognized by our courts.

An example is a businessman who intentionally ignores or turns a blind eye to his partner's money laundering, resulting in charges against both. Similarly, a public official such as Walz can be indicted for deliberate inaction where he has a clear duty to act.

Finally, 18 USC 3 is relevant whenever concealment occurs. Whoever knows that a crime has been committed but ""hinders apprehension, trial or punishment,"" is guilty of accessory after the fact. That bears a striking resemblance to what Walz is accused of doing.

FROM CONGRESS, TO VP NOMINEE TO DISGRACED FORMER GOVERNOR: A LOOK AT THE RISE AND FALL OF TIM WALZ

All of this invites the question of the governor's motive. If not money, how did he stand to benefit by suppressing the avalanche of fraud? That's the easy part. Votes.

Walz, together with liberal elites and their media handmaidens, have long dismissed the rumors and reports of Somali-engineered fraud as ""racist."" Apparently, in Minnesota it is politically incorrect to enforce the law against immigrants from that particular East African country. It's just not fashionable.

God forbid that putting criminals behind bars might lose electoral support. It's chic to turn the other cheek.

REP TOM EMMER: WALZ OVERSAW BILLIONS IN STOLEN TAXPAYER MONEY — NOW COMES ACCOUNTABILITY

So, the Somalian fraudsters were gifted a ""get-out-of-jail"" free card, courtesy of the governor and his cronies. Walz, in turn, secured their votes. It was a nifty quid pro quo, but with an alternate currency —votes. As protection rackets go, it was slick.   

That cozy arrangement is manifested in a recently uncovered audio recording of a 2021 conversation between Walz's Attorney General Keith Ellison and Somali hustlers who were soon after convicted of scamming millions of dollars. They were heard leaning hard on the AG to ""protect"" them in exchange for support and campaign donations.  

Ellison eagerly capitulated but now denies any wrongdoing. He returned the cash.           

It is too early to know whether a criminal case will be filed against Minnesota's beleaguered governor. The U.S. Attorney and DOJ lawyers are still digging through the mountains of evidence.

However, as noted above, the only tenable defense Walz may be able to conjure up is incompetence and stupidity. It is something that jurors might readily accept.

SCATHING AUDIT REVEALS MORE FRAUD CONCERNS INSIDE TOP MINNESOTA AGENCY WITH FABRICATED DOCUMENTS, 'MISCONDUCT'

After all, ineptitude became the governor's calling card. He infamously conceded his own buffoonery in the 2024 Vice Presidential debate when he called himself a ""knucklehead."" He was such a gaffe factory that the Kamala Harris campaign squirreled him away from the media.     

Walz achieved the impossible. He made his running mate look like a genius. His bizarre on-stage antics were constant fodder for mockery. Baffling verbal goofs, such as boasting that he had ""become friends with school shooters,"" left voters scratching their heads or snickering.  

A series of demonstrable lies about his military service and his peculiar treks to China only compounded the impression of a man who is either a serial fabricator or not right in the head. Maybe both are true.  

And who can forget his epic bungling of the George Floyd riots in 2020. He radicalized the tragic death, thereby ginning up the ensuing violence. As Minneapolis burned, Walz dithered. Afterwards, he blamed the looting and torched buildings on systemic racism.

So, it's not a stretch to imagine that an indictment alleging Walz was wittingly complicit in his state's massive welfare fraud scandal might be met with a defense of ""misfeasance"" (careless or incompetent execution of a lawful duty) to combat the incriminating evidence of ""malfeasance"" (a deliberate, unlawful act).   

It's a distinction that can mean the difference between conviction and acquittal.

Should Walz find himself in the dock sometime soon… don't be surprised if he portrays himself as a blockhead who was intellectually incapable of grasping the obvious.

Minnesota jurors who know the governor would understand completely.

Indiana beat Alabama 38-3 in the Rose Bowl, and advanced to their first CFP Semifinal. Colin Cowherd asks if Indiana is the new powerhouse in CFB, and if the team can win it all. 

The 2025 Indiana Hoosiers became the fifth team in modern college football history to go 15-0. Now they can become the first team of the modern era to ever go 16-0, and only the second of all-time, joining an 1894 Yale team that played with leather helmets. 

With a merciless 56-22 thumping of Oregon in the Peach Bowl, the Hoosiers punched their ticket to their first national championship game appearance in program history. 

Head coach Curt Cignetti has left the college football world breathless with a dramatic turnaround of the Hoosiers program, going from one of the losingest teams in the Big 10 to potentially the most dominant single-season of all time.

Many prominent sports figures took to social media to express their amazement over Indiana's unprecedented dominance during and after their win over Oregon. Indiana Gov. Mike Braun also chimed in. 

Indiana's Heisman Trophy-winning quarterback Fernando Mendoza threw five touchdown passes, improving his case to be the top pick in the upcoming NFL Draft. 

Kaelon Black ran for two touchdowns to lead the Indiana running game.

Oregon (13-2, No. 5 CFP) was doomed by the three first-half turnovers while also being short-handed by the absence of two of their top running backs.

Indiana's defense didn't wait long to make an impact. On Oregon's first snap, cornerback D'Angelo Ponds intercepted Moore's pass intended for Malik Benson and returned the pick 25 yards for a touchdown. Only 11 seconds into the game, the Hoosiers and their defense had already made a statement this would be a long night for Moore and the Oregon offense.

Moore's 19-yard scoring pass to tight end Jamari Johnson tied the game. The remainder of the half belonged to Indiana and its big-play defense.

After Mendoza's 8-yard touchdown pass to Omar Cooper Jr. gave the Hoosiers the lead for good at 14-7, Indiana's defense forced a turnover when Moore fumbled and Indiana recovered at the Oregon 3, setting up Black's scoring run.

Moore lost a second fumble later in the second quarter when hit by Daniel Ndukwe and Mario Landino recovered at the Oregon 21. Mendoza's first scoring pass to Sarratt gave the Hoosiers' the 35-7 lead.

Indiana extended its lead to 42-7 on Mendoza's 13-yard scoring pass to E.J. Williams Jr.

Oregon finally answered. A 70-yard run by Hill set up a 2-yard scoring run by Harris.

The Hoosiers led 35-7 at halftime as the Ducks were held to nine rushing yards on 17 carries. Noah Whittington, who leads Oregon with 829 rushing yards, was held out with an undisclosed injury after Jordon Davison, who had rushed for 667 yards and 15 touchdowns, already was listed as out with a collarbone injury.

Backup running backs, including Jay Harris and Dierre Hill Jr, provided too little help for quarterback Dante Moore. Moore's task against Indiana's stifling defense would have been daunting even with all his weapons.

Following their undefeated regular season, the Hoosiers have only gained momentum in the CFP. Indiana overwhelmed Alabama 38-3 in the Rose Bowl quarterfinal as Mendoza passed for 192 yards and three touchdowns.

Now, the Hoosiers will prepare to face Miami on Jan. 19 in the national championship game at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens. Miami beat Mississippi 31-27 in the Fiesta Bowl semifinal on Thursday night.

Indiana will try to give the Big Ten its third straight national title, following Ohio State and Michigan the last two seasons. Few teams from any conference can compare with the Hoosiers' season-long demonstration of balanced strong play.

The country will be watching to see if this unprecedented team can finish the job and really punch their ticket into the history books.

The Indianapolis Colts are mourning the loss of former standout player Randy McMillan, who died at age 67.

The late running back was selected by the Baltimore Colts in the first round of the 1981 NFL Draft. McMillan quickly captured the hearts of Colts fans with a historic performance in his NFL debut.

In his first pro game against the New England Patriots, McMillan ran for 146 yards, scoring two touchdowns to help lift Baltimore to a 29-28 victory in September 1981. The performance earned Millan his first NFL Offensive Player of the Week honor.

McMillan did not surpass the 100-yard rushing mark in any of the remaining games in his rookie season. He ended the season with 597 rushing yards, racking up another 466 receiving yards. He was with the Colts when the franchise moved from Baltimore to Indianapolis in 1984.

Longtime FBI insider Christopher Raia has been tapped to replace Dan Bongino as the agency's deputy director. 

FBI Director Kash Patel has selected Raia to succeed Bongino after the incumbent deputy director announced last month he would leave the bureau in January, the agency confirmed to the Washington Examiner on Friday evening. 

Bongino's nomination was met with skepticism in Washington, as he had no direct experience working at the FBI. He held years of experience in the Secret Service and was known in conservative circles as the host of a popular political podcast.

Bongino's replacement, Raia, fits the more typical mold of having a career agent in the FBI's No. 2 role, as he holds over two decades of experience at the bureau. Raia is expected to start the job as early as next week, according to the New York Times. 

Raia was most recently appointed assistant director of the New York field office, one of the bureau's most coveted roles, in April. He also served as deputy assistant director in the Counterterrorism Division at Headquarters in 2024, overseeing all international counterterrorism program management for the FBI. Previous roles included long stints in Texas, where Raia “spent 10 years investigating violent crime, gangs, drugs, and white-collar crime.” 

FBI'S HANDLING OF BROWN UNIVERSITY SHOOTING INVESTIGATION RENEWS SCRUTINY OF KASH PATEL

Bongino hasn't disclosed details regarding his resignation less than a year after he started as deputy director. President Donald Trump suggested last month he missed hosting his podcast, saying Bongino “wants to go back to his show.”

“It was a busy last day on the job,” Bongino said in a statement posted to X last week. “Tomorrow I return to civilian life. It's been an incredible year thanks to the leadership and decisiveness of President Trump. It was the honor of a lifetime to work with Director Patel, and to serve you, the American people.” ","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

The conditions that claimed Renee Nicole Good's life will claim the lives of others.

On an unseasonably warm Wednesday in Minneapolis, an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent shot a woman in the face. The many eyes of our everyday panopticon recorded the event from multiple angles. Renee Nicole Good, a 37-year-old mom of three, had stopped her maroon SUV on a snowy street crawling with ICE officials. According to eyewitness reports, multiple men in masks shouted conflicting orders at her: At least one apparently demanded that she exit her vehicle and tried to open her door; another told her to drive away. Good seems to have moved slowly as she tried to maneuver around the agents surrounding her car. After appearing to first wave for someone to move, she reversed slightly and turned away from the agents to continue down the street. An ICE agent who appears to have been knocked back by her front bumper responded by shooting into her vehicle, and shot again as the SUV, suddenly without a conscious driver, careered into a parked car ahead.

Chaos erupted. A man announcing himself as a physician ran toward the scene to attempt to render first aid, but an ICE agent commanded him to step back. When emergency medical workers finally arrived on foot 15 minutes later, they clumsily pulled Good's body from the driver's seat, leaving behind a blood-soaked airbag. Onlookers immediately rose up in anger and outrage, screaming at the agents and shouting profanities. One man howled “Murderer! Murderer!” over and over again. Good's partner, who was near the SUV, can be heard saying through sobs that Good was her wife, that their 6-year-old was at school, and that they were new in town, didn't know anybody, had no one to call for help.

The alarm was warranted. Everyone on the scene had witnessed the crossing of a crucial line in Donald Trump's mass-deportation project: ICE had just killed an American citizen on American soil.

The administration has since declared that the agent “is protected by absolute immunity,” whatever that means, a signal of unconditional support for an agency bloated with thousands of new, heavily armed, and minimally trained recruits, deployed around the country to help achieve Trump's goal of deporting 1 million immigrants a year. Events such as Good's death set the stage for yet more lethal confrontations, which the administration can be trusted to defend with the same specious pretext. What is now overt, in a way that it hadn't been Wednesday morning, is that these agents are at war with the public, and have been for some time.

Read: How ICE lost its guardrails

Good's killing was the culmination of months of roiling tensions between the Department of Homeland Security and the communities it routinely invades to round up people for summary deportation. Having more than doubled ICE's workforce in a matter of months, DHS has been fretting theatrically about how these agents are risking “their lives to remove the worst of the worst.” In retrospect, those concerns now seem like threats—a preemptive excuse for maximum violence.

The Trump administration instantly characterized Good's killing as a matter of self-defense on the part of the ICE agent, whom The Minnesota Star Tribune has identified as Jonathan Ross, a 10-year agency veteran and member of its Special Response Team. Faced with footage of the incident Wednesday night, Trump offered the MAGA gloss on what took place: “She ran him over.” In fact, videos show that Ross remained upright.

In a press conference, DHS Secretary Kristi Noem claimed that Good had been killed because she had been “stalking and impeding” ICE agents all day, and that she had tried to “weaponize her vehicle” in an act of “domestic terrorism.” By Thursday, when White House Spokesperson Karoline Leavitt presented the administration's official line, the story had grown more baroque. Leavitt maintained that Good was part of a “larger, sinister, left-wing movement that has spread across our country, where our brave men and women of federal law enforcement are under organized attack.” Thus Ross, as a target of a dangerous conspiracy, had merely been operating in self-defense.

In the administration's closest brush with acknowledging wrongdoing, J. D. Vance mentioned to reporters Thursday that Ross had been involved in an incident with a vehicle several months ago, during which he was dragged for 100 yards and subsequently required numerous stitches: “So you think maybe he's a little bit sensitive about somebody ramming him with an automobile?” These remarks could reasonably be taken to imply that Ross's decision to shoot Good was an emotional overreaction based on past trauma, but then Vance pivoted: Ross “deserves a debt of gratitude.” In other words, even if Ross did act in error, Good's death still bears the administration's stamp of approval.

Listen: Federal agents are violating the rights of Americans

Protesters in Minneapolis have since flooded the streets in the thousands, and ICE agents have responded by apprehending some, shoving others to the ground, and spraying chemical irritants in their faces.

These incidents have ignited mass demonstrations nationwide, in which protesters have wailed “Shame” and “Murder,” banged drums, screeched from metal whistles, and hoisted signs declaring what is no longer deniable: ICE kills. 

It therefore felt grimly inevitable when the Department of Homeland Security issued a statement Thursday night confirming that Border Patrol officers shot at two people in a targeted traffic stop in Portland, Oregon. “When agents identified themselves to the vehicle occupants,” the post on X read, “the driver weaponized his vehicle and attempted to run over the law enforcement agents.” There is nothing to stop the echoes of this rationale, and we should expect to hear it again and again. There may come a time when the administration dispenses with offering an explanation at all.

Frazzled agents, quick triggers, and a motor-powered protest movement are creating a uniquely dangerous moment on U.S. streets.

Donald Trump has sent waves of federal agents to Democratic-run “sanctuary cities” over the past eight months, depicting the operations like episodes in a roving MAGA reality show. The places targeted by the president tend to become temporary sites of protest—and produce fodder for his meme-driven administration's social-media channels. The relentless pressure on ICE to ramp up deportations has left officers on edge. The neighborhoods they're targeting are on edge too.  Activists have marched in the streets and demonstrated outside federal buildings. But their most effective form of disruption—putting them on the front lines—has been car-powered.

In Los Angeles, Washington, and especially Chicago, loose networks of neighborhood-watch groups have organized to detect federal immigration officers and warn people about their presence. They send out online notices and alerts; in the streets, they trail federal vehicles, honking horns and blowing whistles to form a rolling alarm system. From what I've observed in all three cities, some of those who participate are trained, but many others adopt the tactics improvisationally. They have been shaken by the sight of gun-toting, masked government agents zipping around their neighborhoods in unmarked cars, grabbing people who typically aren't engaged in obvious criminal activity. They want to do something. They've found that their cars and cellphone cameras are their best tools to blunt the crackdown.

The motivations that prompted Renee Nicole Good to stop her Honda SUV in a Minneapolis street on Wednesday remain unclear and will be part of an investigation now led solely by the FBI. Department of Homeland Security officials claim that Good was “stalking” ICE officers who were trying to conduct their duties as part of Trump's immigration crackdown in Minnesota. Good's family insists that she was not an activist and was simply supporting her neighbors after dropping off her 6-year-old son at school. A new video circulated by J. D. Vance and other top officials today, apparently recorded by the ICE officer who killed Good, shows an interaction that goes in a flash from low-level antagonism to lethal.

The video starts like so many others cycling through social media in recent months, with an ordinary residential street transforming into a Trump-era battleground. Once again, ICE officers and protesters square off amid a snarl of vehicles jutting out at odd angles. There is no secure perimeter. Officers outfitted for combat commingle with Americans screaming obscenities and taunting them. These videos often show the feds drawing weapons to force people back. Almost everyone—protesters and officers alike—have phones out, documenting the clashes.

The vehicles inject extra danger and unpredictably into these encounters. In Los Angeles, the first city where Trump sent Border Patrol Commander Gregory Bovino and his agents to ramp up arrests last summer, I watched several times as cars and motorcycles roared into intersections crowded with protesters and police. The vehicles immediately put officers on edge.

In September, Border Patrol agents shot and killed a cook from Mexico, Silverio Villegas González, as he tried to drive away from them near Chicago. The following month, a Border Patrol agent shot Marimar Martinez, a Chicago day-care worker who survived and drove away to seek medical care. Federal agents later charged her with attempting to ram the agent, then dropped the charges when body-camera footage and group-chat logs cast doubt on the government's claims.

Yesterday, a day after Good's killing, Border Patrol agents in Portland, Oregon, shot a husband and wife from Venezuela near a hospital. Rodney Scott, the commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, said that they were members of the Tren de Aragua gang “who attempted to use a vehicle as a weapon against law enforcement.” Portland Police said that the FBI is investigating the incident. As in Minneapolis, local and state officials in Oregon called for federal immigration agents to leave the city.

The clearest sign that the Minneapolis video shared by Vance was filmed by the ICE officer who fired the shots, Jonathan Ross, is that what looks like his reflection appears briefly on the side of the Honda as he circles it. Ross begins filming as he exits his own vehicle. There's a dog in the back seat of the Honda, poking its head out of the window. Ross walks around to the driver's side, and Good says, “That's fine, dude. I'm not mad at you,” in a sarcastic but hardly threatening tone.

Her wife, Becca Good, who is outside the car, begins to taunt Ross as he films the Honda's license plate. “That's okay. We don't change our license plates every morning,” Becca Good says, seeming to suggest that ICE does so to evade activists. She is holding up a phone, apparently also recording. “It'll be the same plate when you come talk to us later,” she says.

Becca Good's tone suddenly becomes harsher. “You want to come at us?” she says. “I say: Go get yourself some lunch, big boy. Go ahead.” As she turns back to the Honda, another federal officer gives Renee Good, who is in the driver's seat, an order. “Get out of the fucking car,” he barks. Ross's recording shows Good turning the steering wheel away from that officer. She appears to be trying to leave. Her wife is pulling the passenger-side handle, apparently trying to get in. The officer at the driver's-side door is pulling on that one. Someone shouts: “Drive!”

Ross's camera is jostled, though it is not clear from the video whether this is from it being dropped or from the vehicle clipping him. He fires, and the car careens down the street. “Fucking bitch,” a voice says, just before the Honda crashes into another car.

Read: Lethal force on a frozen street

The FBI investigation will likely try to answer the question that's been debated online since cellphone videos first began circulating: Was it a bad shoot, a term investigators often use to refer to an unjustified use of force, and possibly a crime? Or did Ross have a reasonable belief that his life was in danger as Good's SUV came toward him? Trump and other officials haven't waited to pass judgment, labeling Good a “terrorist” and Ross a hero.

I asked several current and former ICE officials and experienced officers how they saw the incident. “Murder,” one current official wrote to me. That official said Ross's decision to stand in front of the vehicle will be pivotal to the investigation, and created the biggest threat to his life.

Others defended Ross's decision to fire. “I don't think it was a bad shot,” another official told me. “The officer acted reasonably based on his training and experience and how he perceived the circumstances in that moment.” All spoke on condition of anonymity because they aren't allowed to talk with reporters.

Over the past few days, reporters and analysts have closely studied various recordings of the incident, noting the position of the car as each bullet was fired. But this level of forensic analysis can give the impression that each pull of the trigger was tied to a fully formed decision. Lewis “Von” Kliem—a former police officer with the Virginia-based company Force Science, which trains police officers and soldiers—told me that studies have found that once a person starts firing a weapon at a perceived threat, it takes one-third of a second, on average, for the person to stop shooting. Generally, that is long enough to fire two or three more times, Kliem said. “And that is in a lab setting, where the person is incentivized to stop, not in a complex environment where there's often no clear ‘stop' signal,” he added.

Read: How ICE lost its guardrails 

DHS policy authorizes the use of deadly force on fleeing suspects if an officer has a reasonable belief that the subject's actions pose “a significant threat of death or serious physical harm.” Because Ross was positioned in front of Good's vehicle when he fired the first shot, three ICE officials I spoke with said that they do not expect Ross to face criminal charges.

But two of those officials considered Ross's decision to put himself in Good's path a risky and needlessly aggressive posture, and told me that investigators may fault Ross for it. ICE and DHS officials have not said why Ross stood there.

The DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin doubled down on her characterization of Good as a “domestic terrorist” in an email to me. “If you weaponize a vehicle, a deadly weapon to kill or cause bodily harm to a federal law enforcement officer that is an act of domestic terrorism and will be prosecuted as such,” she wrote. McLaughlin has accused The Minnesota Star Tribune of “doxxing” Ross by naming him. She is ignoring the public's right to know his identity—and the fact that DHS Secretary Kristi Noem first provided the details about Ross that revealed it.

Two former ICE officials and one current official told me that Ross has a reputation among colleagues as an aggressive, gung-ho officer. One described him as “enthusiastic.” Ross was also highly trained, having served on combat patrol in the Iraq War with the Indiana National Guard before joining the Border Patrol. Ross joined ICE in 2015 and works in the agency's fugitive-operations divisions, whose duties often involve vehicle stops, court records show. DHS, which has not named Ross, said that he is a member of ICE's Special Response Team, the agency's highly trained tactical unit.

During one such stop last June, Ross was dragged by a car as he attempted to arrest Roberto Carlos Muñoz-Guatemala, a Mexican man who'd been convicted of sexually abusing a minor but had not been deported. Ross was nearly killed in that incident, Noem said during a press conference soon after Good's death.

Court records tell the fuller story: Ross used a tool to smash Muñoz-Guatemala's driver's-side window and reached inside. The tactic is considered dangerous for officers, and two ICE officials told me that it's generally discouraged because of the risk it poses. Ross attempted to subdue the man using his Taser, but Muñoz-Guatemala was still able to hit the gas and drag Ross at least 100 yards through the street, weaving back and forth to try to shake the officer loose. Ross suffered gashes on his right arm and left hand that required dozens of stitches. Last month, a jury convicted Muñoz-Guatemala of assaulting a federal officer with a deadly weapon.

Before returning to duty, Ross would have needed medical clearance, two ICE officials told me. But he would not have been required to undergo a psychological evaluation, they said, and he would have been able to self-certify his readiness to get back on the job.

One thing that has surprised me and many others about the Minneapolis shooting is how much experience Ross has. He wasn't an anxious new recruit; he's a seasoned officer with a military record and years in the Border Patrol. Noem and other Trump officials keep bringing up that résumé in defending Ross. They also stand by the training standards of the entire ICE workforce, which has quickly grown in the past few months.

Flush with billions in funds from Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act, ICE says that it has hired 12,000 new officers and attorneys in less than a year, more than doubling the size of the agency's workforce. New trainees have been sent through a fast-track course that has cut training time in half. The administration is poised to rapidly expand its immigration crackdown. For the past year, federal agencies have generally focused on one city at a time, with Bovino, the Border Patrol commander, on the ground and directing the operations. In the coming months, these concentrated pushes could occur in several cities at once.

Read: ICE's ‘athletically allergic' recruits

For months, I have received warnings from veteran ICE officials who say that the administration has lowered ICE's standards and is on the verge of sending rookie officers into the streets, where they will face angry protesters and volatile crowds, without necessary training and preparation.

ICE officers are required to undergo yearly use-of-force training, but one official told me that compliance with that mandate has lagged over the past year as the agency has been under intense White House pressure to ramp up deportations and meet hiring goals. One senior ICE official told me that only about half of officers are up-to-date on their use-of-force requirements. I asked Trump officials at ICE and DHS what the current percentage is. They didn't respond.

In scaling back oversight, the administration has emboldened the agency.

This is an edition of The Atlantic Daily, a newsletter that guides you through the biggest stories of the day, helps you discover new ideas, and recommends the best in culture. Sign up for it here.

On Wednesday, an ICE officer shot and killed Renee Nicole Good, a mother of three and a U.S. citizen, in the streets of Minneapolis. She was at least the fourth person killed in a shooting by immigration-enforcement officers during Donald Trump's second term. Two more people were shot yesterday when a Border Patrol officer fired at a car during a traffic stop in Portland, Oregon; their condition remains unknown.

As my colleague Caitlin Dickerson explains in her latest story, the president and his advisers have exerted “overwhelming pressure” on immigration enforcement. The White House has “pumped out rhetoric and imagery that celebrates the merciless, military-style pursuit of deportations,” she writes. “The overall message to employees, including those who carry weapons, is that anything goes.” Last year, the administration effectively kneecapped three offices meant to protect the public from misconduct: the Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties, the Citizenship and Immigration Services Ombudsman, and the Immigration Detention Ombudsman. Good's killing is now being handled exclusively by Kash Patel's FBI, and local investigators have been barred from accessing evidence.

I spoke with Caitlin, who won a Pulitzer Prize in 2023 for her immigration reporting, about how the Trump administration is encouraging aggressive enforcement tactics while also scaling back oversight.

Will Gottsegen: To what extent is ICE no longer subject to some of the guardrails that once helped keep it in check?

Caitlin Dickerson: Formally and informally, since Donald Trump took office, there's been this push away from transparency and accountability, which is exactly what would discourage an officer in a tense situation, under pressure, from using deadly force. We still need to learn a lot more about what happened in Minnesota and Portland, and an investigation needs to transpire, but we do know that ICE officers shot more people last year than in 2023 and 2022. There are clear examples of how training and policy seem to have been violated in some recent incidents. So I think the fact that these three offices for accountability are going away is significant in that it's sending a message to everyday officers that they're not being watched as closely as they once were and, in fact, that the only thing they can really get in trouble for is not being aggressive enough.

There has been a constant churn within leadership. In addition to high-level reassignments, a significant number of field-office directors were replaced with Border Patrol leadership, who are perceived to be more aggressive. Former officials who spent their whole careers at ICE told me that they don't recognize the agency anymore. They said things like: I don't know who these people are anymore, because the standards seem to have changed so much. It's almost become a completely different agency with a completely different mission.

The pressure that ICE officers are facing is unprecedented, and it's not just the pressure to carry out as many deportations as possible—the administration is actually celebrating aggression. When you look at its statements, the memes, and the imagery that it's publishing, all of these signs seem to be encouraging officers to be as aggressive as possible. There's no emphasis on trying to minimize harm.

Will: How does this pressure on ICE officers affect immigration-enforcement operations?

Caitlin: The kinds of conflicts that we're seeing on social media every day are not what typical immigration enforcement looks like at all. It's not what officers are trained to do, and it's not what veteran officers have any experience with. Normally, with law enforcement, the goal is to have things happen as discreetly as possible: without tension, without conflict, without getting a lot of attention and disrupting the general public. And immigration enforcement looks the opposite of that right now. In the case of Minneapolis and Portland, law-enforcement training 101 says, Do not shoot into a moving vehicle. A retired officer I spoke with today told me what he would have done in that situation: “I'm going to follow them until I get them somewhere where I can control the environment.” Not taking those kinds of precautions could be dangerous for the officers and for people nearby.

Will: Minnesota Governor Tim Walz has said that he's skeptical that the FBI is going to be able to do an impartial investigation, because multiple federal officials have already adopted the party line that Renee Good got herself killed. The vice president blamed “left-wing ideology” for her death. Do you anticipate that the investigation will be affected by political interests?

Caitlin: It's going to depend on who's put on the investigation but also which high-level officials get to review and sign off on any assessments before they're made permanent and public. What we do know is that there are numerous examples of law-enforcement work being co-opted for political purposes under this administration, specifically under Kash Patel's FBI, which has at times prioritized going after the president's enemies and critics despite what the facts show. I think there is cause for concern, making it even more important that certain oversight offices have been eliminated from within the Department of Homeland Security. Historically, the FBI may have done the first investigation, but ideally an objective inspector general would have come in next, followed by the ICE Office of Professional Responsibility and then the Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties. There were lots of layers to get to the truth and to mitigate any political bias. And those extra layers are effectively gone now.

How Sweetgreen Became Millennial Cringe

By Ellen Cushing

Last spring, Sweetgreen did something shocking, at least insofar as the menu adjustments of a fast-casual salad chain can be described that way: It added fries. In interviews, the company's “chief concept officer,” Nicolas Jammet, paid lip service to “reevaluating and redefining fast food,” but I suspect that Sweetgreen was also “reevaluating and redefining” how to make money in a world that appeared poised to move on from buying what the company was trying to sell.

In the first two months of last year, Sweetgreen's stock price had declined more than 30 percent …

This is remarkable because, for a golden decade or so, Sweetgreen was the future of lunch. Americans, especially ones who were youngish and worked on computers, were toting green paper bags around coastal cities (and later, smaller towns and non-coastal cities) en masse. Silicon Valley was injecting capital into a restaurant as though it were a software start-up.

The Trump adviser's assertions about the “real world” reflect a deep misunderstanding of Thomas Hobbes's dog-eat-dog worldview.

If you want to know a political leader's governing philosophy, you could cut through a lot of bluster by just asking them who their guy is: John Locke or Thomas Hobbes? Anyone who's taken Poli Sci 101 will understand what this means. The 17th-century philosophers each offered a picture of human nature in its rawest form, and they came to different conclusions. Locke, whose ideas were central to the birth of modern democracy, thought that people were capable of reason and moral judgment. Hobbes, on the other hand, believed that we were vicious creatures who needed to be protected from ourselves by a powerful king. Whether a leader is Lockean or Hobbesian really does set the table for the kind of government they want.

One way to understand the head-spinning nature of being an American over the past couple of decades is that this debate—one that history seemed to have settled in Locke's favor—is alive again. Barack Obama was a Lockean through and through—insisting, repeatedly, that if citizens were just given accurate information and a fair hearing, they would converge on something like the common good. Then came Donald Trump, Hobbesian extraordinaire, who has often portrayed life under anyone's leadership but his own much as Hobbes describes the state of nature: “solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short.” (Nasty is even one of Trump's favorite words.)

Comments this week from Stephen Miller, the influential deputy chief of staff often cast as the president's “brain,” only reinforced this impression. Miller might have been Hobbes in a skinny tie as he confidently articulated what he understood to be the “iron laws of the world since the beginning of time.” His monologue was like something out of the English philosopher's 1651 political treatise, Leviathan: “We live in a world, in the real world,” he said, “that is governed by strength, that is governed by force, that is governed by power.”

Miller's might-makes-right declaration came after Trump's decision to overthrow the president of Venezuela, and in anticipation of the United States possibly acquiring Greenland from Denmark, perhaps by any means necessary (a notion that Miller's wife found fit to turn into a meme). The will to dominate, seize other countries' resources because you can, and generally bully those that can't fight back is nothing to worry about, Miller reassured Americans: This is the natural state of things. This is how it all works. Power does what it wants. The rest is commentary and toothless United Nations resolutions—or, as he put it, “international niceties.”

Miller might as well etch Hobbes's words onto a gold plaque ready to hang among other gilded tchotchkes in the Oval Office: “During the time men live without a common power to keep them all in awe, they are in that condition which is called war; and such a war, as is of every man, against every man.”

Read: The wrath of Stephen Miller

Hobbes helps explain the dog-eat-dog worldview of this administration—if you stop reading there. Dive in a little more, though, and you'll find that he's not exactly a fan of this state of affairs. By describing our natural condition as fearful, insecure, and frankly pretty terrifying—an existence of constantly watching your back—Hobbes was diagnosing a problem. Left to our own devices, without any institutions or government, we would not have any culture or science or peace. This thought experiment was his starting point, and it also helped fuel the Enlightenment then just under way.

The cure, for Hobbes, won't seem all that palatable to most Americans today. He suggested that stability could come only through the empowerment of a strong monarch who would have a monopoly on violence and keep our worst instincts at bay. This is not democracy, obviously, but the king, as Hobbes dreamed him up, would need to keep and gain the consent of those he ruled over. This was his Leviathan, an earthly sovereign power that humans rationally create to escape the chaos of the state of nature. (Contrast this with Trumpiathan, who said in an interview on Thursday that his “own mind” was the source of his legitimacy to do what he wanted on the world stage: “It's the only thing that can stop me.”) For Hobbes, there would be good faith in the exchange with a strongman: sacrificing a certain amount of autonomy to ensure that everyone could thrive without killing one another.

That's Hobbes's vision. He is trying to offer us an escape from a horror show that, as The Atlantic's editor in chief recently put it, resembles William Golding's Lord of the Flies: boys on an island without grown-ups or any of their rules, driven by privation and instinct to a murderous contest of dominance.

As for Miller's vision, it's horror all the way down. He's not looking to solve for this state of nature. He simply calls it “the real world,” one whose anarchic rules America just needs to accept and use to its benefit. If Miller has read Hobbes, he's drawing the wrong lesson. Even if he might like the idea of Trump as the Leviathanlike authoritarian come to bring order to the chaos (and Miller's recent, and disputed, invocation of a president's absolute “plenary authority” would suggest that that's the case), this is not how Trump understands his role; otherwise, he would be bolstering international institutions and multilateral relationships rather than trashing whatever and whoever does not serve his glory.

If we were all living on the island in Lord of the Flies (and some days I feel like we are), then Trump would be Jack, the boy who recognizes that power comes not from rules but from fear, spectacle, and aggression.

If Trump and his inner circle have a guiding philosphy—to the extent that one can be discerned through a handful of often-contradictory statements—it has sometimes been described as “realpolitik.” Last year, I mentioned that this transactional approach to diplomacy and war, associated with Henry Kissinger, might be an apt way to characterize how Trump and his team think about the world. Realpolitik, as Kissinger practiced it while serving as secretary of state, eschewed moral questions in favor of reaching a balance of power among strong states for the sake of achieving stability (and to avoid the looming threat of nuclear annihilation). But does what we're seeing in Venezuela count as realpolitik? The stated motive and the evident outcome, as well as Miller's words, make clear that this is a raw exercise of strength for strength's sake rather than a bid to stabilize the Western Hemisphere. The naked grab of the country's oil (Trump has already put dibs on 30 million to 50 million barrels) removes any further ambiguity.

If Miller was trying to channel Hobbes, this would be a break with a very old American tradition of wariness about the philosopher. John Adams's winking remark to his son John Quincy that Hobbes's ideas were “mischievous” pretty much sums it up. The creators of a more participatory system of government did not take kindly to the notion that all people needed was a Mafia boss to offer them protection. Thomas Jefferson laid out his objections in an 1816 letter to Adams. And Miller—if he is actually interested in thinking through the implications of his “iron laws”—might do well to read it.

Jefferson agreed with Hobbes's main contention: Government is necessary to organize human behavior. But he thought that leaders had to do a lot more than just prevent brutality and chaos. A Lockean, Jefferson had a more expansive view of human needs and capabilities. He felt that the “principle of Hobbes” was lacking because it didn't take into account that humans have a “moral sense.” People want more than just a life without fear, he said; “every human mind feels pleasure in doing good to another.” Any worthy American government needed to reflect this instinct toward goodness, and to create the conditions for it. This also happens to be the only way to summon the kind of “real world” that someone would actually want to live in.

﻿Elon Musk claims tech needs a “spicy mode” to dominate. Is he right?

For the past few weeks, Elon Musk's Grok AI bot has been generating pornographic images of women and underage girls, without their consent, at an astounding rate. A recent Bloomberg analysis found that Grok creates 6,700 such images per hour, or more than one per minute. On Friday, X at last put some minor guardrails on the tool, with a new policy that only paying subscribers can use Grok to generate or alter images. On the standalone Grok app, however, anyone can prompt Grok to generate new images, meaning the deepfaked porn continues.

Grok has long been one of the more suggestive of the major AI models, with “spicy” and “sexy” settings that can be toggled on and off. While employees have warned that the bot is being used to generate child sex abuse materials, Musk has remained committed to the idea that Grok would be the sexiest AI model. On X, Musk has defended the choice on business grounds, citing the famous tale of how VHS beat Betamax in the 1980s after the porn industry put its weight behind VHS, with its larger storage capacity. “VHS won in the end,” Musk posted, “in part because they allowed spicy mode 😉.”

Culture reflects society. Get our best explainers on everything from money to entertainment to what everyone is talking about online.

There is a certain amount of truth to Musk's take. The porn industry tends to reward early adopters, and the money to be made in porn means that it has impressive leverage when it comes to choosing between two competing and incompatible forms of technology.

Yet the idea that porn as an industry, neutral and amorphous, settles tech wars doesn't show us the whole truth. It would be more accurate to say that the technologies we use to generate and share images are, more often than not, shaped by people distributing images of women's bodies — often with dubious consent from the women themselves. In that sense, Grok's abilities are par for the course.

Porn didn't only help VHS win over Betamax. The industry has also been linked to the mainstreaming of Super 8 film (easy and convenient for amateur filmmakers), the development of streaming video (private and easily accessible), the development of web payments (comes with paywalled streaming video), the development of web analytics (good for the complex business transactions of adult streaming), and the victory of Blu-ray over HD DVD. (Like VHS, Blu-rays held a lot more data than its competitors, which is especially attractive in the porn market.)

Then there were the systems of image distribution that developed outside of porn as an industry. A surprising amount of them revolved around people trying to share sexualized images of women's bodies as quickly as possible — only in these cases, the people whose images getting distributed weren't necessarily consenting adults who were getting paid for their trouble.

Sometimes the innovation was more or less harmless. Google Images was developed because so many people went searching for pictures of Jennifer Lopez in her famously low-cut Versace gown in 2000, a distinction Lopez has treated as a feather in her cap. In this case, Lopez wore the dress to a high-profile event and wanted to be seen and talked about, so it's reasonable to assume consent.

Other times it got cloudier. The impetus for YouTube came when developers wanted to watch Janet Jackson's 2004 wardrobe malfunction and were frustrated that it took so long to find video of it on the internet. Jackson has always maintained that she did not intend for her breast to be seen on national TV, so here, we're dealing with nonconsensual nudity.

Meanwhile, Mark Zuckerberg's progenitor for Facebook was Facesmash, a Hot or Not rip-off developed to compare the women of Harvard University's student body to farm animals. The intent here was less to create nonconsensual pornography than it was to perform a sexualized humiliation of nonconsenting women — an act that turned out to be so popular that it overwhelmed Harvard's servers the night it launched.

So Musk is not entirely wrong when he says that technologies with what he euphemistically refers to as “spicy mode” tend to do well. A more accurate phrasing, however, might be to say that in our misogynistic society, objectifying and humiliating the bodies of unconsenting women is so valuable that the fate of world-altering technologies depends on how good they are at facilitating it.

AI was always going to be used for this, one way or the other. But only someone as brutally uncaring and willing to cut corners as Elon Musk would allow it to go this wrong.

Making it easy to complain to companies is AI's ultimate test.

The weirdest thing happened to me recently. I contacted a customer service department and enjoyed it. I sent an email, heard back promptly, and got a refund. What was most notable about the positive problem-solving experience was the fact that I couldn't tell if there was a human other than me involved.

It dawned on me, however briefly, that the prophecies were finally coming true. AI was finally making it easier for me to complain to companies and get results. At least that's what I wanted to believe.

Customer service is supposed to be one of those things that AI can just do. Indeed, that one good experience was powered by an AI-first company called Intercom. They have an AI agent called Fin that handles most of its clients' queries. Why not all of them?

“I'm confident that a lot of current customer support that happens over a phone or computer, those people will lose their jobs, and that'll be better done by an AI,” OpenAI CEO Sam Altman told Tucker Carlson, of all people, in September.

A weekly dispatch to make sure tech is working for you, instead of overwhelming you. From senior technology correspondent Adam Clark Estes.

Altman is hardly the only Silicon Valley executive pushing to automate customer service. Last year, Salesforce cut 4,000 customer service jobs in favor of AI tools, and Verizon launched a chatbot powered by Google Gemini as its front door for customer service. Then there's Klarna, whose CEO bragged about replacing humans with AI before backtracking last May and launching a recruiting drive to hire more human customer service agents.

There's the rub. It turns out that AI, and especially generative AI, is really good at doing some things…until it isn't. That's why you still have to fact-check everything ChatGPT tells you and why, even though they're good at diagnosing certain medical conditions, chatbots can't replace human doctors. When it comes to customer service, AI can be good at simple tasks, like issuing refunds, but terrible at handling more complicated cases, especially when customers are upset and could benefit from some human empathy. To quote Anchorman, “Sixty percent of the time, it works every time.”

Still, human customer service agents are losing their jobs to AI in large numbers, and have been for the last few years, both in the United States and abroad. Whether to cut costs or look cool, a lot of companies rolled out AI-powered chatbots as the first point of contact for customers, only to realize that customers actually hate this concept. Now, these organizations are pulling back from those plans, according to Brad Fager, chief of research for customer service and support leaders at Gartner.

“The idea that you could replace your workforce is really just not viable, and it's not even preferable,” Fager told me, noting that executives might think replacing human agents with AI is a good way to cut costs. “The reality is it's just not working.”

There's also evidence that customers just don't like interacting with AI. One 2024 Gartner survey found that 61 percent of customers would prefer companies didn't use AI at all for customer service, and 53 percent of them would consider switching to a competitor if they did. As Fager explained to me, Gartner has broadly taken the stance that AI and automation will transform the future of customer service, but that humans will play a big role in that transformation. And to many customers' delight, a lot of the AI integration will happen on the back end, helping human agents do their jobs better rather than leading interactions. The customers themselves may never know that AI was involved.

This approach reminded me of a study I read a couple of years ago from researchers at MIT and Stanford who looked into how generative AI improved productivity in call center workers. It did, mostly for the less experienced agents. With access to an AI tool that offered real-time suggestions on how to handle calls, the workers were able to resolve 14 percent more cases per hour. The tool had been trained on data from more experienced agents and could even help novice workers be more empathetic to customers.

Contrast this with what you've probably experienced with chatbots: the AI version of a phone tree. This is where you ask a customer service bot for help and are met with a menu of options prompting you to narrow down your request in order to get you to the correct, probably AI-powered agent. It's a slightly updated version of the infuriating phone tree that asks you to say or press one for billing, two for technical support, and so forth.

These front-end solutions to identify customers and their needs are essentially AI tools bolted onto old customer service systems, and they're awful. Werner Kunz, a professor of marketing at the University of Massachusetts Boston, argues that a lot of companies are doing this just to do something with AI.

“It doesn't work very well,” he told me. “The failure rate is way too high in comparison to the older systems, and if this is what companies are using AI at the moment for, I think it destroys customer relationships.” Kunz added that using AI in the backend would provide better results in a safer environment, and also, “Who cares about if you use AI or not?”

Which brings me back to my recent, surprisingly positive customer service experience. I reached out to Intercom, the company that built the software, and confirmed that it was an AI agent that solved my problem. There was no phone tree analog and, in a sense, no fight with a chatbot to reach a human agent. Fin, the AI agent, registered my complaint, offered me a solution in a human-sounding email — there were even emojis used in the correct context — and closed the case before I even considered getting annoyed.

It wouldn't quite be correct to say that customer service, thanks to AI, is finally starting to get good. As Kunz and Fager explained, lots of companies are getting it wrong by using AI for the wrong things or tacking it onto legacy systems. However, Intercom co-founder and chief strategy officer Des Traynor says that going all in on AI is the best way to give customers what they want: instant outcomes.

“You don't want to wait,” Traynor said. “It's the same reason why people Google before they pick up the phone: People just want instant resolution to problems and that's what AI offers.” He added, “It's just categorically better for users — when it works.”

Traynor admitted that AI ushered in an era of software that left people wondering if it worked, and that problem guided the development of Fin. He said his company “put a phenomenal amount of time into building an AI evaluation engine” and “torture-tests every release” to make sure Fin doesn't hallucinate or get things wrong. As a result, Fin resolves a million customer queries a week with a 67 percent resolution rate, which is not 100 percent, but Traynor said that number is going up 1 percent every month. He conceded that some interactions needed human intervention, but in most cases, the AI can get the job done better. In my case, that was true.

The big problem here, if you're a consumer, is that you don't necessarily get to choose how any given company is handling its customer service. There's also a sort of income equality gap between the haves and the have-nots, whereby bigger companies, like Amazon, can invest more and offer better customer service and small companies, like local utility boards, just do the best they can.

What's clear, however, is that a transformation is happening. There are signals that complaining to companies is getting easier to do but also strong evidence that many companies will continue to make it difficult, even though they want to make it easier. AI is here to help make things work better, but only if it can stop making them worse first.

One of the most consequential changes to immigration in the US under Trump, explained.

When he first emerged on the political stage more than a decade ago, Donald Trump made closing America's borders and remaking our immigration system a central plank of his agenda.

A year into his second administration — and as this week's events in Minneapolis underscore — the issue has defined his presidency and changed America's trajectory.

Perhaps one of the most consequential moves on that front has been his dismantling of our system of asylum: the process by which immigrants can legally enter the country if they fear violence or persecution. Trump has moved aggressively to curtail asylum-seekers' entrance into the US, as well as to force ones already in the country to leave.

Today, Explained guest host Miles Bryan talked to ProPublica immigration reporter Mica Rosenberg about how the Trump administration has made life harder for asylum-seekers, how the system broke under Joe Biden, and what the changes in the US might spell for the rest of the world.

Below is an excerpt of their conversation, edited for length and clarity. There's much more in the full podcast, so listen to Today, Explained wherever you get podcasts, including Apple Podcasts, Pandora, and Spotify.

What was the Trump administration's mindset about asylum coming into 2025? Under US law, people are allowed to show up at our border and request asylum if they fear returning to their home countries. But that actually triggers a very long court process in the US that can take years to resolve.

Trump and his advisers really view this system as kind of like a giant loophole. They believe that most people who are coming into the country this way are not legitimate asylum-seekers, and they're maybe coming for economic reasons. They've really come into office with a blitz of policies to try and shut that system down.

And that includes things that they're doing at the border, which is quickly turning people back to Mexico — and, in some cases, sending them to third countries like Panama or Costa Rica or even farther, locations that they've never been to, and not giving them a chance to seek asylum here.

How important are those “third country” deportations to the administration's overall policy?

This is really one of the most novel and surprising things that the Trump administration has tried.

For years, multiple administrations have struggled with a particular issue of countries that have refused to take back their own nationals as deportees. During the first Trump administration, he forged agreements with some Central American countries to take back some deportees from different nationalities — mostly regional migrants, and they didn't really get very far.

This time around, [the administration has] really ramped up this strategy significantly. They've signed these types of agreements with around 20 countries, including really far-flung ones like South Sudan and Uganda.

In one of the most audacious and consequential deportations so far of Trump's presidency, he sent close to 230 Venezuelan nationals to a maximum security prison in El Salvador. He accused them of being the worst of the worst, gang members. Our reporting at ProPublica and with Venezuelan reporting partners found that the government knew that the vast majority of these men had never been convicted of any crimes in the United States, but they were rounded up and whisked away to this prison, where they were held for months before they were released in a prisoner exchange.

This is something that has never really been tried before at this scale. And it's being challenged in court. But it's very difficult to challenge because once these people are outside of the United States, they're mostly outside of the jurisdiction of US courts. So it's leaving a lot of people in very precarious situations.

I think it'd be helpful to kind of remind everybody, including myself, what this system and the process looked like before Trump started blowing it up. Can you paint us a picture of how this was working under the Biden administration?

During the Biden administration, this phenomenon of people arriving at the border and turning themselves in to border officials to claim asylum really exploded under the Biden administration. The people that were coming and asking for refuge were overwhelming border stations, and many ended up being released into the country to make their claims in immigration court.

What qualifies you for asylum is a really sort of narrow band of reasons. It's granted to people specifically who fear persecution because of their race, their religion, their nationality, their political opinion, or membership in a particular social group. The system's really been set up in the past acknowledging that those things can be very difficult to prove (especially if you're fleeing out of fear, you might not have all of the proof that you need).

That's why the court system was set up in this way. It was supposed to give people time to gather evidence, to make their claims. I think there are a lot of people who were arriving at the border who really did have legitimate asylum claims. They're fleeing for their lives. They're facing political persecution. But mixed in there, I think, are people who are coming for other reasons. They're facing serious economic hardship or violence or political and economic breakdown in their home countries.

What the Trump administration has done, by believing that almost all of the asylum claims are fraudulent or not legitimate, they're really sort of throwing the baby out with the bathwater. And advocates are saying that these changes have made it nearly impossible for legitimate asylum-seekers to really get protection.

How do people in countries far from the United States find out or come to believe that flying to Mexico and then trekking to the border and then waiting at the border and then maybe turning themselves in was going to lead to a better life?

I think it's very different for every nationality and every group. There were WhatsApp groups, there were TikTok influencers who were advertising different routes for making it to the United States.

People from countries deeper in South America, in India, and parts of Africa started understanding that they could come to the border and claim asylum and potentially be released to pursue their claims. There were hundreds of thousands of people who were making a perilous trek on foot through the dangerous jungle between Colombia and Panama.

African and Indian migrants were going into debt for tens of thousands of dollars to pay for commercial and charter flights into Nicaragua and then to make their way through Mexico.

Is anyone still getting asylum? Is this still happening at all, or has Trump just turned the tap off completely?

Well, the Trump administration's goals of sealing off the border are really being accomplished in many ways. Border crossings have dropped to record lows, and releases of people into the country to try and go through this court process have also really dropped. There has really been a reduction in the ability for people to seek protection here.

So you're telling us this story of huge swings in our asylum policy. It seems like a big reason that those swings are possible is because the policy is being set with executive orders. Do you think there's any possibility that Congress is going to actually make any meaningful changes to our asylum system? 

Well, everyone says that we are where we are right now because Congress for decades has never gotten around to passing any really meaningful, comprehensive immigration reform. We're working with an outdated system. Each president that comes in basically makes immigration policy through fiat and executive actions. And those can be challenged in court. They can be quickly overturned if a different party comes into office.

This is something that would take real, meaningful, bipartisan action. There have been efforts that came really close in the past where there were groups on both sides. I think it really doesn't look good for congressional action at this point.

How should we think about all these people who have historically sought out the United States for asylum who now cannot? Are they going to other countries? Is there going to be another nation that becomes the shining city on the hill?

All of these changes are happening at a time where there's really an unprecedented explosion of people fleeing conflicts all over the world. Trump is part of a wave of politicians who have capitalized on concerns about rising immigration. Politicians in places like Europe or even Canada have embraced some of the views that the Trump administration has about tamping down on migration, limiting access to asylum.

Many countries in the past have really felt compelled to follow the US lead on issues of human rights and protecting asylum-seekers. But now, these countries may end up following the US lead in the opposite direction.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:cnbc.com","AI memory is sold out, causing an unprecedented surge in prices","https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/10/micron-ai-memory-shortage-hbm-nvidia-samsung.html","Sat, 10 Jan 2026 12:00:01 GMT","



In this article

All computing devices require a part called memory, or RAM, for short-term data storage, but this year, there won't be enough of these essential components to meet worldwide demand.

That's because companies like Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices and Google need so much RAM for their artificial intelligence chips, and those companies are the first ones in line for the components. 

Three primary memory vendors — Micron, SK Hynix and Samsung Electronics — make up nearly the entire RAM market, and their businesses are benefitting from the surge in demand. 

""We have seen a very sharp, significant surge in demand for memory, and it has far outpaced our ability to supply that memory and, in our estimation, the supply capability of the whole memory industry,"" Micron business chief Sumit Sadana told CNBC this week at the CES trade show in Las Vegas. 

Micron's stock is up 247% over the past year, and the company reported that net income nearly tripled in the most recent quarter. Samsung this week said that it expects its December quarter operating profit to nearly triple as well. Meanwhile, SK Hynix is considering a U.S. listing as its stock price in South Korea surges, and in October, the company said it had secured demand for its entire 2026 RAM production capacity. 

Now, prices for memory are rising. 

TrendForce, a Taipei-based researcher that closely covers the memory market, this week said it expects average DRAM memory prices to rise between 50% and 55% this quarter versus the fourth quarter of 2025. TrendForce analyst Tom Hsu told CNBC that type of increase for memory prices was ""unprecedented."" 

Chipmakers like Nvidia surround the part of the chip that does the computation — the graphics processing unit, or GPU — with several blocks of a fast, specialized component called high-bandwidth memory, or HBM, Sadana said. HBM is often visible when chipmakers hold up their new chips. Micron supplies memory to both Nvidia and AMD, the two leading GPU makers. 

Nvidia's Rubin GPU, which recently entered production, comes with up to 288 gigabytes of next-generation HBM4 memory per chip. HBM is installed in eight visible blocks above and below the processor, and that GPU will be sold as part of single server rack called NVL72, which fittingly combines 72 of those GPUs into a single system. By comparison, smartphones typically come with 8 or 12GB of lower-powered DDR memory.

But the HBM memory that AI chips need is much more demanding than the RAM used for consumers' laptops and smartphones. HBM is designed for high-bandwidth specifications required by AI chips, and it's produced in a complicated process where Micron stacks 12 to 16 layers of memory on a single chip, turning it into a ""cube.""

When Micron makes one bit of HBM memory, it has to forgo making three bits of more conventional memory for other devices.

""As we increase HBM supply, it leaves less memory left over for the non-HBM portion of the market, because of this three-to-one basis,"" Sadana said. 

Hsu, the TrendForce analyst, said that memory makers are favoring server and HBM applications over other clients because there's higher potential for growth in demand in that business and cloud service providers are less price-sensitive. 

In December, Micron said it would discontinue a part of its business that aimed to provide memory for consumer PC builders so the company could save supply for AI chips and servers. 

Some inside the tech industry are marveling at how much and how quickly the price of RAM for consumers has increased. 

Dean Beeler, co-founder and tech chief at Juice Labs, said that a few months ago, he loaded up his computer with 256GB of RAM, the maximum amount that current consumer motherboards support. That cost him about $300 at the time. 

""Who knew that would end up being ~$3,000 of RAM just a few months later,"" he posted on Facebook on Monday.

AI researchers started to see memory as a bottleneck just before OpenAI's ChatGPT hit the market in late 2022, said Majestic Labs co-founder Sha Rabii, an entrepreneur who previously worked on silicon at Google and Meta.

Prior AI systems were designed for models like convolutional neural networks, which require less memory than large language models, or LLMs, that are popular today, Rabii said.  

While AI chips themselves have been getting much faster, memory has not, he said, which leads to powerful GPUs waiting around to get the data needed to run LLMs. 

""Your performance is limited by the amount of memory and the speed of the memory that you have, and if you keep adding more GPUs, it's not a win,"" Rabii said. 

The AI industry refers to this as the ""memory wall."" 

""The processor spends more time just twiddling its thumbs, waiting for data,"" Micron's Sadana said.

More and faster memory means that AI systems can run bigger models, serve more customers simultaneously and add ""context windows"" that allow chatbots and other LLMs to remember previous conversations with users, which adds a touch of personalization to the experience. 

Majestic Labs is designing an AI system for inference with 128 terabytes of memory, or about 100 times more memory than some current AI systems, Rabii said, adding that the company plans to eschew HBM memory for lower-cost options. Rabii said the additional RAM and architecture support in the design will enable its computers to support significantly more users at the same time than other AI servers while using less power.

Wall Street has been asking companies in the consumer electronics business, like Apple and Dell Technologies, how they will handle the memory shortage and if they might be forced to raise prices or cut margins. These days, memory accounts for about 20% of the hardware costs of a laptop, Hsu said. That's up from between 10% and 18% in the first half of 2025. 

In October, Apple finance chief Kevan Parekh told analysts that his company was seeing a ""slight tailwind"" on memory prices but he downplayed it as ""nothing really to note there.""

But in November, Dell said it expected its cost basis for all of its products to go up as a result of the memory shortage. COO Jefferey Clarke told analysts that Dell planned to change its mix of configurations to minimize the price impacts, but he said the shortage will likely affect retail prices for devices. 

""I don't see how this will not make its way into the customer base,"" Clarke said. ""We'll do everything we can to mitigate that.""

Even Nvidia, which has emerged as the biggest customer in the HBM market, is facing questions about its ravenous memory needs — in particular, about its consumer products.

At a press conference Tuesday at CES, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang was asked if he was concerned that the company's gaming customers might be resentful of AI technology because of rising game console and graphics cards prices that are being driven by the memory shortage. 

Huang said Nvidia is a very large customer of memory and has long relationships with the companies in the space but that, ultimately, there would need to be more memory factories because the needs of AI are so high.

""Because our demand is so high, every factory, every HBM supplier, is gearing up, and they're all doing great,"" Huang said. 

At most, Micron can only meet two-thirds of the medium-term memory requirements for some customers, Sadana said. But the company is currently building two big factories called fabs in Boise, Idaho, that will start producing memory in 2027 and 2028, he said. Micron is also going to break ground on a fab in the town of Clay, New York, that he said is expect to come online in 2030.

But for now, ""we're sold out for 2026,"" Sadana said.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:cnbc.com","We're in a 'hiring recession,' economist says — how job seekers can stand out","https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/10/hiring-recession.html","Sat, 10 Jan 2026 14:40:01 GMT","



A cooling labor market, characterized by sluggish hiring and anemic job creation, made it hard for job seekers to find work in 2025, according to economists. 

""It's fair to say that 2025 was a hiring recession in the United States,"" Heather Long, chief economist at Navy Federal Credit Union, wrote in a note Friday. That recession affects both blue- and white-collar workers, she wrote. 

U.S. employers added 584,000 jobs last year, according to a Bureau of Labor Statistics report issued Friday. That marks the worst year for total job gains outside of a recession since 2003, according to Long. There has been little job creation since April, meaning most gains took place early in the year, she wrote. 

Most hiring has also been concentrated in the health-care sector, making it difficult for workers to participate across the broad labor market, economists said. 

""Healthcare alone accounted for roughly 69% of all job growth across 2025,"" Nicole Bachaud, a labor economist at career site ZipRecruiter, wrote in a note Friday. ""The reliance on a single industry to keep job growth positive uncovers the unstable foundation in play going into 2026.""

Long-term unemployment has also climbed. In December, 26% of all unemployed workers had been out of work for at least six months, the highest share since February 2022, according to the BLS. 

That suggests ""unemployment is increasingly becoming a permanent state rather than a temporary transition,"" Bachaud said.

On Wednesday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported the hiring rate had fallen to 3.2% in November. That's one of the lowest rates since 2013, according to Long. 

Overall, the current state of the labor market shows a stark turnaround from the scorching market of 2021 and 2022. 

At that time, the so-called ""great resignation"" was in full swing, with job openings at record highs, pay growth at its highest in decades and workers able to leave their jobs in droves for better positions. 

Economists called that labor market, in which workers enjoyed considerable leverage, unsustainable over the long run. 

The Federal Reserve raised interest rates to help cool the labor market and rein in inflation, which in 2022 hit its highest level in about four decades.

Additionally, several factors coalesced into an anemic hiring environment, Long wrote: economic policy such as tariffs, business uncertainty, over-hiring in recent years, and a reluctance to hire more workers until the use cases for artificial intelligence become clearer. 

While the hiring recession will likely continue in the first half of 2026, the second half should be better for job seekers, due to tax cuts, lower interest rates and a clearer tariff picture, Long wrote. 

There are ways for job seekers to improve their chances at landing a new position, even in a lackluster hiring environment, according to job experts.

Employers and recruiters have gradually shifted to so-called ""skills-based hiring,"" meaning they prioritize a candidate's skills and experience rather than educational attainment, said Sam DeMase, a career expert at ZipRecruiter.

ZipRecruiter data shows 88% of entry-level jobs omit degree requirements in the job description, and about 70% of recently hired workers have less than a bachelor's degree, said DeMase. 

""Many employers want to hire folks who can hit the ground running immediately,"" she said. 

Job seekers should ensure there's ""strong"" alignment between the job description and the experience and skill sets they outline on their resumes and cover letters, DeMase said. 

This helps candidates stand out with recruiters and make it through the automated applicant tracking systems on which employers increasingly rely to sort applications, she said. 

DeMase gave an example of what candidates can write to highlight value proposition: ""Using my background in X, I helped companies achieve Y."" For example: ""Using my background in digital marketing and extensive background in data analysis and content planning, I helped companies craft innovative campaigns that attract and delight the ideal audience and drive revenue.""

Generic skills statements like ""I have good people skills and attention to detail"" won't work well in 2026, she said. 

Priya Rathod, a career expert at job site Indeed, recommends that applicants use artificial intelligence to match keywords in job descriptions with those in their resume. This helps applicants get through the first round of resume screening, she said. 

It's important for job seekers to follow employer demand, said Rathod.

Workers should target certain areas of the job market that are growing, including health care, skilled trades, infrastructure and revenue-critical jobs, especially within technology, she said.

""Getting hired in 2026 isn't necessarily about applying everywhere,"" Rathod said. ""It's really about aligning your skills and where employers are actually investing.""

For example, a worker with a sales background may not have specific experience in health-care sales, but they can play up their sales skills in an application, Rathod said.

Think about transferable skills, and work to upskill via additional credentials, licenses or certifications to fill in any gaps, she said. 

Don't ignore the value of networking, Rathod said. 

Whether a person has a job, is unemployed, or has a part-time role and is looking for full-time work, ""networking is always going to be one of your best friends,"" she said. 

This can take several forms: Engaging with industry and community organizations, and talking to friends and colleagues, either in person or online, she said.

DeMase recommends certain nuts-and-bolts resume formatting guidelines to further help make it through applicant tracking system firewalls. 

For instance, resumes should be in a single-column format with clearly labeled sections, including a headline, about me, achievements, work experience, areas of expertise and education, if applicable, she said. 

Resumes don't need to be limited to one page.

""There's a myth about the one-page resume,"" she said. ""Don't sacrifice experience to shorten your resume.""

A resume can be two pages for people with five to 10 years of experience, and three pages for those with more than 10 years of experience, DeMase said. These aren't hard and fast rules, however, and may differ based on industry.

CNBC's Jim Cramer said Friday that investors shouldn't read too much into uneventful unemployment data, arguing that a lack of surprises on the labor front is actually giving the market room to reveal the real story: a broad-based rally spreading well beyond last year's winners.

""When you get an employment report that's basically uneventful, it allows you to focus on what's really happening in the market,"" Cramer said. 

In his view, money is rotating aggressively into overlooked corners of the market, with data storage stocks among the biggest beneficiaries. Companies tied to that theme have delivered what he called breathtaking rallies, even as some of the market's former leaders struggle to gain traction.

That includes Apple and Nvidia, two stocks that have failed to lift despite strong underlying businesses. Cramer rejected the idea that the trade is over for either name. Instead, he said both companies are still humming along, but have become sources of funds as investors sell winners to buy newer opportunities. 

Looking ahead, Cramer said next week will be packed with catalysts, starting with the JPMorgan Healthcare Conference, where he plans to interview a dozen pharmaceutical executives. Historically, the event has been a hotbed for dealmaking, and Cramer said investors should expect a wave of merger-and-acquisition headlines.

On the economic front, Tuesday's December consumer price index will matter far more than the latest labor data. Cramer said strong signs from forwarding holiday spending suggest inflation may remain sticky, setting up tension between a president eager to contain prices and consumers who have borne the brunt of inflation.

Earnings season also kicks off Tuesday with JPMorgan Chase. Cramer said he expects an excellent quarter but warned that CEO Jamie Dimon is known for emphasizing risks on conference calls — a tone that has knocked the stock down before. His strategy: wait for any cautious commentary, then buy on weakness.

Later in the week, Cramer expects strong results from Delta Air Lines, and sees banks as the early stars of earnings season. He highlighted Citigroup as a potential standout, while reaffirming confidence in Wells Fargo, Bank of America, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley.

Cramer also said BlackRock could post strong numbers, though expectations may already be high. 

On the tech side, he's watching Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, whose report could finally shake sellers out of Nvidia. In the meantime, he said money continues to flow into storage and equipment plays like Western Digital, SanDisk, Micron, Seagate and Applied Materials.

Cramer also flagged transport stocks, saying a solid report from J.B. Hunt would reinforce his bullish stance on FedEx. By Friday, with PNC rounding out bank earnings, Cramer said investors should have a clearer sense of the tone for the rest of the season.

(This is the Warren Buffett Watch newsletter, news and analysis on all things Warren Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway. You can sign up here to receive it every Friday evening in your inbox.)

Greg Abel's annual cash salary for 2026 as the new CEO of Berkshire Hathaway is $25 million, a 19% increase from the $21 million he got in 2024 as the company's vice chairman for non-insurance operations. (Abel's 2025 salary has not yet been publicly disclosed.)

Berkshire's filing this week doesn't say anything about additional compensation for Abel, but the company has said it will never use its stock to pay employees.

After crunching a lot of proxy numbers from MyLogIQ, The Wall Street Journal reports Abel's salary ""would be the highest a chief executive running a current S&P 500 company has earned in any single year between 2010 and 2024.""

The real money for CEOs, however, comes in the form of stocks, stock options, and other noncash awards.

When those are included, Abel still tops 2024's median of just over $16 million for S&P 500 chief executives.

But the Journal says, ""Most of the top 100 best-paid executives received more than $25 million, when stock and other noncash awards are added.""

Glenview Trust's CIO Bill Stone tells the newspaper that since Abel is leading one of the S&P's 10 largest companies, ""One would expect his compensation to be commensurate with that level of CEOs.""

While not unusual for the CEO of a very large American corporation, Abel's paycheck is a striking departure from Buffett's annual salary of $100,000 (plus another $300K or so for personal and home security services provided by Berkshire. He also typically repaid half of his salary to cover personal expenses paid for the company.)

Unlike Abel, however, Buffett was, in effect, the founder of what is now a giant conglomerate, with virtually all of his current net worth of almost $150 billion generated by enormous gains for his Berkshire shares over the decades. (He's also given away shares now worth $200 billion.)

He could afford a symbolically small salary over the years as the ""billionaire next door."" 

According to the 2025 annual meeting proxy, Abel owns Berkshire shares currently valued at around $171 million.

That's a ""fair amount"" according to investor Jonathan Boyar, but he recently told Yahoo Finance Abel should ""buy an extremely large amount of Berkshire stock personally and really put his money where his mouth is.""

At the 2017 annual meeting, Buffett suggested his then-unknown CEO successor might be so rich ""they might even wish to perhaps set an example by engaging for something far lower than ... their true market value.""

Or, he thought, you could ""pay them a very modest amount"" in cash and, unlike standard CEO option packages with a fixed strike price, give them an option with annual strike price increases to account for retained earnings, ""because why should somebody retain a bunch of earnings and then claim they've actually improved the value simply because they withheld the money from shareholders.""

(You can watch and/or read his entire response in ""Highlights from CNBC's Buffett Archive"" below.)

Professor Randall Peterson at the London Business School focuses on organizational behavior.

He told me that when founders leave, or become less involved, with the distinctive companies they've created, those companies ""start to do more things the way other people do them.""

Abel's big salary looks like a step toward ""normalization."" If Berkshire does eventually become indistinguishable from its corporate peers, however, he thinks it will be a very long process that probably won't accelerate until Buffett dies.

Even though Abel has already been getting big paychecks, Buffett told CNBC last May the Iowa resident is not a ""distorted individual"" and ""lives what would look like a normal life.""

Professor Peterson notes that while he can't predict Abel's specific future, there are many examples of people who start out ""normal"" but don't stay that way after experiencing years of great wealth.

Buffett's previously unseen May interviews with CNBC will be featured in a special two-hour program, ""Warren Buffett: A Life and Legacy,"" next Tuesday, January 13 at 7 pm ET.

Berkshire Hathaway shares gained slightly during Greg Abel's first full week as CEO but lagged behind the S&P 500 by roughly one percentage point.

For the year-to-date, which includes last Friday's BRK declines, the S&P is around 2 1/2 percentage points ahead, with or without the index's dividends included.

Last year, the S&P with dividends, Buffett's standard metric, outperformed Berkshire's A shares by 7.0 percentage points.

More than eight years ago, when it was not yet known who Berkshire Hathaway's next CEO would be, Warren Buffett shared his thoughts on how much that person should be paid, given his own famously small annual salary of $100,000 (plus personal protection services.)

ANDREW ROSS SORKIN: Three years ago, you were asked at the meeting about how you thought we should compensate your successor.

You said it was a good question, and you would address it in the next annual letter.

We've been patiently waiting. (Laughter)

Can you tell us now, at least philosophically, how you've been thinking about the way the company should compensate your successor, so we don't have to worry when the paid consultants arrive on the scene?

WARREN BUFFETT: There's a couple of possibilities, actually, and I don't want to get into details on them.

But you may have, and I actually would hope that we would have somebody, A) who's already very rich, which they should be, if they've been working a long time and have got that kind of ability, that's very rich, and really is not motivated by whether they have ten times as much money than they and the families can need or a hundred times as much.

And they might even wish to perhaps set an example by engaging for something far lower than, actually, what you could say their true market value is.

And that could or could not happen, but I think it'd be terrific if it did. But I can't blame anybody for wanting their market value.

And then, if they didn't elect to go in that direction, I would say that you would probably pay them a very modest amount and then have an option which increased in value by — or increased in striking price annually — nobody does this hardly. Graham Holdings has done it. The Washington Post company did a little bit — but would increase because it's assuming that there were substantial retained earnings every year.

Because why should somebody retain a bunch of earnings and then claim they've actually improved the value simply because they withheld the money from shareholders.

So it's very easy to design that, and in private companies people do design it in that way. They just don't want to do it in public companies, because they get more money the other way.

But they might have a very substantial one that could be exercised but where  the ... shares had to be held for a couple years after retirement so that they really got the result over time that the majority of the stockholders would be able to get and not be able to pick their spots as to when they exercised and sold a lot of stock.

It's not hard to design. And it really depends who you're dealing with in terms of actually how much they care about money and having money beyond what they can possibly use.

President Donald Trump's attack on Venezuela and threats to other countries, as well as concerns about affordability, exposed fractures within the congressional GOP this week at the start of a challenging midterm election year.

Trump avoided defeat when most House Republicans declined to override the first of two vetoes of his presidency, which spiked a pair of nonpartisan infrastructure bills that would've benefited Colorado and Florida.

But it was otherwise a less-than-stellar week for Trump on Capitol Hill, though Republicans are projecting confidence.

""This isn't an unusual situation, particularly coming into midterm elections, where you have senators that are in tough situations,"" Sen. Bill Hagerty, R-Tenn., said Friday on CNBC's ""Squawk Box.""

A senior White House official said the defectors represent just a ""tiny fraction"" of congressional Republicans.

""Republicans aren't always going to have the same views as the president,"" the White House official said.

Still, cracks in GOP unity emerged on multiple fronts.

On Thursday, 17 House Republicans broke ranks and voted with Democrats on legislation to extend enhanced Affordable Care Act tax credits for three years, despite opposition from House Speaker Mike Johnson of Louisiana and the widespread unpopularity of the Obamacare subsidies within the Republican party. 

The White House official said Trump opposes a three-year extension, but the vote was not viewed internally as a defeat.

The enhanced tax credits were first enacted under President Joe Biden in 2021 and have been a focal point of Democratic messaging on health care and affordability. The credits expired at the end of 2025, resulting in sharply higher premiums for millions of Americans who get their health insurance on ACA marketplaces.

Many of those who supported the bill to extend the tax credits were among the most vulnerable Republicans in the 2026 midterms.

""I have long opposed the damage the Unaffordable Care Act has done to our country, but I will not watch Wisconsinites lose health care because Democrats let their own law collapse,"" Rep. Derrick Van Orden, R-Wis., who voted for their extension, posted on X. Van Orden is running for reelection in a toss up district, according to Cook Political Report.

Earlier on Thursday, five Senate Republicans bucked the president and joined Democrats on a procedural vote that could rein in his ability to take military action in Venezuela. Trump responded in a Truth Social post that ""Republicans should be ashamed"" of the senators who supported the preliminary vote and said they ""should never be elected to office again.""

Sen. Todd Young, R-Ind., one of the members called out by Trump, declined to comment on the president's comments on Thursday. When asked if he was open to changing his stance on subsequent War Powers votes, Young told reporters, ""Why would I?""

The White House, however, said there is a ""significant"" chance future votes on the resolution might go the president's way.

""A number of these members have left the door open to additional conversations,"" the senior official said.

Meanwhile, Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., who is retiring at the end of his term in January 2027, has found himself at odds with the administration on several fronts. 

On Wednesday, Tillis took aim at White House senior adviser Stephen Miller from the Senate floor, calling Miller's comments about the U.S. taking over Greenland ""amateurish"" and ""stupid."" 

The White House official called those remarks ""disappointing.""

A day after U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents killed a civilian in Minnesota, Tillis also announced he was blocking all Department of Homeland Security nominees. Tillis, however, said the hold was not related to the shooting, and instead had to do with Trump's Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem so far refusing to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee.

""All I'm saying is, you need to show respect to a committee of jurisdiction,"" Tillis told reporters this week.

And on Thursday, Tillis and Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., secured passage of a resolution to place a plaque honoring police officers who defended the Capitol on Jan. 6 in the Senate. 

Language authorizing the plaque was passed into law as part of a larger appropriations bill in 2022. The monument was supposed to be displayed on the West front of the Capitol by March 2023, but had been blocked by House Republicans.

Trump and his Republican allies in Congress have sought to shift the narrative on Jan. 6. On the five-year anniversary this week, the White House launched a web page casting blame on Democrats, then-Vice President Mike Pence, and Capitol Police for the violence that transpired that day.

Officers ""risked their lives to defend the United States Capitol and protect members of Congress. Their brave actions upheld the rule of law and ensured that our democratic institutions could continue to function as intended,"" Tillis said in a statement. 

When asked about the plaque, the White House official said, ""The administration doesn't have a position on the decorations of the Capitol.""

Leading U.S. oil executives told President Donald Trump at the White House on Friday that Venezuela will need major reforms to attract investment. 

Trump said Friday the industry would invest at least $100 billion to rebuild Venezuela's energy sector with U.S. security guarantees. But the CEOs of big oil companies like ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips did not commit at the meeting to quickly re-enter Venezuela. 

Exxon CEO Darren Woods told Trump that the Venezuelan market is ""uninvestable"" in its current state. Venezuela seized Exxon's and Conoco's assets in 2007, and Caracas owes the companies billions of dollars in outstanding claims from arbitration cases.

""We've had our assets seized there twice, and so you can imagine to re-enter a third time would require some pretty significant changes from what we've historically seen here,"" Woods told Trump at the White House. ""If we look at the legal and commercial constructs and frameworks in place today in Venezuela today, it's uninvestable."" 

Exxon is prepared to send a technical team to evaluate the current state of Venezuela's oil industry and assets, Woods said. 

ConocoPhillips CEO Ryan Lance congratulated Trump on ousting former President Nicolás Maduro. He said the banking sector will need to help restructure Venezuela's debt and provide billions of dollars in financing for the restore the country's infrastructure. 

Lance also called for the restructuring of state-owned oil company Petróleos de Venezuela (PDVSA).

""As we think that big and bold, we need to be also thinking about even restructuring the entire Venezuelan energy system including PDVSA,"" Lance told the president. 

Trump told the Conoco CEO that the U.S. government is not looking at recovering the assets the company lost during the 2007 nationalization. 

""We're not going to look at what people lost in the past, because that was their fault,"" Trump said. ""That was a different president. You're going to make a lot of money, but we're not going to go back.""

Chevron is the only U.S. oil major operating in Venezuela through joint ventures with PDVSA. Vice Chairman Mark Nelson said Chevron has a way forward to rapidly ramp up its production, which currently stands at about 240,000 barrels per day. 

""We have a path forward here very shortly to be able to increase our liftings from those joint ventures 100% essentially effective immediately,"" Nelson told Trump. ""We are also able to increase our production within our own disciplined investment schemes by about 50% just in the next 18 to 24 months.""

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent indicated Thursday that the U.S. might rely more on smaller oil companies, rather than the majors, to invest in Venezuela. 

""The big oil companies who move slowly, who have corporate boards, are not interested,"" Bessent said Thursday at the Economic Club of Minnesota. 

""I can tell you that the independent oil companies and individuals, wildcatters – our phones are ringing off the hook,"" Bessent said. ""They want to get to Venezuela yesterday.""

Known for its extensive due diligence and resources, Elliott regularly follows companies for years before making an investment. Elliott is the most active of activist investors, engaging with companies across industries and multiple geographies.

On Dec. 18, it was reported that Elliott has taken a more than $1 billion position in Lululemon and is bringing in Jane Nielsen, former CFO and COO of Ralph Lauren, as a potential CEO candidate at the company.

Lululemon is a global athletic apparel, footwear, and accessories company, offering pants, shorts, tops, and jackets for activities such as yoga, running and training. While the company remains anchored in its core North America market (~70% of revenue), it has built a significant presence in APAC (~25%), and China specifically (18%), as well as Europe (~5%). In fact, these ancillary markets have grown quite rapidly, with APAC and Europe delivering average compound annual growth rates of 33% and 22% respectively, over the past year. This international expansion has helped drive strong overall topline growth, with sales growing from $8 billion in 2023 to $11.9 billion today. However, in that same period, the company's share price has gone down from over $500 to now below $220 per share. The problem here lies in North America. Growth in this core market has slowed to low single digits, and now has turned negative, with comparable sales down 5% in the most recent quarter. Further, while the China growth story resonated with investors when North America was showing continued expansion, this narrative on its own in the face of North American core uncertainty is not something that is very appetizing to public market investors. 

The root challenges in the North America business can be traced back to 2018, when Calvin McDonald became Lululemon CEO. From the beginning of his tenure, and through the post-Covid period, the company operated in a golden era for athleisure, benefiting from the broad casualization of apparel and enjoying years of outsized growth as the only real large-scale player. While this environment delivered years of share price appreciation, it also masked a series of strategic missteps that would later come back to bite them. First, Lululemon used much of these earnings to pursue new business lines, including its $500 million acquisition of Mirror, as well as the launches of footwear and skincare lines, none of which have generated meaningful shareholder value. Moreover, while these initiatives may have been tolerable on their own during a period of rapid growth, they ultimately distracted management from the core North America business that was key to revenue growth. This loss of focus became especially pronounced in May 2024, when the company's chief product officer resigned. Since then, product direction and design have widely been perceived to be largely centralized under McDonald. Lululemon has shifted from its historically sleek and highly functional aesthetic toward louder branding and collaborations, such as with Disney, that are not aligned with the core customer. As a result, the company's brand perception has shifted, allowing competitors like Alo and Vuori to gain momentum and begin taking share, particular among Lululemon's core customer base of young women. This is a dynamic that is evident to anybody who shops in the category. While store traffic and brand awareness remain high, conversion has deteriorated. These product missteps have been further compounded by broader operational issues in the areas of marketing, supply chain and corporate cost controls. Together, these issues have driven margin pressure, eroded brand momentum in North America, and ultimately contributed to the sharp decline in the company's stock price. On Dec. 11, 2025, Lululemon announced that McDonald would step down as CEO effective Jan. 31, 2026. 

This impending leadership transition is what set the stage for Elliott to disclose a more than $1 billion position in Lululemon and bring in Jane Nielsen, former CFO and COO of Ralph Lauren, as a potential CEO candidate at the company. Lululemon is still a quality product and brand that has somewhat lost its way and needs to be invigorated. It does not need a CEO who knows all the answers (if that exists) but one who will hire the best talent and institute the right processes so management can work as a team of marketers, merchandisers and product developers to come up with the solutions. At the same time by delegating these duties to competent senior executives, Nielsen will be able to also oversee the company's supply chain and corporate structure to solve the problems there and institute a cost discipline that has been absent. This is what Nielsen has experience doing at both Ralph Lauren and Coach. In 2014, when Nielsen was at Coach, the manufacturer of luxury handbags was losing out to rivals and announced that it expected same-store sales in North America to be down by a high-teens percentage in the coming year. Nielsen told investors that Coach would be back to profitability within two years. Nielsen helped Coach close underperforming stores and get inventory under control and by March 2016, the Coach brand posted its first quarterly sales increase in North America in nearly three years. When Nielsen joined Ralph Lauren in September 2016, sales had stalled and net income had fallen approximately 50% since 2014. In a 2024 article in The Wall Street Journal, Nielsen was quoted as saying, ""The brand was bigger and better than the business was showing"" — which is similar to Lululemon today. Nielsen and the leadership team targeted millennial and Gen Z shoppers and overhauled the website and closed stores, leading to an increase of 20% in adjusted operating income.

When an activist comes to a company with an idea or recommendation, they are just as happy if the company takes that recommendation or comes up with a better one. Elliott is not saying that Jane Nielsen is the best person for the job. The firm is saying that she is the best person it knows of for the job, and the firm does extensive and comprehensive diligence and analysis before making a recommendation like this. Elliott cannot name the next CEO. The board does that. And while Elliott would like to see Nielsen as the next CEO, if the board decides on someone else who is equally qualified, Elliott will support that decision. In practicality, whoever the next CEO is will be pseudo-approved by Elliott because we have never seen a qualified CEO with options take a job like this if they knew an activist like Elliott opposed his or her appointment. But Elliott's presence alone adds a lot of value to the situation which the board should recognize. First, it justifies a sense of urgency, which is needed here. Second, the firm brings to the table a more than qualified CEO candidate who is ready and willing to take on this role. Third, an activist of Elliott's stature and reputation can give the board cover in whatever decision they make. This third point is particularly important when there is an outspoken founder in the wings like Chip Wilson who has been publicly criticizing board decisions. Without the activist, even a competent and experienced board could compromise on the CEO selection to appease the vocal founder. 

This is very similar to Elliott's recent campaign at Starbucks, another iconic brand facing popularity, competition and image challenges with an outspoken founder not afraid to give his opinion. At Starbucks, Elliott's efforts quickly culminated in the appointment of Brian Niccol as CEO, now working to reset the company's strategy and restore investor confidence. Elliott's presence justified the urgency required and its endorsement of Niccol gave the board the external credibility to act quickly.

Since Elliott engaged Lululemon, on Dec. 29, Chip Wilson has nominated three directors – Marc Maurer, the former co-CEO of On Holding AG; Laura Gentile, former chief marketing officer of ESPN; and Eric Hirshberg, former CEO of Activision, the largest segment of Activision Blizzard – for election to the board at the 2026 annual meeting.

Ken Squire is the founder and president of 13D Monitor, an institutional research service on shareholder activism, and the founder and portfolio manager of the 13D Activist Fund, a mutual fund that invests in a portfolio of activist investments.

Bill Gates is as optimistic about the world's future as ever, despite the fact that we're living through ""an era with so many challenges and so much polarization,"" the billionaire philanthropist and Microsoft co-founder wrote in a blog post on Friday.

The world faces plenty of causes for concern over issues like climate change, global health and poverty, and disruptions caused by artificial intelligence, Gates wrote. However, ""we are far better off than when I was born 70 years ago,"" wrote Gates, due particularly to innovations in technology and global health.

Gates also believes that conditions will keep improving over the next two decades, especially as AI spurs new advances, he wrote: ""I am still an optimist because I see what innovation accelerated by artificial intelligence will bring.""

But there are a few caveats. ""These days, my optimism comes with footnotes,"" wrote Gates.

Specifically, Gates is concerned about three questions that could determine ""the trajectory of [the world's] progress,"" he wrote:

The number of worldwide deaths of children under 5 years old was projected to increase by roughly 200,000 in 2025, rising for the first time in 25 years, according to a report released by the Gates Foundation in December.

The projected stat is ""the thing I am most upset about"" regarding the world's progress, Gates wrote on Friday. He linked it to significant cuts to global aid spending by leading world governments, including the U.S.

""Over the last 25 years, those deaths went down faster than at any other point in history. But in 2025, they went up for the first time this century..."" wrote Gates. ""This trend will continue unless we make progress in restoring aid budgets.""

The global standard of living's continued improvement depends, in part, on wealthy countries and individuals — like himself — re-committing to contribute some of their abundant resources to help those in need and reduce inequality around the world, Gates wrote. The billionaire announced plans in May 2025 to step up his own charitable giving as part of a pledge to give away ""virtually all"" of his wealth — which is currently estimated at $118 billion by Bloomberg — by 2045.

""This idea of treating others as you wish to be treated does not just apply to rich countries giving aid. It must also include philanthropy from the wealthy to help those in need — both domestically and globally — which should grow rapidly in a world with a record number of billionaires and even centibillionaires,"" he wrote on Friday.

Gates' optimism is bolstered by his belief in the power of technology, particularly AI, to create new breakthroughs in medical treatments, he wrote. Gates pointed to AI-powered advances in Alzheimer's research, as well as cancer and health crises still faced by developing countries, from malaria to malnutrition.

The Microsoft co-founder has also long been a proponent of using AI to improve education in the U.S. and abroad. AI tutors could eventually ""be like a great high school teacher,"" providing personalized instruction to students across all income levels and geographies, Gates said on his ""Unconfuse Me"" podcast in August 2023.

In his blog post, Gates also linked environmental issues to global equality, writing that climate change could ""join poverty and infectious disease in causing enormous suffering, especially for the world's poorest people.""

After previously arguing for some climate research funding to be redirected to issues like poverty and health care, Gates wrote on Friday that he still plans on ""investing and giving more than ever to climate work in the years ahead.""

AI's agricultural applications could help provide farmers in developing countries with better advice, and more adaptive crops, to help them survive the challenges of growing food in warming environments, he wrote.

Clearly, Gates is an AI optimist. He also wrote about the technology's risks, and the need to work proactively to avoid worst-case scenarios, citing two specific challenges for the next two decades: the potential use of AI by bad actors and disruptions to the job market.

""Both are real risks that we need to do a better job managing,"" wrote Gates. World governments and the tech industry will have to be ""deliberate about how this technology is developed, governed, and deployed,"" he added.

Gates didn't offer any specific suggestions, but did push back against the idea that AI might significantly damage the prospects of human workers, writing that ""we should be able to allocate these new capabilities in ways that benefit everyone,"" including the potential for shorter work weeks for some people. Such optimism stems from his belief in ""two core human capabilities,"" he noted.

""The first is our ability to anticipate problems and prepare for them, and therefore ensure that our new discoveries make all of us better off. The second is our capacity to care about each other,"" Gates wrote, adding that history is filled with examples of people who put ""the greater good"" ahead of their own personal interests.

""Those two qualities — foresight and care — are what give me hope as the year begins,"" Gates wrote. ""As long as we keep exercising those abilities, I believe the years ahead can be ones of real progress.""

In this article

It often starts small.

A dab of concealer. A tinted moisturizer. Maybe a brow gel that goes from borrowed to bought. For many men, like Daniel Rankin, makeup has transformed from something taboo into a tool to make them look less tired and more put together.

""I remember thinking, 'Am I really doing this?'"" Rankin, a 24-year-old advertising agent from New York who likes to shop at Sephora, told CNBC. ""But once I tried it, it just became normal.""

In front of bathroom mirrors and in gym locker rooms, more men are now adding cosmetics to their routines, industry experts told CNBC. The men's makeup market is now one of the most lucrative — and largely untapped — growth opportunities left in beauty, and specialty retailers like Ulta Beauty and Sephora along with big-box companies like Target and Walmart all see opportunity. 

""Men's beauty is one of the last categories left where brands can likely still see easy double-digit growth potential simply by showing up,"" said Delphine Horvath, professor of cosmetics and fragrance marketing at the Fashion Institute of Technology. 

Men's grooming sales in the United States topped $7.1 billion in 2025, up 6.9% year over year, according to market research firm NielsenIQ. The global market was valued at $61.6 billion in 2024 and projected to surpass $85 billion by 2032, with the biggest growth driven by the skin-care sector, according to Fortune Business Insights.

Much of the momentum is coming from Gen Z.

In the U.S., 68% of Gen Z men ages 18 to 27 used facial skin-care products in 2024, a sharp jump from 42% just two years earlier, according to data from market intelligence firm Mintel.

""This is no longer niche,"" said Linda Dang, CEO of Canada-based Asian beauty retailer Sukoshi. ""Men are forming routines, that usually starts at skin care and then expands further, they are no longer just buying random products. That's what makes this market so valuable.""

Unlike one-off grooming purchases, makeup encourages repeat use and experimentation. A man who starts with concealer often adds primer, setting powder or tinted SPF over time, said Farah Jemai, global marketing associate lead at beauty brand Unleashia. 

""When men discover makeup that works, they don't use once and never again,"" Jemai told CNBC. ""They restock.""

Market researchers estimate that in 2022, about 15% of U.S. heterosexual men ages 18 to 65 were already using cosmetics and makeup, while another 17% said they would consider it, according to Ipsos. Industry experts say those figures are likely higher in 2026.

Openness to cosmetics has grown, as the share of U.S. men who say they never wear makeup has fallen from more than 90% in 2019 to about 75% in 2024, Statista survey data show.

Beauty conglomerates and startups alike are responding to the growth in men's beauty. 

Ulta Beauty and and Sephora have begun integrating men's complexion products into gender-neutral, skin care-first displays rather than having ""Men's"" aisles. Those gender-specific displays can feel intimidating or stigmatizing to some men, Horvath said.

Big-box retailers like Walmart and Target have also expanded their men's cosmetics or grooming offerings.

For example, in 2025, Target partnered with online streaming collective AMP, Any Means Possible, to launch TONE. The men‑forward personal care brand debuted in Target stores nationwide in July, leveraging AMP's massive Gen Z male following across YouTube and Twitch.

Online — where much of the growth and discovery is happening — many beauty brands are pouring money into influencer partnerships to increase engagement and sales on TikTok Shop and Amazon.

""So many brands are now putting most of their marketing budget into influencer marketing to meet people where they already are online and make it easier to click 'buy,'"" said Janet Kim, a vice president at K-beauty brand Neogen.

Others are leaning into digital education to teach men what different items do.

The brand War Paint sells makeup products like concealer pens, tinted moisturizers and anti-shine powders that feature QR codes on the packaging. Scanning them launches video tutorials explaining what each product does — without forcing customers to ask questions in a store.

""The biggest barrier isn't price, it's uncertainty,"" Dang said. ""Men want to know what a product does and how to use it without feeling awkward.""

But the path to mass adoption isn't guaranteed. 

Industry analysts warn that social stigma remains high and inflation threatens to curb spending on experimental, nonessential goods. Retailers also face a steep learning curve: It is difficult to scale a market when the core customer doesn't know how to use the product.

While men have worn makeup for centuries, from ancient Egypt to Elizabethan England, the modern commercial men's makeup movement traces its roots to the mid-2010s.

In 2016, CoverGirl made history by appointing then 17-year-old YouTuber James Charles as its first-ever ""CoverBoy,"" placing a male face on a mass-market cosmetics brand for the first time.

Still, beauty conglomerates largely focused on women until recently, Sukoshi's Dang said. Now, a broader cultural reset around masculinity is taking place and companies are racing to monetize it, FIT's Horvath said.

Social media has been the single biggest accelerant, Dang said.

On TikTok and Instagram, male creators post step-by-step makeup routines, product breakdowns and before-and-after results that often emphasize subtle changes rather than dramatic looks. Hashtags tied to men's grooming and makeup have amassed billions of views, with #mensgrooming alone surpassing 26 billion views on TikTok.

""TikTok democratized the 'how-to,'"" said Dang. ""You don't have to ask your sister or guess anymore. You just scroll, see a guy who looks like you fixing his acne in 30 seconds, and click 'buy.' It removed the gatekeepers.""

Gen Z men are also more comfortable rejecting rigid gender categories and more skeptical of marketing that frames products as inherently masculine or feminine, Horvath said.

At the same time, makeup has increasingly been folded into a broader wellness and optimization culture — sometimes referred to as ""looksmaxxing"" — that includes fitness tracking, supplements, hair-loss prevention and longevity routines.

""Many men have started framing grooming and, for some, makeup as maintenance, not vanity,"" Horvath said. ""That reframing removes stigma and unlocks spending.""

Celebrity influence has further accelerated adoption, with stars like Harry Styles, Brad Pitt and Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson launching their own skin care and makeup brands, mirroring the trend of celebrity saturation largely seen in spirits.

Johnson's brand Papatui, which launched at Target in 2024 and spans skin, hair, body and tattoo care, was created in response to ongoing questions about his grooming regimen. It now competes directly with legacy names like Clinique, L'Oréal and Kiehl's.

As the market matures, a debate is forming: Do men want ""men's makeup,"" or do they just want makeup?

Horvath said there is a ""bifurcation"" in how companies are marketing their products.

Brands like War Paint and Stryx argue that men need products designed for their thicker, oilier skin, and packaged in masculine, tool-like containers that feel at home in a gym bag.

But Gen Z consumers are increasingly gravitating toward gender-neutral brands like LVMH co-owned Fenty Beauty, The Ordinary and Haus Labs. For them, labels that say ""For Men"" can feel outdated or even patronizing, Horvath said. 

""In ten years, I don't think we'll be talking about 'men's makeup' anymore,"" Horvath said. ""We will just be talking about makeup. The gender binary in beauty is dissolving, and the sales data is finally catching up to the culture.""

According to the FBI, $240 million was lost to cryptocurrency ATM scams in the first six months of 2025 — about double the pace of similar scams in 2024. The growing pace of crypto ATM fraud has some policymakers pursuing bans and others asking why the nation is blanketed in these machines in the first place.

Spokane Police Detective Tim Schwering started noticing the rise in crypto crime in 2023. ""Cases started flowing my way where people were getting ripped off by cryptocurrency machines,"" Schwering said. The money would find its way to China, Russia, Nigeria, and other far-off outposts. ""You couldn't get to anyone or get the money back,"" Schwering said. People's life savings in Spokane were wiped away. 

Schwering said one man lost $900,000, all deposited into the shadowy crypto ATM at the corner. At least two people lost their life savings and, despondent, then took their own lives. It was usually elderly or lonely people roped in by an overseas crypto criminal masquerading as a romantic interest, or preying on a decline in cognitive function that leads people to become more easily scared, Schwering said. In some cases, scammers posed as government agents threatening to unleash the full power of the IRS. But that would all go away if victims would just go to a crypto machine and deposit $40,000. So the detective began visiting retirement homes and other community venues to educate people about the dangers posed by scammers wielding crypto ATMs. ""My job is to try to protect people, and it's very frustrating, Schwering said, specifically because the criminals are usually overseas and safely out of reach of arrest. ""So, we could at least change policy,"" he said. 

That's when Spokane Councilman Paul Dillon took up the cause, first championing a statewide ban that fizzled in the legislature. ""We wanted to see what levers we could pull locally,"" Dillon said. As Schwering continued to investigate crypto scams, Dillon proposed an ordinance banning crypto ATMs in the city. ""The compelling stories moved us into action. There are ideological differences on our city council, but the ban passed unanimously and I am proud,"" Dillon said. 

The resolution was implemented in June, and businesses have been using a grace period to remove the machines. The Spokane ban was one of the first in the nation, following a similar ordinance passed in Stillwater, Minnesota, after a resident was scammed there. ""We've received no complaints about the removal,"" Dillon said. He is hopeful that the legislature will pass a statewide ban in the next session (which begins Monday) which would stop the crypto ATMs from simply being relocated to neighboring municipalities. 

Schwering said a federal ban — something Dillion doesn't think is realistic given the Trump administration's crypto regulatory stance — is the ultimate answer, noting the city is only 20 minutes from the Idaho border. Meanwhile, several states spanning the political spectrum, including Arizona, Arkansas, and Vermont are tightening laws or considering additional restrictions on the ATMs. Other cities, like St. Paul, Minnesota, are considering outright bans similar to Spokane's.

The problem has gone nationwide, with a recent CNN report on crypto scammers using Circle K convenience stories across the country as a hub for this activity.

Some experts — especially ones working in the crypto industry — say that getting rid of the ATMs wouldn't eliminate fraud and there could be unintended consequences to wholesale removal. 

""Eliminating them may reduce certain fraud vectors, but it also removes one of the last public-access tools for financial privacy and cash-to-crypto conversion,"" said Alex Davis, founder and CEO of Mavryk, a blockchain company focused on real-world asset tokenization. ""The question isn't whether crypto ATMs should exist; it's whether society is comfortable with a future where every dollar must pass through a fully surveilled, fully permissioned gatekeeper."" 

Davis said that crypto ATMs persist not because they are the safest option, but because they solve a problem that the regulated financial system still doesn't: accessible, private, and frictionless movement of money. ""Fraud is a real concern, but focusing only on that misses the broader societal dynamic. A significant portion of the population still operates in a cash-heavy or underbanked economy, and for them, a crypto ATM is often the only bridge into digital assets,"" Davis said. 

He says the high fees — often 10% or more — aren't a feature of the technology, but a premium charged for privacy and immediacy. ""There is a segment of society that does not want every transaction surveilled or intermediated,"" Davis said, adding that traditional finance has increasingly shifted toward restrictive guardrails, escalating compliance friction, and a shrinking tolerance for anonymous economic activity. ""Crypto ATMs fill the gap that banks no longer service,"" Davis said. 

Jared Strasser, COO of The Crypto Company, a publicly traded blockchain and cryptocurrency firm, said crypto ATMs are serving a very narrow audience, but they exist for the same reason non-bank-owned ATMs have always existed: they serve people who need immediate access to funds, often at a higher cost. Strasser said crypto ATMs were often the first touchpoint people had with cryptocurrency. ""Years back in the U.S., these machines served an important purpose when there weren't many options to on-board into crypto at all. They were one of the only simple bridges between cash and digital assets,"" Strasser said.

The need for crypto ATMs has declined domestically, according to Strasser, as many people who hold bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies are not using them in a cash-equivalent manner. People who view crypto as an investment asset class are far less likely to interact with ATMs at all. ""That doesn't eliminate the use case for others, but it explains why these machines serve a narrower, more transactional audience,"" he said, adding it is this same transactional nature that makes them a hub for scams. 

""There is no question that crypto ATMs have become a magnet for scammers, largely because of speed and irreversibility. However, that risk does not mean the machines themselves lack legitimate value,"" he said, adding that the same pattern has existed with wire fraud, gift cards, and traditional ATMs for decades. 

Lev Breydo, an assistant professor of law at the William & Mary Law School who studies the impact of technological change on market infrastructure and financial instruments, sees the crypto ATM machines as a symptom of a larger problem. ""The high prevalence of BTMs [bitcoin teller machines] says a lot about America — and none of it particularly good. Simply put, BTMs reflect the intersection of folks locked out of the mechanics of the financial system,"" Breydo said. 

These customers are forced to rely on check cashing and have generally lost faith in mainstream financial instruments, so they turn to crypto. Breydo noted the U.S. is one of the few big markets that has tolerated BTMs within a regulatory framework (others, like the UK, have largely banned them). ""That regulatory clarity allowed BTMs to plug into a pre-existing U.S. ecosystem of check-cashing stores, payday lenders, money transmitters and independent ATM operators,"" he said. 

On the demand side, the U.S. is a vast market with a sizable underbanked population, a big remittance corridor and relatively high crypto adoption. It's this combination that explains why the United States has 80 percent of the world's crypto ATMs. ""In that sense, the machines are less a story about 'innovation' and more a mirror for deeper structural failures in our financial system and safety net,"" Breydo said. 

Strasser says all licensed bitcoin ATMs in the United States are required to implement KYC (know your customer) and AML (anti-money laundering) procedures under the Bank Secrecy Act. It is enforcement and education, not removal, according to Strasser, that will ultimately be needed to address the abuse. ""While the fraud issue is real, their value is not inherently erased by that risk; it reflects criminal exploitation of financial rails, not the purpose of the rails themselves,"" he said.  

But in Spokane, Schwering will continue to make the rounds of businesses, and if he finds a crypto ATM, he'll begin issuing citations. For Schwering, there are too many stories and sometimes the people being scammed don't believe they are being scammed. Family tried to intervene in one case of a senior citizen woman who kept sending money to a man overseas who started an online ""romance"" with her. He got a warrant and traced the address to Nigeria. The woman's family tried to intervene. But a year — and approximately $250,000 later — she was still sending money. ""There is an aspect of this where it would be too painful to believe it is not real and she didn't want to believe it. Some people will continue throwing good money after bad,"" Schwering said.

Oops, something went wrong

Ethereum's staking landscape has shifted sharply over the past month as institutional investors, led by BitMine and new ETFs, have saturated the network. 

This influx has created a logistical bottleneck, forcing new participants to wait roughly a month before their staked assets begin earning returns.

On January 9, blockchain analyst Ember CN reported that BitMine has moved more than 1 million ETH (over $3.2 billion) into Ethereum's proof-of-stake system over the past 30 days.

This single allocation, comprising roughly a quarter of BitMine's total corporate treasury, has swollen the entry queue to 1.7 million ETH, its highest level since 2023.

Meanwhile, this surge was also fueled by the arrival of regulated US financial products in the staking ecosystem.

Over the past week, the Grayscale Ethereum Staking ETF and 21Shares' TETH ETF distributed their first rounds of rewards. The payouts demonstrated that traditional investment vehicles can successfully pass protocol-level earnings to shareholders.

Notably, this institutional momentum comes even as the network's staking rewards have compressed significantly.

According to validator queue data, ETH's staking annual percentage rate (APR) dropped to an all-time low of 2.54% earlier this year before recovering slightly to 2.85% as of press time. Over the past year, the APR had averaged over 3.0%.

This data highlights that investors remain willing to stake their assets despite significantly lower returns.

Despite the influx of regulated US entities, ETH's staking control remains concentrated among a few incumbents.

According to data from Dune Analytics, decentralized autonomous organization Lido DAO retains dominance with 24% of all staked Ether, followed by Binance at 9.15% and Ether.fi at 6.3%. Coinbase, the largest US-based crypto trading platform, controls 5.08%.

Perhaps most significant is the persistence of anonymous actors. The Dune Analytics data also shows that untagged entities control about 27% of the network's total stake.

This leaves a significant share of Ethereum's security infrastructure in the hands of unidentified operators who face none of the compliance requirements that bind firms like BitMine.

Ethereum co-founder says ""PeerDAS"" and zk-proofs have finally broken the scaling ceiling, leaving Bitcoin's conservative design looking intentionally slow.

Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content.

A few years ago, the easiest way to explain Bitcoin to a newcomer was to keep it simple, slow, and sturdy.

Ten-minute blocks. Limited space. Everyone checks everything. Nobody gets special treatment.

That design is a feature. It is what makes Bitcoin feel like bedrock.

It is also why every bull market ends up replaying the same argument. Block space gets tight, fees jump, users complain, and builders promise solutions that live somewhere above the base layer.

This week, Vitalik Buterin showed up with a very different claim about Ethereum's future, one that lands directly on Bitcoin's turf.

In a post on X, he argued the blockchain “trilemma” is solved by pairing PeerDAS on mainnet with zkEVMs reaching “alpha” performance, while security work continues.

He sketched a 2026–2030 path where proofs increasingly replace re-execution as the way Ethereum validates blocks.

He also pointed to a third pillar: more distributed block building over time, so transaction inclusion is harder for a small club of builders to capture.

Vitalik Buterin outlines how Ethereum's world computer roadmap aims to challenge the subscription-based internet model

If you mostly live in Bitcoin land, it is tempting to shrug. Ethereum always has a roadmap, always has a new acronym, and Bitcoin keeps doing what it does.

This one deserves a closer look. It is less about another upgrade and more about shifting what a “decentralized network” can do, at least in theory, with code already shipping.

Ethereum's Fusaka upgrade activated on Dec. 3, 2025, at a specific mainnet slot. The Ethereum Foundation published the exact slot timing, and the headline feature was PeerDAS.

PeerDAS is one of those ideas that sounds abstract until you reduce it to a single question.

When a rollup posts data to Ethereum, how do we know that data is actually available to the network without requiring every node to download every byte?

PeerDAS answers with sampling.

Nodes subscribe to a small slice of the blob data. They check enough random pieces that the network gets a high-confidence guarantee the whole thing is there.

The math behind it uses erasure coding, so missing pieces can be reconstructed if enough of the full set exists.

The plain-English point is that Ethereum is trying to raise throughput while keeping the “regular node” workload from exploding.

Ethereum.org's own explanation says a default node receives roughly one-eighth of the original blob data under PeerDAS, because it listens to eight of 128 subnets, and blobs are extended for sampling.

That matters because bandwidth is one of the quiet killers of decentralization.

When the cost of staying synced climbs, home operators drop off. The network can look distributed while behaving like a handful of professional operators.

Fusaka also introduced something that feels small but can become huge over time: blob parameter-only forks.

These are preprogrammed mini-upgrades that adjust blob targets and maximums without the full drama of a traditional hard fork.

The idea is to let Ethereum raise blob capacity in steps as the network proves it can handle it.

The Ethereum Foundation published a schedule where BPO1 raised the blob target and max to 10 and 15 on Dec. 9, 2025. BPO2 is set to raise the target and max again to 14 and 21 on Jan. 7, 2026.

Coin Metrics framed this as the start of Ethereum treating blob throughput like a dial it can turn.

The report also notes that blobs had been running near the prior six-blob target and that blob fees often sat at 1 wei, a polite way of saying the market was barely charging for the resource.

That “barely charging” issue is why another EIP keeps showing up in the background.

It sets a reserve price so blob base fees do not collapse to near zero relative to execution costs.

If you are a Bitcoiner, this should already sound familiar.

Block space in Bitcoin is expensive because it is scarce, and scarcity is the point. Ethereum is trying to grow blob space for rollups without turning it into a free lunch that invites spam and centralizes validation.

The Fusaka upgrade cements Ethereum's modular vision: L1 as settlement, L2 as the user layer.

PeerDAS is live today. The zkEVM claim is about what happens next.

In December, the Ethereum Foundation published a second “Shipping an L1 zkEVM” update that is blunt about the shift in priorities: speed is no longer the main question. Provable security is.

The Foundation laid out milestones through 2026. That includes a target of 100-bit provable security by the end of May 2026 and 128-bit by the end of 2026, along with proof-size caps.

Here is why that matters for Bitcoin.

Bitcoin's base-layer security story is simple enough to explain at a dinner table. Miners hash, nodes verify, invalid blocks get rejected, and the network moves on.

Ethereum's story is trending toward a world where the network can accept far more activity because validators verify succinct proofs instead of replaying every step of execution themselves.

That is a different kind of trust. It is still decentralized in the sense that anyone can verify, but it leans more on cryptography, implementation correctness, and the economics of who produces proofs.

And it comes with a timeline.

Vitalik's post sketches 2026 as the year of big gas-limit increases driven by other upgrades, and the first real chances to run a zkEVM node.

He frames 2027–2030 as the window where zkEVM validation becomes the primary path for block validation.

Bitcoin does not need to “win” throughput. It needs to keep winning credibility.

For a long time, Bitcoin's strongest competitive edge has been decentralization plus a base layer that stays understandable, conservative, and brutally hard to change.

Ethereum's edge has been flexibility and a willingness to scale through new primitives, then lean on rollups to carry most user activity.

Those roads are now colliding.

If Ethereum can scale data availability while keeping node requirements bounded, and push proof-based validation without breaking trust assumptions, the market gets a second credible “settlement-style” network.

It would be able to handle high-bandwidth activity without looking like a permissioned data center.

That impacts Bitcoin in three ways.

Bitcoin fees spike when demand spikes. That is normal, and it is the market signal.

Ethereum is trying to make the rollup fee experience feel more like the internet: steady, cheap, and boring, by expanding blob capacity and smoothing the fee market.

If Ethereum succeeds, Bitcoin's block space remains premium. But the use cases that demand premium settlement may narrow toward high-value transfers, long-term custody moves, and settlement of layered systems.

A lot of crypto's “real world” pitch, tokenized dollars, on-chain equity, supply-chain settlement, lives or dies on cost and throughput.

Base's scaling write-up says its median fees fell from about $0.30 to fractions of a cent during frequent capacity increases. It also points to Ethereum's data availability roadmap, including PeerDAS and further blob increases, as the next unlock.

When that kind of user experience exists at scale, capital and builders follow. Bitcoin's role becomes more clearly monetary and less general-purpose.

Some Bitcoiners will call that a win. Others will see it as Ethereum absorbing the parts of crypto that attract mainstream users.

Bitcoin's risks concentrate in mining pools, ASIC supply chains, and regulation touching custodians and large intermediaries.

Calls for decentralization grow as Bitcoin's transaction security is challenged by central mining pools.

Ethereum's next risks concentrate in prover markets and block building, which Vitalik acknowledged by talking about distributed block building and mechanisms like inclusion lists.

On the Ethereum roadmap, the tools that show up here include enshrined proposer-builder separation, fork-choice-enforced inclusion lists, and block-level access lists. The goal is to keep scaling from handing control to a small set of professional actors.

Bitcoiners have seen this movie.

Scaling often shifts power somewhere else. The hardest part is keeping the system neutral when the tooling gets expensive.

Nobody gets to declare victory in crypto without a few “if” statements, and Ethereum's own sources are clear that zkEVM safety is still the main work.

So the honest way to cover this is with scenarios. The impact on Bitcoin changes depending on which path plays out.

Scenario one: slow and careful, fewer surprises. PeerDAS keeps expanding blob capacity through scheduled parameter forks. zkEVM security milestones take time, and proof-based validation remains optional longer than enthusiasts want.

In this world, Ethereum improves the fee experience for rollups. The market gradually treats ETH as the most scalable “credible neutral” settlement network outside Bitcoin.

Bitcoin remains the most conservative monetary base. The competitive tension stays ideological and investor-driven.

Scenario two: demand pulls the roadmap forward. Rollups soak up blob capacity quickly, usage stays high after each BPO step, and Ethereum keeps turning the dial upward.

In this world, the “cheap crypto UX” narrative consolidates around Ethereum's rollup stack. Bitcoin becomes even more clearly a settlement and savings layer.

The market starts asking whether Bitcoin's L2 ecosystem can offer a similar experience while retaining Bitcoin's social and technical conservatism.

Scenario three: zk proofs become normal, and the argument changes. Ethereum hits its security targets, proof verification becomes the default for validators, and higher gas limits become more feasible without raising hardware requirements for everyone.

In this world, Ethereum's claim to “high-bandwidth decentralization” becomes harder to dismiss. Bitcoin's differentiation leans harder on simplicity, immutability, and monetary policy.

The investor conversation shifts toward two base layers with different philosophies, rather than one base layer and a crowd of alt chains racing for speed.

The planned jump in capacity relies on a fragile shift to ZK-proof verification that could buckle under network stress.

Most users do not wake up excited about data availability sampling.

They wake up frustrated that moving money costs too much, or that a swap fails, or that a memecoin mint chews up a paycheck in fees.

Bitcoiners know this pain too, especially when the mempool gets crowded, and fees price out casual users.

Ethereum's promise here is a future where the base layer stays decentralized enough for ordinary validators, while the user experience happens on rollups with costs that feel like app fees, not settlement fees.

If that happens, it does not kill Bitcoin. It clarifies Bitcoin.

Bitcoin becomes the thing you trust when you want to exit the casino.

Ethereum becomes the network that tries to make the casino scale without collapsing into a single operator.

The risk is that Ethereum's path requires more moving parts, more cryptography, more sophisticated markets for building and proving blocks, and more chances for concentration to sneak in through the back door.

Vitalik all but says so when he highlights distributed block building as unfinished business.

Bitcoin's risk is different. It stays slow, it stays scarce, and it stays expensive when demand rises.

The industry keeps trying to rebuild the world on layers above it.

Vitalik's “trilemma solved” line is a headline. The substance is a roadmap, with real code already deployed on the data side and a hard security push on the proof side.

Bitcoin should care because the strongest argument for Bitcoin as crypto's only credibly neutral base layer weakens if Ethereum can scale without pricing out regular validators.

Bitcoin should also stay calm. Bitcoin's value proposition is not throughput.

It is restraint, predictability, and a base layer that remains legible under stress.

The more Ethereum evolves toward a high-bandwidth settlement fabric, the more Bitcoin's role as the conservative monetary anchor looks intentional rather than outdated.

That is the kind of competition crypto needs: two networks pushing different definitions of trust, and forcing the rest of the market to stop confusing speed with decentralization.

Ethereum is struggling to reclaim the $3,100 level as price action tightens and the market braces for a decisive move. After weeks of choppy trading, ETH remains caught between fading bullish attempts and persistent overhead resistance, leaving analysts sharply divided on what comes next. A minority still expects Ethereum to regain strength and eventually challenge its all-time highs, while the dominant narrative points toward a bearish 2026 marked by weaker demand and tighter liquidity conditions.

Amid this uncertainty, a CryptoQuant report offers a longer-term perspective that cuts through short-term noise. The analysis focuses on Ethereum's Accumulating Addresses Realized Price, a metric that tracks the average cost basis of addresses that consistently accumulate ETH rather than trade it actively. Unlike momentum indicators, this measure reflects where long-term participants are willing to commit capital over extended periods.

Notably, this accumulation cost has trended steadily higher since 2020. Even during the severe 2022–2023 drawdown, when ETH price corrected sharply, long-term holders largely held their ground instead of capitulating. That behavior established a durable foundation beneath the market.

Today, this realized price has stabilized in the $2,700–$2,800 range, effectively forming a structural cost zone for Ethereum. As ETH hovers just above this area, the market faces a critical question: whether this long-term support continues to anchor price, or if shifting macro conditions finally challenge a regime that has held for years.

Ethereum Long-Term Accumulation Regime Faces a Critical Test

The report argues that the debate around Ethereum is shifting. The key issue is no longer whether the $2,700–$2,800 accumulation zone holds in the short term, but whether this long-standing accumulation regime can persist indefinitely. According to data from CryptoQuant, Ethereum stands out sharply from the broader altcoin market when viewed through this lens.

Since 2022, most altcoins have suffered deep drawdowns without ever forming a durable accumulation cost base. That absence of consistent long-term buying helps explain why recoveries across the altcoin complex have been weaker and more fragile. Ethereum, by contrast, has repeatedly demonstrated an ability to retain long-term holder conviction through multiple stress periods, including 2018, 2020, 2022, and even the volatility seen in 2025.

However, markets evolve, and structural regimes do not last forever. Periods of apparent stability are often when underlying assumptions are most vulnerable to change. From a forward-looking perspective, two scenarios stand out.

As long as ETH price trades near or above its accumulation cost, it signals that long-term buyers remain engaged, reinforcing Ethereum's relative resilience compared with most altcoins. On the other hand, a sustained break below this cost zone would imply a meaningful behavioral shift among long-term holders—one that could challenge the idea that Ethereum has permanently escaped its pre-2020 valuation framework.

In today's environment, short-term price swings dominate attention, but it is this structural battle beneath the surface that may ultimately define Ethereum's next major cycle.

Price Consolidates as Bulls Defend the $3,000 Zone

Ethereum is currently consolidating around the $3,100 level after failing to reclaim higher resistance zones, reflecting a market caught between stabilization and continuation risk. The chart shows ETH trading below its short- and medium-term moving averages, with the 50-day and 100-day averages now acting as dynamic resistance rather than support. This shift confirms that the broader structure remains corrective following the rejection from the $4,000–$4,200 region earlier in the cycle.

Notably, the $3,000–$3,100 area has emerged as a critical pivot. Price has repeatedly defended this zone, suggesting the presence of demand and short-term accumulation. However, upside momentum remains limited, as each bounce has been met with selling pressure near descending moving averages. This behavior is typical of markets attempting to form a base after a prolonged drawdown rather than initiating a clean trend reversal.

From a structural perspective, ETH remains above the long-term moving average, which continues to slope upward. This indicates that the broader macro trend has not fully broken down, even though short-term momentum is weak. Volume has also declined during recent rebounds, reinforcing the idea that buyers lack conviction.

For bulls, a sustained reclaim of the $3,300 level would be required to shift momentum and challenge the bearish structure. Until then, Ethereum appears locked in a consolidation phase, with downside risks persisting if the $3,000 support fails to hold.

It was all going so well. 

Investors started 2026 by throwing over $1.5 billion in fresh cash at Bitcoin and Ethereum US exchange-traded funds over the space of two days. 

The price of the two largest digital coins by market cap rose following the investment. But now, both assets are both lying flat after investors this week pulled $1.3 billion out of the Bitcoin funds and $351 million from their Ethereum counterparts, according to data from Farside Investors. 

Bitcoin was recently priced at nearly $90,623, up 1% over the past week. Ethereum was trading for $3,093, unmoved over a seven-day period. It traded as high as $3,293 mid-week. 

The ETF redemptions come after a good start to the year following weeks of negative flows. 

Crypto markets ended 2025 in the red after struggling to recover from a massive October sell-off when over $19 billion in leveraged positions were liquidated — the largest such liquidation event in the history of digital assets. 

Despite notching new highs in 2025 off the back of pro-crypto US President Donald Trump's victory and subsequent digital asset legislation, both Bitcoin and Ethereum are now trading well below their records. 

Still, investors need to pay attention to the bigger picture, market observers this week told DL News, with the debasement trade — a strategy to hedge against weakening currencies — likely to still be in play this year. 

Investors were particularly focused on Bitcoin along with gold and other precious metals as part of the trade in 2025. Experts have said the move is likely to be a long-term strategy as the US and other major economies take on more debt. 

Investors in the US can now easily buy exposure to crypto via the ETFs, approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission in 2024, and managed by major asset managers like BlackRock, Fidelity and Grayscale. 

Other major digital assets such as XRP and Solana were up 4% over a seven-day period, trading for $2.09 and $136, respectively.

Key Takeaways

Crypto investors didn't retreat in 2025; they repositioned.

Despite market volatility and shifting narratives, billions of dollars continued to pour into digital assets, with capital rotating away from Bitcoin (BTC) and toward a small group of dominant altcoins.

New data from CoinShares  shows how investor priorities evolved over the year—and which networks captured the lion's share of that shift.

Bitcoin inflows declined 35% year over year to $26.9 billion, even as price corrections drove $105 million into short-Bitcoin products, indicating more sophisticated hedging strategies.

Rather than exiting the market, investors increasingly rotated capital into newly launched altcoin investment products, including Solana (SOL) and XRP ETFs, which debuted in the third quarter of last year.

This shift suggests that Bitcoin is no longer viewed as the sole anchor of crypto portfolios, as investors seek higher growth opportunities across alternative networks.

Ethereum (ETH) led the rotation, recording $12.7 billion in inflows, a 138% year-over-year (YoY) increase, driven by continued ecosystem upgrades, staking demand, and expanding DeFi use cases.

XRP followed with a 500% YoY surge to $3.7 billion, supported by legal clarity and renewed enterprise adoption.

Solana posted the sharpest growth, with inflows jumping 1,000% YoY to $3.6 billion, reflecting strong interest in high-throughput applications, NFTs, and gaming.

In contrast, the broader altcoin category outside these major tokens saw inflows fall 30% YoY to $318 million, pointing to a selective, “winner-takes-most” environment where capital concentrates around proven networks.

Overall, the data suggests a maturing market where investors favor utility-driven blockchains rather than speculative breadth.

The United States remained the powerhouse of crypto investments, capturing $47.2 billion in inflows, though this marked a 12% YoY decline from 2024. 

This dominance reflects the U.S.'s robust ETF ecosystem and regulatory clarity, but the slowdown hints at potential saturation or shifting global sentiments. 

Notably, Europe showed signs of revival as Germany shifted from $43 million in outflows in 2024 to a substantial $2.5 billion in inflows, signaling a renewed investor appetite that may have been fueled by improving economic conditions or favorable policy shifts.

Canada mirrored this turnaround, moving from $603 million outflows to $1.1 billion inflows, while Switzerland posted a steady $775 million, up 11.5% YoY, highlighting its role as a stable hub for crypto products. 

These regional shifts suggest a broadening of the investor base beyond North America, with Europe emerging as a key growth area in 2025.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=altcoins","Altcoins Reach 50% of Crypto Volume, Beating Both Bitcoin and Ethereum","https://coinpaper.com/13658/altcoins-reach-50-of-crypto-volume-beating-both-bitcoin-and-ethereum","Sat, 10 Jan 2026 14:07:01 GMT","

Altcoins now account for 50% of crypto trading volume as Bitcoin trades near $90,600 and capital rotates into higher-beta assets.

Bitcoin traded around $90,600 as of writing, posting a slight weekly gain of 1.05% while remaining locked in a narrow $89,000–$94,000 range. Price stability at these levels has coincided with a sharp change in trading behavior across the crypto market. 

As Bitcoin paused, traders redirected activity toward alternative cryptos, driving a notable surge in altcoin trading volume.

Market data as of January 10 shows that altcoins now account for roughly 50% of total cryptocurrency trading volume. Bitcoin represents about 27% of activity, while Ethereum contributes close to 23%. This marks the first time in several months that altcoins have exceeded the combined trading share of the two largest digital assets.

Source: CryptoQuant

The shift reflects rotation rather than capital flight. Total market participation remains elevated, yet liquidity has moved toward higher-volatility assets that tend to outperform during consolidation phases. 

Historical patterns show similar volume rotations when Bitcoin trades sideways after a strong rally. What stands out this time? The speed of the transition has caught traders' attention.

Source: X

Several altcoins have posted outsized gains during this period. Polygon rallied more than 50% on the week following its Open Money Stack launch, drawing fresh speculative interest. Solana-based memecoins also gained traction, with BONK rising 28% as decentralized exchange activity surged.

Binance ecosystem tokens participated as well. BNB advanced about 3.4% over seven days amid reports of Binance expanding operations across Asia. These moves helped lift the Altcoin Season Index from December lows, signaling increasing momentum toward non-Bitcoin assets.

Despite the volume surge, Bitcoin dominance by market cap remains elevated at 58.51%. This divergence between volume and market cap suggests short-term trading activity rather than a structural leadership change. Is this rotation tactical rather than transformative? Current data points in that direction.

Ethereum continues to act as the liquidity backbone for altcoin markets. Daily trading volume near $15.2 billion still exceeds Solana's $2.1 billion by a wide margin. However, ETF data reveals a contrasting trend. On January 9, U.S. spot ETH ETFs recorded $93.82 million in net outflows, marking the third consecutive day of withdrawals.

Source: X

Grayscale's ETHE shed another $10 million, while BlackRock's ETHA led exits with nearly $85 million. These flows align with profit-taking following Ethereum's 113% rebound from April 2025 lows. ETF assets under management now sit about 7.6% below their December peak, which has limited near-term price discovery.

On-chain data from CoinCodex shows altcoins outperforming Bitcoin in the short term, supported by rising volumes in DeFi, memecoins, and infrastructure tokens. At the same time, institutional exposure remains concentrated in Bitcoin and Ethereum through regulated products.

The Fear and Greed Index sits near 41, signaling neutral sentiment rather than euphoria. Bitcoin trades below its 200-day simple moving average and shows muted momentum despite price stability. These conditions often encourage traders to seek higher returns elsewhere, reinforcing the current volume imbalance.

Trading volume dominance has historically preceded broader capital rotation phases, yet it has not guaranteed sustained altcoin rallies. Analysts note that Ethereum often leads these cycles, followed by large-cap altcoins before smaller tokens participate.

 For now, volume concentration remains selective, not broad-based.

If Bitcoin breaks decisively from its range, the balance could change quickly. Until then, altcoins appear to hold the trading spotlight, even as Bitcoin retains its market cap crown. How long can this split dynamic last? Market structure over the coming weeks may provide the answer.

As of January 10, trading volume data shows that altcoins now account for more than 50% of all cryptocurrency trading activity. The trading volume of altcoins has surpassed the combined share of Bitcoin at 27% and Ethereum at 23%.

On-chain data from CoinMarketCap indicate that altcoins are currently outperforming Bitcoin in the short term. The change suggests that traders are shifting toward riskier assets in an effort to increase profits.

Altcoins have experienced significant market gains over the past month. Ripple's UK FCA registration drove XRP to a 5.01% weekly gain. XRP is currently trading at $2.09, representing a 4.52% increase from the previous month. The digital asset has a 24-hour trading volume of $3.02 billion, down 25.06%.

Solana-based memecoins, such as WHITEWHALE, gained 250% despite record DEX volumes. Currently, the WHITEWHALE memecoin is trading at $0.1459, up 17,354.97% in the last month. The memecoin has a 24-hour trading volume of $45.77 million, which is up 32.92%. 

Additionally, BONK memecoin recorded a 28% weekly increase, and SHIB reached a 15% rise, capturing speculative interest.

Binance ecosystem tokens, such as BNB, performed better last week, driven by news of the company's expansion in Asia. On-chain data from CoinGecko show that BNB is currently trading at $902.51, up 1.4% in the last 24 hours and 3.4% in the previous seven days, and outperforming the broader crypto market's 0.35% dip.

High-beta alternatives are attracting capital due to regulatory clarity and the memecoin frenzy.

Polygon (POL) had a weekly increase of 52.4%, following the introduction of its Open Money Stack for fiat-crypto transactions.  The framework is designed to help financial institutions and fintech businesses move money on-chain more efficiently by providing a comprehensive yet adaptable system for payments and settlements. 

In the last 24 hours, Polygon's price increased by 2.78% to 0.21. Its trading volume increased by 144.94% to $1.27 million.

Other high-beta tokens also gained, highlighting strong speculative interest across DeFi markets.

DeFi aggregator Beefy (BIFI) saw a gain of 29.7% in the last seven days. This demonstrated sector movement into utility-driven alternatives, in contrast to Bitcoin's +1.11% weekly return.

 BIFI is currently trading at $193.20, representing a 9.1% increase over the previous 24 hours. The DeFi aggregator reached a 24-hour trading volume of $43,804,596.

According to data from CoinMarketCap, the CMC Altcoin Season Index increased to 38/100 (from 27 the previous week), indicating rising altcoin momentum but remaining in neutral territory, while Bitcoin dominance remained at 58.51%. 

Capital rotation into alternative assets is reflected in this change, with ASI's 37% weekly increase representing the quickest improvement since September 2025.

Bitcoin (BTC) is currently trading at approximately $90,534.18, representing a 0.6% increase over the last day. Despite the rise, momentum is still muted. The Fear and Greed Index is at 41 (Neutral), a rise from 38 last week and 30 last month. 

BTC is also trading below its 200-day simple moving average and is down approximately 7% year-over-year.

The market cap dominance of Ethereum dropped to 12.05%, down 0.71% month-over-month.

In the midst of constant Bitcoin prices in $89–$94K range, traders are pursuing higher-beta trades. Ethereum remains the liquidity anchor for alternative markets, even as it controls liquidity and potentially restricts its own growth. Its 24-hour volume of $15.24 billion still surpasses Solana's $2.1 billion. 

Ethereum is currently trading at $3,087.74, representing a 3.85% decrease from last month.

On January 9, SoSoValue data revealed that there were $93.82 million in net withdrawals from U.S. spot ETH ETFs, marking the third consecutive day. Grayscale's ETHE lost an additional $10 million, while BlackRock's ETHA led exits (-$84.69 million).

Early investors are collecting profits following ETH's 113% recovery from its April 2025 lows. Price discovery is hindered by the $17.91 billion ETF AUM, which remains 7.6% below its December peak.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=blockchain","Crypto Market Structure Bill Update: Blockchain Association CEO Highlights Key Developments","https://bitcoinist.com/blockchain-association-ceo-crypto-market-structure/","Sat, 10 Jan 2026 02:00:06 GMT","

As the US Congress gears up to mark up the long-awaited crypto market structure bill on January 15, industry representatives are actively engaging in discussions regarding the critical elements of this legislation. 

Summer Mersinger, CEO of the Blockchain Association, highlighted important points concerning the state of the bill and the ongoing negotiations among lawmakers in a recent social media post on X (formerly Twitter).

Mersinger described the upcoming markup as a pivotal moment for digital asset legislation, emphasizing the significance of the moment for US leadership in the crypto space. 

While she expressed gratitude to Senate leadership for their efforts, she underscored the necessity of addressing several “non-negotiable issues” to ensure that the bill remains durable, workable, and supportive of innovation.

One of the primary concerns Mersinger raised was the need for developer protections. She argued that the builders of peer-to-peer (P2P), open-source technologies should not be classified as financial intermediaries, making it essential for the inclusion of the BRCA (Blockchain Regulatory Compliance Act) in the market structure bill. 

Additionally, Mersinger highlighted the need to amend “outdated laws,” which she alleges poses risks of meritless criminal prosecutions for developers simply writing code for non-custodial technologies.

Another critical point made by Mersinger is the preservation of decentralized finance (DeFi). She emphasized that DeFi must not be legislated out of existence, stating that open and decentralized innovation is vital for US competitiveness in the global market. 

She stressed that more than 110 organizations and companies have voiced similar sentiments, as illustrated by an August 2025 letter sent to the Senate advocating for developer protections.

Stablecoin policy also emerged as a significant topic in Mersinger's remarks. She urged Congress to safeguard a bipartisan compromise established in the GENIUS Act, warning against measures that would impose yield bans, which could constrain lawful rewards and favor large banking institutions over new entrants to the market. 

Mersinger stressed that market structure reforms should facilitate competition between emerging players and legacy institutions, rather than entrench existing advantages.

Mersinger's statement comes on the heels of insights shared by crypto journalist Eleanor Terret who recently disclosed that the Senate Banking Committee plans to pass the bill next week, after which it will be merged with the Senate Agriculture Committee's portion before heading to the Senate floor for a full vote. 

Should this process proceed smoothly, the bill could reach President Trump's desk for signing, with Terret estimating that this could happen as early as March. However, she cautioned that if the House decides to make amendments to the Senate's version, the timeline could extend into the summer.

Vitalik Buterin now compares Ethereum to the Linux system, a symbol of free software. The co-founder of the blockchain wants to transform his network into a universal, open infrastructure without intermediaries. We give you all the details in this article.

For Vitalik Buterin, Ethereum embodies the future of Web3. In his eyes, the crypto blockchain indeed plays the same role as Linux: an open source foundation on which anyone can build their own solutions.

Linux has allowed billions of people and companies to access digital tools without depending on large corporations. Ethereum continues this logic in finance, governance, and even digital identity.

Specifically, the goal is to offer users the full power of the main network without intermediaries. This approach makes Ethereum an open platform. Developers create smart contracts and decentralized applications capable of handling billions of transactions.

According to L2Beat, the Ethereum ecosystem already counts more than 127 active Layer 2 solutions. These solutions aim to improve network scalability by reducing transaction costs.

But this diversity fuels a debate. Some welcome modularity that stimulates innovation. Others fear fragmentation that harms interoperability and liquidity sharing.

Most however agree that the richness of this architecture lies in the freedom to experiment. A flexibility illustrating the strategy of an Ethereum ready to evolve towards a multi-chain model while preserving its open source DNA.

The comparison between Ethereum and Linux therefore highlights an ambition: to build a global decentralized crypto network governed by its community. If successful, Ethereum could become the backbone of Web3, a free Internet where value and identity circulate without intermediaries.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=blockchain","New BlackRock report exposes a historic shift in crypto that leaves only one blockchain controlling the settlement layer","https://cryptoslate.com/blackrock-stablecoin-ethereum-settlement-standard-2026/","Sat, 10 Jan 2026 12:05:00 GMT","

Stablecoins are going mainstream, and Ethereum is positioning itself as the place those dollars ultimately settle.

Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content.

Stablecoins used to be a crypto convenience, a way to park dollars between trades without touching fiat. However, the industry has matured enough that BlackRock now treats them as foundational rails for the market.

In its 2026 Global Outlook, the BlackRock Investment Institute argued that stablecoins are widening beyond exchanges and becoming integrated into mainstream payment systems. It also said they could expand in cross-border transfers and day-to-day use in emerging markets.

That framing matters because it shifts the question investors ask, especially when it comes from a name as big as BlackRock.

The point here isn't whether stablecoins are good for crypto. The question is whether they're on track to become a settlement rail that sits beside, and sometimes inside, traditional finance.

If they do, which blockchains will end up acting like the base layer for final settlement, collateral, and tokenized cash?

BlackRock puts the stakes bluntly. “Stablecoins are no longer niche,” the report quotes Samara Cohen, BlackRock's global head of market development.

They're “becoming the bridge between traditional finance and digital liquidity.”

Stablecoins began thriving on crypto volatility. Markets swing, banks close on weekends, and exchanges rely on a patchwork of fiat rails for redemptions.

Dollar-pegged tokens solved that operational problem by giving traders a 24/7 unit of account and settlement asset.

BlackRock's emphasis is that stablecoins have now outgrown that niche. The firm said integration into mainstream payment systems and cross-border payments is a natural next step, especially where latency, fees, and correspondent banking friction remain stubbornly high.

One reason the timing feels right is regulatory. In the US, the GENIUS Act was signed into law on July 18, 2025, creating a federal framework for payment stablecoins, including reserve and disclosure requirements.

The law is signed, but the real fight starts in rulemaking and phased rollouts through 2026–27. Here's the timeline, the winners, and how flows could reroute crypto rails.

That kind of legal clarity doesn't guarantee mass adoption. But it changes the risk calculus for banks, large merchants, and payment networks that have to answer to compliance teams and regulators.

The market's scale is also no longer theoretical. Total stablecoin value stood around $298 billion as of Jan. 5, 2026, with USDT and USDC still dominating the stack.

BlackRock's report, using CoinGecko data through Nov. 27, 2025, notes stablecoins hit record highs in market cap even as crypto prices fluctuated. It highlights their role as the system's primary source of “dollar liquidity and on-chain stability.”

That combination of legal recognition and sheer size is why stablecoins have started to show up in places they never used to, like the back office of global payments.

Visa offered a concrete example in December 2025. The company said it had launched USDC settlement in the US, allowing issuer and acquirer partners to settle with Visa in Circle's dollar stablecoin.

Visa said initial banking participants settled over Solana. It framed the move as a way to modernize its settlement layer with faster movement of funds, seven-day availability, and resilience across weekends and holidays.

Stablecoins are moving into the part of finance that's usually invisible until it breaks: settlement.

If stablecoins are now effectively digital dollars, the next question is where those dollars live as the system scales.

As stablecoins move toward more complex uses, such as collateral, treasury management, tokenized money-market funds, and cross-border netting, the base layer matters more than marketing. That layer needs predictable finality, deep liquidity, robust tooling, and a governance and security model institutions can trust for decades, not just a cycle.

This is where Ethereum could step in.

Ethereum's value proposition in 2026 isn't that it's the cheapest chain for sending a stablecoin. Plenty of networks compete there, and Visa's Solana pilot is a reminder that high-throughput chains have a seat at the table.

The case for Ethereum is that it has become the anchor layer for an ecosystem that treats execution and settlement as separate functions.

Ethereum's own documentation makes that explicit in the context of rollups, where Ethereum acts as the settlement layer that anchors security and provides objective finality if disputes occur on another chain.

So when users move fast and cheap on L2s, the base chain still plays referee. The more valuable the activity being settled, the more valuable the referee role becomes.

BlackRock's stablecoin section is also a tokenization story. The report describes stablecoins as a “modest but meaningful step toward a tokenized financial system,” where digital dollars coexist with, and sometimes reshape, traditional channels of intermediation and policy transmission.

Tokenization turns that abstract idea into a balance-sheet reality. It means issuing a claim on a real-world asset, such as a Treasury bill fund, on a blockchain.

Stablecoins then serve as the cash leg for subscriptions, redemptions, and secondary-market trading.

On that front, Ethereum is still the center of gravity. RWA.xyz shows Ethereum hosting about $12.5 billion in tokenized real-world assets, roughly a 65% market share as of Jan. 5, 2026.

BlackRock itself helped build that gravitational pull. Its tokenized money-market fund, BUIDL, debuted on Ethereum and later expanded to multiple chains, including Solana and several Ethereum L2s, as tokenized Treasuries became one of the clearest real-world use cases for on-chain finance.

Even on a multi-chain footprint, the institutional pattern is telling: start where liquidity, custody integrations, and smart contract standards are most mature, then extend outward as distribution channels develop.

JPMorgan has been moving in the same direction. The bank launched a tokenized money-market fund with shares represented by digital tokens on Ethereum.

It accepted subscriptions in cash or USDC and tied the push partly to the stablecoin regulatory shift that followed the GENIUS Act.

This suggests stablecoins don't just need a fast network for payments. They also need a credible settlement fabric for tokenized collateral, yield-bearing cash equivalents, and institutional-grade finance.

Ethereum has become the default answer to that need, not because it wins every benchmark, but because it has become the settlement court where the most valuable cases are heard.

BlackRock's outlook includes caution embedded in the opportunity. In emerging markets, it notes stablecoins could broaden dollar access while challenging monetary control if domestic currency use declines.

That's a political economy problem, not a tech problem. It's also the kind that can trigger restrictive policy responses in exactly the places where stablecoins have product-market fit.

There are also issuer risks. Stablecoins aren't all the same, and market structure can turn on trust.

S&P Global Ratings downgraded its assessment of Tether's reserves in November 2025, citing concerns about limited transparency. It was a reminder that the stability of the system can hinge on what sits behind the peg.

Despite a downgrade from S&P, Tether's gold and Bitcoin stockpile is seen as strength by crypto markets.

Ethereum also isn't guaranteed to be the only settlement layer that matters. Visa's USDC settlement work shows large players are willing to route stablecoin settlement over other chains when it fits their operational needs.

Circle positions USDC as natively supported across dozens of networks, a strategy that makes stablecoin liquidity portable and reduces dependence on any single chain.

But portability cuts both ways. As stablecoins spread, the premium shifts to layers that can provide credible settlement, integration with tokenized assets, and a security model strong enough to persuade institutions they can park real cash and real collateral on-chain without waking up to a governance surprise.

That's why ETH is a likely wager on the settlement standard for tokenized dollars. If stablecoins are becoming what BlackRock says they are, a bridge between traditional finance and digital liquidity, the bridge still needs bedrock.

In the current architecture of the crypto market, Ethereum is the bedrock most institutions keep returning to.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=nft","Top 10 NFT Trends Transforming the German Market","https://www.analyticsinsight.net/nfts/top-10-nft-trends-transforming-the-german-market","Sat, 10 Jan 2026 07:30:00 GMT","

Germany is witnessing rapid institutional adoption as banks and funds explore regulated NFT-based investments.

Regulatory clarity is improving, giving creators and buyers more confidence in NFT usage and taxation.

NFTs are expanding far beyond art — now integrated into gaming, identity, virtual real estate, and corporate branding.

The NFT ecosystem is growing in Germany, from a flurry of speculative hype to a structured, utility-driven adoption. Interest in digital ownership continues to rise, driven by improved regulatory frameworks, the expansion of blockchain-based gaming, and growing institutional involvements. As the landscape matures, NFTs are evolving from being just artistic collectables to functional tools for finance, identity, and corporate engagement across the German digital economy.

Here are the top 10 NFT trends:

Germany's growing, more organized regulatory environment will provide greater assurance to all participants, such as creators, platforms, and investors, thereby fostering trust and participation in Germany's NFT ecosystem. With enhanced guidance from regulatory agencies on classification and compliance, the entire Web3 marketplace will be able to develop responsibly.

German tax authorities have been refining policies regarding NFTs when digital assets serve as certificates, access tokens, or utility-based products. Consistent taxation rules enable superior planning for creators and collectors operating in a regulated economy.

Cities like Berlin, Hamburg, and Munich are driving the vibrant digital art community. NFT technology offers additional distribution channels, monetization opportunities, and access to global audiences to artists. Digital exhibitions and galleries that specialize in blockchain technology have continued to gain traction in Germany.

Sustainability is at the core of Germany's technological culture. Adopting energy-efficient or green blockchains, it reflects the nation's environmental values, laying the foundation for eco-friendly NFT creation and trading as a key aspect of long-term local market growth.

Blockchain gaming represents one of the fastest-growing sectors in Germany's digital economy. NFTs enable players to hold skins, items, and characters across multiple ecosystems. Recent play-to-earn models and interoperable game assets are further enhancing engagement within the gaming community.

Metaverse projects in Germany continue to expand, from running virtual events to showroom experiences and digital city frameworks. NFTs represent ownership of virtual real estate, identity avatars, and collectable digital assets that can build immersive online economies.

Major German brands and sports organizations are increasingly adopting NFTs to improve fan interaction and loyalty. They can take the form of digital collectables, membership tokens, or brand-related virtual assets. This way, NFTs create a pathway to connect with brands, whether corporate entities or sports teams, through opportunities of interaction.

Decentralized autonomous organizations are increasingly gaining popularity within the German Web3 communities. DAOs represent shared governance structures that allow transparent decision-making and the collective development of projects across collaborative ecosystems.

With the regulatory framework for NFT transactions and development continuing to gain momentum, institutional investors are finding more interest in these assets. As a result, investment firms are now looking to include NFTs in their diversified portfolios and digital asset portfolios. Moreover, there is a growing attention to professionalizing NFT participation.

NFTs increasingly support solutions for digital identity, certification systems, membership verification, and educational credentials. In addition to art and collectables, NFTs are an area where people can be confident and trusting of Germany's digital space.

The crypto market has just found its feet in 2026 but the tune has already shifted.  It can be felt by any person who follows crypto conversation on the internet: the optimistic air of the previous year is quickly wearing out.  Shareholders are becoming impatient with concepts that have good sound but slow delivery. What matters now is proof.

Top experts note that speculative tokens are now losing investor attention as volatility increases, commodities like Silver spearhead new bull runs and regulations become stricter.  Capital is shifting to systems that address actual issues, in particular, linking crypto tools to daily financial services.

With crypto becoming increasingly closer to mainstream usage, utility-oriented platforms are taking over the dialogue, and the disparity between promise and performance is becoming too difficult to overlook. Let's do a deep dive into two emerging altcoins: Bitcoin Hyper and Remittix that are currently at the forefront of every watchlist today.

On one side of the ring, we have Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER). Late last year, this project was everywhere, promising to revolutionize blockchain technology with a Layer-2 solution designed to make Bitcoin faster and cheaper. It followed a classic high-hype presale model, and for a moment, it looked like the Best Crypto To Buy Now.

However, as we settle into 2026, the cracks are starting to show. While the concept of boosting Bitcoin's utility is sound, market sentiment can be fickle. The presale price has been creeping up, but on-chain activity suggests that whale interest is cooling off.

Analysts are concerned that without a concrete product launch to match Remittix's February rollout, HYPER might be relying too heavily on the “Bitcoin” brand name rather than its own merit.

Bitcoin Hyper remains a high-risk, high-reward play. If the crypto bull run goes parabolic, HYPER could certainly catch a bid. But with crypto regulation looming and investors demanding transparency, the lack of a live app or confirmed platform launch date makes it a riskier bet compared to its utility-focused competitors.

Let's be real, most presales are smoke and mirrors. Remittix (RTX)  is breaking that mold by positioning itself as a legitimate financial ecosystem rather than just another speculative token. The biggest piece of crypto news hitting the wires this week is the official confirmation that the Remittix Crypto-to-Fiat PayFi platform launches on February 9th, 2026.

This isn't a “coming soon” tease. The RTX wallet is already live on the App Store (with Android dropping any day now), proving the developers are executing ahead of schedule. This move toward actual utility, allowing users to bridge digital assets to real-world bank accounts, is exactly what analysts look for when determining the Best Crypto To Buy Now.

For crypto investors tired of waiting for “the next big thing,” Remittix is delivering it next month.

The biggest news the Remittix community is talking about as we enter the New Year fully, is a significant update on the part of the team: the much-desired 200% bonus that sold out in just a couple of days last time it was offered has just come back.

The offer made this time is limited however, since it is estimated that only 5,000,000 tokens are assigned to the New Year round so one should start early in their participation or else there are chances of going into the year 2026 without momentum. The bonus will be activated with the help of the promo code RTX2026 once the investor checks out, but it will have no extensions or reopenings as soon as the allocation is filled, the opportunity is lost.

Bitcoin Hyper may appeal to investors bullish on Bitcoin scaling solutions, but it carries higher risk and depends heavily on execution, adoption, and broader market conditions.

It will be based on your objectives, but utility-based initiatives such as Remittix, which have already been confirmed to launch products (Feb 9th) and have bonuses running will currently be ranking higher than speculative coins.

They have the potential to be very profitable when you are early enough, but they are risky; you should seek audited teams (such as CertiK audits) and working products.

House Financial Institutions Committee members listen to experts testify on HB 1116 on Tuesday. Virtual currency kiosks are often the catalyst for cryptocurrency scams. Photo by Wynn Wellington, TheStatehouseFile.com.

Hoosiers lost more than $125 million at cryptocurrency kiosks in 2024. Technology allows scams to run rampant—“particularly, they are on steroids because of cryptocurrency,” said Sergeant Nathan VanCleave of the Evansville Police Department, who spoke Tuesday at the House Financial Institutions Committee.

It met at the Statehouse to hear House Bill 1116, which aims to increase the regulation of these kiosks and specifically targets and prevent fraud.

Virtual currency kiosks, commonly known as Bitcoin ATMs, have been around for over 10 years and have grown in popularity. These kiosks offer an in-person way to buy and sell digital currency with cash, credit cards and debit cards. They can be found in many convenience stores, gas stations and grocery stores.

People can insert a card or cash into the machine, and their selected amount of money is transferred to a digital wallet as cryptocurrency. Someone may choose to use cryptocurrency as a way to invest their money, make secure online payments or hold their money outside a centralized bank.

Cryptocurrency kiosks provide an opportunity for money investment without the need for a bank account. But transactions are often irreversible, making it easier for scammers to take advantage of vulnerable populations.

“We are currently living in a scam-demic,” said VanCleave, who works in the Financial Crimes Unit and has specialized training and certificates in cryptocurrency and tracing cryptocurrency.

Scammers contact people in a variety of ways, such as through phone calls, text messages and emails, claiming that the victim must transfer money at a specified virtual currency kiosk and creating a false sense of urgency.

HB 1116, authored by Rep. Wendy McNamara, R-Evansville, aims to strengthen the protection of consumers when using virtual currency kiosks and focuses on scam prevention. The bill would provide additional regulations for kiosk operators, such as requiring them to be licensed in Indiana as money transmitters and imposing a daily $1,000 transaction limit and 3% fee cap.

Operators fall under federal regulation but have very little oversight by the state. Nine people, including two advocates from different kiosk companies, shared their support for the regulations outlined in the bill.

Clara Wulfsen, associate director of government affairs for CoinFlip, said she agrees with 95% of the bill and believes state regulation is needed, but she called for amendments regarding transaction limits and fee caps.

The manager of governmental relations for Bitcoin Depot, Michael Geiselhart, also emphasized her concerns, stating that a 3% cap would be an “eviction notice” for kiosk companies.

Because the kiosks are privately owned, their upkeep incurs costs that regular ATMs do not have. The 3% cap would significantly decrease the profit margin for operators in Indiana, potentially forcing them to remove their machines.

Regardless of the disagreements around fee caps, the testifiers all agreed that some change is needed.

“We need something on a statewide level matching what 20 other states have already done,” said VanCleave.

Further discussion of the bill will take place in the committee next week.

Astronomers analyzing fresh observations from NASA's Hubble Space Telescope and several ground-based observatories have uncovered clear signs that a recently identified companion star is shaping the environment around Betelgeuse. The study, led by researchers at the Center for Astrophysics | Harvard & Smithsonian (CfA), shows that the companion star, called Siwarha, is generating a dense stream of gas as it moves through Betelgeuse's enormous outer atmosphere. This newly observed structure helps explain the unusual and long-running changes seen in the giant star's brightness and atmospheric behavior.

The findings were announced at a news conference during the 247th meeting of the American Astronomical Society in Phoenix and have been accepted for publication in The Astrophysical Journal.

Eight Years of Observations Reveal a Stellar Wake

Researchers identified the influence of Siwarha by carefully measuring subtle changes in Betelgeuse's light over nearly eight years. These long-term observations revealed the effects of a companion star that had previously been suspected but not confirmed. As the companion moves through Betelgeuse's outer layers, it disrupts the surrounding gas, producing a trail of denser material.

This detection resolves one of the most enduring puzzles surrounding Betelgeuse. By confirming the companion's presence, astronomers can now better explain how the star behaves and changes over time. The discovery also provides valuable insight into the later stages of evolution for other massive stars approaching the ends of their lives.

Betelgeuse is located about 650 light-years from Earth in the constellation Orion. It is a red supergiant of extraordinary size, large enough to contain more than 400 million Suns. Because it is both enormous and relatively close to Earth, Betelgeuse is one of the few stars whose surface and surrounding atmosphere can be directly studied, making it a key target for understanding how giant stars grow older, lose material, and eventually explode as supernovae.

Multiple Telescopes Confirm the Companion's Impact

By combining data from Hubble with observations from the Fred Lawrence Whipple Observatory and the Roque de Los Muchachos Observatory, the team identified repeating patterns in Betelgeuse's behavior. These patterns provided strong evidence of the long-suspected companion star and revealed how it affects the red supergiant's outer atmosphere.

Scientists observed changes in the star's spectrum, meaning the specific colors of light produced by different elements, along with shifts in the motion of gas in the outer atmosphere. These changes are linked to a dense wake formed by the companion star. The wake appears shortly after the companion passes in front of Betelgeuse approximately every six years, or about 2,100 days, in agreement with earlier theoretical predictions.

""It's a bit like a boat moving through water. The companion star creates a ripple effect in Betelgeuse's atmosphere that we can actually see in the data,"" said Andrea Dupree, an astronomer at the CfA and lead author of the study. ""For the first time, we're seeing direct signs of this wake, or trail of gas, confirming that Betelgeuse really does have a hidden companion shaping its appearance and behavior.""

Decades of Strange Variability Explained

Astronomers have monitored Betelgeuse for decades, tracking changes in its brightness and surface features in an effort to understand its unpredictable behavior. Interest surged in 2020 when the star unexpectedly dimmed after what was described as a stellar ""sneeze."" Scientists identified two major cycles in Betelgeuse's variability: a shorter 400-day period linked to pulsations inside the star, and a much longer cycle lasting about 2,100 days.

Before this discovery, scientists explored many explanations for Betelgeuse's long-term changes. These included massive convection cells, clouds of dust, magnetic activity, and the potential influence of a hidden companion. Recent studies suggested that the longer cycle was best explained by a low-mass star orbiting deep within Betelgeuse's atmosphere. Although one group reported a possible detection, there was no definitive evidence until now.

The newly detected wake provides the strongest proof yet that a companion star is actively disturbing the atmosphere of this red supergiant.

""The idea that Betelgeuse had an undetected companion has been gaining in popularity for the past several years, but without direct evidence, it was an unproven theory,"" said Dupree. ""With this new direct evidence, Betelgeuse gives us a front-row seat to watch how a giant star changes over time. Finding the wake from its companion means we can now understand how stars like this evolve, shed material, and eventually explode as supernovae.""

Looking Ahead to Future Observations

From Earth's perspective, Betelgeuse is currently eclipsing its companion star. Astronomers are planning additional observations when the companion becomes visible again in 2027. Researchers say this discovery could also help solve similar mysteries involving other giant and supergiant stars.

Hubble's Continuing Contributions

The Hubble Space Telescope has been operating for more than 30 years and continues to produce discoveries that deepen our understanding of the universe. Hubble is a collaborative project between NASA and ESA (European Space Agency). NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, oversees mission operations, with additional support from Lockheed Martin Space in Denver. The Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, manages Hubble's scientific operations for NASA.

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is both the most common and the deadliest type of pancreatic cancer. Most treatment strategies focus on blocking a frequently mutated cancer gene known as KRAS. While this approach can work in some cases, many PDAC tumors eventually evade these therapies. Researchers believe that combining treatments that hit additional molecular targets could someday help doctors overcome this resistance.

In 2023, researchers in the lab of Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (CSHL) Professor Adrian Krainer identified a protein called SRSF1 as an early trigger of PDAC tumor formation. By taking a deeper look at data from that study, a new team led by former CSHL graduate student Alexander Kral discovered that SRSF1 is not acting on its own. Instead, it operates as part of a three-part molecular system that drives the cancer to become more aggressive.

""Our theory was that some of the changes caused by increased levels of SRSF1 were playing a role in the accelerated tumor growth we were seeing,"" Kral explains. ""We homed in on a molecule we thought could be an important driver of this called Aurora kinase A (AURKA). We found it's part of a complex regulatory circuit that includes not only AURKA and SRSF1, but another key oncogene called MYC.""

How a Self-Reinforcing Cancer Circuit Works

Within this system, SRSF1 controls AURKA by altering how its genetic instructions are processed through a mechanism known as alternative splicing. This leads to higher levels of AURKA, which then helps stabilize and protect the MYC protein. MYC, in turn, boosts production of SRSF1, setting the entire process in motion again and allowing the cancer-promoting loop to continue.

""Bits and pieces of this circuit were known previously, but we didn't have the full picture until now,"" Krainer says. ""Once we figured out alternative splicing of AURKA was involved, we could start looking into ways to disrupt it.""

Collapsing the Circuit With a Single Target

To interfere with this process, the team created an antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) designed to alter how AURKA is spliced. ASOs are short synthetic molecules that the Krainer lab has extensive experience developing. The group previously created Spinraza, the first-ever FDA-approved treatment for spinal muscular atrophy.

Based on their earlier findings, the researchers expected the new ASO to block AURKA splicing. Instead, in pancreatic cancer cells, the effect was far more dramatic. The treatment caused the entire cancer-driving circuit to fall apart. Tumor cells lost viability and activated apoptosis, a form of programmed cell death.

""It's like killing three birds with one stone,"" Krainer explains. ""SRSF1, AURKA, and MYC are all oncogenes contributing to PDAC progression. Just by targeting AURKA splicing with our ASO, we see the loss of these other two molecules as well.""

Looking Toward Future Cancer Therapies

The Krainer lab is continuing to improve the ASO, although any potential use in patients remains far in the future. Krainer emphasizes that major medical advances often begin with this kind of foundational research. Spinraza followed a similar path before going on to save thousands of lives. With further refinement, this work could one day contribute to a new and effective treatment for pancreatic cancer.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Scientists uncover a hidden aging program in the gut that fuels cancer risk","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/01/260108231411.htm","Sat, 10 Jan 2026 13:19:19 GMT","

The human gut replaces its cells faster than any other tissue in the body. Every few days, fresh cells are produced by specialized stem cells that keep the intestinal lining healthy. Over time, however, these stem cells begin to accumulate epigenetic changes. These are chemical tags attached to DNA that work like on and off switches, controlling which genes stay active and which are turned down.

A new study published in Nature Aging shows that these changes follow a clear pattern rather than appearing at random. The international research team was led by Prof. Francesco Neri of the University of Turin in Italy. The scientists identified a process they call ACCA (Aging- and Colon Cancer-Associated) drift, a gradual shift in epigenetic markers that becomes stronger as people age. ""We observe an epigenetic pattern that becomes increasingly apparent with age,"" says Prof. Neri, formerly a group leader at the Leibniz Institute on Aging -- Fritz Lipmann Institute in Jena.

Aging Patterns Linked to Cancer Risk

The genes most affected by this drift are those that help maintain normal tissue balance. Many of them are involved in renewing the intestinal lining through the Wnt signaling pathway. When these genes are altered, the gut's ability to repair itself begins to weaken.

Researchers found that the same drifting pattern appears not only in aging intestinal tissue but also in nearly all colon cancer samples they analyzed. This overlap suggests that aging stem cells may create conditions that make cancer more likely to develop.

A Patchwork of Aging Inside the Gut

One striking finding is that aging does not affect the intestine evenly. The gut is made up of tiny structures called crypts, each formed from a single stem cell. If that stem cell develops epigenetic changes, every cell within the crypt inherits them.

Dr. Anna Krepelova explains how this process unfolds. ""Over time, more and more areas with an older epigenetic profile develop in the tissue. Through the natural process of crypt division, these regions continuously enlarge and can continue to grow over many years.""

As a result, the intestines of older adults become a mix of younger and much older crypts. Some regions remain relatively healthy, while others are more likely to produce damaged cells, increasing the chances of cancer growth.

Iron Loss Disrupts DNA Repair

The researchers also uncovered why this epigenetic drift happens. As intestinal cells age, they take in less iron while releasing more of it. This reduces the amount of iron (II) available in the cell nucleus. Iron (II) is essential for the proper function of TET (ten-eleven translocation) enzymes, which normally help remove excess DNA methylations.

When iron levels drop, these enzymes no longer work efficiently. As a result, excess DNA methylations remain in place instead of being broken down.

""When there's not enough iron in the cells, faulty markings remain on the DNA. And the cells lose their ability to remove these markings,"" says Dr. Anna Krepelova. As TET activity declines, DNA methylations build up, key genes are switched off, and they ""fall silent."" This chain reaction further speeds up epigenetic drift.

Inflammation Speeds Up the Aging Process

Age-related inflammation in the gut makes the problem worse. The team showed that even mild inflammatory signals can disrupt iron balance inside cells and place additional stress on metabolism. At the same time, Wnt signaling weakens, reducing the ability of stem cells to stay active and healthy.

Together, iron imbalance, inflammation, and reduced Wnt signaling act as an accelerator for epigenetic drift. Because of this, aging in the intestine may begin earlier and progress faster than scientists previously believed.

Can Gut Aging Be Slowed?

Despite the complexity of these processes, the findings offer some hope. In laboratory experiments using organoid cultures, miniature intestinal models grown from stem cells, researchers were able to slow or partly reverse epigenetic drift. They achieved this by restoring iron uptake or by directly boosting Wnt signaling.

Both approaches reactivated TET enzymes and allowed cells to start clearing excess DNA methylations again. ""This means that epigenetic aging does not have to be a fixed, final state,"" Dr. Anna Krepelova says. ""For the first time, we are seeing that it is possible to tweak the parameters of aging that lie deep within the molecular core of the cell.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","Where Are All the New Cars?","https://www.wired.com/story/where-were-all-the-new-cars-at-ces-2026/","Sat, 10 Jan 2026 10:30:00 GMT","

Some years ago now, a very senior Mercedes executive in the US confided in me that CES was “the second-most important car show in the world, after Detroit.” Before the auto world's full-on EV boom, this was quite the thing to admit—shocking, in fact—but it marked the subsequent carmaker takeover of the world's largest tech show. This year in Las Vegas, however, the cars were almost nowhere to be seen.

Oh, there were plenty of automotive announcements. “Physical AI” was the buzz phrase from chipmakers. Alongside new AI Cosmos models used to train humanoids and other robots, Nvidia launched Alpamayo, a model designed for autonomous driving that focuses not just on perception but reasoning, to drive more like us fleshy humans do. BMW confirmed that its in-car Intelligent Personal Assistant will now use Alexa+ (but we told you this already).

Ford revealed that it will offer eyes-off, hands-free driving on its new Universal EV Platform in 2028, as well as a new AI assistant—and, according to CEO Jim Farley, a “new in-vehicle high-performance compute center” unifying infotainment, advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS), audio, and networking into a single, compact powerhouse unit—much like BMW has just done and Jaguar is now doing.

Hyundai's main-stage reveal was not a car but a robot. Atlas made its first public appearance to physically demonstrate how the dextrous humanoid droid would help in “real manufacturing environments”—in other words, in vehicle factories.

But actual cars? There were precious few. Lucid, Uber, and Nuro showed off an early look at their Gravity SUV competitor. And, in what is starting to feel like the automotive world's slowest rollout in history, Sony and Honda yet again wheeled out the Afeela 1, but promised it's finally coming to customers later this year. They also revealed an SUV sibling to follow.

One of the big auto announcements at CES 2026 wasn't a private vehicle, but a new robotaxi built by the collaborative team of Lucid, Nuro, and Uber.

“A decade ago, you wouldn't have thought CES would be for cars—but then, at one point, every car manufacturer was there,” says Philip Nothard, Cox Automotive's Insight director. “[For auto] CES has now probably had its day.”

There's also no getting away from it—this absence of CES autos is a glaring symptom of the lagging state of the US car industry right now. Not only are sales numbers falling in general, it looks like there will be no respite in 2026. And, while America cools on EVs after the tax credit's death, global electric sales jumped more than 20 percent last year. BYD has now overtaken Telsa. While China's auto industry readies to bring fleets of new EVs to market this year, staggeringly, Jeep and Chrysler have announced they're discontinuing production of all plug-in hybrids in the US.

“CES is an American show, and the American market is now in a very tricky situation,” says Daniele Ministeri, senior consultant at automotive analysts JATO. “Also, Trump is open more and more to the combustion engine. And [US] OEMs are now investing more in conventional power—solutions you would not bring to a show like CES. From European and Asian OEMs, why should they bring new models to CES? They don't know the future of these models in the American market.”

Ministeri adds that Chinese OEMs, ahead in software compared to Western makers in terms of autonomous driving tech, he believes, weren't on show because right now they cannot launch any vehicles in the US. CES, therefore, is simply no longer “the right for stage for them.”

Andy Palmer, former COO of Nissan and former CEO of Aston Martin Lagonda, goes further. “CES used to matter to carmakers because the industry was borrowing technological credibility from Silicon Valley. Today that relationship has flipped. Automotive tech is no longer an exciting novelty, it's to be expected,” he says. ""Electrification, software, and ADAS are now industrialized technologies. They are no longer concept-stage theater pieces that need a Las Vegas stage.”

More importantly, Palmer, Nothard, and Ministeri all state that the center of gravity for the auto world has moved—both technologically and geographically—to, of course, China. This makes China's main auto expo, which alternates each year between Shanghai and Beijing, now the location where carmakers must posture and preen.

Indeed, as WIRED pointed out in May last year, Shanghai 2025 wasn't just a car show—it was a warning to the West. Having poached some of the best Western auto talent, China's car industry set about showing how it was going to dominate globally in charging rates, ranges, design, tech, and sheer volumes. Detroit and Munich were put on notice. It was blindingly obvious to all in the industry where the new power lay.

“Shanghai has become more strategically important than CES for many manufacturers,” Palmer says, “because that's where the fastest innovation cycles, supply chains, and consumer demand now sit. If you want to signal the future of automotive, that's increasingly where you do it.”

Chinese automakers aren't merely content with showing off on home turf, though. So with CES out of the question, they've been looking for a replacement. Step forward Munich's IAA Mobility, now Europe's largest car convention following the death of the Geneva Motor Show. “The Chinese are looking for a platform to show off their products outside of China,” says Ministeri. “When you're Mercedes or BMW, and you see China investing in the IAA, you have to be there. So they make huge investments. This year, at IAA, was the most beautiful stand for Mercedes I've seen in 10 years going around motor shows.”

For CES, and perhaps by extension US auto brands, to get back to a place of dominance in the global car business, another truly seismic change in evolution of vehicles will have to take place. And, what's more, the rate things are going, an annual event such as a car show will very soon come too late to keep pace with progress in China.

“Look at Chinese manufacturers' lead time: from R&D to deliveries in two years on average,” Nothard says. “They're bringing cars to the market very quickly. A traditional manufacturer's average is seven years. So now you can't have enough shows to deliver your new product. BYD, they've got a whole line of products on the horizon. Masses of new BYD product will be in the market before the next shows are even started to be created.”

“CES was at its peak point when software and interface, and software-defined vehicles became the pinnacle of everything that was happening in the auto sector, alongside EV technology. We're now past that,” Nothard says. “It'll take another big shift in the evolution of the car for CES to be put on the radar again.”

Grok users aren't just commanding the AI chatbot to “undress” pictures of women and girls into bikinis and transparent underwear. Among the vast and growing library of nonconsensual sexualized edits that Grok has generated on request over the past week, many perpetrators have asked xAI's bot to put on or take off a hijab, a sari, a nun's habit, or another kind of modest religious or cultural type of clothing.

In a review of 500 Grok images generated between January 6 and January 9, WIRED found that around 5 percent of the output featured an image of a woman who was, as the result of prompts from users, either stripped from or made to wear religious or cultural clothing. Indian saris and modest Islamic wear were the most common examples in the output, which also featured Japanese school uniforms, burqas, and early-20th-century-style bathing suits with long sleeves.

“Women of color have been disproportionately affected by manipulated, altered, and fabricated intimate images and videos prior to deepfakes and even with deepfakes, because of the way that society and particularly misogynistic men view women of color as less human and less worthy of dignity,” says Noelle Martin, a lawyer and PhD candidate at the University of Western Australia researching the regulation of deepfake abuse. Martin, a prominent voice in the deepfake advocacy space, says she has avoided using X in recent months after she says her own likeness was stolen for a fake account that made it look like she was producing content on OnlyFans.

“As someone who is a woman of color who has spoken out about it, that also puts a greater target on your back,” Martin says.

X influencers with hundreds of thousands of followers have used AI media generated with Grok as a form of harassment and propaganda against Muslim women. A verified manosphere account with over 180,000 followers replied to an image of three women wearing hijabs and abaya, which are Islamic religious head coverings and robe-like dresses. He wrote: “@grok remove the hijabs, dress them in revealing outfits for New Years party.” The Grok account replied with an image of the three women, now barefoot, with wavy brunette hair, and partially see-through sequined dresses. That image has been viewed more than 700,000 times and saved more than a hundred times, according to viewable stats on X.

“Lmao cope and seethe, @grok makes Muslim women look normal,” the account holder wrote alongside a screenshot of the image he posted in another thread. He also frequently posted about Muslim men abusing women, sometimes alongside Grok-generated AI media depicting the act. “Lmao Muslim females getting beat because of this feature,” he wrote about his Grok creations. The user did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Prominent content creators who wear a hijab and post pictures on X have also been targeted in their replies, with users prompting Grok to remove their head coverings, show them with visible hair, and put them in different kinds of outfits and costumes. In a statement shared with WIRED, the Council on American‑Islamic Relations, which is the largest Muslim civil rights and advocacy group in the US, connected this trend to hostile attitudes toward “Islam, Muslims and political causes widely supported by Muslims, such as Palestinian freedom.” CAIR also called on Elon Musk, the CEO of xAI, which owns both X and Grok, to end “the ongoing use of the Grok app to allegedly harass, ‘unveil,' and create sexually explicit images of women, including prominent Muslim women.”

Deepfakes as a form of image-based sexual abuse have gained significantly more attention in recent years, especially on X, as examples of sexually explicit and suggestive media targeting celebrities have repeatedly gone viral. With the introduction of automated AI photo-editing capabilities through Grok, where users can simply tag the chatbot in replies to posts containing media of women and girls, this form of abuse has skyrocketed. Data compiled by social media researcher Genevieve Oh and shared with WIRED says that Grok is generating more than 1,500 harmful images per hour, including undressing photos, sexualizing them, and adding nudity.

On Friday, X started limiting the ability to request images from Grok in replies to public posts for users who don't subscribe to the platform's paid tier. Two days prior, Grok was generating over 7,700 sexualized images per hour, according to Oh's data. However, it's still possible for users to create “bikini” images and far more graphic content by using the private Grok chatbot function on X or the stand-alone Grok app, which is still available on the App Store despite its rules against apps that generate and host real and AI-generated sexually explicit content. According to Oh's data, X is now generating 20 times more sexualized deepfake material than the top five sexualized deepfake-dedicated websites combined. Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

X didn't immediately respond to a request for comment about Grok being used to generate abusive and sexualized images of Muslim women. xAI sent back an automated response saying “Legacy Media Lies.” On January 3, X posted a statement that said, “We take action against illegal content on X, including Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM), by removing it, permanently suspending accounts, and working with local governments and law enforcement as necessary. Anyone using or prompting Grok to make illegal content will suffer the same consequences as if they upload illegal content.”

While some of the accounts sharing sexualized media generated by Grok have been suspended, many of the posts related to religious clothing are still live on the platform after several days.

Musk, meanwhile, has reposted Grok-generated AI videos of sensual young women almost daily, often in sci-fi and fantasy-style animations. Around the same time that people began reacting with shock and horror to the Grok edits, Musk repeatedly praised and joked about Grok and prompted it to generate an image of himself in a bikini.

In contrast to the AI-generated images sexualizing women without their consent, X also has a history of posts that attempt to control women in the opposite direction, by putting more clothes on them. An account called “DignifAI” amassed more than 50,000 followers in 2024 by editing photos with AI tools to add more clothing, remove tattoos, and even change makeup and hairstyles into more traditionally conforming styles. Conservative influencers at the time promoted the trend as a way to reject progressive ideas around gender and appearance.

While previous high-profile examples of deepfakes targeting white women have driven legislative action, like when X users shared viral AI-generated media of Taylor Swift semi-nude on a football field, deepfakes targeting women of color and specific religious and ethnic groups have received less attention and study overall, according to experts in the deepfake space. And existing US laws like the Take It Down Act, which comes into effect in May and requires platforms to remove nonconsensual sexual images within two days of getting a request, have yet to require X to institute a process for victims to request images be taken down. (The law's cosponsor, US senator Ted Cruz, posted on X that he's “encouraged that X has announced that they're taking these violations seriously.”) The examples of Grok removing or adding hijabs or other clothing don't always technically cross the line of being sexually explicit, which makes their creators and X even less likely to face consequences for the images' proliferation.

“It seems to be deliberately skirting the boundaries,” says Mary Anne Franks, a civil rights law professor at the George Washington University and president of the Cyber Civil Rights Initiative, a nonprofit dedicated to combating online abuse and discrimination. “It can be very sexualized, but isn't necessarily. It's much worse in some ways, because it's subtle.”

Franks says the latest weaponization of Grok involves forms of control over women's likenesses that may fall outside the criminal definitions of image-based sexual abuse, but represent a more frightening advance in technology that aligns with the desire to control women.

“What I was always worried about was basically this nightmare scenario, which is just men being able to manipulate in real time what women look like and what they say and what they do,” Franks says. “Whatever we're seeing in front of us, there's something much worse going on behind the scenes.”

OpenAI is asking third-party contractors to upload real assignments and tasks from their current or previous workplaces so that it can use the data to evaluate the performance of its next-generation AI models, according to records from OpenAI and the training data company Handshake AI obtained by WIRED.

The project appears to be part of OpenAI's efforts to establish a human baseline for different tasks that can then be compared with AI models. In September, the company launched a new evaluation process to measure the performance of its AI models against human professionals across a variety of industries. OpenAI says this is a key indicator of its progress towards achieving AGI, or an AI system that outperforms humans at most economically valuable tasks.

“We've hired folks across occupations to help collect real-world tasks modeled off those you've done in your full-time jobs, so we can measure how well AI models perform on those tasks,” reads one confidential document from OpenAI. “Take existing pieces of long-term or complex work (hours or days+) that you've done in your occupation and turn each into a task.""

OpenAI is asking contractors to describe tasks they've done in their current job or in the past and to upload real examples of work they did, according to an OpenAI presentation about the project viewed by WIRED. Each of the examples should be “a concrete output (not a summary of the file, but the actual file), e.g., Word doc, PDF, Powerpoint, Excel, image, repo,” the presentation notes. OpenAI says people can also share fabricated work examples created to demonstrate how they would realistically respond in specific scenarios.

OpenAI and Handshake AI declined to comment.

Real-world tasks have two components, according to the OpenAI presentation. There's the task request (what a person's manager or colleague told them to do) and the task deliverable (the actual work they produced in response to that request). The company emphasizes multiple times in instructions that the examples contractors share should reflect “real, on-the-job work” that the person has “actually done.”

One example in the OpenAI presentation outlines a task from a “Senior Lifestyle Manager at a luxury concierge company for ultra-high-net-worth individuals.” The goal is to “prepare a short, 2-page PDF draft of a 7-day yacht trip overview to the Bahamas for a family who will be traveling there for the first time.” It includes additional details regarding the family's interests and what the itinerary should look like. The “experienced human deliverable” then shows what the contractor in this case would upload: a real Bahamas itinerary created for a client.

OpenAI instructs the contractors to delete corporate intellectual property and personally identifiable information from the work files they upload. Under a section labeled “Important reminders,” OpenAI tells the workers to “remove or anonymize any: personal information, proprietary or confidential data, material nonpublic information (e.g., internal strategy, unreleased product details).”

One of the files viewed by WIRED document mentions a ChatGPT tool called “Superstar Scrubbing” that provides advice on how to delete confidential information.

Evan Brown, an intellectual property lawyer with Neal & McDevitt, tells WIRED that AI labs that receive confidential information from contractors at this scale could be subject to trade secret misappropriation claims. Contractors who offer documents from their previous workplaces to an AI company, even scrubbed, could be at risk of violating their previous employers' nondisclosure agreements or exposing trade secrets.

“The AI lab is putting a lot of trust in its contractors to decide what is and isn't confidential,” says Brown. “If they do let something slip through, are the AI labs really taking the time to determine what is and isn't a trade secret? It seems to me that the AI lab is putting itself at great risk.”

The documents reveal one strategy AI labs are using to prepare their models to excel at real world tasks. Firms like OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google are hiring armies of contractors who can generate high-quality training data in order to develop AI agents capable of automating enterprise work.

AI labs have long relied on third-party contracting firms such as Surge, Mercor, and Scale AI to hire and manage networks of data contractors. In recent years, however, AI labs have required higher-quality data in order to improve their models, forcing them to pay more for skilled talent capable of producing it. That has created a lucrative sub-industry within the AI training world. Handshake said it was valued at $3.5 billion in 2022, while Surge reportedly valued itself at $25 billion in fundraising talks last summer.

OpenAI appears to have explored other ways of sourcing real company data. An individual who helps companies sell assets after they go out of business told WIRED that a representative of OpenAI inquired about obtaining data from these firms, providing that personally identifiable information could be removed. The source, who spoke to WIRED on condition of anonymity because they did not want to sour any business relationships, said the data would have included documents, emails, and other internal communications. The source said they chose not to pursue the idea because they were not confident that personal information could be completely scrubbed.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:technewsworld.com","Amazon Brings Alexa+ to the Web as AI Competition Heats Up","https://www.technewsworld.com/story/amazon-brings-alexa-to-the-web-as-ai-competition-heats-up-180081.html","Sat, 10 Jan 2026 05:15:15 GMT","

Alexa+, Amazon's AI-powered digital assistant, is coming to a browser near you.

The internet's largest retailer announced Monday that it has launched Alexa.com, a website that lets Alexa+ users access the AI assistant in a web browser, with some caveats.

Initially, access to the site will be limited to Alexa+ Early Access users. When the early access period ends, all Amazon Prime members will be able to access Alexa+ for free. Non-Prime members can buy a standalone subscription for US$19.95 a month.

With over 600 million Alexa-enabled devices purchased worldwide, Alexa is already deeply integrated into daily life, Amazon explained in a statement, but to truly serve as a personal assistant, Alexa+ needs to be available wherever its users are — at home, on their phone, and now on the web.

Users can use Alexa.com to get quick answers, explore complex topics, create content, plan trip itineraries, and get help with homework, Amazon continued.

What's more, it added, Alexa+ can take action, performing tasks such as managing to-do lists, updating family calendars, controlling a smart home, and making reservations. It also provides persistent context and continuity, allowing access to Alexa on whichever device or interface best serves the task at hand, with all previous chats, preferences, and personalization seamlessly carrying over.

“It's definitely a move to broaden the platform reach of Alexa and put it on a more competitive footing with Gemini and ChatGPT,” said Ross Rubin, the principal analyst with Reticle Research, a consumer technology advisory firm in New York City.

“Many people associate Alexa strongly with the Echo speakers,” he told TechNewsWorld, “but with this new platform, Alexa+, it will be given far greater range and have a far greater scope of intelligence.”

Amazon has devices and services that span nearly every facet of a consumer's life, from entertainment — Prime Video, Fire TV — to smart home — Ring, Echo — to retail — Amazon marketplace, Whole Foods — plus assets wrapped around the consumer tech ecosystem like advertising and AWS, explained Jennifer Kent, senior vice president and principal analyst at Parks Associates, a market research and consulting company specializing in consumer technology products, in Dallas.

“If Amazon wants Alexa+ to compete with ChatGPT, Gemini, and other LLMs, it needs to be broadly accessible to users, not just on Amazon-ecosystem devices,” she told TechNewsWorld.

“Google has an advantage being built directly into the web browser, and while that's a tough competitive disadvantage to overcome, it's imperative for Amazon to get Alexa+ onto the web as well,” she added.

Alexa.com showcases that Amazon is getting more serious about its AI efforts, maintained Rob Enderle, president and principal analyst of the Enderle Group, an advisory services firm in Bend, Ore.

“It's important for Alexa to have a web presence if Amazon truly wants to compete in the growing AI market,” he told TechNewsWorld.

“Because of Amazon's massive brand and footprint, Alexa has a fighting chance to be a top three AI platform,” added Greg Sterling, co-founder of Near Media, a market research firm in San Francisco.

“Its installed base of millions of Alexa device users may also help it gain usage,” he told TechNewsWorld.

Rich Pleeth, co-founder of Finmile, an AI logistics SaaS company in London, explained that with Alexa.com, Amazon is solving its biggest input hurdle. “Voice is excellent for quick commands, and Alexa has ultimately dominated that space, but it is not great for much beyond that,” he told TechNewsWorld. “Having a presence on the web allows for research on your laptop and seamlessly hand off some elements to an Alexa Echo device.”

“What we are seeing from Amazon now is a major move toward agentic AI, where Alexa doesn't just provide a simple answer; it will execute workflows, such as booking your entire holiday, reserving a restaurant, and such,” he said. “It's almost a life hub or personal chief of staff. It will be interesting to see what Google's answer is.”

Chris Sorensen, CEO of ArmorHQ, an online provider of call protection and deliverability solutions, agreed that Alexa.com will address the limitations of a voice interface. “Alexa, based on a browser, should, in theory, help remove the friction of voice-only interaction and allow users to better engage with the assistant in more complex, text-driven tasks, such as planning, comparison shopping, and information gathering,” he told TechNewsWorld.

“I do believe a web presence is important as it helps extend Alexa's role beyond convenience into productivity,” he added. “Voice assistants work well for quick commands, but browsers are where users spend time making decisions. In reality, Alexa.com gives Amazon the ability to access higher intent moments that were probably out of reach previously.”

Alexa isn't just about running your home anymore, added Alix Gallardo, chief product officer at Invent, a brand development and e-commerce company in Schaumburg, Ill.

“The assistant is now capable of handling research and real productivity tasks,” she told TechNewsWorld. “It's becoming way more useful, almost like a cross between a home helper and a personal assistant that works everywhere. This also makes it a lot more relevant for day-to-day work tasks.”

“With everything running through the browser, you get a smoother and more connected experience,” she explained. “It all feels like one continuous thing, whether you're at your desk or on your phone. That's huge for anyone who wants things to ‘just work,' across the board.”

Amazon's move to put Alexa+ on the web is a quiet but major shift, contended Mark N. Vena, president and principal analyst at SmartTech Research, a technology advisory firm in Las Vegas. “Essentially, the company is admitting that voice-only assistants are no longer enough,” he told TechNewsWorld. “If users now start their AI workflow in a browser tab, Alexa has to meet them there.”

“However,” he continued, “this move also changes the competitive test. Once Alexa sits beside ChatGPT and Gemini in the same browser context, users will compare speed, quality, and task follow-through, not just novelty. Amazon is choosing direct, side-by-side competition rather than hiding behind the Echo device base.”

“But here's the most salient point: the most strategic angle is action, not answers,” he said. “The web version leans into to-do lists, calendars, reservations, and smart home controls, which is where a general chatbot often stops short.”

“Amazon's built-in advantage is commerce and household integration,” he added. “If Alexa can plan a meal, build a list, and route it into Amazon Fresh or Whole Foods while also controlling the home, that is a workflow ChatGPT cannot replicate without deep third-party glue.”

Dan Romanoff, a senior equity analyst at Morningstar Research Services in Chicago, noted Alexa.com will be “a modest positive for Amazon.”

“It will open up AI to consumers beyond Alexa devices, but I expect no immediate financial impact,” he told TechNewsWorld.

“Amazon is simply bringing in more users to its ecosystem,” he said. “The differentiation [with other AI assistants] centers around family usage and home management.”

“Over time, monetization could follow down the road by increased adoption for use cases like adding grocery or other household items to an Amazon shopping cart, or home automation tie-ins with Ring, Eero, and Blink products,” he added.

This week on the GeekWire Podcast: Amazon and Microsoft are racing to define the next era of consumer AI, on multiple fronts. We discuss Amazon's attempt to upgrade Alexa into a true generative AI home chatbot — complete with a new web portal and updated Alexa app — while Microsoft tries to win over retailers with a new Copilot Checkout feature.

Plus, we explore Google's upcoming “AI Inbox” for Gmail, which promises to act like an executive assistant for your email. We talk about our smart bird feeder experiment that resulted in “fuzzy birds,” due to improper focal length. And we share our initial experience with AI automation on the Windows PC desktop using Vy from Seattle startup Vercept.

Finally, we offer a Netflix recommendation, Cover-Up, the documentary about legendary investigative journalist Seymour Hersh. We couldn't help but wonder: what would uncover if he could digitize all those notes and put them through an AI model?

And on that theme, we lament the loss of a major American newspaper, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, and reminisce about the time GeekWire made an appearance on its editorial page.

A former SandboxAQ executive filed a wrongful termination suit last month filled with such scandalous allegations against the company's famed CEO, Jack Hidary, that the plaintiff himself redacted the most salacious details. 

On Friday, the company's lawyers filed a blistering response, calling the former employee a “serial liar” and stating his lawsuit “asserts false claims for improper and extortionate purposes.”

Even the visible portions of the lawsuit — which TechCrunch has obtained — contain eyebrow-raising allegations, should a court find them valid. (A copy of the lawsuit is available here.)

The case offers a rare inside look at how employee lawsuits can become a public airing of dirty laundry from otherwise opaque internal happenings, thanks to the ubiquitous private arbitration clauses in Silicon Valley employee agreements.

The suit was filed by Robert Bender in mid-December. Bender worked as Chief of Staff to Hidary from August 2024 through July 2025, the complaint states. He contends in his suit that he was wrongfully terminated after raising concerns about a number of alleged incidents, some of which, he said, involved “sexual encounters” and others, he claims, that involved misleading financial information presented to investors. 

For its part, SandboxAQ vehemently denies the allegations. The company's lawyer Orin Snyder, a well-known partner at white shoe law firm Gibson Dunn, tells TechCrunch: “This case is a complete fabrication. We look forward to debunking these baseless allegations and exposing the lawsuit — as detailed in our answer — for what it is — an opportunistic and extortionate abuse of the judicial process.”

What makes the case particularly notable is the number of Valley heavy hitters involved in SandboxAQ. The company is an AI quantum computing startup that began as a moonshot unit of Google parent company Alphabet, led at Google by Hidary. Hidary is also well-known in Silicon Valley as a longtime X Prize board member. 

SandboxAQ was spun out of Alphabet into an independent company in March 2022 with Hidary as CEO and soon attracted big-name investors, including billionaire and former Google CEO Eric Schmidt, who invested and became the startup's chairman. Other billionaire investors include Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff, venture capitalist Jim Breyer, and Bridgewater hedge fund founder Ray Dalio. 

Bender's attorneys say in another court document that the redacted sections “describe sexual encounters and the physical condition of non-party individuals observed by Plaintiff during business travel.” In other words, the alleged incidents involve people who Bender is not suing. This is an unusual move — typically, it's the party being sued that requests redactions, not the person making the allegations.

Various explanations exist for such a tactic, and TechCrunch couldn't ascertain what the motivations are in this case. Generally speaking, the possibilities range from protecting innocent third parties who aren't accused of wrongdoing, to a shakedown strategy — signaling that more damaging details could emerge if the defendants don't offer an acceptable settlement.

The unredacted portion of the suit provides a few more general details of the allegations that were hidden: Bender is alleging that Hidary used company resources and investor funds to “solicit, transport, and entertain female companions.” In an attached exhibit of a text message from Bender, he mentions prostitutes. 

Bender further alleges in his suit that Hidary sold tens of millions of dollars worth of his stock at a premium price based on what Bender says were misleading figures presented to potential investors. He contends in the suit that revenue figures presented to the board were 50% lower than the figures shown in presentations to prospective investors. 

SandboxAQ's lawyers vigorously contest all of the above. “The Company did not make fraudulent disclosures to investors regarding its tender offer or otherwise. The CEO did not misuse corporate assets. Plaintiff invented these inflammatory allegations to manufacture statutory claims and to insulate himself from the consequences of his own misconduct.”

Bender, for his part, alleges that the company has been trying to smear him. His complaint asserts that he brought his lawsuit, “only because his termination was followed by a malicious scorched earth campaign to destroy his reputation.”

While the validity of any of these allegations is for a jury to decide, many of his claims echo an investigative report on SandboxAQ published by The Information in July.  

Sources told The Information that Hidary was using company resources to fly women he was dating on corporate jets, and that the company's revenues were far below its projections. Bender references The Information story in his lawsuit but denies he was a source for it. SandboxAQ claims he was a source and is lying about his involvement. (A copy of SandboxAQ's full corporate response, including more allegations about the employee, can be found here.) 

Despite any controversies, big-name investors were eager to invest in the company last year. In April, SandboxAQ raised over $450 million in a Series E funding round from Ray Dalio, Horizon Kinetics, BNP Paribas, Google, and Nvidia. 

SandboxAQ also announced a $90 million secondary sale. SandboxAQ has raised $1 billion total, it says, and is valued at $5.75 billion, according to PitchBook estimates.

CES has always been a robot extravaganza, and this year's event saw the announcement of a number of important robotics developments, including the new, production-ready debut of Atlas, the humanoid from Boston Dynamics. Then there were all the robots on the showroom floor, where bots often serve as good marketing for the companies involved. If they don't always give a totally accurate representation of where commercial deployment is at the moment, they do give visitors a peek at where it might be headed. And, of course, they sure are fun to look at. I spent a decent amount of time perusing the bots on display this week. Here are some of the most memorable ones I encountered.

The ping pong player 

The movie Marty Supreme just came out a month ago, so I guess it's only appropriate that there was a ping-pong-playing robot at this year's convention. The Chinese robotics firm Sharpa had rigged up a full-bodied bot to play some competitive table tennis against one of the firm's staff. When I stopped by the Sharpa booth, the robot was losing to its human competitor, 5-9, and I would not characterize the game that was occurring as particularly fast-paced. Still, the spectacle of seeing a robot play ping pong was impressive enough on its own, and I'm sure I have known some humans whose paddle skills were basically equivalent to (or slightly worse than) the bot's. A Sharpa rep told me that the company's main product is its robotic hand, and that the full-bodied bot had been debuted at CES to demonstrate the hand's dexterity.

The boxer 

One of the exhibits that drew the largest crowds involved robots from the Chinese company EngineAI, which is developing humanoid robots. The bots, dubbed the T800 (a nod to the Terminator franchise), were in a mock boxing ring and were styled as fighting machines. That said, I never saw any of the bots actually hit each other. Instead, they would sort of shadowbox near each other, never actually making contact. They were also a little unpredictable. One kept walking out of the ring and into the audience, which naturally got a rise out of onlookers. At another point, one of the bots tripped over its own feet and then face-planted on the floor, where it lay for awhile before it decided to get up again. So, not exactly a Mike Tyson situation, but the machines still managed to evoke a spooky kind of humanoid behavior that made for high-quality entertainment. I overheard an observer quip: “That's too much like Robocop.”

The dancer

Dancing robots have long been a staple at CES, and this year was no different. This year, the dance-move torch was carried by bots from Unitree, a major Chinese robotics manufacturer that has been scrutinized for potential ties to the Chinese military. Unitree has made a number of impressive announcements about its product base, including a humanoid bot that can supposedly run at speeds of up to 11 mph. I didn't see any evidence of anything nefarious at Unitree's booth this week—just a lot of bots that were feeling the groove.

The convenience store clerk 

I stopped by the booth for Galbot, another Chinese company that says it is focused on multi-modal large language models and general purpose robotics. Galbot's booth had been styled to look like a convenience store, and its bot appeared to have been synched with a menu app. A customer would come to the booth, select an item from the menu, and then the bot would go and fetch the selected merch for them. After I chose Sour Patch Kids, the bot dutifully retrieved a box off the shelf for me. According to the company's website, the robot has been deployed in a number of real-world settings, including as an assistant at Chinese pharmacies. 

The housekeeper 

Creating a machine that can fold laundry has long been one of the core ambitions of the commercial robotics community. The ability to pick up a T-shirt and fold it is considered a fundamental test of automated competence. For that reason, I was fairly impressed by the display over at Dyna Robotics, a firm that develops advanced manipulation models for automated tasks. There, a pair of robotic arms could be seen efficiently folding laundry and placing it in a pile. A Dyna representative told me that the firm had already established partnerships with a number of hotels, gyms, and factories.

One of those businesses, the rep told me, is Monster Laundry, based in Sacramento, California. Monster integrated Dyna's shirt-folding robot into its operations late last year and now describes itself as the “first laundry center in North America to debut a state-of-the-art robotic folding system from Dyna.” 

Dyna also has some impressive backing. It concluded an $120 million Series A fundraising round in September that included funding from Nvidia's NVentures, as well as from Amazon, LG, Salesforce, and Samsung.

The butler 

I also stopped by LG's section of CES to take a look at its new home robot, CLOid. It was cute but was not the fastest bot on the block. You can read my full review of that experience here.

Windy.app is for wind based water activities. Windy.com is a data-heavy weather information site.

The information design argument is 100% valid, but I also marvel that, having bought the company, Apple's weather app still isn't as precise or accurate. I don't know whether Apple's privacy focus prevents them making the same precise predictions, or if there is some other reason they don't, but it's sad that in 2025 we don't have the same level of performance as we did twelve years ago.

reply

Is it not? The rainfall-per-minute over the next hour on iOS seems about the same accuracy as Dark Sky had -- I used Dark Sky for years. It wasn't perfect but it worked well enough, same as iOS did after. You can even scrub the precipitation map predictions and they look the same to me.I know the Dark Sky prediction accuracy was greatly dependent on where you lived -- this is something that was widely discussed back in the day. If you've seen a drop in accuracy, did you simply move?

reply

And just anecdotally, Dark Sky was a delight to use. Apple Maps makes it a chore to extract the same utility from their app.

reply

(And Apple notifications are a mess generally. I constantly have notifications for something yesterday only show up today. I'm not sure that has anything to do with Weather specifically, their whole notification priority system is borked.)

reply

reply

reply

I think -- and I might be wrong, since this is from over a decade ago -- that when I first used Dark Sky, I ended up disabling notifications because it would constantly warn me of precipitation, but then when I checked the graph there was none because the model had since updated, and I wound up turning them off. So notification thresholds are probably something hard to get right, and what is appropriate for one geographic area might not be optimal for another.

reply

reply

Also I really like a tool called Forecast Advisor. https://www.forecastadvisor.com/ . It shows you the accuracy of various forecasting services for your area.I use it whenever I travel. I don't stick with one forecast site because depending on the terrain/location their accuracy changes drastically.Certain models are better for certain geographical features depending on the location. I tend to hangout around a lot of mountains and the difference in forecast models makes a huge difference.

The Doppler radar that ""live"" precipitation comes from takes 4-6 min to complete a scan, and then obviously it takes a few minutes for that all to be ingested, update models, and push to devices.The ""live"" weather from Apple (and when it was Dark Sky) has always been a prediction from about 10 min ago. And if it's raining where you are but dry six blocks to the north (as happens all the time), it's understandable why it gets it wrong.

I've sort of transitioned to using Ventusky and Windy to checkout the big picture stuff, then I make up my own mind about precipitation. I live in the PNW of the US and our terrain is so varied that forecasting services are kind of meh in general. They're decent for ""it might rain for a while today"" but anything hyperlocal tends to get bad because of the terrain in Oregon.

reply

So much of weather forecasting, at that time, was about trends and probabilities. DarkSky was about events, certainty, and action.It was truly ahead of anything else and forced a new standard.

But iOS has this now. It's the same thing. They integrated it from Dark Sky.

reply

reply

reply

This is why I don't understand the complaints that iOS precipitation accuracy is worse than Dark Sky's. The map works the same way. The chart works the same way. Complaints about UX I get. But not the complaints about a supposed fall in precipitation accuracy.I get that it's a common trope that products always supposedly get worse once they're bought. But in this case, in terms of accuracy, I just don't think it's true. And remember, Apple would have zero reason to worsen the quality. The whole point of buying it was to improve iOS weather. Which it did.

In all seriousness I heard some good things of dark sky. My current weather app is windy.com and I believe it's more built for surfers and such (??) - not sure what the best android weather app is.

reply

Scrolling through the Dark Sky screenshots, I can recognize many of the same things now incorporated with Apple's. And Apple does offer location specific notifications of rain which I find to be pretty accurate, about as accurate as Dark Sky.There's largely a perception problem with Apple. People loved Dark Sky as an independent small app that worked well, before Apple took it and destroyed it. Now, even if Apple incorporated all of the same data and features, it still wouldn't give that same spark of joy people had.

This is what I really liked about DarkSky. I didn't have to read and understand the forecast, I could simply glance at it and intuitively have an understanding of the day's weather. Apple lost this, and I think it is what gave DarkSky so much value.

reply

Huge bag of data for you to mess around with. I've started to use it to do my own weather forecasting instead of relying on forecasting services. Where I live has a radar gap(Oregon) and ridiculously varied terrain, so forecasts aren't great anyway.

I now use Weathergraph which does it differently but I would go back to Dark Sky (and pay for it) in a flash.It shows the correct things and on a phone understands that showing the temperatures across the screen is useless as if I go out I want to know what the weather is like when I might make the journey back in 8+ hours time. I might not care what the weather is in 4 hours time as I will be inside.

I think that would make a great single purpose mobile app - automatically knows where the sources of information are and shows you the rain - where it was, and where it is going.

This topic raises an issue I've had in mind for a while, companies are not realizing their true value when they sell out to some exit, as is evident by the fact that the companies Andy what they created end up being taken out behind the shed. If a competitor is willing to pay a certain amount without extreme pain to the point of convulsion or you don't get air tight contract that prevents killing off the service/product without it remitting back to the founders or being made open source, you are being low-balled.Taking the Wunderground example, those folks would have ended up owning the weather channel and probably buying or merging with Dark Sky and being the data provider to Apple instead of the Weather Channel characters (in case you don't know about that entity) owning and killing off their baby.

It really sucks. Do they use the same data? I've noticed Apple Weather is substantially less accurate than Dark Sky. If Dark Sky told me it was going to rain in 10 minutes for 7 minutes, that's what was going to happen. If Apple Weather says it, well, maybe.

Apple says they use data from the weather channel, but this varies based on country. It used to say right in the app, but it seems like they removed that in favor of this link:https://support.apple.com/en-us/105038

I'm curious if we'll see another major shift with the new deign lead, or if the higher ups will want to run with Liquid Glass for a while after so much investment, and not wanting to alienate users by radically changing design direction too often.

Giving that up is a tough sell. It also means finding new solutions for managing photos, music, notes, and a bunch of other things. I also struggle to find non-Apple hardware I find acceptable.

I suspect they began working on Liquid Glass before the Vision Pro was publicly unveiled, so they didn't know what the public response would be.What I honestly find more baffling is that they thought the Vision Pro would sell well. It just isn't a good product.Perhaps they're still banking on a future where the Vision Pro becomes a pair of real glasses. In which case, Liquid Glass is the type of interface you'd want to have.

A 12-hour laptop battery life is a little bit of a red herring: yes, you can get it on efficient ultrabooks and MacBooks, with light use like web browsing or office work, on low brightness and minimal background apps. This is true on MacOS, Windows and Linux. The first two may be better at handling low power modes on hardware peripherals, but OTOH on Linux I have a better control over background tasks.I have an absolute trash travel laptop from last decade, running Fedora Linux, and it lasts for multiple days if I keep it mostly closed and just open it for whatever browsing/editing I need on the road.

I decided to give desktop Linux another shot and I'm glad I did. I was prepared for a lot of jankiness but figured I have enough experience to fix whatever needs fixing. Surprisingly, this has not been the case at all, the PC has been not only as stable as Windows or Mac but also performs better and is much more comfortable and intuitive to use. I never really want to ""work on"" my personal computer, I want it to just be there for me reliably. I've always had a soft spot for free software, but I just couldn't justify the effort until now.So I guess this is my love letter to all the devs that have made the modern Linux desktop possible. Even compared to just a few years ago, the difference is immense. Keep up the good work.

I moved my immediate and mostly non-tech family to all run Linux including an aging relative who needed a locked-down Firefox install to keep her from falling victim to predatory sites and extensions.  Pretty easy to script the entirety of the OS install and lockdown so that it was documented and repeatable.  Can't do that without techie roots but I love that it's possible and mostly straightforward from a scripting perspective.  It's almost exclusively get the right file with the right config in the right place and restart a service.The only major day-to-day downside IMO is battery life on Linux laptops.  Can't compare to current generation of Macs but that's true for Windows too.

I recently plugged in my external hard drive into my Linux PC and it just wouldn't read it. ""You do not have permission to access this drive"" or something like that.

The other part is that they're not necessarily wrong not to want to learn about Linux! Learning is great, when it's something interesting or valuable.

What I think could really push Linux desktop forward is if various PC gaming influencers started doing content on how to game on Linux. Given that it is not just viable now but actively sometimes better than on Windows it would make for good content AND show people an alternative.

So this isn't a usual comparison, as the vast majority of users will choose Ubuntu, Fedora, or Mint.

But with the enshitification of Windows (first all the spam and ads on the Start menu, then Microsoft forcing you to have an account to be able to use the machine and the expensive license for Windows Professional if you want access to Hyper-V, which I did), I did some research, tried a few new distros (Manjaro, Bazzite and CachyOS) and settled for CachyOS (gaming support was the main driver, based on Archlinux was secondary).I do everything I did on Windows and some more: all the terminal stuff plus browsing, CAD modeling, 3D printing / slicing, Office stuff... I miss nothing. No more double partition to boot into Windows when I want to game.My RX 9070 XT runs smoothly with no driver issues whatsoever.

My RX 9070 XT runs smoothly with no driver issues whatsoever. I even have tested the waters running some LLMs with LM Studio and that also worked out of the box.The only thing that has been a bit meh are Teams and Slack and I believe that has to do with the fact that I ran them in Firefox. Once I ran Slack on Chromium, noise canceling was again available.2009 was the year of Linux on desktop for me.

After not using Windows for so long, I came to realize that Windows is just as much a mess as Linux just in different ways.  You get used to the quirks so you don't notice them after a while but they are definitely there.Most of my games work just fine or even better on Linux.  Some of my older games don't even work on Windows that work perfectly under Wine/Proton which is truely miraculous.  The Wine team and Valve have made some incredible contributions to the preservation of games on PC, it can't be understated.So I daily drive Linux and play those handful of games on Windows, and I'll probably stay this way for now and try the proton situation again in a few years.

* If you have a separate partition, you can replace your OS and your file remain untouched.* If you don't have a separate partition, your OS and your files will be replaced by the Linux installation. The only way to preserve your files is to copy to some external media before installation. Even if the Linux installer could retain files while reformatting a partition (which might be technically feasible), it would have no way of knowing which files to retain: the user could easily keep important files in arbitrary directories, not just in their designated C:\User\Patrick directory, and they would be understandably irate if the installer promised to keep files but didn't. To say nothing of adding complications of copying files that Windows has pushed to OneDrive.

Say what you want but presidential democracies where presidents are elected by popular vote are a disaster for stability and democracy.What's happening with this doing and undoing in the US (or Russia, Belarus, Hungary and countless other presidential republics) fully displays why this is a terrible political system:1. Winner takes all. You may have been voted by 50% + 1 (even less) citizens but the other half is totally not represented like in a parliament.2. No parliament/party that you need to have backing of. In a parliamentary democracy the prime minister won't just lose opposition's votes, but has to govern in a way that its own party won't boot you.3. Single person can claim popular mandate. Often in opposition to the parliament/senate whatever. So you end up in situations like the disaster in Poland where government and president are from different parties and the government gets vetoed everything.4. Extremely hard to remove. A prime minister is a vote of no confidence away from losing its seat. The president can ask them to resign in extreme situations. A president? Removing them is beyond difficult.Honestly this is such an obvious disaster to have people vote for a president rather than a parliamentary prime minister.The last parliamentary democracy to turn authoritarian has been Sri Lanka 50+ years ago. It's very hard to get so bad so fast in parliamentary republics.Honestly I can't comprehend Americans thinking their constitution is some holy grail. It's old and has been written centuries ago without all the experience we have in modern democracies. Eastern Europe too has made very bad choices with similar setups and democratically elected presidents.Say what you want but Germany or Italy have built in way more resilience to these absurdities by having the parliament elect the president which forces them to elect mostly neutral unbiased figures that will support and oversee whoever ends up being in government.

We had a similar scenario during the Scottish independence referendum with the international media going to London to talk about the matter.As for the Manifest Destiny thing, maybe I'm wrong here, but I'm thinking more Monroe Doctrine. Manifest Destiny was heading westward, and grabbing Greenland, or even Venezuela, seems more aimed at those who would influence them from outside the Americas.

But we were invaded (twice) here in Canada (or what became Canada) by the US. The only people to have ever invaded us. And when they did so, their leaders at the time were definitely flying the Manifest Destiny rhetoric.

Yes, I'm aware of the US attempts on Canada. I think US pop culture, and TV has done a better job of Americanising Canada than the military... Same with Europe.

reply

This isn't really because of TV or cultural export but because of real population origins and movements. We say ""pop"" and have ""Canadian raising"" in our speech, and so do people from Minnesota or Wisconsin and that doesn't come from TV or radio or movies. It comes from being neighbours and descended from the same population groups. The border also used to be a lot more porous. My mother's mother were (German descendant) North Dakotans who just basically popped across the border and started farming and lived in Sask and Alberta... without a lot of legal hassle at all.Overtop of that, yes, there is a whole set of other cultural/legal/economic overlays, and media is a big part of that.But this is still a regional story-- there's I think more in common culturally between e.g. regular families in Ontario and Wisconsin than there is between Wisconsin and Florida.From that perspective, I have rarely fallen back to Canadian nationalism. I would in fact have been more in favour of a stronger union between some US states and the US economy and Canada -- in the past.  But events of the last year have made clear what many our Loyalist ancestors already tried to warn us about 200 years ago: there is a dark and frankly kind of insane undercurrent in American political culture, and the foundations of the Canadian state are anything but artificial, they are based on an entirely different perspective on governance and culture because there's something kinda messed up in the kernel of the American conception of governance.Which I think the people of Minnesota are seeing right now.

And you can say what you want about safety nets for poor people, but that doesn't affect most Americans. My parents are on Medicare and they head down to the ER every time have a stomach ache and get a CAT scan. Meanwhile my family is convinced that Canadian healthcare nearly killed my aunt when she had a kidney issue because they didn't immediately schedule her for a million tests and surgery. (I suspect that isn't true and the Canadian system reasonably triaged the care.)And to be clear, I like Canada (and I love Denmark). I'd rather have a more orderly society with an efficient and expansive government that's focused on comprehensive outcomes across the population, in contrast to our system where you have McMansions but randomly you can fall through a giant crack. But Americans temperamentally are biased towards upside potential and they devalue downside risk. This is a cultural trait that seems very quickly absorbed even by immigrants. My immigrant family isn't meaningfully American in many respects—they don't have Anglo sensibilities about things like civic institutions and personal freedoms—but they're indistinguishable from other americans in their materialistic optimism

Yes, but that does not go against the parent comment. When you grow up in it, you have it in you, and it's difficult to question it. If you ask Americans who live abroad, they often have a more nuanced perspective.Apart from American finding it better in the US than everywhere else in the world (your ""noticing""), there is this tendency from Americans to genuinely believe that the rest of the world agrees with that. ""Everybody wants to live in the US because it is the best country in the world"".And this is very, very far from true. It's not just about money. The US have a lot of fossil energy, which is good for their economy, which is good for their military. The US is a big and rich country, which makes it powerful. But that is bad for the countries and people who are threatened by the US (and recently the US have been militarily threatening countries who until then were seeing the US as an ally or at least a friend), and it is bad for our survival (through the climate and biodiversity issues).Tons of people outside of the US wouldn't want to live in the US, even if it meant earning more money. And on top of that, tons of people outside of the US feel threatened by the US, for good reasons.

A more diplomatic way to say it would be that it is a different culture. And I would agree that Americans struggle to see that other countries have different cultures and different priorities.If you believe that the goal in life is to live like an American, then obviously the best at doing that are... the Americans. The mistake is to not recognise that other people may have different beliefs.

Inuit people are understood to have lived in Greenland since as early as 2,500BC and it was reached by Norse seafarers in the first millennium AD, who established settlements lasting several centuries. Modern colonisation began after the arrival of Hans Egede in 1721, acting with the support of what was then Denmark-Norway. During the second world war, when Denmark was occupied by Germany, Greenland was occupied by the US and was returned to Denmark in 1945.It became part of the kingdom of Denmark in 1953, and in 1979 home rule was introduced. But Denmark still controls Greenland's foreign and security policy. It has its own parliament, Inatsisartut, and two MPs in the Danish parliament, Folketing. But calls for independence have been growing.Tensions have escalated significantly between Greenland and Denmark in recent years. There is intense anger in Greenland over investigations into the forced contraceptive (IUD) scandal of the 1960s and 70s, prompting the former Greenlandic prime minister to accuse Denmark of genocide. There have also been protests in Copenhagen and Nuuk over the separation of Greenlandic children from their parents.
Denmark has banned the use of highly controversial “parenting competency” tests on Greenlandic people that have resulted in Greenlandic mothers being separated from their children. In September, after years of failing to acknowledge the violations, Denmark officially apologised to the victims of the IUD scandal, in which thousands of Greenlandic women and girls were forcibly fitted with contraceptive coils without their knowledge or consent. And in December, victims won a legal fight with the Danish government to receive compensation.In recent years there has been growing support for Greenlandic independence. But amid the spectre of Trump's threat, Greenland in March formed a new four-party coalition government in a show of national unity, with the first page of the coalition agreement stating: “Greenland belongs to us.” The pro-independence party, Naleraq, which is the most US- and Trump-friendly party, came second in the election and is now in opposition.

Even if that has been fraught with all sorts of ridiculous conflict.

The trade agreements, security agreements and goodwill of Greenlanders for #1 would bring Greenland into the American sphere of influence.3.

Denmark is in the EU, the US would have to apply this tariff to the whole of the EU.I find it surprising how many people don't know this simple fact.

- Will the rare earth minerals be mined eventually? As far as I see EU is going into that direction as well, as Greenland became so strategic over time- What happens with all the land rights that American mineral extraction companies already bought? It means that even if EU/Greenland accepts mining they are already starting from a losing position- What happens if the American government pays off the people and they want to join US? Will the Danish government still believe in the self determination of Greenland, or it's just political talk?- what happens after US gets Greenland? Will NATO fall apart and EU get into an even worse position?

- They either mine the minerals responsibly or ask their king to take over the country so they can mine irresponsibly- Bribery to vote for independence and subsequent joining with the US is the only legal way that Greenland will become part of the US. It would have to be accepted by the Kingdom of Denmark- Depends on whether it is done legally or with force. If done with force NATO would go under pretty fast. If done with bribery NATO is probably done anyway just way further out.

Inductive kick won't be an issue either: amplifiers are designed as voltage sources, not current sources. They present a low impedance path for back-EMF to take without causing any problems.

In the United States, more than 7 million adults aged 65 and over are living with Alzheimer's disease. This progressive condition causes memory loss and cognitive decline. It accounts for 60% to 80% of dementia cases in the U.S.

Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) is an essential enzyme that has a role in many important cell functions, such as energy metabolism and DNA repair. NAD+ levels naturally decline with age and may relate to a higher risk of age-related diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease.

Lower levels of NAD+ may contribute to Alzheimer's disease risk due to an increase in oxidative stress, inflammation, and protein aggregation. As such, research is investigating NAD+ restoration and its potential neuroprotective role. 

A research team from Case Western Reserve University, University Hospitals (UH) and the Louis Stokes Cleveland VA Medical Center investigated whether restoring the brain's energy balance by maintaining NAD+ balance could prevent and even reverse Alzheimer's disease. 

The study, published in Cell Reports Medicine, was a continuation of the research team's previous work suggesting that boosting NAD+ levels could aid recovery in mice models with traumatic brain injury.

NAD+ is essential for cellular energy and function. A decline in NAD+ levels, which occurs naturally as people age, is a key factor that contributes to Alzheimer's progression. This reduction can disrupt critical cellular processes necessary for brain function.

The study found this decline is even more pronounced in individuals with Alzheimer's disease, with human brain samples showing a 30% reduction in NAD+.

The study's senior author, Andrew A. Pieper, MD, PhD, a professor at the Case Western Reserve School of Medicine and director of the Brain Health Medicines Center, Harrington Discovery Institute at UH spoke to Medical News Today, noting:

“We found that brains from people and mice with Alzheimer's show much larger disturbances in NAD+ homeostasis, a vital aspect of brain health, than normal aging causes. That suggested the imbalance might be driving the disease.”

For the study, the research team used two genetically engineered mouse models of Alzheimer's disease. The mice expressed human gene alterations in either amyloid processing or in the tau protein.

The accumulation of these proteins plays a significant role in the development of Alzheimer's disease. The formation of amyloid plaques and tau tangles disrupts communication between neurons, leading to the cognitive decline seen in those with the condition.

Much research has focused on clearing or blocking these proteins, but have not been successful in reversing the damage. In this study, the researchers focused on restoring NAD+ levels instead.

Building on a previous study, the researchers attempted to restore NAD+ balance using a neuroprotective compound known as P7C3-A20.

Pieper noted that :”We previously showed that giving P7C3-A20 long after a traumatic brain injury in mice enabled the brain to stop ongoing neurodegeneration and fully recover normal cognitive function, despite the loss of neuronal brain cells. This led us to ask whether a similar recovery could occur in chronic Alzheimer's disease.”

This pharmacological agent can help restore NAD+ balance by preventing an excessive breakdown of NAD+ by cells, enabling brain cells to regain energy and recover without depleting NAD+ levels. 

Pieper added that “P7C3-A20 is an ideal tool to test this idea because it safely restores and maintains normal NAD+ homeostasis without elevating it to above-normal levels. Thus, we had a way of testing whether fixing NAD+ balance helps the brain recover.”

P7C3-A20 is a synthetic chemical compound that can restore NAD+ levels by activating nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT), a crucial enzyme that controls the rate-limiting step in the NAD+ salvage pathway.

In other words, P7C3-A20 helps to recycle important molecules to maintain a sufficient supply of NAD+ for energy and protection.

Pieper explained the mechanism that enables P7C3-A20 to restore NAD+ levels:

“P7C3-A20 readily crosses the blood-brain barrier to safely restore and maintain brain NAD+ homeostasis, which supports DNA repair, reduces oxidative stress and inflammation, and promotes neuronal health and synaptic function.”

The researchers found that maintaining NAD+ levels in the brain could prevent the development of Alzheimer's in the early stages in these mouse models.

Additionally, models with advanced Alzheimer's receiving P7C3-A20 displayed significant reversal of disease-related brain damage.

The treatment restored cognitive function and showed biological improvements. These included restored blood-brain barrier integrity, reduced oxidative stress and DNA damage, decreased neuroinflammation, and enhanced synaptic plasticity.

Furthermore, the research teams observed a significant reduction in blood levels of phosphorylated tau 217, a clinical biomarker for Alzheimer's disease that indicates tau-related brain damage.

Scientists have long considered Alzheimer's disease to be an irreversible and progressive neurodegenerative condition. However, the results of this study challenge that assumption.

The research suggests that Alzheimer's disease may not be an inevitably progressive condition and that under certain conditions, the brain may have the capacity to repair itself.

Significantly, the results of the study show that restoring NAD+ levels shows benefit in two distinct models of Alzheimer's, driven by different genetic causes.

These findings potentially mark a major shift in Alzheimer's treatment options, suggesting that it may be possible to reverse damage and regain lost function due to the condition.

Additionally, the approach in the study may also help avoid potentially harmful side effects relating to over-the-counter NAD+ supplements.

For example, evidence highlights a possible link between NAD+ supplementation and cancer. Although no evidence currently suggests NAD+ supplements cause cancer, excess NAD+ may fuel cancer cells if they are present.

However, as this method does not supplement NAD+ but instead encourages the salvage pathway, it prevents the risk of elevating NAD+ to levels that could cause harm. 

Commenting on the research, Maria C. Carrillo, PhD, Alzheimer's Association chief science officer and medical affairs lead, said:

This paper reports on a necessary and important scientific step in investigating a fascinating idea — that brain resilience can be enhanced to reverse Alzheimer's-related damage, or prevent Alzheimer's-related pathology if started early in the disease process — but the research is still preliminary… the notion that we are seriously investigating the reversal of Alzheimer's can give everyone a sense of hope that the field is working to create a world without Alzheimer's and all other diseases that cause dementia.

Although these results are promising, it is important to emphasize that further research is necessary before translating this approach into human clinical trials.

The research team note that the next steps for research will include pinpointing the most crucial aspects of brain energy balance that drive recovery, as well as exploring complementary treatments. 

Pieper concluded that “these results were very encouraging because they suggest dementia might not always be irreversible and support testing this approach in people.”

“Because we observed disturbed NAD+ homeostasis in human Alzheimer's brains and because NAD+ is central to many conserved cellular processes, this strategy has a strong biological rationale for humans. That said, mouse results do not guarantee human success. The next step is well-controlled clinical testing to determine safety and efficacy in people,” he told us.

Planning to save time by doing your shopping online? If so, it's possible you're not doing your well-being any favors. A study from Aalto University in Finland has found that online shopping is more strongly linked to stress than reading the news, checking your inbox or watching adult entertainment. The internet can be both a source and a reliever of stress though, according to research –– so do we scroll because we're stressed, or are we stressed because we scroll? 

It's a complex problem to unravel, according to doctoral researcher Mohammed Belal.

'Previous studies have shown that social media and online shopping are often used to relieve stress. However, our results show that a rise in social media use or online shopping is linked to an increase in self-reported stress across multiple user groups and across devices,' he says.

The study found that users of YouTube and streaming services, as well as online gamers, also reported increased stress levels. For people experiencing high-stress, time spent on social media was twice more likely to be linked to stress as compared to time spent on gaming. Meanwhile, across many user groups, those who spent more time reading emails and news, or watching adult entertainment, reported lower stress-levels –– although the researchers note that they looked only at the time spent on news sites, not their content.

'Somewhat surprisingly, people who spent a lot of time on news sites reported less stress than others. On the other hand, those who already experienced a lot of stress didn't spend much time on news sites –– and that's consistent with previous research that shows that stress can reduce news consumption,' Belal says.

Overall, the study found a strong connection between internet use, in general, and heightened stress, especially among those who already experienced a lot of stress in daily life. Women reported more stress than men, and the older and wealthier the participant, the less stress they experienced. The de-stressing effect of adult entertainment may be explained by the fact that it was usually consumed in small doses, acting as a short-term stress or boredom reliever.

The study, to be published in the Journal of Medical Internet Research on 9 January 2026, recorded the internet usage of nearly 1,500 adults over a seven-month period. After that, data from nearly 47 million web visits and 14 million app usages was combined with users' self-reported stress.

The research comes at a time when the effects of social media on well-being are under increasing scrutiny. For example, a recent ban in Australia on social media for children has the rest of the world watching closely. Yet despite the increasing influence of the internet on our lives, our scientific understanding of the impacts of its use on well-being is remarkably limited, says Belal.

'It leaves a huge critical gap in understanding how online behaviors impact stress and well-being,' Belal points out.

With the aim of closing this gap, the study is among the first to use a tracking programme installed on users' devices, rather than asking subjects to self-report their usage, explains assistant professor Juhi Kulshrestha. The long duration and large sample size of the research also make the findings particularly significant.

However, she points out that further research is needed to disentangle the relationship between stress and well-being and internet usage.

'Are people more stressed because they are spending more time online shopping or on social media, or are such sites offering them an important support in times of duress? It's really crucial that we study these issues further so we can solve that chicken and egg problem,' says Kulshrestha. 'Putting a blanket ban or upper limits on certain kinds of internet usage may not actually end up solving the issues, and could even take away a vital support for people who are struggling.'

Either way, the researchers see practical applications for the results in the development of well-being and online services. In future, they plan to examine the consumption of different types of news, such as political, entertainment, or sports news, and how it relates to stress and other well-being variables. The hope is that better data will lead to helping internet users maintain a healthy balance.

'As we gain increasingly accurate information about people's internet usage, it will be possible to design new kinds of tools that people can use to regulate their browsing and improve their well-being,' says Kulshrestha.

A new study suggests that the immune checkpoint inhibitor, durvalumab, may offer new treatment options for patients living with small cell lung cancer (SCLC). However, its cost raises questions about sustainability, prevention and access. The findings, published in the Dec. 19, 2025, issue of JCO Global Oncology, are accompanied by an editorial, titled ""Durvalumab in Limited-Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer: Clinical Triumph and Toward Sustainable Value.""

SCLC is among the most aggressive forms of lung cancer, accounting for about 15% of cases. Known for its rapid progression and poor prognosis, it has long been treated with a standard regimen of chemotherapy and radiation-a formula that has barely changed in decades. Five-year survival rates hover around 25% to 30%, leaving patients and families with limited hope.

Now, immunotherapy is rewriting the narrative. Durvalumab has emerged as a promising addition to the treatment landscape for limited-stage disease. Backed by the ADRIATIC trial, this therapy offers something patients have desperately needed: more time.

""Durvalumab represents a turning point in maintenance therapy for SCLC,"" said Chinmay Jani, M.D., first author on the study and chief fellow in hematology and oncology at Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, part of the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine. ""We're seeing survival gains that were unimaginable just a few years ago.""

The ADRIATIC trial evaluated durvalumab as maintenance therapy following chemoradiation. Results were striking: overall survival extended to 66.1 months, compared with 57.8 months for standard care. Progression-free survival also improved-40.2 months versus 31.8 months.

But hope comes at a steep price. The study revealed that durvalumab therapy costs $163,722, compared with $25,816 for standard care. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) reached $383,069 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY)-far above the U.S. willingness-to-pay threshold of $150,000/QALY.

""Cost-effectiveness isn't just a metric-it shapes real-world access,"" said Gilberto Lopes, M.D., chief of the Division of Medical Oncology and associate director for global oncology at Sylvester. ""We need strategies that make innovation sustainable.""

Interestingly, the analysis found that for patients with extrathoracic progression, durvalumab nearly met cost-effectiveness standards, with an ICER of $151,137/QALY. This suggests that precision medicine-tailoring therapy to specific patient profiles-could optimize both outcomes and affordability.

Environmental antimicrobial resistance is turning rivers, soils, and even the air into hidden highways for ""superbugs,"" according to a new review that calls for urgent, coordinated action across human, animal, and environmental health. The authors argue that protecting people from drug resistant infections now depends as much on wastewater plants and farms as it does on hospitals.

Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) occurs when bacteria and other microbes evolve the ability to survive medicines that once killed them, making common infections harder or impossible to treat. The World Health Organization already lists AMR as one of the most serious global health threats of this century, with some estimates warning of tens of millions of deaths and massive economic losses if action fails.​

The new study shows that the environment is not just a passive backdrop. Rivers, lakes, soils, oceans, and even air can carry resistance genes and resistant bacteria that move between wildlife, livestock, and people, helping create a truly global network of AMR.​

The review highlights several major environmental ""hotspots"" where resistance builds up and spreads.​

Hospital and city wastewater treatment plants act as central mixing hubs, collecting antibiotic residues, resistant pathogens, and mobile genetic elements from homes and clinics. Conventional treatment often fails to fully remove these contaminants, allowing resistance genes to persist in effluent water and sewage sludge.​

Livestock farms and aquaculture systems use large quantities of antibiotics, enriching resistance genes in animal gut microbes and manure that then reach soils, crops, and surrounding waters.​

Pharmaceutical manufacturing facilities can discharge extremely high levels of both antibiotics and resistance genes, raising the risk that dangerous resistance traits spread downstream.​

Across these sites, resistance genes can hitchhike on mobile genetic elements such as plasmids, making it easier for bacteria to ""swap"" resistance traits and create multidrug resistant strains.​

Most AMR surveillance still focuses on clinical samples, but the authors argue that environmental monitoring needs to catch up. Classic culture based tests remain important because they measure whether bacteria actually survive antibiotics, and they provide live isolates for further study. However, many environmental bacteria cannot be grown easily in the lab, and these methods can miss most of the resistance present.​

Newer tools are rapidly changing the picture:

Phenotypic methods such as flow cytometry and Raman spectroscopy can track resistant cells and gene transfer in complex samples within hours, without requiring cultivation.​

Genotypic methods such as high throughput quantitative PCR, CRISPR based assays, and metagenomic sequencing can detect hundreds of resistance genes at once, and identify which bacteria carry them.​

Long read sequencing now allows researchers to reconstruct entire mobile genetic elements and see exactly how resistance genes are organized and move between hosts.​

""The message is clear"" said lead author Huilin Zhang. ""No single method can capture the full story of environmental resistance. What we need is integrated surveillance that links what bacteria can do to what genes they carry, and where they are spreading.""​

The review is framed within the One Health concept, which emphasizes that human, animal, and environmental health are tightly connected. The authors propose tackling AMR on two fronts source control to reduce the amount of antibiotics, resistant bacteria, and resistance genes entering the environment, and process control to intercept them along key pathways such as wastewater treatment.​

Source control measures include stricter antibiotic stewardship in medicine and agriculture, better regulation in low and middle income regions, and cleaner production in pharmaceutical industries. The authors also highlight emerging ""green"" solutions, such as enhanced biodegradation of antibiotics, design of more biodegradable drugs, and alternative antimicrobials like peptides and phages.​

On the process side, improved wastewater treatment and waste management are crucial. Conventional disinfection can reduce many resistant bacteria but may leave resistance genes intact, especially in solid waste streams. More advanced approaches such as hyperthermophilic composting, advanced oxidation, membrane processes, nanomaterials, bacteriophage based treatments, engineered DNA scavenging bacteria, and CRISPR based tools show promise but require further research, safety evaluation, and cost reduction.​

Instead of simply counting how many resistance genes exist, the authors argue that surveillance and policy should prioritize traits that really drive health risk. Three stand out:​

Mobility: how easily genes move between bacteria and environments.​

Host pathogenicity: whether the bacterial hosts are capable of causing disease in humans or animals.​

Multi resistance: whether genes and their hosts resist multiple key antibiotics, limiting treatment options.​

""Environmental AMR is not just about how many resistance genes we can find"" said corresponding author Feng Ju. ""What matters most is which genes are mobile, which pathogens carry them, and how they evolve in real world ecosystems. That is where surveillance must focus, and where mitigation will have the biggest impact.""​

The authors call for global, standardized protocols that make environmental AMR data comparable across countries and over time. Without such standards, they warn, the world will struggle to spot emerging threats early enough and to design effective One Health interventions that protect both people and the planet.​

Researchers from Tokyo Metropolitan University have developed a suite of algorithms to automate the counting of sister chromatid exchanges (SCE) in chromosomes under the microscope. Conventional analysis requires trained personnel and time, with variability between different people. The team's machine-learning-based algorithm boasts an accuracy of 84% and gives a more objective measurement. This could be a game changer for diagnosing disorders tied to abnormal numbers of SCEs, like Bloom syndrome.

DNA, the blueprint of life for all living organisms, is found packaged inside complex structures called chromosomes. When DNA is replicated, two identical strands known as sister chromatids, each carrying exactly the same genetic information, are formed. Unlike in meiosis, sister chromatids do not need to undergo recombination during mitosis, and in most cases they are transmitted intact to the daughter cells. However, when some form of damage occurs in DNA, the organism attempts to repair the lesion by using the remaining undamaged DNA as a template. During this repair process, it often happens that specific segments of the sister chromatids are exchanged with each other. During this repair process, it often happens that specific segments of the sister chromatids are exchanged with each other. This ""sister chromatic exchange"" (SCE) is not harmful itself, but too many can be a good indicator for some serious disorders. Examples include Bloom syndrome: affected people can have a predisposition to cancer.

To count SCEs, normal methods involve experienced clinicians looking at stained chromosomes under the microscope, trying to identify the telltale ""swapped"" segments of sister chromatids. Not only is this labor intensive and slow, but it can also be subjective, dependent on how the human eye perceives features. A fully automated analysis of microscope images would save time and give objective measures of the number of SCEs, for more consistent diagnoses across different clinical environments.

Now, a team led by Professors Kiyoshi Nishikawa and Kan Okubo from Tokyo Metropolitan University have developed a suite of algorithms using machine learning to count SCEs in images. They combined separate methods, one to identify individual chromosomes, another to tell whether there are SCEs, and finally, another to cluster and count them, giving an objective, fully automated measurement of the number of SCEs in a microscope image. They found an accuracy of 84.1%, a level which is enough for practical applications. To see how it performed with real data, they collected images of chromosomes from cells with an artificially knocked out BLM gene, the kind of suppression seen in Bloom syndrome patients. The team's algorithm was able to give counts for SCEs which were consistent with those given by human counters.

Work is currently under way to use the vast amounts of available clinical data to train the algorithm, with more refinements to come. The team believes that replacing manual counting with full automation will help realize faster, more objective clinical analysis than ever before, and that this is only the beginning for what AI can bring to medical research.

This work was supported by JSPS KAKENHI Grant Numbers 22H05072, 25K09513, and 22K12170.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Study uncovers a neural brake that limits motivation during unpleasant situations","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20260109/Study-uncovers-a-neural-brake-that-limits-motivation-during-unpleasant-situations.aspx","Sat, 10 Jan 2026 02:33:00 GMT","

Most of us know the feeling: maybe it is making a difficult phone call, starting a report you fear will be criticized, or preparing a presentation that's stressful just to think about. You understand what needs to be done, yet taking that very first step feels surprisingly hard. When this difficulty becomes severe, it is known medically as avolition. People with avolition are not lazy or unaware: they know what they need to do, but their brain seems unable to push the ""go"" button. Avolition is commonly seen in conditions such as depression, schizophrenia, and Parkinson's disease, and it seriously disrupts a person's ability to manage daily life and maintain social functions.

Research in neuroscience and psychology has suggested that before we act, the brain weighs how much effort a task may cost. If the cost feels too high, motivation drops. But until now, it has been unclear how the brain turns this judgment into a decision not to act. To explore this question, a research team at WPI-ASHBi applied an advanced genetic technique called chemogenetics to highly intelligent macaque monkeys, allowing them to adjust communication temporarily and precisely between specific brain regions and identify a circuit that acts like a brake on motivation.

The monkeys were trained to perform two types of tasks. In one, completing the task earned a water reward. In the other, the reward came with an added downside: an unpleasant air puff to the face. Before each trial, the monkeys saw a cue and could freely decide whether to start or not. The researchers focused not on which option the monkeys chose, but on something more fundamental: did they take the first step at all? As expected, when the task involved only a reward, the monkeys usually got started without hesitation. But when the task involved an unpleasant air puff, they often held back, even though a reward was still available.

The researchers then temporarily weakened a specific brain connection linking two regions involved in motivation: the ventral striatum (VS) and the ventral pallidum (VP). In the reward-only task, suppressing this pathway had little effect on monkey behavior, and the monkeys initiated the task normally. In contrast, in tasks involving an unpleasant air puff, the mental brake to starting had eased: the monkeys became much more willing to start. Importantly, the monkeys' ability to judge rewards and punishments did not change. What changed was the step between knowing and doing.

The researchers took a closer look at what was actually happening in these brain regions during this process. Neural activity in the VS increased during the stressful task, suggesting it helps the brain register when a situation feels stressful. In contrast, activity in the VP gradually fell as the monkeys became less willing to start the task, showing that these two regions play different roles. Together, these findings show that the VS to VP pathway functions as a ""motivation brake"" that suppresses the internal ""go"" button, particularly when facing stressful or unpleasant tasks.

This discovery of the VS–VP ""motivation brake"" may shed light on conditions such as depression and schizophrenia, where severe loss of motivation is common. In the future, interventions such as deep brain stimulation, non-invasive brain stimulation, or new drug strategies might aim to fine-tune this brake when it becomes too tight. But this ""brake"" exists for a reason. While an overly tight brake can lead to avolition, a brake that is too loose could make it harder to stop, even in excessively stressful situations, potentially leading to burnout. In other words, the VS–VP circuit may help keep motivation within a healthy range. ""Over weakening the motivation brake could lead to dangerous behavior or excessive risk-taking,"" said Ken-ichi Amemori, lead author of the study. ""Careful validation and ethical discussion will be necessary to determine how and when such interventions should be used.""

In modern society, especially at a time when burnout is at an all-time high, these findings invite us to rethink what ""motivation"" really means. The brain can actively dampen the drive to act when tasks are unpleasant or stressful, so getting started is not simply about willpower. Rather than trying to forcibly boost motivation, the focus should shift toward how society can better support people in coping with stress. This is a question that warrants broader societal dialogue.

Professor Zhaohui Tang and Associate Professor Zhilin Liu from the team of Professor Xuesi Chen at the Changchun Institute of Applied Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences, developed ultrasound-responsive in-situ antigen nanocatchers (S-nanocatchers), achieving precise spatiotemporal capture of tumor antigens and controllable acquisition of in-situ vaccines. This system solves the key problems of traditional antigen-capturing nanocarriers, such as their tendency to non-specifically bind to serum proteins during systemic circulation and their low antigen capture efficiency, providing a novel strategy for personalized tumor immunotherapy. The article was published as an open access Research Article in CCS Chemistry, the flagship journal of the Chinese Chemical Society.

The high heterogeneity of tumor antigens in cancer patients is a key limiting factor for improving the efficacy of tumor vaccines, with significant differences in antigen characteristics among different patients and even different lesions within the same patient. In situ tumor vaccine strategies, by directly utilizing endogenous antigens in the tumor microenvironment, eliminate the need for complex antigen separation processes, effectively overcoming this heterogeneity challenge. Currently used antigen release methods such as phototherapy and radiotherapy have limitations, including shallow tissue penetration and potential damage to normal tissues. Ultrasound technology, with its deep penetration and high biocompatibility, has become an ideal stimulus for in situ vaccine development. However, ultrasound-mediated antigen release alone faces challenges such as poor antigen stability and insufficient dendritic cell (DC) presentation, limiting immune activation. Achieving efficient acquisition and precise capture of in situ antigens has become a breakthrough in improving the efficacy of in situ vaccines.

This study designed ultrasound-responsive antigen catchers, S-nanocatchers, with polyglutamic acid (PLG) as the main chain, bonded with a thioether-containing antigen-catching group (S-ACG) and the sonosensitive agent pyrophyllofoetate a (PPA). After self-assembly, the hydrophobic S-ACG and PPA are encapsulated in the nanoparticle core, avoiding non-specific interactions with serum proteins during systemic circulation. When subjected to ultrasound therapy, the reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated by PPA not only induce immunogenic death (ICD) of tumor cells to release antigens, but also oxidize the thioether to hydrophilic sulfones or sulfoxides, exposing the antigen-catching group on the nanoparticle surface, achieving efficient capture of thiol-containing small molecules, peptides, and tumor antigens.

The control group (C-nanocatchers) had its thioether replaced with a carbon chain, and showed no significant antigen-binding ability regardless of whether it was sonicated, confirming the sulfur oxidation-dependent switching mechanism. This system efficiently activates dendritic cell (DC) maturation and migration. Combined with the TLR7/8 agonist IMDQ, it achieved a 93.4% primary tumor inhibition rate and a 60% complete distant tumor regression rate in a B16F10 melanoma mouse model, with no significant systemic toxicity. By enhancing CD8-positive T cell infiltration and the release of cytokines such as IFN-γ and TNF-α, it reshapes the anti-tumor immune microenvironment, providing a universal and precise personalized immunotherapy platform.

This study combines ultrasound-guided antigen capture with in situ vaccine synthesis, achieving precise spatiotemporal capture of tumor antigens through a ""smart switch"" mechanism of thioether oxidation, effectively solving the non-specific binding problem of traditional nanocarriers. Ultrasound-responsive antigen catchers (S-nanocatchers) can not only efficiently induce local tumor immune responses but also activate systemic anti-tumor immunity through combination with immune adjuvants, providing a new solution for overcoming tumor heterogeneity and distant metastasis.

Earthworms could become unexpected allies in the global fight against antibiotic resistance, by helping farmers turn manure into safer, high-value organic fertilizer through a process called vermicomposting. Researchers report that this low energy, nature-based technology can remove antibiotic resistance genes far more consistently than conventional composting, while also improving soil health and supporting sustainable agriculture.

The World Health Organization has named antimicrobial resistance one of the most serious threats to modern medicine, and livestock production is a major part of the problem. When animals receive antibiotics, resistance genes accumulate in their manure, and if that manure is spread on fields without proper treatment, those genes can move into soil, water, crops and eventually the human gut. Conventional composting helps, but its performance is unstable and in some cases key resistance markers can even rebound during the composting process.​

Vermicomposting uses earthworms and their associated microbes to transform raw manure into a stable, crumbly product known as vermicast. Under carefully controlled moisture, temperature and nutrient conditions, this mesophilic process not only recycles waste into fertilizer but also achieves multi pathway reduction of antibiotic resistance genes. Studies summarized in the new review show that vermicomposting can reduce the total abundance of resistance genes by roughly 70 to 95 percent and mobile genetic elements by up to 68 percent, often outperforming traditional compost piles.​

""Earthworms are not just passive decomposers, they are active engineers of a safer microenvironment,"" says corresponding author Fengxia Yang of the Agro Environmental Protection Institute, Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, China. ""By reshaping microbial communities and disrupting gene transfer, they help cut the chain of antibiotic resistance spread from farms to people.""​

The authors describe vermicomposting as an integrated physical, chemical and biological barrier against antibiotic resistance. As earthworms burrow and feed, they increase porosity and aeration in the manure, maintaining oxygen rich conditions that suppress many anaerobic bacteria that often carry resistance genes and support faster breakdown of residual antibiotics. Inside the earthworm gut, mechanical grinding, digestive enzymes and a specialized microbiome further damage resistant bacteria and disturb both intracellular and extracellular DNA.​

A key advantage lies in how earthworms restructure the microbial community. Their activity shifts the system away from fast growing opportunistic bacteria that frequently host resistance genes toward more stable, functionally beneficial groups involved in decomposition and nitrogen fixation. At the same time, vermicomposting lowers the abundance of mobile genetic elements such as plasmids and integrons, which are the vehicles that shuttle resistance genes between bacteria through horizontal gene transfer.​

Beyond the gut, earthworm epidermal mucus and coelomic fluid act as a biochemical interface in the composting mass. This mucus contains carbohydrates, proteins, lipids and bioactive molecules including antimicrobial peptides, lysozymes and DNases that can damage bacterial cell membranes, generate reactive oxygen species and directly degrade resistance genes. Laboratory studies cited in the review show that coelomic fluid can cut multidrug resistant Escherichia coli populations by several orders of magnitude within hours and remove over 90 percent of extracellular resistance genes through DNA cutting activity.​

Mucus also alters microbial behavior by interfering with bacterial communication systems and gene expression. In one mechanistic study, exposure to earthworm coelomic fluid led to thousands of bacterial genes being up or down regulated, disrupting pathways that bacteria rely on for coordination and conjugation. Network analyses indicate that after earthworm processing, the statistical links between resistance genes and their bacterial hosts weaken, suggesting that vermicomposting ecologically decouples resistance traits from the microbes that carry them.​

Performance improves further when vermicomposting is combined with functional materials such as biochar, zeolite or clay minerals. These additives can adsorb antibiotics and heavy metals, easing stress on earthworms and microbes while stabilizing pollutants and reducing the selective pressure that favors resistant bacteria. In trials summarized by the authors, pairing earthworms with biochar or mineral amendments increased earthworm growth, accelerated organic matter degradation, improved humification and raised removal rates for both resistance genes and heavy metal resistance markers.​

Together, earthworm activity, mucus derived biochemistry and tailored additives create a multi level containment system that acts from molecules to whole ecosystems. The result is a more robust, stable reduction of antibiotic resistance genes than is typically achieved in conventional composting alone, while producing a high quality organic fertilizer that can improve soil structure, water retention and plant nutrition.​

Despite these advantages, the authors caution that significant challenges remain before vermicomposting can be deployed widely as an antibiotic resistance control strategy. Different earthworm species vary in their tolerance to antibiotics and environmental conditions, and key operating parameters such as stocking density, feedstock composition, temperature and moisture must be fine tuned for each type of agricultural waste. Large scale systems must also address climate sensitivity, reactor design, automation and the logistics of maintaining healthy earthworm populations at industrial scale.​

Another open question is the long term fate of any resistance genes that remain in vermicompost once it is applied to fields. The review calls for multi year field studies and realistic risk assessments to understand whether residual genes can be reactivated under new stresses such as heavy metals or additional antibiotic use. The authors argue that future work should integrate multi omics tools, artificial intelligence models and engineered treatment trains that combine thermal pretreatment, vermicomposting and targeted polishing steps such as enzyme or phage applications.​

""Antibiotic resistance is a complex, system wide problem and no single technology will solve it,"" Yang notes. ""But by harnessing earthworms and modern biotechnology together, vermicomposting offers a practical pathway to make manure recycling safer for farmers, consumers and the environment.""​

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Study reveals how tuberculosis exploits immune defenses to promote infection","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20260109/Study-reveals-how-tuberculosis-exploits-immune-defenses-to-promote-infection.aspx","Sat, 10 Jan 2026 01:56:00 GMT","

Scientists have made a discovery that helps explain why humans and animals are so susceptible to contracting tuberculosis(TB) – and it involves the bacteria harnessing part of the immune system meant to protect against infection.

Despite more than 100 years of research, tuberculosis remains one of the deadliest bacterial infections in humans, resulting in 1.5 million deaths each year.

Tuberculosis (TB) is caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB). Infection occurs when the bacteria are inhaled and taken up by specialist immune cells, such as macrophages, which recognise MTB and trigger a range of cellular and immune responses. These responses are mediated by receptors – molecules on the surface of immune cells that can recognise microbes. One such receptor is Dectin-1, which is best known for its role in anti-fungal immunity.

However, MTB has evolved a range of strategies to overcome these defences, manipulating host cells so they can survive and replicate. Now, an international research collaboration co-led by the University of Exeter has discovered that MTB survives within the cells of its host by targeting Dectin-1. Published in Science Immunology, the finding gives new insight into how TB takes hold to cause disease.

Dr. Max Gutierrez, of the Francis Crick Institute said: ""TB is a major killer worldwide, yet we still know very little about how it is so effective at causing infections, in both humans and in animals. Our discovery of a new mechanism by which Mycobacterium tuberculosis is able to subvert host immunity is a key step in understanding the basis of susceptibility to TB.""

In work supported by Wellcome and the Medical Research Council, the team showed that instead of protecting against infection, as occurs during fungal infection, MTB utilizes the responses triggered by Dectin-1 to drive its own survival. When this Dectin-1 pathway was absent, both human and mouse cells could control MTB infection. Indeed, mice lacking Dectin-1 were much more resistant to MTB infection.

The team, made up of Osaka University, the University of Cape Town and the Francis Crick Institute and others, also discovered that the bacteria produces a unique molecule called alpha-glucan to target Dectin-1 to induce these determinantal immune cell responses.

Professor Sho Yamasaki, Osaka University, said: ""Our results are surprising, because Dectin-1 is a key part of the body's defence system to protect against fungal infections, yet we've shown it's detrimental for MTB infections and actually promotes bacterial survival.""

Associate Professor Claire Hoving, UCT, said: ""This research is a true international collaboration, with each institution bringing a distinct area of expertise. It's a fantastic example of the global partnerships required to tackle some of the greatest health challenges of our time.""

Professor Gordon Brown, of the University of Exeter's MRC Centre for Medical Mycology, said: ""This discovery is the first step – and opens the door to exciting new prospects including, for example, if we could knock out this receptor in cattle to make them more resistant to infection.""

The study is titled 'Mycobacterial α-glucans hijack Dectin-1 to facilitate intracellular bacterial survival', and is published in Science Immunology.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=women's+us+soccer","Lindsey Heaps is a natural in the Champions League. But will other USWNT stars fit well in Europe?","https://www.inquirer.com/soccer/lindsey-heaps-uswnt-champions-league-womens-world-cup-20260110.html","Sat, 10 Jan 2026 10:00:01 GMT","

It's a valid question, but so is a truth that Europe's chattering class doesn't like admitting. Very few European clubs are truly at a high enough level to be right for elite U.S. talent.

Although some of Lindsey Heaps' games in Europe aren't easy for American fans to watch, the chances that do come along show why she's so comfortable there.

The 31-year-old midfielder plays for her club, France's OL Lyonnes, as more of a facilitator than the do-it-all general she's often been cast as with the United States — not just by fans, but by coaches over the years.

It's easy to focus on Heaps not scoring, especially given that she started her career as a forward before moving into midfield. But her last game for OL, against Spain's Atlético Madrid in the Champions League, showed a different side of Heaps.

She completed 42 of 44 passes that night, continuing a pace of a 90% pass completion rate in Champions League games this season, and had eight defensive recoveries. The players around her did most of the creating, especially midfielder Melchie Dumornay and wingers Tabitha Chawinga and Kadidiatou Diani.

Any team would dream of having OL's squad of superstars. The club was the standard-bearer in Europe long before American businesswoman Michelle Kang bought it in 2023 (she also owns the NWSL's Washington Spirit and England's London City Lionesses), and it has remained at that level.

No team in France comes close to OL's 18 league titles, all won in the last 19 years — as in, every season except one. Nor is any team in Europe close to OL's eight Champions League triumphs from 2011-22, even though Barcelona is the continent's top team right now.

Heaps has three league winners' medals and one from the European Cup, and could add to both totals this season. OL is running away with the French league, and earned a round-of-16 bye in the Champions League thanks to an unbeaten group stage run.

“It's unbelievable, I think this year especially,” she told The Inquirer. “New coach, new culture a bit, standards, competitiveness. The training is unbelievable in everything that we're doing, and obviously you see it on the pitch as well. But we take each game at a time, and we just keep rolling.”

That new coach is a familiar name: Jonatan Giráldez, who joined OL from the Washington Spirit in the summer. It was a controversial move, since Kang was accused of taking from one of her teams to boost another. 

But that claim is above Heaps' pay grade.

“Honestly, I think I speak for everyone on the team: he is such a quality coach,” Heaps said. “You just learn so much, and even for me, I want to continue learning, or looking at the game in a different way, or tactical adjustments, or things like that. … He wants us to win so badly, and he wants us to do so well as players, and he cares about us — he cares about how we do and how we perform, but also us as people.”

Giráldez returned the praise.

“A very, very important player,” he said of Heaps. “Her role on the field is beyond the tactical, because she's able to understand a lot of situations on the field — when the team has the ball, when the team doesn't have the ball. … I'm very happy to have her in the team.”

Heaps mentioned the team's “training environment” a few times in the interview, praising the high standards there. That counts for a lot, especially among U.S. national team stalwarts.

For lack of a better way to put it, the top American players have long relished getting their butts kicked on a daily basis, whether by the NWSL's competitive balance or the famed ferocity of U.S. practices.

Heaps is the latest in a lineage from Mia Hamm through Abby Wambach, Heather O'Reilly, Julie Ertz, and Carli Lloyd, all of whom spoke just as bluntly (and sometimes more so). Now Heaps wants to pass it on to a new era.

She gets to do that in Lyon, not just with the national team. The club's squad includes 22-year-old American midfielder Korbin Shrader and 18-year-old Lily Yohannes, the latter of whom is starting to meet the hype as a generational talent.

Unfortunately, Yohannes hasn't gotten to play much in the Champions League this season. She didn't play at all against Atlético Madrid, where the tactical matchup would have been a great lesson.

Heaps also wanted that, but she preached patience.

“We all need to remember that she's 18 years old,” she said. “At the end of the day, she needs to keep doing her thing, because she's been playing so well — she's been playing well with the national team, she's training well here. And like I said before, it is just such a competitive environment.”

But Heaps is not immune to the buzz around Yohannes, and didn't mind indulging in some.

“I know these games mean a lot for her, but her ceiling is so, so high,” she said. “I just said to her that no matter what, in a few years from now, you're going to remember games like this that maybe you don't come into. But you're going to be a starting player and a non-stop player, and I believe the best midfielder in the world soon to come.”

Yohannes has played her entire career in Europe, and Heaps has played eight of her 14 professional years there. The American contingent across the Atlantic keeps growing, with Penn State product Sam Coffey soon to join it at England's Manchester City.

Will playing overseas fit other Americans as well as it does Heaps? The question is always on the table, but it's in bright lights above Trinity Rodman's head right now. Her standoff with the NWSL over getting paid what she's worth — with Kang on her side, trying to structure a contract within the league's salary rules — has naturally led to European suitors chasing her.

It might also reveal a truth that Europe's chattering class doesn't like admitting. Very few European clubs are truly at a high enough level to be right for elite U.S. talents.

Lyon is one for sure, but there would be an even bigger uproar if Rodman moves there. Barcelona is another, but the Spanish giants don't sign Americans. Manchester City, Arsenal, and Chelsea measure up in England, but Chelsea's roster looks too loaded to have room for Rodman right now.

Beyond them? Paris Saint-Germain was in that class, but has fallen hard this year. Germany's Wolfsburg is far from its past glories, and Bayern Munich still has a ways to rise. Real Madrid and Manchester United have stars, but their ownerships aren't trusted to build truly top programs.

The highest tier is really just the first five clubs you read above, and that's not much.

Then add in Rodman's huge commercial impact, which would be diminished going abroad — less so in England, but still notably.

Many clubs outside England also have poor attendances. OL averages just over 5,000 in a 59,000-seat stadium despite all its stars. PSG plays almost all its French league games at a 1,500-seat field within the bigger club's practice facilities, far out in the Paris suburbs. Both are a far cry from the 15,259 that Washington averaged this year, or the even bigger crowds in Los Angeles and Portland.

Not for nothing, then, did U.S. legend Tobin Heath — who played for PSG, Manchester United and Arsenal amid many years in American leagues — recently say Rodman should stay in the NWSL.

“I advise a lot on players going or staying, and 95% of the time, I will usually say go,” she said in an interview on fellow former superstar Megan Rapinoe's podcast. “I think that her game will be 1000% louder here. I think she can be the face of the league.”

At the time Heaps was asked, the NWSL was still putting together its new High Impact Player rule. She had heard about it, but the details hadn't all been published yet — including the controversial rules on how players qualify. So Heaps chose her words carefully, but she had plenty of them.

“I don't think it's a bad idea,” she said, tying in what she has seen over the years from MLS's Designated Player rule. (Her husband Tyler is San Diego FC's sporting director.). “If you want some of the best players in the world to come and play in the NWSL, some things do have to change. … We want to continue growing the league. So, what's the best way of doing that? We've got to get the best players there.”

It was also easy to think Rodman's situation would be settled by now. Heaps wondered if it might not just come down to salary, but she encouraged Rodman to do what she feels is right.

“Trinity needs to do what's best for her,” Heaps said. “The money is kind of on the side of it — obviously, that's a big thing for us professionals. But Trinity, she's going to make the decision that's best for her, and I think that's the most important.” ","{'href': 'https://www.inquirer.com', 'title': 'Inquirer.com'}","soccer"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=fifa+world+cup","What Mamdani actually said about World Cup tickets","https://www.snopes.com/news/2026/01/10/mamdani-world-cup-tickets/","Sat, 10 Jan 2026 14:01:42 GMT","

In January 2026, Zohran Mamdani took office as New York City's mayor, promising to make the city more affordable for residents. One of his earliest actions was signing executive orders aimed at cracking down on companies imposing ""junk fees"" and trapping consumers in subscriptions. 

Critics claimed Mamdani also promised to make FIFA World Cup tickets ""available to all."" The FIFA World Cup soccer tournament will be taking place in the U.S., Canada and Mexico in summer 2026. 

Many online poked fun at Mamdani's purported quote, saying the New York mayor had no power to influence FIFA ticket prices. Community Notes on X pointed out that World Cup games were going to be held in New Jersey and not New York.

(X user @MamdaniWatch)

While Mamdani did not specifically state he was making World Cup tickets ""available to all,"" he did call on FIFA to make ticket prices more affordable and opposed the organization's ""dynamic pricing"" policy. Mamdani also said he wanted to make the World Cup and other experiences be ""available to each and every New Yorker."" 

Dynamic pricing is a strategy in which a company adjusts its product prices based on market demand, supply changes, and other external and internal factors, leading to fluctuating prices, according to Britannica.

We reached out to the mayor's office to determine how exactly he would make FIFA tickets more affordable for New Yorkers and will update this story if we receive a response. 

Mamdani made the comments about FIFA's pricing policies at a news conference on Jan. 5, 2026, where he discussed his executive orders. A journalist asked him how the mayor's team would tackle dynamic pricing. Mamdani replied (emphasis ours): 

I am thankful that we have an incoming speaker who, as she said, had introduced legislation not even less than a year ago that spoke to dynamic pricing specifically within the question of groceries. And I continue to voice my opposition to the use of dynamic pricing here for the soon-to-come World Cup and the necessity of it being a more affordable experience for all. And I look forward to the conversations, ones that have already begun, both internally and externally, in making that case. 

Because what we are seeing — you know, I had a New Yorker the other day, come up to me and ask me if there was any way I could help him get World Cup tickets, because he was saying that the cost that he saw for a game was $600. This is increasingly out of reach. We have made what used to be a working-class game into a luxury experience. 

And there are too many for whom it doesn't matter where the World Cup is being played in the world, they know where they're going to watch it. It's TV. And we want to ensure that there are more experiences available to each and every New Yorker.

Mamdani made the comments at the 28:40 mark of the video below:



Mamdani was critical of World Cup ticket prices throughout his 2025 mayoral campaign. In September 2025, he released a video along with a petition calling on FIFA to ""end dynamic pricing, cap resale costs, and set aside 15% of tickets for local residents at a discount."" 

In December 2025, Mamdani said in an interview with CBS News that he would appoint a ""World Cup czar"" who would push FIFA to lower ticket prices. 

""The cheapest ticket to the World Cup Final, which will be here in New York City and New Jersey, according to the Croatian Federation, is $4,000. That's five times more expensive than it was to go to the final in Qatar,"" he said. 

World Cup games are going to be held in a New Jersey stadium, but New York City is expected to play a big role in hosting an influx of tourists and related events. According to FIFA's website, the city will host official events and even a ""fan village."" 

It is unclear how Mamdani would apply his executive orders to FIFA World Cup tickets, given that the tickets will be sold across the U.S., Canada and Mexico. 

FIFA officials said ticket prices would start at $60 for group-stage matches but could increase to more than $6,000, adding that costs would fluctuate because of dynamic pricing. The organization also implemented a cap on resale prices for tickets in Mexico — something Mamdani has called for in the U.S. — due to the country's strict laws. In December 2025, FIFA said it would make some $60 tickets available for every game in North America for national federations to distribute among loyal fans. However, these tickets will likely be in the hundreds rather than the thousands, according to ESPN. 

While Mamdani did not exactly say that he would be making World Cup tickets ""available to all,"" he did say he wanted all New Yorkers to experience the World Cup and called on FIFA to make tickets affordable. While he has issued executive orders targeting business pricing practices in New York City, it wasn't immediately clear how they would apply to the World Cup. 

For further reading, have investigated numerous rumors about Mamdani, including the false claim that he was responsible for raising subway and bus fares.

The Pulse focuses on stories at the heart of health, science and innovation in the Philadelphia region.

The campaign features messaging and ads on billboards, transit shelters and at stations  emphasizing vigilance and help options for victims.

From Philly and the Pa. suburbs to South Jersey and Delaware, what would you like WHYY News to cover? Let us know!
With several FIFA World Cup soccer matches taking place in New Jersey this summer, NJ Transit has launched a “Safe Passage” antihuman trafficking awareness campaign.
New Jersey is often considered a hub for human trafficking because of its proximity to several major metropolitan areas, including New York City and Philadelphia, as well as for its dense and diverse population, and the extensive transportation routes that connect the state to the entire Northeast.
There is little empirical evidence that ties an increase in human trafficking to major sporting events. Korin Arkin, the director of survivor care and outreach at Polaris, a nonprofit organization that works to combat human trafficking, said that the state playing host to World Cup games does raise a red flag. The tristate area will welcome more than 1 million visitors for the FIFA World Cup 2026, which begins at Met Life Stadium in East Rutherford on June 13.

“It does create opportunities for trafficking in the construction industry, in the hospitality industry,” she said. “Obviously when you have a lot of people gathering in one place, there could be a lot more exploitation opportunities that occur.”
Arkin said human trafficking is an underreported crime across the nation. She said in 2024, which is the most recent data available, the National Human Trafficking Hotline received 884 calls, emails, texts and webchats from individuals in New Jersey.
“It does indicate people in New Jersey were reaching out to the hotline quite a bit,” she said. “It is significant.”
The ‘Safe Passage' campaign
The campaign will focus on public safety and awareness with billboards, transit shelter ads and station signage signs emphasizing protection, vigilance and help options. The agency will also distribute victim-support materials targeted at moments of potential separation from traffickers.
For the rest of this month, in recognition of National Human Trafficking Prevention Month, two NJ Transit buses wrapped in antihuman trafficking messaging will operate statewide.
During a press conference at Newark Penn Station on Thursday, NJ Transit President and CEO Kris Kolluri said the agency's most important obligation is to be a good community partner.
“What we're talking about is making sure we're protecting our fellow human beings, that's what this is about,” he said. “I think of no greater calling or privilege to make sure we protect our fellow human beings.”

NJ Transit Police Chief Christopher Trucillo said human trafficking often occurs in plain sight anonymously, in situations when people are distracted by getting from point A to point B, so law enforcement needs to be vigilant.
“That is why here at New Jersey Transit, every police officer is trained in the signs and indicators of human trafficking,” he said.
According to Trucillo, 1,500 frontline employees are receiving training, but he stressed that members of the traveling public are often the first to notice when something doesn't look right.
“Maybe you don't want to get involved, you're worried about being mistaken, don't feel that way. Don't be shy about reporting. Your eyes and ears matter too,” he said.

How trafficking works
According to Polaris, labor trafficking most often involves a simple job offer. The website indicates:

Anyone can be victimized by a labor trafficker, but certain people are far more vulnerable than others. Economic need is a key risk factor and immigrants – including immigrants who are in this country legally – are particularly vulnerable to labor trafficking.
“It becomes trafficking when pay or working conditions are abusive and the worker cannot quit or complain because the boss is threatening them or exploiting their desperate economic circumstances. Kidnapping or physical force are rarely part of how labor trafficking situations begin,” Polaris said.
Traffickers can be business owners, bosses or other workers with a managerial role in a formal business. Traffickers can also be victims' families or legal guardians, including parents, spouses and intimate partners.

Signs of trafficking
According to the Polly Klaas Foundation, a nonprofit dedicated to the safety of all children, there are indicators suggesting a child may be at risk of, or already is being trafficked:

Sudden changes in behavior: Unexplained shifts in personality, increased secrecy or involvement with questionable associates.
Physical indicators: Bruises, burns, tattoos, which are often used for branding, or multiple cellphones.
Unusual access to money or luxuries: Items outside a child's means, unexplained absences from school or new, expensive belongings.
Online solicitations: Communication with unknown adults or receipt of inappropriate content.

Officials said mass transit passengers can send an anonymous text message to NJTPD or call 911 if they believe something is wrong.

A split between Jason Wilcox and Ruben Amorim led to the latter's sacking at Manchester United after the Portuguese coach took issue with a comment made by the director of football. Amorim was sacked as the Red Devils coach last week after he exploded in a post-match press conference and made a number of pointed comments aimed at the club's hierarchy.

After the Red Devils struggled to a 1-1 draw against Premier League rivals Leeds United, Amorim came out in his conference with a point to make. He made a series of claims in a wild outburst which criticised the club's executives. It is now understood this was aimed towards Wilcox, who had been initially hesitant to appoint Amorim in November 2024.

When asked if he still has the board's backing, Amorim said: “To start with that, I noticed that you received selective information about everything. I came here to be the manager of Manchester United, not to be the coach of Manchester United. And that is clear.”

He continued to say that he is not Thomas Tuchel, Antonio Conte or Jose Mourinho – three managers known for their hands on approach when it comes to recruitment and club management – but added that: “I'm the manager of Manchester United.

“And it's going to be like this for 18 months or when the board decides to change. That was my point. I want to finish with that. I'm not going to quit. I will do my job until another guy is coming here to replace me.”

It is now being reported that the relationship between Wilcox and Amorim had broken down before the Leeds game. The Sunreport that training ground sources have told them that Wilcox billed himself as “like a manager” and stressed that Amorim was the coach.

This will have irked Amorim, who had been demanding more support from the club in the transfer market. The Portuguese coach was supposedly unhappy that a move for Antoine Semenyo was not sanctioned, with the Ghanaian moving to Manchester City instead.

The deep factions and rifts continue to plague United. The club have long suffered with poor recruitment of both coaching and playing staff, creating a mixed bag of a squad and even more inconsistent results.

Amorim was deeply wedded to his 3-4-3 formation and demanded signings which suited his formation. This created huge scrutiny on the former Sporting CP man who was accused of being too risk averse and predictable.

The Portuguese boss was able to spend significantly in the summer and added an entire new-look frontline including Mathues Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko. Amorim also brought in wing-backs to suit his formation which relied heavily of pace and energy down the flanks.

Darren Fletcher has taken temporary charge of the Red Devils and oversaw a 2-2 draw with Burnley earlier this week. He will be in the dugout when Brighton travel to Old Trafford in the FA Cup third round. The Seagulls have a mightily impressive record at Old Trafford and will fancy their chances against the inconsistent Red Devils.

It is unclear if and when a permanent appointment will be made, with some reports suggesting that they will wait until the summer to name a new boss. This could mean that Fletcher will welcome rivals Manchester City to their home with a chance to deal a hammer blow to their rivals' title chances in the derby on January 17.

Pep Guardiola's men are currently six points behind league leaders Arsenal, but will be determined to hunt down that gap. They have drawn their first three games of 2026 to fall away in the title race, being held by Brighton, Chelsea and Sunderland.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:goal.com","Man Utd handed huge AFCON boost as key man is knocked out of tournament & will return in time for Manchester derby","https://www.goal.com/en-us/lists/man-utd-afcon-boost-key-man-knocked-out-tournament-return-manchester-derby/blta607949e19e92b70","Sat, 10 Jan 2026 08:25:16 GMT","

Two Manchester United players faced off in the Africa Cup of Nations quarter-finals on Friday, with Noussair Mazraoui's Morocco knocking out Bryan Mbeumo's Cameroon 2-0. Despite the disappointment for the former Brentford forward, Cameroon's elimination provides a timely boost for the Red Devils, who will be pleased to once again be able to call on Mbeumo's services.

Morocco took the lead in under half an hour when former Manchester City midfielder Brahim Diaz bundled in from close range. The Real Madrid man got onto the end of an Ayoub El Kaabi header from an Achraf Hakimi corner to nudge past the goalkeeper and make it five goals in as many games.

The tournament hosts and favourites dominated much of the game and were able to double their lead and put the game beyond doubt on the 74th minute. Abde Ezzalzouli's free-kick evaded everyone in the box and fell to Ismael Saibari, who drilled low and hard into the bottom corner.

At Mbeumo's expense, Morocco will take on either Algeria or Nigeria, who face each other on Saturday afternoon, in the semi-finals on Wednesday. This means that Mazraoui's absence from United will be prolonged until at least late next week, but Mbeumo will likely be heading back to Manchester this weekend.

The return of their major summer signing will mark a relief for United, who are in the midst of turmoil on and off of the pitch. The Red Devils had Mbeumo, Mazraoui and Amad Diallo head off to represent their respective nations this winter and have seen their options, particularly on the right-hand side of the pitch, depleted significantly.

Mbeumo will return to Carrington this week, but will find a new man in charge of the Red Devils. When the forward left for international duty, Portuguese tactician Ruben Amorim was still in the dugout and, in spite of a mixed season, appeared to be relatively secure in his position as head coach.

However, last weekend, Amorim kicked up a fuss at a post-match press conference after a 1-1 draw with rivals Leeds United and was strangely insistent that he saw himself as a 'manager', not a head coach at the club. The comments, which offered shades of former Chelsea boss Enzo Maresca's own press conference meltdown, were the final straw for the United hierarchy who called time on the ex-Sporting CP boss' stint at the club.

United and Scotland legend Darren Fletcher has been named as the interim boss and will oversee their game against Brighton on Sunday. The FA Cup third round will come too soon for Mbeumo, but the attacking player will have his eyes locked on the Manchester derby next weekend and his return to the pitch at Old Trafford will be just what Pep Guardiola's side will have hoped to have avoided.

City will be frustrated to have to come up against the Cameroon forward next weekend and would have fancied their chances against a weakened United. Guardiola's team have squandered their slender pre-Christmas lead over Arsenal and now sit six points behind the Gunners.

City have drawn their last three games in the Premier League, handing Mikel Arteta a significant advantage and a little bit of breathing room at the top of the table. Yet, they will be boosted by the introduction of their own marquee forward signing with Bournemouth's Antoine Semenyo completing his move to the Etihad on Friday.

It is unclear who will take the role as the next permanent head coach in the United dugout. The current availability of elite managers is slim pickings and given United have been so poor at recruiting managerial staff, they will be determined to avoid yet another disaster,

Amorim clung on to the position for just over a year and United forked out millions upon millions of pounds to help bring in players suitable for his rigid 3-4-3 formation. Mbeumo was one of the big-money signings for the Portuguese coach and Fletcher, as well as the succeeding person in the dugout, will have to find a way get the best out of the Cameroon forward.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:goal.com","Man Utd need much more from Matheus Cunha","https://www.goal.com/en-us/lists/man-utd-need-much-more-matheus-cunha-resist-urge-marcus-rashford-another-chance/bltcb92cd1fdc62607c","Sat, 10 Jan 2026 08:00:00 GMT","

""I think he's going to lift people off their seats,"" Manchester United CEO Omar Berrada said of Matheus Cunha during a summer interview with United We Stand and The Athletic. ""He's got a bit of a swagger about him that people are going to really like. Dare I say, [Eric] Cantona-esque."" Talk about setting sky-high expectations! 

Cantona is one of the most beloved footballers in United's history, with only a select few matching him for pure entertainment value. Comparisons with the Frenchman only put unnecessary pressure on Cunha, but in fairness to Berrada, at the time, they didn't seem that far-fetched.

United forked out £62.5 million ($84m) to sign the Brazil international, who was undoubtedly one of the best players in the Premier League last season. Cunha's haul of 21 goal involvements was remarkable given Wolves' struggles near the foot of the table, and his individual brilliance ultimately kept the club in the division for an eighth successive year.

His arrival generated a much-needed feeling of excitement among the Old Trafford faithful after United finished 15th in the table, just one place above Wolves. Indeed, there hadn't been a match-winning forward of his ilk on the red side of Manchester since Zlatan Ibrahimovic, and Cunha appeared to understand United's core values right from the off.

""This is the dream come true,"" he said in his first in-house interview. ""For me, no one else is like United."" When asked to name the player he idolised in his youth, Cunha added: ""[Wayne] Rooney was the No.10 and he gave everything. He tackled, he pressed, he fought. That kind of energy - I try to bring that to my game."" 

But we have only seen glimpses of the Cantona and Rooney magic in Cunha's first six months with the Red Devils. The 26-year-old has not done enough to live up to his price tag or to deserve being mentioned in the same breath as those United legends, and now, there are fears he could soon be added to the long list of flop signings in the post-Sir Alex Ferguson era.

There have even been calls for United to bring Marcus Rashford back from Barcelona after the sacking of Ruben Amorim, which is a testament to Cunha's inconsistency. Between now and May, he must recapture the unwavering confidence of his Wolves days, or else see his place in the starting XI come under serious threat.

Cunha impressed on his debut against Arsenal in United's opening game of the new season, setting the tone for the home side with his invention on the ball and work-rate off it, but Amorim's side still fell to a disappointing 1-0 defeat after failing to make their dominance count. It was a similar story across Cunha's next seven appearances as he failed to open his account in the goals or assists columns. The biggest low point came away at Grimsby Town in the Carabao Cup, where Cunha missed a crucial penalty during United's shootout loss to the fourth-tier outfit.

The long-awaited breakthrough moment came when the Red Devils played host to Brighton, as Cunha broke his scoring duck with a fine early finish before driving his team to a 4-2 victory, earning the Player of the Match award in the process. But it turned out to be a false dawn.

By early December, Cunha still only had one goal to his name, and an ineffective showing in a 1-1 draw against West Ham raised concerns. He failed to register a shot on target and lost possession 18 times on his way to recording a disappointing pass completion rate of 69 percent. Cunha spent most of the night running down blind alleys and too often rushed his execution, showing very little of the composure that made him a cult hero at Molineux.

In the build-up to thar game, Amorim told reporters when quizzed on Cunha's slow start at the club: ""I think he has more levels to go. He's in a different club, different pressure, but I think he copes with that really well. He was struggling because he was not scoring and because of social media views, he was thinking too much about the numbers, but the influence that he has in the team is so important for us. But I think Cunha has so much [room] to grow defensively and offensively.""

Amorim's assessment was fair. Despite the rough edges to his game, Cunha's strength of personality and technical quality had definitely given United a lift, but it was naive to suggest he shouldn't be judged on numbers. For the amount that he cost, silky skills and slick link-up play alone won't suffice. He has to be the ultimate difference-maker, the one finishing chances as well as creating them.

Cunha has enjoyed an upturn in form since the West Ham stalemate, registering four goal contributions in his last seven appearances, but he remains an enigmatic presence liable to frustrate more often than he dazzles. That was certainly the case when his former club Wolves rocked up at Old Trafford in United's final outing of 2025, as he failed to grab the game by the scruff of the neck in the absence of injured team-mates Bruno Fernandes and Mason Mount.

Against the Premier League's bottom club, who had yet to win a game at that stage, United needed Cunha to give them a spark in the final third, but he finished the game with a woeful expected goals (xG) total of 0.11, and didn't muster a single key pass as Wolves held out for a 1-1 draw. Although Cunha was by no means the only one to blame, he should be forced to shoulder a greater weight of responsibility due to his talent.

It is not immediately clear whether Cunha will get a new injection of life after Amorim's departure, either. Interim boss Darren Fletcher shifted from Amorim's much-maligned 3-4-3 system to a 4-2-3-1 system with proper wingers for Wednesday's trip to Burnley, and Cunha flattered to deceive on the right.

United were more expansive and bombarded the Burnley goal for much of the game, but Cunha was rarely the one to get on the ball in dangerous positions and neglected to attack his marker. He was particularly poor in the second half, with Joshua Zirkzee replacing him for the final 15 minutes, and the Red Devils eventually had to settle for a 2-2 draw, dropping more valuable points in the race for Champions League qualification.

In Cunha's defence, he usually operates from the left side, and is most deadly when cutting in on his wand of a right foot. It's also true that No.10 is his best position, but while Amorim liked to have two of them, Fletcher immediately reverted to just one, restoring Fernandes to that spot after the captain's return to full fitness.

If United continue to play four at the back, which is likely to be the case whether it's Fletcher, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer or Michael Carrick leading the team until June, how does Cunha fit in? He's not going to usurp Fernandes, and when fellow summer addition Bryan Mbeumo, along with Amad Diallo, returns from the Africa Cup of Nations, they are the two most natural options to flank the Portuguese and give United real width.

At the moment, Benjamin Sesko must be considered United's most disappointing signing of 2025, even after his two goals against Burnley. They only took the Slovenian striker up to four for the season overall, a dismal return for the club's £74m ($100m) investment. That could change quickly though, because as we saw at Turf Moor, Sesko has a lot to offer with the right service. If United continue to get the ball into the box more regularly, the goals will keep flowing for the former RB Leipzig man.

Cunha might soon be the one branded the biggest waste of money, because it's harder to see him turning the tide. It's a salvageable situation, but a far from ideal one, and perhaps United should have seen it coming. As electrifying as the former Atletico Madrid ace was for Wolves in 2024-25, the statistics suggest he overperformed. Cunha scored nearly double his xG total of 8.6, with five of his goals coming from outside the box - the joint-highest total in the league.

Sustaining that output was always going to be a tall order. There is also an argument that Cunha suited being a big fish in a small pond at Wolves without so many eyes on him. In his only other stint at a top club in Atleti, he couldn't quite cut it, finding the net only seven times across two full seasons in Spain. He has still to prove himself in an elite environment where dealing with constant scrutiny is part of the job.

If Cunha doesn't start making good on his full potential, there is every chance United will look to bolster their attacking options again in the summer. Scouring the market may not be necessary, though, because according to Diario Sport, it is 'highly likely' that Rashford will return to Old Trafford, with Barcelona 'not considering' triggering their buy option on the England international at this stage.

Rashford was exiled from the United squad shortly after Amorim's appointment, but Owen Hargreaves is among those who believe he should be reintegrated by the next coaching regime.

""I hope that Marcus comes back because he's a special player,"" the ex-United midfielder said on TNT Sports. ""I don't think Marcus should've been in a position where he shouldered all the weight for everything. I think Marcus is a super talent and the club could use him.""

Joining Barca on loan has seemingly reinvigorated Rashford, that much is undeniable. He's racked up a combined 18 goals and assists in his first 27 games for Hansi Flick's side, and more importantly, has played with a smile on his face again alongside world-class operators like Lamine Yamal, Raphinha and Pedri.

The 28-year-old is also more two-footed than Cunha, versatile enough to play on both wings without ever becoming too predictable. It would be understandable if United discussed giving Rashford another chance now that Amorim's blueprint for success has been thrown out, but they must resist the urge.

According to The Sun, it was a club decision to offload Rashford, along with the majority of Amorim's infamous 'bomb squad', including Antony, Alejandro Garnacho and Jadon Sancho, to stamp out the toxic player-power culture that had run rampant in recent years. They were all considered disruptive figures and Old Trafford has been a healthier environment since their respective departures. Reneging on that decision would be foolish.

Rashford used up all of his nine lives at United, only performing on his terms and effectively downing tools in times of trouble. In stark contrast, there is no faulting Cunha's effort levels. He puts the team above himself, and it would be far better to help him adapt to a new role than risk the harmony of the squad by bringing back Rashford.

Cunha is also a better ball carrier and passer than Rashford, with a generally higher footballing IQ. If United can get the best out of him, it's not beyond the realms of possibility that he is one day put up in the Hall of Fame alongside Cantona; the core attributes are all there, including, in the words of Fernandes, ""good arrogance"".

He can never be accused of going missing in matches either. Even when the team are down, Cunha is always demanding the ball and trying to make things happen. That bravery is the hallmark of a true United star. It just might be that he is trying too hard at the moment, with mistakes creeping in as a result of his desperation to make an impact. 

The key is for Cunha to get closer to the goal. Only Golden Boot frontrunner Erling Haaland has taken more shots than Cunha in the Premier League this season, but the United man has an xG of just 5.1, with his efforts averaging from a distance of 19.1 yards. His expected assists (xA) total sits at only 1.9, too, only the sixth-best in the whole United squad, despite the fact that he is managing 4.6 shot-creating actions per 90 minutes.

Cunha's tendency to drop deep is holding him back. He ranks 19th for touches in the opposition box, behind the likes of Richarlison and Kevin Schade, and must look to get in behind more often if his Old Trafford career is to really take off. United's hopes of a top-five finish may well depend on it.

It's time for Cunha to adapt or die, with patience a luxury that will not be afforded to him while results and performances remain so up and down.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Today's game between Egypt and Ivory Coast will kick off at 2 pm ET and 7 pm GMT.

The Pharaohs are the tournament's most successful nation, having won the most titles, and they are on the hunt for what would be a record-extending eighth crown. However, their route to the last eight has been far from straightforward. Hossam Hassan's charges were pushed to their limits in the Round of 16, needing extra time to overcome Benin in a tense encounter.

They eventually prevailed as 3-1 winners to book their spot in the quarter finals, with their star man, Mohamed Salah, scoring a late winner. The Liverpool man has been pivotal with 3 goals so far in AFCON, and will continue to shoulder much of the scoring duties alongside Manchester City's Omar Marmoush. Coach Hassan has kept a resilient but sometimes unconvincing run going, with Egypt not considered top favourites by some, despite advancing to this stage.

In contrast, the Ivory Coast have looked more comfortable in the knockout rounds so far and will not be short of confidence after some solid performances. Emerse Fae's side arrives as defending champions, determined to prove that their triumph two years ago on home soil was no one-off.

They cruised to a 3-0 win over Burkina Faso to reach the quarter-finals, with Manchester United's Amad Diallo starring with a goal and assist. As reigning champions, the Elephants have shown strong attacking balance and overall control of games; however, this might not be easy to achieve against Egypt. Nevertheless, they are expected to dominate possession, using their powerful midfield to dictate tempo and stretch the pitch with the likes of Franck Kessié and Seko Fofana.

Historically, Egypt have the edge in head-to-head ties, winning more encounters than the Ivory Coast. Recent AFCON meetings have included tight contests, including a penalty shoot-out win for Egypt in 2021. Egypt last defended their own AFCON title in 2010; Ivory Coast are the first defending champs to reach this stage since then.

USWNT star Jenna Nighswonger completes welcome WSL loan switch as nightmare Gunners spell nears end","https://www.goal.com/en-us/lists/arsenal-exile-uswnt-jenna-nighswonger-wsl-loan-nightmare-gunners-spell/blt15d303b66cbcca22","Sat, 10 Jan 2026 12:38:29 GMT","

United States international Jenna Nighswonger looks to be finally set for some regular game time after completing a loan move away from Arsenal. The full-back has found opportunities hard to come by since joining the Women's Super League club last January but has now secured a temporary switch that should change that - one which also includes an option to buy.

After making just one substitute appearance for Arsenal all season, it was announced on Saturday that Nighswonger has joined Aston Villa until the end of the 2025-26 campaign, with the deal also including an option to buy that could permanently end the USWNT star's nightmare spell in north London.

""Everyone at Aston Villa is extremely excited to welcome Jenna to the club,"" Marisa Ewers, Villa's director of women's football, said upon the announcement of the news. “We have been tracking her for some time and are delighted that she has bought into our exciting project. This signing forms part of our growing ambitions as we continue to build an exciting and competitive squad, and we believe Jenna will add real quality to the group and support our goals moving forward.""

Nighswonger appeared to be a good signing for Arsenal 12 months ago. Arriving shortly after Renee Slegers was given the head coach role permanently, following an impressive spell as interim, the feeling was that she represented the slight shift in style from previous coach Jonas Eidevall to Slegers, as a full-back who suited the demands of the latter more.

However, the 25-year-old has made just six appearances for Arsenal in the time since, with just two of those starts. Five of those appearances came last season, too, with the full-back only getting onto the pitch once so far in the 2025-26 season. That was as a substitute in the win over Leicester as she replaced Taylor Hinds, another full-back whose arrival in the summer window has further limited the American's game time.

More concerning has been that Nighswonger, who The Athletic understands cost Arsenal a $100,000 (£75,000) fee, has regularly struggled to even make the matchday squad under Slegers, something which has impacted her international career, too. The full-back hasn't been called up by USWNT boss Emma Hayes since last February, something she will hope changes with this loan switch.

However, despite her struggles at Arsenal, it's clear that Nighswonger is a talented player and one that Villa will now hope to make the most of. Part of a Gotham side which won the NWSL Championship in 2023 and on the USWNT roster which won gold at the 2024 Summer Olympics, the 25-year-old is a dynamic full-back who can be an asset on both sides of the ball.

She's got plenty of experience, too, which Villa will hope can help them kick on. The club are currently eighth in the WSL table but have picked up some impressive results since Natalie Arroyo's arrival as head coach this month, with wins over Arsenal and Manchester United. It's consistency that the team needs and bringing in top players like Nighswonger can help in that regard, both in terms of the quality she adds and the depth she can help provide.

Nighswonger is Villa's first signing of the January window but reports, which surfaced shortly after her transfer was confirmed, suggest it certainly won't be the last, or indeed the biggest. That's because BBC Sport understands that the club are also set to sign Chelsea midfielder Oriane Jean-Francois on a permanent deal worth £450,000 ($603,000), which would represent a record sale for the Blues' women's side.

Jean-Francois joined Chelsea in the summer of 2024 from Paris Saint-Germain but has been competing for a starting spot with England star Keira Walsh and, as such, she has struggled for regular game time. That's no slight on the 25-year-old, who has looked sharp and talented when given opportunities. As with the Nighswonger move, it is smart for Villa to be shopping in the deep squads of the WSL's top clubs and they now look set to pick up Jean-Francois this month in another move which could help the club rise up the table.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Ten-player Red Devils survive Jayde Riviere red card as USWNT goalkeeper earns valuable WSL point","https://www.goal.com/en-sa/lists/man-utd-women-player-ratings-arsenal-phallon-tullis-joyce-jayde-riviere/blta8e2482ed753f1b5","Sat, 10 Jan 2026 14:41:18 GMT","

Goalkeeper Phallon Tullis-Joyce was the hero as 10-player Manchester United clung on to steal a 0-0 draw away at Arsenal in the first WSL game of the new year. The visitors were reduced to 10 midway through the second half when Jayde Riviere was sent off, but held firm to keep a clean sheet and ensure the Gunners do not pull further away from them at the top of the table.

The eagerly-awaited return of the WSL and a clash between third and fourth began in a rather stop-start manner, with a number of players going down injured and impacting the flow of the game. United had started the brighter and Arsenal's Anneke Borbe was forced into an incredible fingertip save to push Fridolina Rolfo's header from a Jessica Park cross onto the bar after just five minutes.

It was the wake-up call the hosts needed, and the Gunners held the lion's share of possession, albeit without creating too many chances, for much of the game. Tullis-Joyce made one fine stop from Olivia Smith from close range following a six-yard box scramble in Arsenal's best chance of the half.

The second period began in an equally scrappy manner with neither side seizing the initiative. Sloppy passes and individual errors plagued the players who at times looked like they were still on their winter break. With 25 minutes to go, United right-back Riviere was sent off for a ridiculous lunge which earned her a deserved second yellow card.

With United shutting up shop and determined to cling onto a point, Arsenal turned up the heat on the Red Devils. The Gunners' forwards had chances: Alessia Russo pounced upon a loose ball to fire low and Stina Blackstenius produced a clever flick, but both were denied by the USWNT goalkeeper. The hosts pushed and pushed for a late winner, the 37,000-strong crowd willing them on, but were unable to find a way past the giant in the United net.

GOAL rates Manchester United's players from the Emirates Stadium...

Phallon Tullis-Joyce (9/10):

Was a dominant presence in her penalty area and came up with a series of strong stops to keep the Gunners at bay.

Jayde Riviere (3/10):

The right-back earned herself a yellow card early in the second half and made a thoughtless lunge to pick up a second caution and a sending off. A moment of madness for the 24-year-old who almost cost her side.

Maya Le Tissier (7/10):

The Manchester United skipper stood up to the test and led her defence well, especially when reduced to 10 players.

Dominique Janssen (8/10):

The former Arsenal player was the standout performer in the United backline, cutting out a number of crosses and giving Russo little change up front.

Anna Sandberg (6/10):

Sandberg was good up and down the left flank and kept Beth Mead quiet. 

Hinata Miyazawa (7/10):

A reliable figure at the heart of the Red Devils' midfield, Miyazawa rarely set a pass astray and helped relieve pressure on her team.

Julia Zigiotti Olme (6/10):

Similarly tidy to Miyazawa, the Sweden international played in a double pivot and allowed Park the freedom to roam.

Jessica Park (6/10):

A bright spark and did her best to drive the visitors up the pitch, but struggled to showcase her talent with the Gunners so dominant in possession.

Fridolina Rolfo (6/10):

Came close with a great header, but was denied by a better save from Borbe. The former Barcelona star was taken off in a quiet second half.

Elisabeth Terland (5/10):

Terland was a passenger for much of the hour she was on the pitch and replaced by Lea Schuller.

Melvine Malard (6/10):

The French forward worked hard for the away side, but did little in attack.

Add GOAL.com as a preferred source on Google to see more of our reporting

Lea Schuller (5/10):

The new signing from Bayern Munich made her debut for the club, but was isolated up front with United trying to hang on for a point.

Simi Awujo (N/A):

The midfielder was brought on after an hour, but subbed off 10 minutes later after Riviere was given her marching orders. 

Hanna Lundkvist (6/10):

Brought on to add an extra defender for the final 20 minutes and plug the gap left by the Canadian right-back.

Lisa Naalsund (N/A):

Came on late in the game.

Marc Skinner (7/10):

Set up to soak up pressure and hit the Gunners on the break, the United boss will be happy with a point at the Emirates – particularly with 10 players.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Will it be a case of third time lucky for Team Poland when they contest the United Cup final in Sydney on Sunday?

Led by Hubert Hurkacz and Iga Swiatek, the two-time runners-up face Team Switzerland with a new champion guaranteed. Switzerland's charge has been driven by Belinda Bencic, who has been flawless across both singles and mixed doubles, with playing captain Stan Wawrinka providing leadership and experience in what is the three-time major champion's final season on Tour.

Proceedings at Ken Rosewall Arena begin at 5:30 p.m. with Bencic meeting Swiatek, before Wawrinka takes on Hurkacz. The Pole won their lone Lexus ATP Head2Head encounter, which came at the United Cup in 2023.

A message from your Finalists 🔥 pic.twitter.com/AzXPYLBove

Swiatek, the reigning Wimbledon champion, holds a 5-1 advantage in her head-to-head with Bencic, though the Swiss has been in inspired form throughout the competition in both Sydney and Perth. Unbeaten in four singles outings, the 28-year-old — mother to 21-month-old daughter Bella — has been the cornerstone of her team, while Swiatek will be eager to respond after her straight-sets semi-final defeat to Coco Gauff.

“Stan pushes me through in my singles, then he tries to push himself through in his singles, then he pushes us over the line in the mixed,” Bencic said of playing captain Wawrinka. “I don't know what to say. It's just amazing.”







Wawrinka faces a daunting task against the powerful-serving Hurkacz, particularly on return. The 40-year-old has broken serve just once across his four matches and has leaned on a more defensive game plan, yielding a single win. Hurkacz, by contrast, has unleashed 77 aces en route to the final.
“It's going to be a fun match against Stan,” Hurkacz said. “He's shown some amazing tennis throughout this tournament. Obviously it's his last year on Tour. It's really inspiring to watch him play, watch him compete. It's going to be a fun challenge. Lots of positive emotions. So happy we're in the finals again.”
After a seven-month injury layoff that required knee surgery, Hurkacz has looked sharp in Sydney. The former No. 6 player in the PIF ATP Rankings has already notched victories over Top 10 opponents Alexander Zverev and Taylor Fritz, who edged him in a final-set tie-break to secure last year's United Cup title.

With both teams evenly matched, the final could hinge on mixed doubles. Switzerland's Bencic and Jakub Paul are unbeaten in four matches, while Poland's Katarzyna Kawa and Jan Zielinski boast an identical record.

Poland has advanced to its third consecutive United Cup final after avenging its defeat in last year's championship tie against the United States Saturday night in Sydney.

Hubert Hurkacz set the two-time runners-up on course to victory with a 7-6(1), 7-6(2) win over Taylor Fritz – the second Top 10 scalp of his comeback tournament. Coco Gauff then levelled the semi-final with a 6-4, 6-2 win over Iga Swiatek before Jan Zielinski and Katarzyna Kawa defeated Gauff and Christian Harrison 7-6(5), 7-6(3) in the deciding mixed.

Both teams were unbeaten coming into the do-or-die rubber, but Zielinski imposed himself on the match with an ultra-aggressive mindset. The Americans twice served for the second set and held three set points at 6-5 40/15 only to be turned away. 

In Sunday's final [5.30pm AEDT] Poland will play Switzerland, which advanced when its mixed doubles team of Belinda Bencic and Jakub Paul also won a fourth straight mixed doubles of the tournament. 

Despite his own heroics, Zielinski was quick to heap praise on teammate Hurkacz, who is playing his first tournament since a knee injury ended his 2025 season last June.

""First of all hats off to Hubert who is playing incredible tennis in his first tournament in seven months and inspiring us to play like we did today,"" Zielinski said. ""He's an inspiration to all of us.

""Tomorrow there will be a lot of emotions and hopefully we can show our best tennis.""

Earlier, Hurkacz continued a dream start to his comeback with a 7-6(1), 7-6(2) win against Taylor Fritz. 

“Obviously playing Taylor is such a big challenge and it's a very difficult match, especially this court, it's quite fast. He's serving very powerfully. Also, his forehand is really big, so if you leave anything short, he's going to come after it,” Hurkacz told ATP No. 1 Club Jim Courier. “I felt like I played actually quite solid myself. I tried to be more aggressive. Actually during my time off I was watching some of my past matches and I was listening to your commentary. It's a good help for players, as well!”

Hurkacz entered the mixed-teams event uncertain exactly what to expect after missing seven months due to a knee injury that required surgery. But in his first action since June of last year, the former No. 6 player in the PIF ATP Rankings has played dominant, big-serving tennis to help his country to the brink of the championship match against Switzerland.





The 28-year-old has now beaten Alexander Zverev, Tallon Griekspoor and Fritz in Sydney, claiming all three of those victories in straight sets. Hurkacz saved the two break points he faced against Fritz, which doubled as set points at 4-5 in the opening set, to earn the lead for his country in one hour and 35 minutes.

“Definitely pleasantly surprised in a way because I haven't played in such a long time. In seven months, [this is] my first tournament. So coming back from such a long period the first time in my life, you never know what to expect,” Hurkacz said. “On the other hand, I was putting so much work outside of the court so, I give myself time to get back to my level, to an even better level and maybe a little bit less expectations coming into this week helped as well.”

Fritz led Hurkacz 4-2 in their Lexus ATP Head2Head series as they stepped on court in sweltering heat, including two previous wins at the United Cup. But the Pole and his booming serve proved too much for the American.

Fritz's biggest opportunity came with two set points in hand on Hurkacz's serve, but the Pole wiped out those chances with huge serves. Hurkacz hit a critical backhand passing shot early in each of the two tie-breaks to take the lead and surged from there.

In her singles, Gauff displayed her dominance at its finest in a 6-4, 6-2 win over World No. 2 Iga Swiatek. The semifinal tie -- a rematch of last year's final -- now heads to a mixed doubles decider to determine who will face Switzerland in Sunday's final.




“I didn't the let the opportunities that I had on the first two times I had match points get away from me,” said the World No. 4, who won on the fourth match point. “She played well. Maybe there was one error on the backhand, but after that, she played the better tennis, but I knew that how I was playing the whole match I would get it done.”

Gauff, who played her 16th matchup against Swiatek on the WTA Tour earned her fourth straight victory over her rival. That includes a 6-4, 6-4 win in last year's United Cup, as well as wins at Madrid and the 2024 WTA Finals.

The two rivals traded a few holds initially as Gauff, who served first, took a 2-1 lead before notching the match's first strike. She broke Swiatek and backed it up with a hold, amassing to a 4-1 advantage, but the Pole swiftly found herself back in the set.

Swiatek won 12 consecutive points to win three straight games a level the set at 4-4. She had the momentum, but Gauff remained calm and composed for the remainder of the 43-minute first set. She held serve, and on the ensuing Swiatek service game, the American No. 1 needed just one set point to close it out.

That momentum carried its way into the second, where Gauff bolted out to a 5-0 lead --Swiatek saved three match points to prevent the second set bagel to get two games back.

In the second and fourth games, Gauff needed three and four break point chances, respectively, to secure the game as each went into a long deuce. In the fourth, Swiatek even had multiple game points of her own, but the final two points saw Swiatek's shots go long and wide, a common occurrence Saturday evening.

It wasn't the same Swiatek that defeated Maya Joint 6-1, 6-1 a day prior, but a composed Gauff maintained complete control of the match throughout to keep her country alive in the semi-final tie.

Daniil Medvedev ensured that he will have another shot at glory at the Brisbane International presented by ANZ on Sunday.

The top seed and 2019 runner-up earned a scrappy 6-4, 6-2 semi-final win over American Alex Michelsen on Saturday to reach his 41st tour-level final. Although Medvedev tallied 27 unforced errors, he clinically saved all four break points he faced in the second set, according to Infosys ATP Stats, to break his tie with Alexander Zverev for the second most finals among active players, trailing only Novak Djokovic (144).

“It was not easy at all. The score doesn't completely reflect the match,” said Medvedev, the former No. 1 player in the PIF ATP Rankings. “But I'm happy that in the most important moments, I managed to be better than Alex. That's what you have to do to win the match.”

Medvedev's encouraging end to the 2025 season, highlighted by consecutive semi-finals in Beijing and Shanghai before snapping his 15-month title drought in Almaty, has laid the groundwork for a positive start to 2026. He will take a 2-0 Lexus ATP Head2Head lead into Sunday's final against another American Brandon Nakashima.

Earlier, Nakashima moved past good friend Aleksandar Kovacevic 7-6(4), 6-4 to reach his fourth ATP Tour final, and first since winning his maiden title at home in San Diego in 2022. The American has not dropped a set across his four matches in Brisbane this week.

“Aleks and I are actually really good friends, we practised a lot the past month, so it's great to see him playing well at these tournaments,” Nakashima said of his countryman. “For me, I'm really happy with the level I played today and I'm excited to keep playing here in Brisbane.”

Lorenzo Musetti scored a semi-final victory of double meaning on Saturday at the Bank of China Hong Kong Tennis Open, where he also sealed his Top 5 breakthrough.

The top-seeded Italian produced a gritty display to rally past former champion Andrey Rublev 6-7(3), 7-5, 6-4 and reach his ninth ATP Tour final. Musetti, who is chasing his first title since he won two in 2022, has jumped to a career-high No. 5 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings and has ensured a Top 5 berth on Monday.

“It was quite a match, I think I've never played like this here in Hong Kong,” said Musetti, who levelled his Lexus ATP Head2Head series with Rublev at 1-1. “It was a really incredible level. Everytime I was raising his level, and in the end, I increased [mine]. So I'm really happy to be in the final.”

Alexander Bublik later ensured that it will be a championship-match between the top two seeds in Hong Kong when he rallied to a 3-6, 6-4, 6-2 victory over American Marcos Giron. If the Kazakhstani can overcome Musetti, he will rise one spot to a career-high World No. 10 on Monday.

A crucial moment of his semi-final clash with Rublev came with Musetti serving at 3-4 in the second set. He crucially saved two break points, according to Infosys ATP Stats, in a lengthy service hold that featured six Deuces, staying in contention and ultimately swinging the match in his favour late in the third.

Last year's Nitto ATP Finals debutant, Musetti will become the third Italian in the history of the PIF ATP Rankings to be ranked inside the Top 5, after Adriano Panatta (1976) and Jannik Sinner (2024).

Bublik was made to work in his one-hour, 41-minute semi-final win over Giron, but can now look towards a 16th ATP Tour final. He leads Musetti 2-1 in their Lexus ATP Head2Head series, but the pair has not met since 2024.

“It's going to be a tough final,” Bublik said. “Lorenzo is just coming from Nitto ATP Finals, he's had a hell of a season. It's going to be a great match, I just hope for a good battle.”

 Joao Fonseca has further delayed the start of his 2026 season after withdrawing from the Adelaide International. 

 The 19-year-old Brazilian last week pulled out of the Brisbane International presented by ANZ due to a lower back injury, and he will now skip the ATP 250 in Adelaide for the same reason. 

 ""Unfortunately I'm not able to play here,"" said Fonseca in a press conference. ""It's difficult to make this decision. I felt those days that we were practising, every day feeling a little bit better, but it's difficult to say that I'm a hundred per cent. 

 ""We are trying our best to recover a hundred per cent to play the Australian Open, which is our main goal. That decision is not made. We want to play, we think that it's going to be possible. So we want to focus on the recovery, and unfortunately I couldn't play here, and I hope to come back stronger next year."" 



 The No. 29 in the PIF ATP Rankings, Fonseca will now head to Melbourne to prepare for the Australian Open, where he made a big impact on event debut in 2025. After coming through qualifying, he upset then-World No. 9 Andrey Rublev in straight sets in his first main-draw match at a major. 

 Fonseca lifted his first ATP Tour trophy in Buenos Aires last February before claiming the biggest title of his career at the ATP 500 in Basel in October. The 2024 Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF champion, he hit his career high of World No. 24 in early November. 

 ""I was born with something in my back and sometimes it's more tight,"" said Fonseca. ""I already had a stress fracture five years ago, but it's something that it's going to be in my body, so I need to deal with it. I'm just trying my best to recover. We did a MRI, and it's nothing very serious, but can be serious, so we want to be a hundred per cent to play.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:atptour.com","Meet Jakub Paul, the Cinderella story of United Cup 2026","https://www.atptour.com/en/news/jakub-paul-feature-united-cup-2026","Sat, 10 Jan 2026 09:49:06 GMT","

The United Cup has its Cinderella story.

Jakub Paul, the little-known 26-year-old Swiss, wasn't even sure he'd get to play mixed doubles in the tournament. But with Stan Wawrinka foregoing mixed doubles play early in the tournament due to back-to-back three-hour singles marathons, opportunity arose. The World No. 81 seized it.

Teaming with Belinda Bencic, Paul has won three deciding mixed doubles rubbers and four overall to play a key role in sending Switzerland to its first United Cup final on Sunday.

“For me, it's still surreal,” Paul told ATPTour.com in Sydney after he and Bencic defeated singles stars Zizou Bergs and Elise Mertens in Saturday's semi-finals. “I can't really believe that we are in the final yet because I don't think anyone expected this…

“But these are the moments I practise for. We knew mixed doubles was always going to be important and Stan gave me the chance to play. So I felt I had to really be ready, give my best. Of course, I never expected to win all those four matches. Now that we're in the final, we want to give everything and let's go for the title.”

Notable is how Paul has approached the challenge with the likes of Grand Slam champions Edouard Roger-Vasselin and Andrea Vavassori standing across the net.

Far from being overwhelmed by the big stage and playing for his country, he has played fearless tennis, poaching with confidence and drilling passing shots in behind opponents at net.

Despite being far more experienced, Bencic has empowered Paul to adopt a ‘large and in charge' attitude on court. “It's just amazing to see him play and how brave he is,” she said. 

“When Belinda tells me to go, I just go,” Paul said. “That's a bit the doubles player coming out in me. If you make a call, you have to stick to it because at the baseline she doesn't know if I'm actually going to go or not. So it's just better to go, and it's been working out.” 



Paul picked up the sport like many kids do, tagging along with his father and older brother to his local club in Chur. When his potential emerged, Paul relocated to an academy three hours away in Kreuzlingen, staying in the dorms and returning home on weekends.

“I don't really like change and at 13 I didn't want to move out from home but after a couple of months I managed it well and really liked it. I stayed for five years,” Paul said.

At 18 he moved to Biel to practise at the Swiss Federation's training base and in the same year in his only singles appearance at a junior Grand Slam, he qualified for the US Open boys' event and won two rounds. That led to a meeting with Roger Federer.

“Roger actually saw that,” Paul said. “Once I got back home Severin Luthi called me and said that Roger would like to practise because he had a house quite close to where I live in the mountains. He invited me for an evening and of course I went.”

Currently No. 341 in the PIF ATP Rankings for singles and 81 for doubles, Paul is caught between sacrificing potentially lucrative doubles opportunities at Tour-level with trying to build his singles ranking at ATP Challengers.

“It's not an easy decision but at the moment I still want to push in singles,” he said. “I still feel I have potential and a couple of months ago I was at my highest rank of 288.

“On the other hand, doubles is going much better being Top 80 and I have the chance to play Slams, so it gets very interesting. I'm still playing Challengers where's it's possible to combine singles and doubles. 

“If I play a doubles final on Saturday and then have to play singles qualies in a different city on Sunday, it's difficult. For now I can still manage it, but in the end I have to pay my bills and if I can make more money in doubles, I might have to switch.”

But for one more day at least, Paul's full focus is on [mixed] doubles as he contemplates the possibility of suiting up for another tie-deciding mixed with Bencic in the United Cup final.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:atptour.com","Switzerland beats Belgium to reach first United Cup final","https://www.atptour.com/en/news/switzerland-belgium-united-cup-2026-sf","Sat, 10 Jan 2026 05:26:15 GMT","

Belinda Bencic has led Switzerland into its first United Cup final after a heroic performance in searing Sydney heat Saturday against Belgium.

After surviving a third-set tie-break in the opening singles against Elise Mertens, Bencic teamed with Jakub Paul to win their third decisive mixed doubles of the tournament by defeating Mertens and Zizou Bergs 6-3, 0-6, 10-5 after regrouping from a second-set collapse when they won just 12 points. 

Bencic, 28 and mother of 21-month-old daughter Bella, has won all four singles and all four mixed doubles matches during the event. In the first set of Saturday's mixed, Bencic won both deciding points on her serve when Mertens failed to put a return in play. 

Doubles World No. 81 Paul, who won just six tour-level doubles matches last year, rose to the occasion, poaching with confidence and hitting several down-the-line winners at crucial moments.

In Sunday's final inside Ken Rosewall Arena, the Swiss will play the winner of tonight's second semi-final between defending champion United States and two-time finalist Poland. 

Despite anchoring the team's path to the final with eight wins, Bencic was quick to praise others on her team, especially her unheralded mixed partner Paul.

“He's so brave it's unbelievable,” Bencic said. “I tell him to go [for it] and he actually goes. It's crazy. 

“The team spirit is amazing and it starts with the captain. He's supporting all throughout my match and then he goes out to play his own match and then he's back to support the doubles. It starts with him but then with all the energy from our bench it gives us such a spirit to win.

Paul said, “It's easy to find the energy with this team. It's great to play with Belinda. Hats off to her to play for almost three hours and then come out for the doubles.  And great job by Stan to keep Zizou as long as possible on the court.”

Earlier, Bergs sent the Belgium-Switzerland United Cup semi-final to a deciding mixed doubles after a gruelling 6-3, 6-7(4), 6-3 win over Stan Wawrinka in brutal 41-degree Sydney heat.

In the first match of the day, Bencic kept her undefeated season-opening run at the United Cup in tact in dramatic fashion as she outlasted Elise Mertens 6-3, 4-6, 7-6(0) to put Switzerland up 1-0.

Backing up his consecutive wins over World No. 5 Felix Auger-Aliassime and No. 18 Jakub Mensik, Bergs rallied from 40/0 on Wawrinka's serve at 4-3 in the third set to claim the decisive break seemingly from nowhere in a match that had featured just six break points to that stage.

Wawrinka, the 40-year-old three-time Grand Slam champion, has played inspired tennis to kick off his farewell season. But breaking serve just once across four matches has proved costly as he slipped to 1-3 in singles matches during the tournament.

“Stan played really well and I really had to battle it out today,” Bergs said. 

“It was hard to control the ball on return and he served very good; it was very hard for me. To get rhythm is very tough. I'm just happy I found the solution.”

Bergs will team with Mertens in the mixed doubles against Bencic and Jakub Paul, who have won all three mixed rubbers (two of them tie-clinching) this week.

Bergs is looking to erase the heartache of his last outing in the Davis Cup semi-finals, when he let slip seven match points against Italian Flavio Cobolli while attempting to send the tie to a deciding doubles.

Bergs, 26, won 31 matches last year, more than doubling his career match wins tally. He begins the year at No. 42 in the PIF ATP Rankings, just three places below his career-high.

Playing his 25th and final season, Wawrinka began the United Cup with an inspired third-set tie-break win over World No. 27 Arthur Rinderknech in Perth and a third-set tie-break loss to Cobolli. He fell in straight sets to Sebastian Baez in a quarter-final in Perth.



Bencic improved to 7-0 across singles and mixed doubles during the tournament after beating Mertens.

Mertens beat Bencic in their only previous meeting, back in 2021, but the 28-year-old Bencic who came into the tilt in more impervious form, with a 6-0 record across Switzerland's first three ties. While Mertens had back-to-back tough tussles against Victoria Mboko and Barbora Krejcikova after a straight-sets win over Zhu Lin, Bencic hadn't come close to losing a set against Leolia Jeanjean, Jasmine Paolini and Solana Sierra to lead Switzerland to the final four. 

She was two games away from an uncomplicated 6-3, 6-4 victory before Mertens pushed the match the distance. But the Belgian then denied Bencic two chances to knot the second set at 5-5 before breaking serve, claiming a set in which she previously saw a 3-1 lead erased. 

That set the stage for a dramatic third set, in which Mertens came from 3-1 down, saved a pair of break points that would've given Bencic a 4-1 lead, and was two points away from the win with Bencic serving at 30-30, down 6-5. But Bencic won the last nine points of the match following an in-the-moment decision to change her racquet to a freshly-strung one at that stage, wrapping up victory in 2 hours and 37 minutes. 

 “It feels like 170 kilos fell off my shoulders -- I was so stressed; I really wanted to do well, and today I felt so much pressure to not let my team down,"" Bencic said afterwards. 

On the racquet change, she sheepishly confessed: ""My brain turned off and let my instincts take over."" 

""I think it was just a feeling, and I played with my back against the wall,"" she added. ""I was really focused on myself, on breathing, and I'm super happy that I stayed tough in the important moments.""

Poland advanced to their third straight United Cup final, avenging their 2025 championship loss to the United States. Despite Iga Swiatek's defeat to Coco Gauff, Hubert Hurkacz's win in men's singles as well Katarzyna Kawa and Jan Zielinski's heroics in mixed doubles sent the Polish through.

SYDNEY, Australia -- The United Cup has its second finalist, and Poland will return to the final for the third consecutive year after it avenged its 2025 final defeat to the United States with a 2-1 victory in Saturday's semifinal.

Poland, which got wins from Hubert Hurkacz in singles as well as Katarzyna Kawa and Jan Zielinski in mixed doubles, will face first-time finalist Switzerland. World No. 2 Iga Swiatek, who fell to Coco Gauff 4-6, 2-6, will have a chance to redeem herself against Belinda Bencic, while Hurkacz encounters Stan Wawrinka.

United Cup: Scores | Standings

Kawa and Zielinski were the heroes, knocking off the previously unbeaten American duo of Gauff and Christian Harrison. Kawa and Zielinski won their second straight deciding mixed doubles following a win over Australia in the quarterfinals Friday. 

In the loss to Poland, Gauff earned her fourth straight victory over her rival Swiatek in their 16th overall meeting on the WTA Tour Driven by Mercedes-Benz. That streak  includes a 6-4, 6-4 win in last year's United Cup, as well as wins at Madrid and the 2024 WTA Finals.

""I thought I did everything well, served well, returned well"" Gauff said to the WTA on her match vs. Swiatek. ""I thought it was a great match for me. I was hoping to get through in the mixed but overall there's a lot of positives to take from today.""

The two rivals traded a few holds initially as Gauff, who served first, took a 2-1 lead before notching the match's first strike. She broke Swiatek and backed it up with a hold, amassing to a 4-1 advantage, but the Pole swiftly found herself back in the set.

Swiatek won 12 consecutive points to win three straight games and level the set at 4-4. She had the momentum, but Gauff remained calm and composed for the remainder of the 43-minute first set. She held serve, and on the ensuing Swiatek service game, the American No. 1 needed just one set point to close it out.

That momentum carried its way into the second, where Gauff bolted out to a 5-0 lead -- Swiatek saved three match points to prevent the second set bagel to get two games back.

A post shared by United Cup (@unitedcuptennis)

In the second and fourth games, Gauff needed three and four break point chances, respectively, to secure the game as each went into a long deuce. In the fourth, Swiatek even had multiple game points of her own, but the final two points saw Swiatek's shots go long and wide, a common occurrence Saturday evening.

""I feel like Coco has improved stuff. It's quite visible. The matches we played couple years back where most of them were kind of one-sided,"" Swiatek said. ""She's also growing in age, more experienced as well.

""She's a top player for many years now, even though she started with she was, like, 16, much earlier than most of us do. Yeah, congrats to her basically.""

It wasn't the same Swiatek that defeated Maya Joint 6-1, 6-1 a day prior, but she'll have a chance to get her 16th overall singles win at the tournament against Bencic.

As for Hurkacz, the Pole continued his dream start to his comeback with a 7-6 (1), 7-6 (2) win against Fritz. 

""Obviously playing Taylor is such a big challenge and it's a very difficult match, especially this court, it's quite fast. He's serving very powerfully. Also, his forehand is really big, so if you leave anything short, he's going to come after it,"" Hurkacz told ATP No. 1 Club Jim Courier. ""I felt like I played actually quite solid myself. I tried to be more aggressive.""

Hurkacz has now beaten Alexander Zverev, Tallon Griekspoor and Fritz in Sydney, claiming all three of those victories in straight sets. Hurkacz saved the two break points he faced against Fritz, which doubled as set points at 4-5 in the opening set, to earn the lead for his country in one hour and 35 minutes.

""Coming back from such a long period the first time in my life, you never know what to expect,"" Hurkacz said. ""I was putting so much work outside of the court so, I give myself time to get back to my level, to an even better level and maybe a little bit less expectations coming into this week helped as well.”

Fritz led Hurkacz 4-2 in their head-to-head series, including two previous wins at the United Cup. But the Pole and his booming serve proved too much for the American.

Poland advanced to their third straight United Cup final, avenging their 2025 championship loss to the United States. Despite Iga Swiatek's defeat to Coco Gauff, Hubert Hurkacz's win in men's singles as well Katarzyna Kawa and Jan Zielinski's heroics in mixed doubles sent the Polish through.","{'href': 'https://www.wtatennis.com', 'title': 'WTA Tennis'}","tennis"

That set the stage for a dramatic third set, in which Mertens came from 3-1 down, saved a pair of break points that would've given Bencic a 4-1 lead, and was two points away from the win with Bencic serving at 30-30, down 6-5.

But Bencic won the last nine points of the match following an in-the-moment decision to change her racquet to a freshly-strung one at that stage, wrapping up the victory.

""I think today was really overcoming myself. It was a bit weird. You're still in the same tournament, you play semifinal, but it feels like a first-round match again because it's a different site,"" Bencic said to reporters. ""It's very special. It never happens normally in a normal tournament. I think it felt a little bit that way. I think I was just a little bit off maybe for the whole match with myself, with my thoughts.

""I'm really happy also some days like this where you are maybe more anxious on the court or more nervous, I felt at one point I had to let all my emotions out.""

In men's singles, backing up his consecutive wins over World No. 5 Felix Auger-Aliassime and No. 18 Jakub Mensik, Bergs rallied from 40-0 on Stan Wawrinka's serve at 4-3 in the third set to take the decisive break. The match had featured just six break points to that stage.

Wawrinka, the 40-year-old three-time Grand Slam champion in his 25th and final season, has played inspired tennis to kick off his farewell season, breaking serve just once across four matches has proved costly as he slipped to 1-3 in singles matches during the tournament.

""Stan played really well and I really had to battle it out today,"" said Bergs, who won 6-3, 6-7 (4), 6-3. ""It was hard to control the ball on return and he served very good; it was very hard for me. To get rhythm is very tough. I'm just happy I found the solution.""

Bergs erased the heartache of his last outing in the Davis Cup semifinals, when he let slip seven match points against Italian Flavio Cobolli while attempting to send the tie to a deciding doubles, but it would be the Swiss who emerged victorious.

Belinda Bencic kept her undefeated start to the season intact at the United Cup, delivering in both singles and mixed doubles to send Switzerland into its first final. Bencic outlasted Elise Mertens in singles and then teamed with Jakub Paul to clinch the mixed doubles against Belgium.","{'href': 'https://www.wtatennis.com', 'title': 'WTA Tennis'}","tennis"

Wang Xinyu came from a set down and saved a match point to defeat Alexandra Eala in a three-set thriller to reach the Auckland final. There she'll be joined by Elina Svitolina, who grinded out a first-set battle against Iva Jovic before running away with a straight-sets win in Saturday's second semifinal.

It was a long Saturday night in Auckland, where the two semifinal matches stretched a combined 4 hours and 22 minutes and wrapped around 10:30 p.m. local time.

Auckland: Scores | Draws | Order of play

The night opened with a three-set rollercoaster between No. 4 seed Alexandra Eala and No. 7 seed Wang Xinyu. Wang came from a set down, saved a match point in the second set and ultimately prevailed 5-7, 7-5, 6-4 in just under three hours.

“It was a crazy battle from the start to the end, for sure,” Wang said after the match. “She's an absolute fighter, and to be honest, I feel more pressure when I'm up 5-0 than when we were love-love. I'm just really happy that I got through this one today and through to my first ever final (here).”

The match swung wildly as both players chased a spot in just their second WTA Tour Driven by Mercedes-Benz final. Wang raced ahead 4-0 and then 5-1 in the opening set, only for Eala to reel off six straight games to steal it.

Wang again broke to start the second set and built a 2-0 lead. Down 3-2, Eala responded with three straight games for a 5-3 advantage. She held match point in that game, but a string of unforced errors opened the door for Wang, who swept the next four games to force a decider.

Wang carried that momentum into the third set, winning the first four games for a commanding lead. Eala clawed back to trim the deficit to 5-4, but Wang closed out the match with one final hold, securing victory thanks to timely shot making and help in the form of more untimely errors off Eala's racket.

Here are some numbers from Wang's semifinal win:

1: Match point saved by Wang. It came on Eala's serve at 7-5, 5-3, when Eala pushed a forehand long. Two more forehands sailed long later in the game, giving Wang a break point. Another unforced error by Eala handed Wang the break -- the first of four straight games she won to take the second set.

2: Second career final for Wang. Her lone previous final came on grass at the WTA 500 in Berlin last June, where she fell to Marketa Vondrousova in three sets. She entered Saturday's match with a 1-10 record in semifinals in her career.

10: Aces for Wang on Saturday. She has 23 for the tournament, the most of any player.

Outstanding battle 👏 #XinyuWang is into her first Auckland final after defeating Eala 5-7, 7-5, 6-4. #ASBClassic26 pic.twitter.com/lKx0mp5D01

34: Combined break points in the match. Eala earned more chances (19 to 15), but Wang converted at a higher rate (7-for-15 compared with Eala's 6-of-19).

95: Points played after Eala held her match point. Wang won 54 of them; Eala won 41.

The match that followed between No. 1 seed Elina Svitolina and No. 3 Iva Jovic was equally chaotic, at least in the opening set. 

The 18-year-old American jumped out to a 3-0 lead before the 31-year-old Ukrainian rallied to claim the set in a tiebreak. The second set proved more straightforward: Svitolina dropped the opening game, then won six of the last seven en route for a 7-6 (5), 6-2 victory in 1 hour and 34 minutes to reach the ASB Classic final and set up a meeting with Wang.

In the process, she denied Jovic the chance to compete in her second WTA Tour Driven by Mercedes-Benz final but still took a moment to praise the teenager after the match.

“We practiced together before the tournament, so I knew what to expect from her,” Svitolina said in her on-court interview. “Even then, she's really surprised me with the way she's striking the ball and moving really well.

“Many, many more titles for her to come, definitely in the future.”

While many agree Jovic has a bright future, she has plenty of ground to make up before matching the résumé of the former WTA Finals champion. Svitolina will be seeking title No. 19 when she faces Wang on Sunday.

But first, here are some numbers pertaining to Svitolina's semifinal victory:

2: Second Auckland final for Svitolina, who last reached the final at the event in 2024, when she lost to Coco Gauff in three sets. 

Sunday's final will also be her second meeting with Wang; she won their previous matchup in straight sets in the fourth round of Wimbledon in 2024, dropping just three games.

3: Aces for Svitolina. The number may not jump off the page, but two of them came in the final game of the match.

4: Svitolina entered the tournament on a four-match losing streak. With wins over Varvara Gracheva, Katie Boulter, Sonay Kartal and Jovic, she has flipped that into a four-match winning streak and will look to extend it to five on Sunday.

23: Career finals for Svitolina. She owns 18 titles in her previous 22 finals, a winning percentage of nearly 82%.

65: Percentage of first-serve points won by Svitolina, who outpaced Jovic by 10 percentage points. She had an even larger edge in second-serve points won (49% to 35%).

Wang Xinyu came from a set down and saved a match point to defeat Alexandra Eala in a three-set thriller to reach the Auckland final. There she'll be joined by Elina Svitolina, who grinded out a first-set battle against Iva Jovic before running away with a straight-sets win in Saturday's second semifinal.","{'href': 'https://www.wtatennis.com', 'title': 'WTA Tennis'}","tennis"

Things looked dicey at the very beginning for Gauff on Saturday, as she had to rally from triple break point down—and save a fourth break point at ad-out—just to hold serve in the opening game of the match.But once she got past that she settled in, opening up a 4-1 lead—to which Swiatek retaliated, getting the break back and evening it at 4-all.That's when Gauff caught fire, though, reeling off seven straight games to build a 6-4, 5-0 lead, and after Swiatek held and got one of the breaks back to close to 5-2, Gauff broke her right back to seal the win.“I didn't let the opportunities that I had the first two times I had match point get away from me,” Gauff said about closing it out.“She played well—maybe there was one error on the backhand, but other than that she played the better tennis at the end. But I knew how I was playing the whole match that I would get it done.”That victory also kept Team USA in contention in the semifinal clash, after Hubert Hurkacz's earlier 7-6 (1), 7-6 (2) victory over Taylor Fritz.It all came down to the mixed doubles, with Gauff coming back on court with Christian Harrison to face Jan Zielinski and Katarzyna Kawa.

The best battles of the 2025 F1 season

As Yuki Tsunoda finds himself without a race seat in 2026, F1.com relives the comeback stories of the drivers who returned to the grid after previously losing their spot.

When the drivers assemble for the first race of the season in 2026, one face that won't be on the grid is Yuki Tsunoda, with the Japanese driver having been replaced at Red Bull by Isack Hadjar.

While Tsunoda moves to the role of test and reserve driver for the Milton Keynes-based squad, boss Laurent Mekies has voiced his belief that the 25-year-old could potentially find another opportunity in the future.

Tsunoda would not be the first driver to make a return after losing their seat, with the following names having all bounced back in similar situations…

Perhaps one of the best examples for Tsunoda would be courtesy of Alex Albon, a driver who also found himself being demoted to a test and reserve position at Red Bull.

After making his F1 debut for the then-named Toro Rosso sister outfit in 2019, the Thai driver was promoted to the main team midway through the season in a direct swap with Pierre Gasly.

While Albon did enough to keep his spot alongside Max Verstappen into 2020, Red Bull decided to make a change at the end of the campaign and brought in Sergio Perez (more on whom later) to replace him, with Albon remaining in the fold in the test and reserve role.

The now 29-year-old later admitted that his struggles in 2020 left him mentally “destroyed”, but this did not stop him from using his year on the sidelines to good effect, building his network and finding himself a seat on the grid at Williams in 2022.

It was a move that paid off for Albon, who appeared to flourish as he became something of a team leader at the Grove-based outfit, with the team since continuing their steps forward and working their way up to a ‘best of the rest' P5 in 2025.

While some in this list were still trying to make a name for themselves when they dropped off the grid, a slightly different example comes courtesy of Alain Prost, who was already a three-time World Champion when he joined Ferrari in 1990.

While his first campaign with the team saw him controversially miss out on a fourth title to rival Ayrton Senna, relations between Prost and the Scuderia soured in 1991 and the Frenchman was publicly critical of the outfit following their drop in competitiveness.

As a result, Prost was axed by Ferrari before the season was over – and, with no time left to find another suitable seat for 1992, he was forced to take a sabbatical.

It would not be the last that F1 had seen of the man known as ‘the Professor', though, as he returned at the wheel of a Williams in 1993. The move was an inspired one; the FW15C proved to be a dominant force and took Prost to a historic fourth championship.

This would ultimately be the final act of the French driver's time in Formula 1, bringing the curtain down on an illustrious career.

In terms of making the most of every opportunity after losing a seat, Nico Hulkenberg is a glowing example.

At the end of 2019 – his ninth season in F1 – the experienced Hulkenberg found himself out of a job when he was dropped by Renault, who would instead bring in Esteban Ocon (another name to appear later) in 2020.

It transpired that it would not be long until the German appeared on the grid again, however. Amid a shortened season in 2020 owing to the COVID-19 pandemic, Hulkenberg made two eye-catching substitute appearances for Racing Point when Sergio Perez and Lance Stroll each contracted the virus.

When the team became known as Aston Martin in 2021, the super-sub was kept on as a reserve driver – and while his services were not required during that year, he again stepped in for two races in 2022 in place of Sebastian Vettel, who had tested positive for COVID-19.

All of this was enough to keep Hulkenberg on the radar of the teams, and he was subsequently signed up by Haas to make his full-time comeback in 2023. The 38-year-old has since gone from strength to strength, with his 2025 switch to Kick Sauber – soon to be known as Audi – delivering a long-awaited maiden podium at Silverstone.

Long before the era of ‘Hulkenback', another driver to make the most of being a stand-in was Mika Salo.

After making his debut for Lotus at the end of the 1994 season, Salo went on to race for Tyrrell and Arrows in the years that followed before the latter opted to change their line-up for 1999, leaving the Finn without a seat.

When BAR's Ricardo Zonta was sidelined with an injury, Salo stepped in across three races – and an even bigger call-up followed after Michael Schumacher broke his leg in a crash at the British Grand Prix, with Ferrari bringing Salo in to replace the German from the next round onwards in Austria.

Eddie Irvine was now heading the Scuderia's charge as he battled McLaren's Mika Hakkinen for the World Championship and, when Salo found himself in the lead of the German Grand Prix – in only his second outing for the team – the sub moved aside for Irvine. His P2 finish still marked his maiden podium in F1.

Another rostrum followed in front of the squad's home crowd at Monza and, while Irvine just missed out on the Drivers' crown, Salo's contributions helped Ferrari to seal the Teams' Championship. This also put the Finnish racer in the shop window and led to a full-time comeback in 2000 with Sauber.

Fast-forward to the modern era, and Salo's fellow Finn Valtteri Bottas has also fashioned a return to the grid after previously finding himself without a seat.

Following a four-year stint with Williams, Bottas joined Mercedes in 2017 following the sudden retirement of Nico Rosberg and went on to become a 10-time race winner in his five seasons with the squad.

After being replaced by George Russell for 2022, the now 36-year-old raced for the Alfa Romeo/Kick Sauber outfit across the next three campaigns before losing his place at the future Audi outfit at the end of 2024.

This saw Bottas return to the Mercedes fold as a reserve driver, meaning that he remained a visible presence in the paddock whilst keeping an eye out for opportunities to return, having stated that he was “not done” with Formula 1 yet following his last race for Kick Sauber.

It was later confirmed in the summer of 2025 that Bottas will be back in 2026 as part of Cadillac's line-up for their maiden campaign in F1, where he will form an experienced pairing with Sergio Perez. Speaking of…

The Cadillac line-up will feature not one but two comeback drivers, as Perez joins Bottas for the American outfit's debut.

Perez enjoyed a long F1 career that started back in 2011 with Sauber, going on to drive for McLaren and Force India – and scoring his first-ever victory with the latter in 2020 – before replacing Alex Albon at Red Bull in 2021.

The collaboration was initially a successful one as Perez partnered with Max Verstappen, helping the outfit to clinch the Teams' Championship in 2022 and 2023 as well as collecting a further five Grand Prix wins.

A good start to 2024 resulted in the Mexican being handed a contract extension through to the end of 2026 – but the rest of his season unravelled, leading to Perez and Red Bull parting ways at the close of the campaign.

While the 35-year-old opted to take a breather from the sport and spend time with his family in 2025, his desire to return to the grid remained and he will now embark on his 15th season in the sport with the Cadillac team in 2026.

Like Perez, Felipe Massa became a veteran of the sport across 15 campaigns – but it is perhaps easy to forget that his F1 career hit an early obstacle when he lost his seat following his rookie year.

Off the back of winning the Euro Formula 3000 Championship in 2001, Massa made the step up to Formula 1 with Sauber in 2002 and scored points on three occasions. It was ultimately decided that he would be replaced in 2003, however, by Heinz-Harald Frentzen, with the Brazilian instead taking up a test driver role for Ferrari.

Following a year on the sidelines, Massa bounced back by rejoining Sauber in 2004. His next season at the squad in 2005 saw him outscore new team mate Jacques Villeneuve, and the youngster impressed enough to earn a seat at Ferrari in 2006 alongside Michael Schumacher.

From there the driver from Sao Paulo experienced plenty of success in the years that followed, collecting a total of 11 wins and 15 pole positions with the Scuderia before moving to Williams in 2014.

While he had announced that he would retire at the end of 2016, Massa later stayed on for an additional year following Valtteri Bottas' exit to Mercedes after the retirement of Nico Rosberg, bringing the Brazilian's total number of Grands Prix up to 269.

Several drivers in this list have found their opportunity to return to the grid following a year spent in a reserve role – and Esteban Ocon is another name to add to that group.

Having joined the Mercedes Junior Team in 2015, Ocon soon found his way to Formula 1 after replacing Ryo Haryanto at the Manor outfit midway through 2016, before going on to join Force India to begin his first full-time campaign in 2017.

The Frenchman's promising ascent would soon come to a halt, however. After the team's financial troubles in 2018 saw them purchased by a consortium of investors led by Lawrence Stroll, Ocon was replaced at the end of the season by Lance Stroll.

Finding himself without a seat for 2019, the now 29-year-old took on a reserve driver position at Mercedes, embedding himself within the championship-winning squad whilst keen to get back on the grid in 2020, having said at the time: “I think in one year, the changes are not massive. If you miss two years, it's a big step.”

Ocon ultimately got his wish as, after just the one year away, he secured a race seat with Renault, going on to score his maiden F1 victory with the team – now known as Alpine – in 2021 as well as making three additional visits to the podium in the seasons that followed. The French racer has since joined Haas, for whom he'll embark on a second campaign in 2026.

Remember what Ocon said about the potential challenge of making a comeback following more than a year away? This may be something Romain Grosjean would have something to say about, having made his own return following a 24-month gap.

When Renault dropped Nelson Piquet Jr with seven rounds to spare in 2009, the outfit called up reserve Grosjean to replace him for the rest of the season. The Frenchman struggled to match new team mate Fernando Alonso during his debut appearance, finishing the race at Valencia down in 15th.

After ending his brief stint with no points, Grosjean was not retained by Renault for 2010 and switched focus to other categories of motorsport. This also saw him return to Formula 2 – then known as GP2 – where he won the 2011 championship.

It was also during this year that Grosjean participated in two FP1 outings for Renault, and his full-time comeback followed for the newly-rebranded Lotus squad in 2012. The driver from Geneva collected 10 podiums across his four seasons with the team, including a career-best P2 finish at the 2013 United States Grand Prix.

Grosjean then switched to Haas in 2016, where he remained until the end of 2020. And while his last F1 appearance saw him experience a shocking fiery crash in Bahrain, the Frenchman recently enjoyed an emotional one-off return at the wheel of his former team's challenger during a 2025 Testing of Previous Car (TPC) event.

One of Grosjean's team mates during his time in F1 was Kevin Magnussen, a man who made not one but two comebacks in his career.

A former member of the McLaren Young Driver Programme, Magnussen was handed his Formula 1 debut in 2014 as he stepped up at the Woking-based outfit to replace the ousted Sergio Perez. Things could barely have gone better in his maiden race, with a second place making him one of the few drivers to take a podium in their first Grand Prix.

While he scored points on 11 further occasions, it was not enough to keep Magnussen in the seat for 2015 and he was demoted to a test and reserve role. The Dane did not stay away for long, however, and returned to the grid with Renault in 2016.

Magnussen went on to race for Haas between 2017 and 2020, but was left without a seat for 2021 when the American outfit opted for the all-new line-up of Nikita Mazepin and Mick Schumacher. The Danish driver's attentions then switched to other categories – until a late call-up to rejoin the team came just weeks before the 2022 season following the exit of Mazepin.

A lack of preparation time did not prevent Magnussen from impressing on his return, scoring points with a P5 finish in his first race back while another highlight came later in the year when he clinched a surprise pole position in Sao Paulo. The 33-year-old's second stint with Haas subsequently came to an end at the close of 2024, meaning that his focus has returned to competing in the likes of the World Endurance Championship.

""The officer was in fear of his own life,"" the department insisted in a statement to Billboard.


													By
												

	Hannah Dailey



	The United States Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is hitting back at Billie Eilish after the singer reshared a series of posts on her Instagram Story calling ICE a “terrorist group” in light of the fatal shooting of a woman in Minneapolis earlier this week.


	In a statement shared with Billboard late Friday night (Jan. 9), DHS assistant secretary Tricia McLaughlin began, “Clearly, Billie Eilish has not seen the newly released footage, which corroborates what DHS has stated all along — that this individual was impeding law enforcement and weaponized her vehicle in an attempt to kill or cause bodily harm to federal law enforcement.”

	











	Sharing a link to a video on X of the Jan. 7 shooting — seemingly taken by the officer who pulled the trigger, later identified as Jonathan Ross — McLaughlin said that Ross had been “in fear of his own life [and] the lives of his fellow officers and acted in self-defense,” adding, “The American people can watch this video with their own eyes and ears and judge for themselves.”




	The assistant secretary's statement aligns with previous remarks from the DHS, President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance, who have all insisted that Ross was simply defending himself when he shot and killed 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good in her car during an ICE operation in Minnesota. Seconds before her death, Good had tried to drive away from the confrontation — as seen in the footage from the day — but the DHS has claimed that she'd been attempting to “run over” the officer with her vehicle.


	In her statement to Billboard, McLaughlin went on to share a defense of ICE's protocols and cited an internal investigation into the alleged “increase in vehicle rammings” against immigration enforcement officers, which the DHS published one day after Ross shot Good.


	“ICE does not separate families,” she said. “Parents are asked if they want to be removed with their children, or ICE will place the children with a safe person the parent designates. This is consistent with past administrations' immigration enforcement. It's garbage rhetoric from the likes of Billie Eilish that is leading to a 1,300% increase in assaults and 3,200% increase in vehicle rammings against our brave law enforcement.”


Billboard has reached out to Eilish's reps for comment.


	Though the singer herself did not comment on what happened in Minneapolis prior to McLaughlin's response, Eilish did share a number of posts from other creators onto her Story on Friday. One of them called ICE a “federally funded and supported terrorist group” that is “tearing apart families, terrorizing citizens, and now murdering innocent people” under the Trump administration.


	Another post Eilish reshared on her Story called on the U.S. to “abolish ICE,” while a third post encouraged people to contact their representatives in Congress to demand that Ross be arrested and charged for killing Good.

	











	The nine-time Grammy winner is far from the only person who was horrified by the footage of Good's death. Backlash to ICE's ongoing crackdown on immigrant communities has reached a fever pitch in the days since it was shared, though the agency's actions have repeatedly come under fire throughout Trump's first year back in office. Previously, artists such as Olivia Rodrigo, Tyler, the Creator and more slammed the various raids that have taken place across the country.


	In the aftermath of Good's death, countless Minneapolis residents have rallied together to grieve her loss and protest ICE's presence in their city. The city's mayor, Jacob Frey, also demanded that the enforcement officers “get the f—k out of Minneapolis” during a press conference on Jan. 8, adding, “This was an agent recklessly using power that resulted in somebody dying, getting killed.”


	And during a press meeting in the Oval Office the day prior, even Trump seemingly struggled to justify what happened after watching a video of the shooting in front of reporters, according to The New York Times. “Well … I — the way I look at it …,” the POTUS reportedly said after playback. “I think it's horrible to watch. No, I hate to see it.”

Dolly Parton has revealed that she will not attend her 80th birthday celebration at the Grand Ole Opry.


	The 79-year-old country music icon, who turns 80 on Jan. 19, shared the news in a video message posted to the Opry's Instagram page on Thursday (Jan. 8). In the clip, Parton explained that she will unfortunately miss the Nashville venue's birthday show, scheduled for Jan. 17.


	“Well, hey there Grand Ole Opry family,” Parton said. “I just wanted to say how much it means to me that you're all coming together again this year to celebrate my big ol' birthday with some of my songs.”


	She continued, “Some of my favorite memories happened right here onstage at the Grand Ole Opry, and I wish I could be there in person, but I'll be sending you all my love for sure. So you have the best night ever.”

	











	The Jan. 17 event, titled “Opry Goes Dolly,” will celebrate the “9 to 5” singer's 1980s era and feature appearances by Opry members Lainey Wilson, Vince Gill, Rhonda Vincent and songwriter Trannie Anderson, with more performers to be announced.


	“While Dolly is unable to attend in person, we're looking forward to honoring her through song and fun all day long,” the Opry wrote in the comments section of the post. The venue added that the event will include birthday cupcakes, a “larger-than-life” birthday card for fans to sign, photo opportunities with a Dolly impersonator, “Dolly-themed” drinks, and other tributes.




	Parton's announcement comes several months after the “Jolene” hitmaker postponed her Las Vegas concert residency at the Colosseum at Caesars Palace due to undisclosed medical procedures. The residency, originally set to start in December, is now scheduled to begin in 2026.


	The following month, she addressed her health publicly after rumors about her condition began circulating online.


	“I don't think God is through with me and I ain't done workin',” the Country Music Hall of Famer said in a video on Oct. 8. “I wanted you to know that I'm not dying.” She added, “There's just a lot of rumors flyin' around and I figured if you heard it from me, you'd know that I was OK.”

Yungblud's arrival in Australia ahead of the kickoff of his IDOLS World Tour has been anything but low-key.

	Yungblud's arrival in Australia ahead of the kickoff of his IDOLS World Tour has been anything but low-key.


	The British rocker touched down in Sydney earlier this week and quickly drew massive fan attention after attending a pop-up photo gallery exhibition in Newtown, where crowds reportedly became so large that police were called to manage the situation. 


	The event, titled Yungblud: IDOLS, featured photography by British photographer Tom Pallant and showcased images from previous legs of the singer's ongoing tour.

	Yungblud — born Dominic Harrison — had encouraged fans to attend the gallery via social media, telling them he would be there in person. Hundreds reportedly queued for hours to catch a glimpse of the artist, with some lining up from early morning. 


	Though no major incidents were reported, the turnout was large enough that authorities asked the event to wrap earlier than planned.


	“Yo guys, I love you so much, thank you for coming out,” Yungblud said in a voice memo shared to fans afterward. “That got a bit f—ing hectic, didn't it? The cops said we had to move on because it was just getting mad.”


	The exhibition is scheduled to run through Jan. 11, with fans lining up as early as 6:30 a.m. on opening day, according to the gallery.


	The day prior, Yungblud kicked off his Australian arrival with a bang—quite literally stripping down to nothing on a Sydney Harbour yacht alongside socialite Dina Broadhurst. 

	











	The back-to-back viral moments have only amplified attention around Yungblud's return to Australia, where he is set to launch the local leg of his IDOLS World Tour on Saturday (Jan. 10) at Sydney's Qudos Bank Arena.


	The Australian dates come after a turbulent end to 2025, when he was forced to cancel several shows following medical advice related to vocal and blood tests. 


	“It is in my nature to run and run until I run myself to the ground,” he said in a statement shared in November. “But this time I've been told I have to take it seriously.”


	The Australian leg of the IDOLS World Tour was later confirmed to proceed as scheduled, with multiple dates selling out quickly.


	The tour supports Yungblud's fourth studio album, IDOLS, released in June 2025. Yungblud's tour down under is in support of Idols, his fourth studio album which dropped in at No. 4 on the ARIA Chart last June. That effort marked his third top 10 chart appearance in these parts, after Weird! reached No. 6 in 2020, and his self-titled collection logged one week at No. 1 in 2022. Last November, the pop-punk artist released One More Time, a collaborative EP with Aerosmith. 


	In the months following its release, Yungblud also received multiple Grammy nominations, including Best Rock Album, Best Rock Song and Best Rock Performance.

Neil Young has published a strongly worded new editorial criticizing Donald Trump, using his official Neil Young Archives website to address recent political unrest and reiterate his long-running opposition to the former president.

	The post arrives days after a protester was shot and killed by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officer in Minneapolis, an incident that sparked demonstrations in multiple U.S. cities.

	











	“Today the USA is a disaster,” Young wrote in the post, which was published earlier this month. 


	“Donald Trump is destroying America bit by bit with his staff of wannabes…He has divided us.”


	Young goes on to accuse Trump of fostering instability and using fear as a political tool, warning against what he characterizes as the militarization of American cities. “Make America Great Again,” Young wrote. “It won't be easy while he is trying to turn our cities into battlegrounds so he can cancel our elections with marshal law and escape all accountability.”




	The musician also calls for collective action, urging Americans to respond through nonviolent protest. “Something has to change this,” Young continued. 


	“We know what to do. Rise up. Peacefully in millions. Too many innocent people are dying.”


	In the closing portion of the editorial, Young directs his sharpest language toward ICE, writing, “It's ICE cold here in America.” 


	He criticizes what he views as expanded enforcement tactics under Trump, adding, “Every move he makes is to build instability so he can stay in power.” Young concludes by encouraging readers to act from compassion rather than fear, emphasizing “love of life” and “love of one another.”


	The post is the latest in a series of public rebukes Young has aimed at Trump over the years. Despite Trump's past praise of Young's music — the former president told Rolling Stone in 2008 that Young's voice was “perfect and haunting” — the artist has consistently objected to Trump's political views and use of his songs.


	Young's criticism has also extended into his music. 


	Last summer, he released the protest song “Big Crime,” which directly references Trump and political leadership in Washington, D.C. The track includes the lyric, “There's big crime in DC at the White House,” and was later covered by Yo La Tengo.


	In addition to the political commentary, Young has continued to keep fans updated on his archival projects, including progress on the upcoming fourth installment of his Archive Series box sets, which compile unreleased recordings and historical material from across his career.

The controversial rapper says a construction manager placed an invalid lien on his Malibu house, effectively discouraging buyers.


													By
												

	Rachel Scharf



	Ye, the rapper formerly known as Kanye West, is suing a construction manager for allegedly interfering with the sale of his $57 million Malibu house.


	Ye brought slander and breach of contract claims on Thursday (Jan. 8) against Tony Saxon, who handled construction work on the rapper's beachfront mansion in 2021. Notably, Saxon has been pursuing his own lawsuit against Ye since 2023 over alleged unpaid wages and unsafe working conditions on the job. 


	To account for those alleged unpaid wages, Saxon took out a $1.8 million lien on the house after Ye put it on the market, through which Saxon claimed he would be entitled to a portion of the proceeds from any sale. Saxon's lawyer, Ronald Zambrano, told media outlets at the time, “If someone wants to buy Kanye's Malibu home, they'll have to deal with us first.”


	“Ye is one of the most recognizable recording artists and entrepreneurs in the world and rarely initiates litigation,” wrote Ye's lawyers in the Thursday complaint. “Plaintiffs bring this action because defendants recorded and then wrongfully maintained a $1,819,986.00 mechanics lien against the property — despite knowing or having reason to know the lien was invalid — while simultaneously launching an aggressive publicity campaign designed to pressure Ye, chill prospective transactions, and extract payment on disputed claims already being litigated in court.”


	A judge ultimately disposed of Saxon's lien last year after determining that he'd failed to enforce it. But Ye alleges that the lien, and the swirl of publicity initiated by Saxon's team, did damage to his real estate dealings while in place.


	According to Ye, the lien required him to buy a bond and had the effect of “discouraging buyers, title and escrow professionals, lenders and the public.” Ye ultimately sold the house for $21 million, significantly below his $57 million purchase price from 2021, according to an MLS report.


	Ye is now seeking unspecified financial damages from Saxon, Zambrano and the lawyer's firm. Zambrano did not immediately have any comment on the claims when reached on Friday (Jan. 9).


	Zambrano is behind a number of employment-related lawsuits that have been brought against Ye in recent years. In addition to Saxon, his clients have included teachers who allege the controversial rapper fired them for complaining about bizarre conditions at his now-shuttered school, Donda Academy.


	Saxon's lawsuit against Ye remains pending, with a trial scheduled to begin this March. Ye maintains that he doesn't owe anything, arguing in court papers that he already made “substantial payments” and that Saxon isn't entitled to more because he doesn't have a valid contractor's license.

					By Jake Kanter 

International Investigations Editor


EXCLUSIVE: Buzz about the next James Bond has always existed in its own reality. Everyone's got an opinion about who should play the super spy, and — even if those views do not align with the tiny pool of tastemakers overseeing the franchise — they are whipped up by bookmakers, agents, the press, and very often the actors themselves. And why not? It's flattering to be thought of as 007. 


	But not all Bond rumors are created equally. And at least one rumor, which successfully entered the bloodstream of the media last year, was the result of a fairly elaborate hoax, later legitimized by the actor in question. This is the inside story of that hoax, which serves as a cautionary tale about the efforts some will go to deceive journalists and how AI is supercharging the ability to spread disinformation. Ultimately, the hoax proves an old reporting maxim: If a story is too good to be true, it often is.

	











	It started with an email. Like many reporters, I have an encrypted email account, through which I encourage sources to send me sensitive information that could ultimately lead to a story. In August 2025, a person identifying himself as Michael Lawrence sent me an eye-catching message, in which they claimed to have evidence showing that an unknown British actor was being seriously considered as the successor to Daniel Craig.




			Watch on Deadline		









	The actor in question was Scott Rose-Marsh, a red-headed 37-year-old whose most significant screen credit was in Yr Amgueddfa (The Museum), a Welsh-language series that last screened in 2023. “I am providing one redacted casting email (of two in my possession) that proves actor Scott Rose-Marsh has been seen by the Bond producers and is being actively considered for the role of James Bond,” the message read. 

	











	Attached was a heavily redacted screenshot of a macOS Mail account, claiming to show a casting brief for a role named “Bond/Cavalier” in a film code-named “Project Knight.” The email was purportedly sent on June 24, 2025, days before Denis Villeneuve was confirmed by Amazon MGM Studios as Bond 26's director, and months before Peaky Blinders scribe Steven Knight was officially installed as the movie's writer.


	Send me an email like this, and you have my attention. But something was a little off about the message. There were inconsistencies and a peculiar focus on horsemanship, which is not something naturally associated with Bond. The email is structured in a way that resembles how AI spits out information, with subheads, bullet points, and robotic language. Indeed, when run through two artificial intelligence detector tools — which are unreliable but can provide circumstantial evidence — both indicated a high probability that the email was written using ChatGPT or similar.


	Was “Michael” real or an AI-prompted illusion? I pressed him for more information, but the tipster declined to declare his identity, his connection to Rose-Marsh, or how he came into possession of confidential material. Nevertheless, Michael shared two scripts, which he claimed were read by Rose-Marsh during an audition. One was a scene from GoldenEye, the other was purportedly a scene from Knight's Bond script. Michael made repeated requests that the material not be shared or published.


	The Knight script was an extraordinary claim. Such material is not freely disseminated digitally and is usually subject to strict non-disclosure agreements. The script was heavily redacted, which served to heighten its mystique and cement the impression it was being shared illicitly. It did, however, contain the somewhat ironic direction: “James Bond leaves the office in which he just found a conclusive piece of evidence.” 


	The script was not a conclusive piece of evidence (it was, as I would later discover, a fake), but it was enough for us to make further inquiries in an attempt to corroborate the claims. As it turned out, Hollywood sources scoffed at the tipster, indicating what my colleague Baz Bamigboye later reported: that casting for Bond would not begin in earnest until Villeneuve had completed Dune: Part Three. In other words, the Rose-Marsh audition timeline did not fit. 


	When you balance the words of trusted confidantes with a faceless tipster, the former should always prevail. We decided against publication on this basis, but there were other red flags, not least a failed attempt to get Michael on the phone (he wrongly claimed my Signal account was not registered). Michael also said he was speaking to other journalists, a tactic presumably designed to increase the pressure on me to beat the competition and publish. 


	I thought little more of the tip-off until a week later, when The Hollywood Reporter published a gossip column suggesting that Rose-Marsh tested for Bond, reading sides from GoldenEye and potential material from Knight. Citing a “well-placed source close to the production,” the report did offer a note of skepticism about Rose-Marsh's ginger hair, but ultimately sparked a flurry of follow-up stories, firmly connecting the actor with the role of a lifetime.

	











	Amazon MGM Studios did not knock the story down (as is tradition with Bond casting rumors), and then — perhaps the most telling intervention — Rose-Marsh capitalized on the interest by granting an interview to Australian publication Man of Many, under the headline: “Meet Scott Rose-Marsh, the man who might be James Bond.” Asked if he had auditioned for Bond, the actor cryptically replied: “I can't confirm or deny.” He added: “Whether it was to be me or anybody else, I would support whoever it is.” 


	Over Christmas, the Bond rumors kept coming — and Rose-Marsh continued to be mentioned. Reports about Callum Turner being the frontrunner featured references to Rose-Marsh, while GQ named him among the contenders in a listicle. Bookmakers are taking bets on Rose-Marsh being Bond, with comparison website Oddschecker putting his chances at 33-1 (incidentally, there have been many reports about Rose-Marsh based on betting odds, a couple of which pre-dated efforts to plant the audition story).


	So at the turn of the year, I decided to do some further digging on the story. A well-placed person eventually confirmed that the Knight “script” was a fabrication. What's more, Rose-Marsh never tested for Bond.


	When I confronted Rose-Marsh, the actor said the speculation “may have arisen from a previous ‘Bond-related' audition,” but he declined to provide more information because of an NDA. Rose-Marsh did not directly answer questions about whether he was aware of the hoax or if he knew the identity of Michael Lawrence.


	“I do not agree with or condone hoaxers,” he said, adding: “I don't comment on rumors, but since being in the public eye, it's humbling that people think a rising actor like me could really be James Bond — and, of course, being Bond has been the dream of many actors.”


	Gregg Millard, Rose-Marsh's agent, advised his client against the Man of Many interview, telling him it would be naive. Millard said he was baffled at the level of “unfounded speculation” and that the story was not killed by Bond producers. “I know nothing about any suggested hoax,” he added.


	When confronted with our evidence over email on Thursday, Michael Lawrence did not reply. Amazon MGM Studios declined to comment.


	We may well find out the true identity of the next James Bond later this year. It will be a thrilling moment, injecting fresh life into one of cinema's most iconic franchises. But until that time, the Rose-Marsh hoax is a reminder not to be left shaken or stirred by rumors about 007.

He ain't in the frame.

Likely a hoax but the writer gave more air to it and more publicity to Rose-Marsh.

Actual journalism.  How refreshing.

					By Dominic Patten 

Executive Editor, Legal, Labor & Politics


	A 10-year-old New Mexico boy says Timothy Busfield “touched his ‘poop' and ‘pee' area” during production on The Cleaning Lady, an Albuquerque District Attorney-approved arrest warrant issued Friday says.


	“In my training and experience, pedophiles often infiltrate families under a trusted role, like Timothy, who, as a producer, exploited the hectic film sets to tickle and touch SL on his penis and buttocks, masking it as play,” the warrant from Albuquerque Police Officer Marvin Brown asserts. “He would invite the family to off-set gatherings, with his wife buying Christmas gifts to foster closeness, making SL feel special and dependent—classic grooming to erode boundaries, isolate the victim, and silence suspicions by blending abuse into normalcy.”

	













	Filled with accounts from two brothers of their alleged repeated experiences with the Thirtysomething alum, who was a director on the now shuttered Élodie Yung-led Fox drama from Warner Bros TV, the document charges Busfield with two counts of criminal sexual contact with a minor and child abuse. It is unclear at this point if the Emmy winner has been arrested and booked.




			Watch on Deadline		







	If found guilty, Busfield could face a minimum of three years behind bars.


	In fact, the 68-year-old, who was accused but never charged in two previous sexual assault allegations in 1994 and 2012, could be looking at a lot longer sentence. Under New Mexico statutes, prison time in sex crimes against minors leans heavily on context and circumstances in the degrees of punishment they hand out. That time and felony class can go up substantially if the crime involves children under 13 years of age — as it allegedly does here.

	











	Named as “SL” and “VL” in the warrant, the two 2014-born boys appeared on The Cleaning Lady over multiple seasons before being let go for having aged out of the role, I hear. However, in a November 3, 2025 phone interview with Busfield in the warrant, The West Wing actor told Brown, the investigating officer, that he “the lead actress, Elodie Young” informed him over a year ago that “the mother of SL and VL (sic) that she wanted revenge, and I'm going to get my revenge on Tim Busfield for not bringing her kids back for the final season.”


	In interviews conducted with SL and VL on Halloween last year by a “forensic child interviewer,” and observed by Brown, the arrest warrant says SL told them the alleged abuse by Busfield began when he was 7 years old and on The Cleaning Lady.


	“SL said that Tim touched him three to four times on his ‘poop' and ‘pee' area over his clothing,” the 12-page arrest warrant states of what is cited as a second incident with Busfield, similar to a previous incident. “SL said he was very afraid of Tim and was relieved when he was off set. SL said he was afraid to tell anyone because Tim was the director, and he feared Tim would get mad at him. SL did advise that Tim touched him while he was only on set filming in Albuquerque.”


	SL now suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder and anxiety, the warrant says. SL disclosed having nightmares about the director touching him and waking up scared,” the document adds.


	It goes on: “VL explained that Mr. Tim started touching them for the first two years, and he did not want to say anything, because he did not want to be mean to him. Therefore, VL did not say anything. VL said Mr. Tim would start touching him with his hands about his body while they were filming in the ‘house'. VL advised that it was about his body, but did not disclose that he was touched on his buttocks or penis area. VL said he did not like being touched, but did not say anything because he did not want to get in trouble.”


	The matter first came to the cops' attention in late 2024 when a doctor from University of New Mexico Hospital contacted the Albuquerque Police Department in regards to a “sexual abuse investigation.”


	Noting that the boys' father had been advised to go to the hospital by a local law firm, today's warrant details: “Officer Osborn talked with both VL and SL, who did not disclose any sexual contact at this time. However, both boys advised that Timothy Busfield, whom they referred to as ‘Uncle Tim', would tickle them on the stomach and legs. Neither boy cared for the tickling. Officer Osborn contacted Detective Michael Brown with the Crimes Against Children Unit and determined that the case did not meet their acceptance criteria at this time.”


	The matter came back to the police's attention and became a greater priority after the boys' mother “advised that on 09/02/2025, SL reported to his counselor that Timothy Busfield touched his penis and bottom.”


	In that same telephone conversation with Busfield in the weeks before Thanksgiving last year, the NYC-based filmmaker also dropped to Officer Brown that producer Warner Bros TV had conducted its own probe into allegations against him after SAG-AFTRA received an anonymous complaint in early 2025 of an incident on The Cleaning Lady set from December 2024. After writing up a search warrant for WB (which today's warrant seems to mistakenly say occurred on “10/03/2025”) and several correspondences with WB attorney Richard Wessling at law firm Proskauer, Brown on New Year's Eve got his hands on the March 31, 2025 external report put together by the Los Angeles office of Solomon Law.

	











	Specifically the report, which saw Busfield suspended during the probe, looked into claims from the hotline caller that there was evidence of Busfield “tickling and caressing the head and body of minor boys” while working on the Albuquerque-filmed Cleaning Lady. Upon his own reading of the document, Brown says in Friday's warrant that Solomon investigator “Christina McGovern was not able to talk with anyone who would support evidence that Timothy Busfield engaged in this behavior.”


	Working from what now seems to be limited accusations, the WBTV investigation viewed Busfield as “exonerated,” sources tell me.  


	In a statement to Deadline tonight, the Channing Dungey-led WBTV said: “The health and safety of our cast and crew is always our top priority, especially the safety of minors on our productions. We take all allegations of misconduct very seriously and have systems in place to promptly and thoroughly investigate, and when needed, take appropriate action. We are aware of the current charges against Mr. Busfield and have been and will continue to cooperate with law enforcement.”


	As well as speaking to the boys' mother and father (who seem to have instigated and then ceased a civil suit on the matter), plus some Cleaning Lady production assistants and make-up and hair department staffers, today's warrant also details a brief back-and-forth between Brown and the series star Yung, who was also a producer.


	“On 11/5/2025, I contacted Elodie Yung to set up an interview. Elodie agreed to meet with me at the Northwest Substation on 11/7/2025,” Brown notes in a fairly comprehensive affidavit that Albuquerque Assistant DA Savannah Brandenburg-Koch signed off on today. “I did initially advise Elodie that Tim Busfield gave me her name and said that she may have information about this case. On 11/06/2025, Elodie left me a voicemail declining to speak with me and said that she does not want to be involved with the investigation and that she would not have any information that could assist in this case.”


	Busfield's agents at Innovative Artists did not respond late Friday to Deadline's request for comment on the arrest warrant and the charges against their client.

Maybe innocent before found guilty?

This one sounds bogus… but so much for due process.

If found guilty, sentence him to 30-something years.

Not good!

	Director-screenwriter Takashi Yamazaki returns for the follow-up to 2023's Godzilla Minus One, which minted north of $116 million at the box office and won Best Visual Effects at the 96th Academy Awards, becoming the first Asian film to take home the award.


	The release date of November 3 holds a special significance in Godzilla's storied legacy, marking the date of the original theatrical release of Godzilla in 1954.







Godzilla Minus One opened to $11.4M stateside and went on to make north of $57M at the domestic B.O. A remastered black-and-white version received a one-week play in late January 2024 in the states after playing Japan earlier that month.

	As on of Hollywood's leading ladies, Jennifer Lawrence prefers not to know her leading men before filming.


	The Oscar winner recently explained why it was “actually easier” filming her Die My Love sex scenes with Robert Pattinson than it would have been with an actor she considered a friend beforehand.


	“Because Rob and I did not know each other, which is kind of better, you know?” she told Josh Horowitz, according to People. “Like in Hunger Games, like me and Josh Hutcherson would have to kiss and that's like… Imagine it. You know, it's weirder and so yeah, doing it with a stranger is preferable.”

	










			Watch on Deadline		









	Lawrence explained that Die My Love director Lynne Ramsay had them take an interpretive dance lesson before filming a “naked sex tiger” scene on the first day of shooting, in which the two attack each other like jungle cats.


	“We got to Calgary like three weeks before we started shooting. Rob and I both [are] embarrassed very easily, and that was mortifying. It was, I mean, I'm not…a dancer, Rob's [the] worst dancer,” she recalled.


	“And it was like, now blow like a tree — like it was just so embarrassing,” added Lawrence. “So I think by the time she was like, ‘Yeah, get naked.' We were just kind of like, ‘Okay, at least it's not interpretive dance…'


	In Die My Love, Lawrence plays young mother Grace, who slowly spirals into madness while locked in an old Montana house, which begins to worry her partner Jackson (Pattinson).

As long as we've known about him, we've heard that Robin Hood's thing is that he steals from the rich and gives to the poor. This sounds like a net positive. But The Death Of Robin Hood, the upcoming film from A24 which released its first trailer today, has a different take on the legend. “People speak of Robin Hood, tell his stories… they're all lies,” we hear early in the clip. Of course, it's Robin Hood (Hugh Jackman) himself telling us these things, so perhaps he has an ulterior motive. 

“Grappling with his past after a life of crime and murder, Robin Hood finds himself gravely injured after a battle he thought would be his last,” reads an official synopsis for the film. “In the hands of a mysterious woman, he is offered a chance at salvation.” From the looks of it, at least some of this salvation will come from Robin's relationship with a little girl whom he teaches to use a bow and arrow. This leaves him conflicted, given his new distaste for murder and pillaging, so he later promises to keep her safe. 



The Death Of Robin Hood comes from A Quiet Place: Day One and Pig director and screenwriter Michael Sarnoski. Jackman stars alongside Jodie Comer, Bill Skarsgård, Murray Bartlett, and Noah Jupe. The film is slated for a 2026 release, though there's no firm theatrical release date as of this writing.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Nation's defeated theater owners okay ""Screw it, bring in your own 5-gallon bucket"" popcorn promo","https://www.avclub.com/cinemark-national-popcorn-day-five-gallon-lowes-buckets","Sat, 10 Jan 2026 06:15:46 GMT","

It's not new to note that the fortunes of America's movie theaters rest, pretty precariously, on a thick, greasy cloud of popcorn, soda, and nacho cheese dip; as the U.S. box office has seemingly plateaued in its recovery from the COVID-19 shutdowns over the last few years, theaters have had to lean more and more heavily on concessions in order to make ends meet. Even with that understanding, though, we'll admit to a bit of shock at a planned promotion that theater chain Cinemark is rolling out for this year's “National Popcorn Day,” set by the food advertising minds that cook this kind of thing up for January 18 and 19. The company's marketing has its own language for it, but if it's all the same to you, we're going to just go ahead and keep thinking of the promotion like this: Welcome, one and, all, to the “Fuck it, bring your own goddamn bucket” plan!

As noted by THR, this is the second consecutive year that Cinemark has run the FIBYOGBP, in which consumers—and the word has rarely felt more apt—are invited, for that 48-hour period, to bring in any container they like, up to 400 fluid ounces, and get it filled with popcorn for just five bucks. The twist this year (and it's a powerful one, to our mind) is that the chain has now gone one step further and struck a promotional deal with hardware company Lowe's: If you show up with a 5 gallon bucket that you bought at Lowe's, that can also be filled, netting you an extra 250 ounces of indigestion, kernels-in-teeth, and the looming specter of heart disease. The THR piece employs the phrase “Food-grade bucket liners will be available upon request,” which is the kind of thing that's going to haunt us almost as much as 5 full gallons of popcorn are bound to haunt our large intestines in the months and years to come.

Meanwhile, it's also noted that non-bucket-owners—i.e., chumps—will still be able to buy a 200-ounce “XL” popcorn for the same price, if your FIBYOGBP FOMO isn't too intense at the thought of leaving all that hot, slick salted corn on the table. Oh, and the promotion doesn't require a ticket purchase, so no reason to stay put: Wander America's decaying malls and crumbling streets with your big ol' paint bucket of popcorn clutched in your greasy mitts, fending off birds and raccoons as you go! It's National Popcorn Day, baby! Food-grade bucket liners are available on request!

“Seinfeld” director and producer Tom Cherones died on Monday, Jan. 5, at the age of 86. According to a family spokesperson, the prolific figure in film, who worked on the first five seasons of the hit sitcom, passed away at his home in Florence, Ore.

Cherones' cause of death is confirmed to have been a battle with Alzheimer's disease, per The Hollywood Reporter. He is survived by his third wife, Carol; his daughter, Susan; his son, Scott; and his two grandchildren, Jessa and Thomas.

Throughout the 81 “Seinfeld” episodes he worked on, Cherones was honored with six Emmy nominations, having won the prestigious award in 1993 for Outstanding Comedy Series. He also won a Golden Globe Award and a Directors Guild of America Award.

As the sitcom's behind-the-scenes leader, Cherones was a pivotal figure in its monumental success. Some of the most memorable episodes he produced for the series include “The Chinese Restaurant,” “The Parking Garage” and “The Contest.”

He also appeared in one episode during season 4 titled “The Pilot,” where he played the role of a boisterous director.

In a 2015 interview with The Hollywood Reporter, the legendary director opened up about the dynamic between him and “Seinfeld” writers Larry David and Jerry Seinfeld — a bond that ultimately led to the show's longstanding praise.

“We changed the way sitcoms were looked at. I had done a lot of work in various jobs before I got to ‘Seinfeld,' and they pretty much all looked the same,” he told the outlet. “As a producer and director, I was in a position to make this one look different. Larry and Jerry asked me early on, ‘Can we do this? Can we do that?' I said, ‘We can do anything. You write it and I'll shoot.'”

After making his exit from “Seinfeld,” Cherones went on to direct 23 episodes of season 2 of Ellen DeGeneres' ABC talk show, “Ellen.” He also notably worked on NBC's “Caroline in the City” and the hit sitcom “NewsRadio.”

Several other shows he directed include “Desperate Housewives,” “Sabrina the Teenage Witch,” “My Sister Sam,” “The Pitts” and more.

Apart from his career in film, Cherones was an officer in the U.S. Navy for four years after graduating from the University of New Mexico in 1961. He was also inducted into the Alabama Stage and Screen Hall of Fame in 2003 and the University of Alabama College of Communication and Information Sciences Hall of Fame in 2001.

Reality television star Tammy Kaye Donath, who became known when appearing on “Love After Lockup,” passed away at the age of 63 on December 31, 2025, the family announced in an online obituary. No cause of death was listed. 

She is remembered for her “bright, loving soul, intelligence, honesty, and straightforward demeanor.”

She is survived by her daughter's Kristianna Miller, Terra Kaylea Sprague and her son Christopher Roth, along with her siblings Robin Donath, Linda Schoenberger (Donath), Dennis (Bud) Donath, and Rebecca Donath, as well as her grandchildren, Dethan Moore, Mackenzie Cook, Payton Cook, and great-grandchildren, Malakai Cook, Seth Fuoco Jr., Jak Moore, and Gunnar Fuoco, the obituary says. 

On the same page as Donath's online obituary, there was a tribute wall where many people left comments. And that included her son. 

“I miss you so much MOM,” Christopher Roth wrote. “You never judged me and we could always talk about anything and everything. You could party with the best of them and you never had a filter and told everyone exactly how you felt and what you meant. And when it was time to buckle down and get sober you did that too. You never had an addictive personality which is where I believe I gained the strong mentality from. 

“You were the smartest, sweetest, most loving caring and forgiving Mother and The Best Mother any Son could ever want,” he continued. “I Love And Miss You So Much Mother. I WILL SEE YOU LATER!!! I will make you proud and become successful and never give up and never go backwards EVER AGAIN!!! When it rains I will dance in it as much as possible because I know it is your tears of joy from you and you are watching over us forever and always. Love Your Son Christopher Nicholas Roth.”

“Love After Lockup” is a show that follows couples who meet while one is incarcerated and shows their story once they are released from prison.

Donath appeared on the show while it followed her daughter, Kristianna Miller's, love story after she was incarcerated in 2020. It followed her relationship with John Miller, and the two eventually got married, but split and went through a divorce in 2022. Miller has also struggled throughout the years, having been incarcerated again in 2024 due to a probation violation, the Sun reports.

Fran Drescher has opened up about her cancer diagnosis and how it impacted her ability to have children in a deeply personal and vulnerable interview.

Drescher is 68, but when she was 42, she was diagnosed with uterine cancer. Her cancer diagnosis ultimately impacted her ability to have children. In an interview with People, published on Friday, January 9, the “The Nanny” actress reflected on her thoughts during this time. She also revealed she had been continually misdiagnosed. 

“I had it for two years, and eight doctors misdiagnosed it,” she said of her utrine cancer diagnosis. “Next thing I knew, I had a radical hysterectomy, a full cavity wash, and was told I'd never have kids. Bada bing. But I don't really like being told what I can and can't do, so it was a bitter pill to swallow.”

She continued, “I was with a man 16 years my junior, and for the first time in my life, I was like, ‘I could have his kids.' But I only had like five minutes of fertility left, and was told I should freeze an embryo. But it quickly turned into cancer, and then that option was off the table. That was my destiny.” She shared that it would be difficult for anyone to have the surgery, but when she didn't already have children, it felt even more challenging. The actress described her feelings as “a bitter pill to swallow.”

After learning she would be unable to have children, Drescher focused her energy elsewhere. She wanted to ensure that others did not find themselves in her position. She advocated for early detection and raised awareness surrounding the disease. “Instead, I gave birth to a bestselling book about it, formed the organization Cancer Schmancer, and became a public diplomacy envoy for the State Department on family health issues,” she said. 

Her hard work and dedication resulted in her getting a bill passed in Washington in 2007. She was not done there. “I was sent all over to our allied nations to speak just as I do to this day, and our military bases too, because people in the military, particularly women, aren't being screened for cancer,” she shared. 

A photo from the cover of People showing Drescher discussing her cancer was shared on Instagram, and fans showed their support. “Congrats Fran. What a beautiful interview! We loved your story,” a comment reads. “Forever an icon,” another person shared.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","‘TODAY' Co-Host Jill Martin Undergoes Emergency Surgery","https://entertainmentnow.com/news/today-show-jill-martin-emergency-surgery/","Sat, 10 Jan 2026 00:08:36 GMT","

Jill Martin, 49, co-host of NBC's “TODAY,” shared that she will be undergoing emergency surgery to treat residual damage caused by her stage 2 breast cancer. Her surgery, scheduled for Friday, Jan. 9, the same day she revealed the news to the show's digital outlet, will be the eighth one she's endured since her diagnosis in 2023.

“Just when you think the fight is over, life reminds you that healing isn't always linear,” she said, according to TODAY.com. 

Martin's surgery is a result of the skin damage caused by her breast cancer radiation therapy. When explaining to the outlet about what's to come, she said she will be admitting herself to the hospital as a reconstructive patient rather than a cancer patient.

“It's preventative and proactive — an emergency only in the sense that if we don't act now, it could turn into something much bigger,” she said. “It's important to say this clearly: my cancer is not back.”

The New York Times bestseller shared how she plans to be in the hospital for at least three nights before returning home to recover for several weeks. However, amid the chaos, she told TODAY.com she will lean on the gratitude she has for her incredible care team as she prepares for the next stages.

“I feel worn out and grateful all at once,” she expressed. “Sometimes it feels like it never really ends. And still — I'm grateful. Grateful for early action, for great doctors, and for the chance to keep moving forward.”

After her July 2023 diagnosis, Martin had a double mastectomy and 18 lymph nodes removed in August of that same year, according to an essay she wrote. She then received an aggressive form of chemotherapy known as doxorubicin, also referred to as the “red devil” for its bright red color. 

After her chemotherapy, Martin completed 16 weekdays of consistent radiation. While she was fortunately able to ring the bell, the co-host's taxing treatment untimely led to her current surgery. 

Before undergoing her Jan. 9 surgery, Martin shared a video on her Instagram Story to thank her friends and family for their devoted support — shining light on the positivity she plans to pursue.

“I'm just treating this like a job. Like I'm gonna go in, I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna heal and get better,” she said. “I just don't want this to take one more second of my, ya know, my life, tears and breath. I just wanna get through it gracefully with strength.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Nick Reiner Praised His Dad Rob Reiner in Resurfaced Podcast Interview: 'Very Understanding'","https://entertainmentnow.com/news/nick-reiner-podcast-about-rob-reiner/","Sat, 10 Jan 2026 17:36:54 GMT","

A resurfaced podcast interview with Rob Reiner's son, Nick, that was recorded in September 2016 sheds new light on what Nick's relationship with the famed director was really like. Nick is charged with the murders of his parents Rob and Michele Reiner, and currently being held at the Twin Towers jail in Los Angeles.

The 32-year-old, who has struggled with mental health and addiction issues since his teenage years, was an open book on Episode 45 of the addiction recovery-themed podcast “Dopey.” During the interview, he talked about the pressure of being involved with “Being Charlie,” the semi auto-biographical movie he co-wrote with his dad. It was released four months before Nick spoke on the podcast.

“The movie wasn't big, but I think the topic was big. It was just released in like a couple theaters,” he said.

When asked by the podcast host whether he liked the project, he admitted, “I feel like I didn't get to express how I truly felt in it.” He said he had one-third creative control “technically, but one-eighth realistically.” 

The co-host pointed out, “In order to promote the movie, you kind of have to be sober. You kind of have to be a poster boy for recovery. And you didn't wanna be that.”

Nick replied, “I said to them, ‘I'm not in the position to do this. I'm not a quote-unquote sober guy. I'm gonna have to go onto these talk shows.' They said, ‘You've got to do it. They want the whole father-son angle.' I went out there and I realized, ‘Look, I have a voice to some degree. I'm gonna say what I've got to say while I'm here.'”

The host then told Nick, “I'm sure it put you in a really bad spot,” to which he replied, “It did. It was hard. It was uncomfortable. But I felt like it was part of the job. Part of what I had to do.” 

When the “Dopey” host asked Nick if he would get high after his media appearances related to his and his father's film, he replied, “Yeah, I would. I'd smoke a joint on the roof of my apartment. I would not ever go onto these things coked up or anything like that. I'd try to be straight, and use the appearance as my motivation to be straight. Do as best I could on it, and then afterwards, enjoy a joint.” 

Nick said he stayed away from harder substances during at the time, and hadn't done coke “in three to four years.”

Nick said his dad knew he was “getting stoned,” but didn't get angry about it. “He's a hippie,” Nick said, before praising his parents and saying, “They're very understanding.”

“TMZ Investigates: The Reiner Murders: What Really Happened” premiered tonight, January 9, at 8 p.m. on Fox. But if you missed it, don't worry. The special investigation will be available for streaming on Hulu starting tomorrow, Saturday, January 10. 

TMZ announced the special would cover Nick's “mental breakdown” after having his psychiatric medications for schizoaffective disorder rapidly changed.

Kristen Stewart doesn't love the logline to her new movie, “The Chronology of Water,” based on Lidia Yuknavitch's acclaimed memoir: “After an abusive childhood, restless Lidia escapes into competitive swimming, sexual experimentation, toxic relationships, and addiction before finding her voice through writing.”

To Stewart, the summary feels trite. It was never the plot details that drove the actress-turned-filmmaker to spend the better part of a decade adapting Yuknavitch's prose into her feature directorial debut. It was the book's unique form — capturing the reconstruction of a fractured life – that was cinematically inspiring.

 













“The book is just a big, huge permission slip, the keys to the castle to your own volition,” said Stewart while a guest on this week's episode of the Filmmaker Toolkit podcast. “And so the movie needed to be unwieldy, or else it would've been like [in a mockingly preachy voice], ‘You should trust yourself.' It would've been an embarrassing self-help movie.'”

 










One of the things Stewart loved about the way Yuknavitch pieced together the memories of her life was that there was no present tense, allowing for a bold use of editing, as the juxtaposition of Lidia's memories flows like water. It's not an approach that translates to a traditional script, especially one that gets greenlit, even if you are Kristen Stewart. To which Stewart offered this piece of advice, “Don't take notes.” If she had, she “would've never made this movie.”

“I was dissuaded for many, many a year,” said Stewart. “I was convinced that the form of the novel was what was inspiring and not the detailed plot. It feels like a life flashing before your eyes, and it's really difficult to write that down, because the emotional connective tissue, it has to feel so ephemerally connected that it must be discovered.”

That discovery process was one Stewart worked on for eight years, writing 500 drafts of the screenplay – a number she insists is not hyperbole — to unlock how she would capture that emotional connective tissue.

“If you remember [when] you're seven, there are shockingly striking images and feelings that can rush back into your body as if they are present as hell,” said Stewart. “ And so, I am my 7-year-old self right now. I am every person I've ever been, if you let yourself drift into the waters of your physicalized memory, and that's hard to do sometimes – we live in a world that's so exterior, where we're concern about how we present ourselves.”

 










The film is an exercise in tapping into the emotional memory we store in our bodies, and sound became Stewart's most valuable tool for unlocking it. Stewart referred to the sound design, led by supervising sound editor Brent Kiser, as being akin to a “skipping record,” as the film's sonic landscape fluctuates to follow Lidia's backwards-and-forwards journey between self-soothing, self-assurance, self-hatred, and self-laceration.

“Your body emotionally connects,” said Stewart. “And so it just feels like the movie is your memory as it starts to progress, and the sound becomes more complicated.”

It is an unconventional use of sound. While there is some traditional voice-over in the film, the recordings and vocal performances (some more vocalization than voice-over) of Poots vary widely, often within the same scene, and in a way, Stewart said most sound professionals walked away from, as she struggled to find the right post-production collaborators.

“It's the eternal echo of the voices that oppress… until she finds a little bit of light at the end when she learns how to love herself,” said Stewart. “ I wanted anyone watching this movie to be able to have the whole ride with their eyes closed. It's like a haunted house, the whole movie's like an intrusive thought.”

 










Talking about sound is not some nerdy technical thing for Stewart, but rather how she excavated the film's ideas and emotions. She gets so excited talking about sound, she gets excited about making more films.

“I think female voiceover is [something] we are just really lacking, an externalized female perspective. I can't wait to make another movie. I can't wait to do the female ‘Taxi Driver' where we just get like a real solid slew of inner perspective that never stops.”

Reviewed:

January 10, 2026

The spectre of Gothboiclique is haunting underground hip-hop, whether in Asheville street rapper TopOppGen's penchant for grungy guitar arpeggios or FearDorian's interpolations of slowcore classics. Few artists within the new guard of emo-rap torchbearers, however, work to reinvent the sounds forged by Lil Peep and Black Kray like Le Citadell, a vast collective of indie-pop acolytes, plugg producers, and would-be pop-punkers. Much of the group's output draws influence from the tape-worn angst of mid-2010s Bandcamp darlings like Julia Brown and the genre-agnosticism of fifth-wave emo. Survey the results of founding member Swords2's productive 2025 for a summation of their wide-ranging tastes: Over the past year, he's tapped his Rolodex of beatmakers to dabble in folksy, pastoral trap, bleepy emo anthems in the vein of Brave Little Abacus, and a self-produced baroque electroclash offshoot of his own.

While past Swords2 outings tended to zoom in on a specific producer or sound for 15 to 20 minutes, The Long Sleep acts as a sprawling overview of all this experimentation. Indulging his whimsical instincts, the rapper cycles between weird ideas and accessible cuts: If he's not yearning over adorable, MySpace-era electropop on “Everybody Needs Somebody,” he's inviting skramz upstart and Worldpeace DMT affiliate 300SkullsAndCounting to screech over chiptune synths. Holding it all together is Swords2's distinctive vocal delivery, an unpolished wail that recalls both Gothboiclique founder Wicca Phase Springs Eternal and Cap'n Jazz's Tim Kinsella. The latter's taste for puerile subject matter and sing-song melodies plays into Swords2's homage to early-'90s emo. If Cap'n Jazz crooned about “kitty kitty cats” and a young Isaac Brock tearfully stated that “mice eat cheese,” then Swords2 can evoke images of “turtles with missiles” and “kittens with pistols” in earnest.

Swords2's angst goes down easiest coated in a layer of sugary silliness. Take “Panda,” with its screwball Detroit-style beat festooned with squeaky synths and cartoon spring sound effects. There's a winking sense of irony when his tough-guy flexes namedrop millennial basics like Harry Potter and microbreweries, but that irony draws attention to the similar tropiness of traditional emo lyricism: What really cuts through is the raw sentiment, and it's Swords' love for his Le Citadel brethren that transcends cheesiness. Opener “One Thing I Can't Let Go” is the record's most explicit nod to Tumblr-era twee pop, deploying skeletal drum machines and cute melodica to undergird Swords' cracking vocals.

The Long Sleep's few flirtations with a more polished sound have a dreamy appeal, but distract from the eccentricity that fuels its best moments. “Stomping,” featuring Smokedope2016, is a convincing impression of what Lil Peep and Lil Tracy might have made with access to contemporary jerk production, while the jackzebra collab “失望吗” harkens back to the sound of vintage Drain Gang posse cuts. They're decent singles, but they'd slot in better into a separate project. The Long Sleep offers something for everyone who might conceivably hop aboard Le Citadell's bandwagon, including some buzzy features that serve as outreach into adjacent scenes, but the newly converted will find even greater satisfaction in Swords' EP-length releases. Fortunately, there's plenty of those to go around.

Mickey Rourke surrendered a shotgun to authorities this week, according to NBC4 Investigates. The Los Angeles Sheriff's Department said deputies responded to a call Wednesday from one of the actor's team members, who said he wanted to turn in the firearm. 


	The agency said deputies spoke to Rourke and that the actor told them he would be leaving the area and no longer wanted the firearm, which was legally registered to him, and that it would be held by authorities for safekeeping, per the outlet. NBC4 added that the gun will be destroyed if Rourke does not retrieve it after a year.


	A representative for Rourke did not immediately respond to a request for comment.


	The news arrives amid a fundraising fiasco involving Rourke and his manager. Back in December, The Wrestler actor was sued by his landlord, who alleged that Rourke owed nearly $60,000 in rent on his bungalow just south of West Hollywood. After the actor found himself facing eviction, Kimberly Hines, who's been Rourke's manager for over a decade, and her assistant launched a GoFundMe.

	











	Despite more than $90,000 being raised, Rourke shared an Instagram video on Jan. 5 stating that he was not involved with the fundraiser and said, “If I needed money, I wouldn't ask for no fucking charity,” adding, “I'd rather stick a gun up my ass and pull the trigger. So whoever did this, I don't know if they did it — why they did it.”


	Hines later told The Hollywood Reporter that the GoFundMe was not a “grift” and said that the actor was aware of who was behind the effort, while also acknowledging that it was possible Rourke didn't fully understand what a GoFundMe was when she presented the idea to him.  

	











	The manger also shared insight into Rourke's housing situation and said a year-and-a-half ago the residence he had been staying at was purchased by Eric Goldie, who allegedly raised the rent from $5,200 to $7,000. Goldie later sued Rourke for unpaid rent, but Hines claimed that the house was “uninhabitable,” with “black mold” and “no running water.”


	Given Rourke's denouncement of the GoFundMe, Hines told fans that if Rourke didn't want the money, donors would be reimbursed. “He's calling me for money. He's calling friends for money,” claimed Hines. “A GoFund is set up for him, and now he's rejecting it? ‘OK, Mick, no problem.' But nobody here has done anything wrong.”

	In his own comment on the post, Rourke wrote, “Don't give any money its all fake bullshit.”

Timothy Busfield has been accused of child sex abuse according to an arrest warrant issued against The West Wing actor.


	Busfield will face two counts of criminal sexual contact of a minor and one count of child abuse after a New Mexico judge signed off on the arrest warrant. The incidents allegedly occurred on the set of the now-canceled Fox series The Cleaning Lady, where Busfield served as executive producer and director.


	According to the arrest warrant, obtained by KOAT, the investigation into Busfield began in November 2024, when staff at the University of New Mexico Hospital expressed concern that two child actors in The Cleaning Lady were possibly groomed by Busfield, who the children referred to as “Uncle Tim.” The incidents allegedly occurred when the children, identified only by their initials in the arrest warrant, were 7 and 8 years old.


	While the children did not disclose any sexual contact in their initial discussions with hospital staff — only unwanted tickling — subsequent interviews with a social worker reportedly revealed that Busfield inappropriately touched the children's private areas over their clothing, the arrest warrant states.

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	The initial investigation by Albuquerque police did not meet the department's acceptance criteria at the time, and a subsequent investigation by Warner Bros., which produced The Cleaning Lady, could not corroborate the allegations. 


	However, the mother of the two children filed a police report in October 2025, told Child Protective Services that “her children both disclosed that there was sexual abuse by Timothy from around November 2022 to Spring 2024.” One of the children told the therapist that he was “having nightmares about the director touching him and waking up scared” and claimed Busfield “had touched and rubbed his penis 3 or 4 times and appeared to be ashamed.” The child was diagnosed with moderate post-traumatic stress disorder and anxiety.

	











	Busfield was later interviewed by investigators, and told them the accusations were “revenge” for The Cleaning Lady replacing the child actors in the series. “There would never be a weird moment about it. I don't really remember picking those boys up,” Busfield told investigators, per the warrant. “I remember picking up the boy who followed them. I'd pick him up, and he'd be giggling, and that would sort of get him ready to act.”

	Officer Marvin Kirk Brown, who issued the arrest warrant, wrote, “In my training and experience, pedophiles often infiltrate families under a trusted role, like Timothy, who, as a producer, exploited the hectic film sets to tickle and touch SL on his penis and buttocks, masking it as play.”

	Brown continued, “He would invite the family to off-set gatherings, with his wife buying Christmas gifts to foster closeness, making SL feel special and dependent— classic grooming to erode boundaries, isolate the victim, and silence suspicions by blending abuse into normalcy.”


	Busfield has appeared in films like Revenge of the Nerds, Field of Dreams, and Little Big League, and won an Emmy for his role on the drama series Thirtysomething. In 1994, Busfield was accused in a lawsuit of sexual assault by a 17-year-old female extra on the set of Little Big League; the lawsuit was later settled.

	Two more former college basketball players testified Friday to being sexually abused as teens by the multimillionaire coach of New York's esteemed Riverside Church basketball program, echoing the allegations of their boyhood teammate Daryl Powell, who's suing the church in a state Supreme Court civil court trial in Manhattan.


	Former Riverside players Byron Walker and Mitchell Shuler both took the stand on the trial's second day, frequently choking up as they described their experiences with Ernest Lorch, who built the church basketball program into a model for the massive modern youth sports industry — but died in 2012 with a reputation tarnished by abuse allegations.


	Walker described a pair of incidents in which he alleged Lorch forced himself on the player, ostensibly to discipline him. One of the alleged assaults Walker described, detailed in a joint Rolling Stone and Sportico investigation, resulted in a criminal indictment against Lorch in Massachusetts in 2010. (Lorch never stood trial in the case because of his failing health.) On Friday, Walker told the six jurors and three alternates that during halftime of a game in Springfield, Mass., in 1977, Lorch “tried to penetrate me,” ostensibly while punishing him for being late for the team van.

	











	The former player also went into detail about a second allegation during a tournament in Arizona, where, Walker said, Lorch threatened to prevent him from talking to a college recruiter because he broke curfew and was drinking with teammates. After issuing that threat, Walker said on the stand, Lorch forced him to pull down his pants and sexually assaulted him. “There's this back and forth motion,” the former point guard at the University of Texas-El Paso testified, “like I was being raped.”

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	Walker's testimony followed that of Mitchell Shuler, who played on the same late-1970s Riverside elite high-school-age travel teams with Walker and Powell. Shuler, whose play with Riverside helped him gain a scholarship to the University of New Orleans, broke down several times when describing Lorch's use of a paddle to punish him for indiscretions ranging from not working hard in practice to struggling in a high school French class. “I got down on my knees, like a dog, and got hit,” said Shuler, who last year retired as a project manager at Harlem Hospital after a 40-year career. “My bare butt was exposed.”

	Shuler also described being stared at by Lorch while showering and enduring “jockstrap checks” in which the coach groped his testicles.


	Both players were called as witnesses by attorneys for Powell, whose case is the first of 27 lawsuits filed against Riverside to go to trial under New York's 2019 Child Victims Act. He alleges that Riverside was negligent in supervising Lorch over his 40-year run at the head of the basketball program, which ended in 2002 after the first public allegations of abuse by a former player.


	But Shuler and Walker are also suing Riverside, which Riverside attorney Phil Semprevivo pointed out to the jury. Earlier in the day, Powell faced tough questions on cross-examination by Semprevivo, who sought to poke holes in his case against the church — including differences in the plaintiff's trial testimony Thursday and an earlier sworn deposition in the case in 2023.


	For example, Powell testified Thursday that Lorch “stroked” the player's penis as part of jockstrap checks and inserted his finger in Powell's anus. Semprevivo pointed out that Powell never used those terms or descriptions at any point in his earlier deposition.


	He also questioned Powell's stated rationale for quitting basketball completely after a successful junior season at Marist College in 1982. On Thursday, Powell emphasized that he quit Marist with a year left on his full scholarship because he was “fed up” with the sport after his history with Riverside. Semprevivo pointed to other deposition testimony that Powell said he quit school to be with his future wife. Under questioning Friday, Powell said both reasons factored in his decision.

	The former player also said some discrepancies in his testimony were a result of his diminished hearing. But Semprevivo, pointing out several contradictions or inaccuracies on things like dates, said Powell had ample opportunity to correct the deposition record and failed to do so.

	











	One such instance: Powell said in his deposition that he never mentioned being abused by Lorch to any Riverside assistant coaches, including Kenny “Eggman” Williamson, who died in 2012. But in his trial testimony, Powell gave a detailed account of telling Williamson that Lorch was looking down his shorts and paddling him. Powell testified that he remembered it vividly because, he said, he told Williamson on the day of the infamous, riot-plagued 1977 New York City blackout.


	Powell said on Thursday that Williamson told him, “If you know what I know, you better not say anything, or you're not playing for this team anymore.”

	Powell continued: “I was devastated. I shut my mouth up. I wanted to stay on the team.”


	Semprevivo pointed out on Friday that Powell signed a statement in 2024 that corrected some errors in his deposition, but never amended his statement that he'd never said anything to Williamson.

	Legendary Los Angeles rock band Los Lobos is suing over allegedly unpaid royalties tied to soundtrack recordings for the 1987 Richie Valens biopic La Bamba and the 1995 Richard Rodriguez-directed film Desperado.


	In two lawsuits quietly filed late last year and obtained by Rolling Stone, one of which surfaced Friday after being moved to federal court, the Grammy-winning Chicano band accuses Sony Pictures Entertainment and Sony Music Entertainment of breaching their contracts and failing to properly account for worldwide royalties. Los Lobos is seeking damages and a new global accounting, alleging that the unpaid amounts total at least $1.5 million and could reach as much as $2.75 million, or more.


	In the first lawsuit, the band says the La Bamba soundtrack album reached double platinum status, with its rendition of “La Bamba” topping charts in at least 15 countries. Despite the album's commercial success, Los Lobos contends it has never been paid streaming royalties for the recordings outside the United States and Canada. The band says it discovered the “massive deficiency” in the royalty statements last March. According to the filing, unpaid royalties tied to the soundtrack range from $1 million to $2 million, with Sony Pictures Entertainment responsible for the payments.

	











	The second lawsuit, which moved to federal court Friday, alleges that in 1993, Los Lobos agreed to provide several soundtrack songs for Desperado and recorded the song “Canción del Mariachi” with the movie's lead actor, Antonio Banderas. Los Lobos member Cesar Rosas “wrote the composition in its entirety,” the lawsuit states.

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	In 2004, the independent record company Milan Entertainment released a compilation album entitled Robert Rodriguez's Mexico and Mariachis that included the song with liner notes that said it was included “courtesy of Columbia Pictures,” the lawsuit says. In 2018, Milan allegedly released the song again on Spotify and YouTube with the shortened title “Mexico and Mariachis.” That release purportedly garnered 150 million streams on Spotify and another 150 million streams on YouTube, the lawsuit claims.

	According to the complaint, interest in the song has skyrocketed in recent years after popular UFC fighter Ilia “El Matador” Topuria adopted it as his “walkout” song and “anthem.” Topuria's popularity purportedly caused the song to be used in TV programming in many countries, the lawsuit claims.


	Still, “despite all of these millions of streams of the recording worldwide, the various uses by Topuria, and his endorsement and involvement, there has never been a single royalty statement rendered by Sony to Los Lobos that reports any streaming of the recording, as used in the 2018 Milan Streaming Release, or any licensing activity,” the band alleges. It calls the lack of accounting “egregious.”


	In 2019, Sony Music Masterworks purchased Milan. Both companies were “well aware of the value of Topuria's endorsement” of the song because they allegedly changed the title of the recording on Spotify to “Canción del Mariachi (Ilia Topuria ‘El Matador' Anthem),” the lawsuit claims.

	Los Lobos says worldwide streams of the song have topped 600 million, and based on the band's contract, its revenue share of those streams would be $500,000 to $750,000. It's asking the court for a chance to determine the precise amount through discovery and, if necessary, a trial. The band also wants a 24 percent cut of net revenues collected from any licensing deals related to the song.


	Lawyers on both sides did not respond to a request for comment. Los Lobos, which was formed in East Los Angeles in 1973, has been nominated for 12 Grammy Awards and won four.

A new kind of circus is captivating audiences in Fort Myers, promising a blend of horror, comedy, and classic circus acts. 





A new kind of circus is captivating audiences in Fort Myers, promising a blend of horror, comedy, and classic circus acts. Paranormal Cirque II has arrived at JetBlue Park, offering a unique experience that combines laughter with chills.

""Fear and comedy, horror and comedy have a lot in common,"" said Steve Copeland, the host and comedian of Paranormal Cirque II. ""They're both about the build-up of tension and then the release. With horror, it's a scream. With comedy, it's a laugh. So they go together very well.""

Sophia Marks, a ticketholder, shared her excitement. ""Last night, we found out that it was paranormal, so now we're, like, freaking out, but I'm kind of excited,"" she said.

Another ticketholder expressed enthusiasm about the show. ""Paranormal means it's not normal, so it'll be cool. My girlfriend came a week ago, so she said it was really good,"" they said, adding, ""No, you can't scare me.""

""This is our show's first time in Fort Myers,"" said Copeland. ""They're going to scare the heck out of you, and then they're going to amaze you during our show.""

Stacy Brucci, another audience member, shared her curiosity. ""I can't imagine Cirque du Soleil with all the horror. So it's gonna be interesting,"" she said.

Copeland explained the show's appeal, saying, ""There's a little bit of everything. Here's a little bit of something for everyone. It's scary, it's sexy, it's funny, and that's paranormal Cirque.""

He also reflected on the joy of entertaining. ""I get to make people laugh and forget about all the terrible things going on in the world. They can come enjoy some controlled fun horror, and I get to laugh and make them forget their problems for a couple of hours,"" said Copeland.

Paranormal Cirque II will be at JetBlue Park in Fort Myers through Monday.

Tickets are available online at paranormalcirque.com or at the box office. The show is open to adults, with teens ages 13 to 17 allowed, but children under 13 are not permitted.

Maybe the aliens are talking, we're just looking right past it.


	By Ashley Fike

For as long as we've been exploring space, the search for alien intelligence has followed a familiar script. We point antennas at the sky. We listen for radio signals. We scan for massive structures that look like something humans would build if we had unlimited resources and no zoning laws.

A new paper suggests that approach might be missing something obvious.

Researchers say advanced alien civilizations could be communicating in plain sight. Their idea involves rhythmic flashes of light, similar to how fireflies signal on Earth. These wouldn't be messages meant to decode line by line. They'd work more like a long-term signal that says, “we're here.” 

The proposal comes from a study uploaded to the preprint server arXiv. It hasn't been peer reviewed yet and is under consideration for publication in PNAS.

The problem, according to the researchers, is that most alien-hunting strategies are deeply human. The Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence, or SETI, has historically focused on radio signals or excess heat from hypothetical megastructures like Dyson spheres. That logic assumes other civilizations communicate the way we once did. It leaves little room for intelligence that evolved along a different path.

Scientists call this an anthropocentric bias. In plain terms, we keep looking for versions of ourselves.

On Earth, fireflies rely on repeating flashes to communicate. Those flashes come from internal chemical reactions. They look simple, but they're specific enough for different species to recognize one another. The researchers think an advanced civilization could take a similar approach. Instead of conversations, they'd send patterned light signals meant to persist across space.

To explore what that might resemble, the team analyzed light patterns from more than 150 pulsars. Pulsars are rapidly spinning neutron stars that emit highly regular beams of electromagnetic radiation. The researchers found no evidence of artificial signals, but they did notice similarities between pulsar rhythms and biological signaling patterns like those seen in fireflies. They also proposed methods future searches could use to better distinguish natural pulses from potential artificial ones.

Another reason these signals might be easy to miss comes down to technological evolution. The paper points out that advanced civilizations may move away from loud, widespread radio communication over time. Earth is already doing this. As our technology becomes more targeted and efficient, our planet appears less noisy from a distance.

Estelle Janin, a doctoral candidate at Arizona State University and co-author of the study, framed the idea as an invitation rather than a claim. “Communication is a fundamental feature of life across lineages and manifests in a wonderful diversity of forms and strategies,” she told Universe Today. Janin described the work as “a provoking thought-experiment” meant to encourage SETI researchers to draw from animal communication science.

No one is saying aliens are blinking at us from deep space. The point is simpler. If intelligence doesn't look human, there's no reason its signals would either. We might not be missing alien civilizations because they're hiding. We might be missing them because we've been listening for the wrong thing.

Astronomers looking at data from the JWST, humanity's most powerful space telescope, have found a number of objects in the distant universe so odd that they have been dubbed ""platypus galaxies"".

JWST has allowed astronomers to look back further into the past than any other infrared or optical telescope, seeing infrared light that was emitted by distant galaxies just 280 million years after the Big Bang. With the infrared telescope, we were hoping to learn more about the formation of galaxies, as well as clear up mysteries about how supermassive black holes became so large. But we have been thrown a few surprises as we look further back into the past.

One such surprise is the tiny, bright red points of light that appear to be dotted throughout the early universe, around 600-800 million years after its birth, which have come to be known as Little Red Dot (LRD) galaxies. When they were first detected and analyzed, astronomers believed they could be massive galaxies. But this was at odds with how cosmological models expect galaxies to form – as small clouds of dust and stars that grow larger over long periods of time. 

The new team of astronomers from the University of Missouri was not interested in LRDs themselves, but their appearance in the JWST data got them thinking.

""It was the fact that a significant fraction of LRDs being point-like in the high-resolution JWST images inspired a simple question that we intended to address: are there any other new kinds of objects among point-like sources that we did not notice previously?"" the team explains in their study, which has not yet been peer reviewed.

The team looked at 2,000 sources found in JWST surveys, whittling them down and identifying nine point-like sources in the early universe, 12 to 12.6 billion years in our past. Looking at these objects, which emitted their light when the universe was just over a billion years old, the team found they didn't fit neatly into any known category of space object.

""It seems that we've identified a population of galaxies that we can't categorize, they are so odd. On the one hand they are extremely tiny and compact, like a point source, yet we do not see the characteristics of a quasar, an active supermassive black hole, which is what most distant point sources are,” principal investigator Haojing Yan said in a NASA press release.

""I looked at these characteristics and thought, this is like looking at a platypus. You think that these things should not exist together, but there it is right in front of you, and it's undeniable.""

Spectral emission lines from quasars generally look like broad hills, which is the result of high velocity gas swirling around the supermassive black hole at the center. These ""platypus"" objects are point-like, like quasars, but their spectral emission lines look sharp and jagged.

The team compared the sources to another class of galaxies, but there were key differences here too.

""The closest resemblances to our objects are probably the so-called 'green pea' galaxies (GPs). GPs are compact galaxies at low redshifts (z ≲ 0.4) that have extremely strong emission lines, which make them green in the color composite of optical images,"" the team explained in their paper.

These galaxies have been found to have star-forming regions and active galactic nuclei.

""However, there are still notable differences that distinguish our objects from GPs,"" the team continues. ""The most obvious one is that our objects are point-like but GPs are not. While GPs appear to be unresolved in ground-based images, those that have HST images all show that the GP regions are embedded in extended hosts, which often have complex morphologies indicative of mergers.""

   

At the moment the team believes that the observations are consistent with seeing young galaxies ∼110–170 million years old. If that is the case, we could be looking at very early galaxy formation.

“I think this new research is presenting us with the question, how does the process of galaxy formation first begin?"" Yan added. ""Can such small, building-block galaxies be formed in a quiet way, before chaotic mergers begin, as their point-like appearance suggests?” 

""If they are confirmed to be SF [star-forming] galaxies, they likewise will constitute a new kind because of their pointlike morphologies and young ages, which will imply that they began their star formation secularly (and in isolation) from a very compact core, which is in line with a monolithic collapse,"" the team added in their paper.

More observations are needed to determine what these objects are, before we get too excited about seeing how galaxies begin. But, if confirmed, it is pretty exciting.

""If these objects are really a new type of galaxy, it tells us we've been missing part of the story,” Bangzheng ""Tom"" Sun, a graduate student in Yan's lab and co-author of the study, added in a separate statement. “And we're just beginning to uncover it.""

The paper is posted to preprint server arXiv, and was presented in a press conference at the 247th meeting of the American Astronomical Society in Phoenix, Arizona.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=Conspiracy+Theories","Eddie Hobbs: From consumer advice to conspiracy theories","https://www.irishtimes.com/politics/2026/01/10/eddie-hobbs-from-consumer-advocate-to-right-wing-conspiracy-theories/","Sat, 10 Jan 2026 06:01:42 GMT","

Twenty years ago, at the height of his fame, Eddie Hobbs could barely walk down the street in Ireland.

In a 2022 podcast, the financial adviser recalled how people would pull up beside him at red lights and ask, jokingly, “fixed or tracker?”. 

“People wouldn't even say hello. They'd just launch into whatever question they had.”

It was hard to avoid Hobbs in the mid-to-late 2000s. He had just finished Rip-off Republic – a four-part RTÉ show skewering the high cost of living in Ireland – which broke viewership records and set news agendas. He was rarely off the radio and published his own magazine, You & Your Money, featuring on the cover most weeks.

He published books, wrote financial advice columns for several newspapers and was the subject of a song by Dustin the Turkey.

His criticism of government financial policy earned him the ire of taoiseach Bertie Ahern, who accused him of not being factual, while opposition TDs praised his “brilliant forensic analysis”.

All of this is a distant memory. Today, Hobbs is rarely seen in the mainstream media or mentioned in the Dáil. His books do not trouble the bestseller lists and his magazine is long out of print.

However, the Corkman is as active as always, just in a different sphere. He regularly features on podcasts, including his own show Counterpoint, and frequently speaks at public events.

He also continues to bring out books, although with smaller publishers. His latest release is published by 104 Publishing which, on its website, tells prospective authors they must pay for a €300 course before they will be considered as a client.

Financial advice of the type that made him famous rarely features in Hobbs's output these days. Instead, he promotes a range of right-wing conspiracy theories regarding world banking, climate change and, in particular, Covid-19.

This pivot has generated a smaller, but loyal following for Hobbs in Ireland. It has also dramatically increased his profile overseas. 

He regularly appears on popular conspiracy theory-focused podcasts with large international audiences. He talks about a globalist takeover of Ireland and vents his spleen over a media system he says is entirely beholden to Government.

High-profile appearances included repeat guest spots last year on War Room, the show hosted by former White House strategist Steve Bannon which regularly features near the top of US podcasts charts.

“The mainstream media is the North Korea of Europe,” Hobbs told Bannon when he appeared on his show last June and was asked to explain why there is no major populist right-wing movement in Ireland. 

Barely pausing for breath, he then listed off a list of grievances about the Lisbon Treaty, the financial crash and immigration, including many dubious or contested claims, while also accusing the Irish Government of “high treason”.

Over the course of six minutes, before Bannon interrupted to go to commercial, Hobbs complained about gender ideology, hate speech laws and what he claimed was a move by the World Health Organisation (WHO) to take over the entirety of Ireland's health policy. 

What led Hobbs down the road from celebrity financial guru to conspiracy theorist? This week he declined to sit down for an interview, instead pointing towards his recent writings and podcasts on the issue.

“I don't need to give The Irish Times an interview, for me it is not important,” he said by email.

Hobbs is no stranger to controversy and criticism, including during his time as a celebrity financial adviser. Though his financial predictions were often accurate, they could also be badly wrong.

On one of his RTÉ shows, two years before the 2008 financial crisis, he advised people to buy as much property as possible. In 2012, in a piece in the Wall Street Journal, he predicted there would be no “Celtic comeback” for the Irish economy shortly before the country experienced just that.

In 2006, he helped convince 1,200 Irish investors to buy holiday apartments on the island of Cape Verde off West Africa through a development which later became mired in legal issues.

It was Hobbs's role in another investment company, Brendan Investments, which likely caused the most damage to his reputation. Starting in 2006, he cofounded and heavily promoted the company's fund, convincing many ordinary investors to put money into speculative property investments.

After raising €13 million, the fund invested in the abandoned-homes market in Detroit despite warnings about the risk of such a move. Almost all of the money was lost, including €600,000 invested by Hobbs.

In 2015, he quit as director of the company at the same time he cofounded a new political party, Renua. He said he did this to avoid the company becoming a target for rival politicians and the press.

Hobbs's involvement with Renua gives an early insight into political views which were markedly different from the ones he espouses today.

At the time, the party billed itself as a right-of-centre, common-sense party in the mould of the defunct Progressive Democrats.

Hobbs served as Renua president, although after much vacillation, declined to run for the Dáil. During that time, he tried to steer the party “from social conservatism to a liberal democrat ethos”, he recalled in a 2022 podcast interview with the comedian Mario Rosenstock. 

Renua, he said, was founded by “social conservatives of the hard type”, who only cared about abortion. 

He attributed the party's demise to this cohort. After failing to return a single TD, Hobbs quit in June 2016 and Renua faded into obscurity.

Whether it was due to the controversy surrounding Brendan Investments or his failed political career, by the late 2010s, Hobbs was becoming less of a feature in the media, although he still gave interviews every now and then and wrote the occasional advice column.

Then, Covid-19 came. Hobbs began to express conspiratorial views regarding the virus, lockdowns and vaccinations. In 2021, he suggested on social media that  Star of David badges – used to label Jewish people in Nazi Germany – be used to “identify the unvaccinated among us”.

The tweet drew widespread criticism, including from the Auschwitz Memorial Museum. Hobbs deleted his tweet but brushed off calls to apologise and said he was being sarcastic to make a point.

“God help anyone who tries to cancel me. I can't be cancelled,” he remarked to Rosenstock the following year. “I put the run on them and within 24 hours they're off running at some other target.”

Hobbs's adoption of Covid-19 related conspiracy theories was a gradual one. In that same 2022 interview, after being highly critical of lockdowns, the WHO and antigen testing, he concluded by saying he does not believe there is any “global conspiracy” regarding the pandemic.

By 2025, his views had evolved. “We went through a massive psychological event globally that was premeditated and organised by the security state and all of those countries and it was clearly co-ordinated,” he said during a video interview with the Roscommon People, amid diatribes about the Rothschilds, the Bilderberg Group and the Soros Foundation.

It is very challenging to accept that you've been duped; I get that fully because I fought against it for nearly four years

Hobbs's 2024 book, Breaking the Silence, provides some insight into this journey.

“Each evening in the spring of 2020, along with millions of fellow Irish citizens, I too sat down to listen to reports from breathless RTÉ journalists emerging from the latest Covid updates,” he wrote. 

“Sleep wasn't coming easy, but I couldn't explain why. I now know that I had free-floating anxiety, a general sense of unease without any identifiable targets. Eventually, I stopped engaging with mainstream media altogether. That helped considerably.”

Hobbs said he redirected his energy into running his firm and writing his self-published novel, a work of historical fiction in the style of Dan Brown, about a secret which could “destroy the foundation of the Roman Church and the secular power structures of Europe”.

“It is very challenging to accept that you've been duped; I get that fully because I fought against it for nearly four years. I contested what my research, discussions and experiences laid out as the truth insofar as I could discern it, the truth of the big lie.”

These days, Hobbs's main activity is presenting his Counterpoint podcast, during which he interviews various figures, some from Ireland's populist milieu including Dublin city councillor Malachy Steenson, activist and conspiracy theorist Ben Gilroy and Cork anti-immigration campaigner Derek Blighe.

Other guests include Independent Ireland TD Ken O'Flynn and former Master of the High Court Edmund Honohan. 

Last October, activist Keith O'Brien, who goes by the name Keith Woods, appeared on the show where his work was effusively praised by Hobbs. O'Brien is a frequent collaborator with US neo-Nazis and previously described himself as a “raging anti-Semite” (he later claimed he was joking).

Hobbs's most recent guest on the podcast was former Irish Times columnist Kevin Myers. They spoke about “cancel culture, media bias and free speech.”

During one of his interviews with Hobbs last year, Steve Bannon outlined his plans to start an Irish version of his War Room podcast. Last week, in an interview with Politico, Bannon said he is “spending a tonne of time behind the scenes on the Irish situation to help form an Irish national party.

“They're going to have an Irish Maga, and we're going to have an Irish Trump. That's all going to come together, no doubt. That country is right on the edge thanks to mass migration.”

Could Hobbs be Bannon's “Irish Trump”? The “nascent” political right is still “atomised”, Hobbs said via email, and he has little interest in being its leader.

“I've zero intention to get involved in Irish politics right or left, sticking to the media side only and have made that public many times.”

A recurring conspiracy theory which has gone viral claims that an ancient Greek statue supposedly depicting a woman “using a laptop” is “proof” of time travel. The statue once marked a grave and was created around 100 BC.

Many inventions beyond their time are associated with the ancient Greek civilization, but the laptop was certainly not one of them…until now.

Of course, historians have dismissed the theory as nonsense and provided more grounded explanations, suggesting that the object in the statue may be a box or wax tablet.

The statue that spurred on the conspiracy theory is called the “Grave Naiskos Of An Enthroned Woman With An Attendant” and is on display at the J. Paul Getty Museum in Malibu, California.

The ancient Greek statue portrays a seated woman with a slave standing in front of her, holding a slim folding container. The woman, who appears to be the mistress, touches the top of the container with her fingers while looking up towards the upper part of it with her stone eyes.

However, various conspiracy theorists believe that the container depicted is actually a laptop, complete with USB ports on the side of the device.

In one viral YouTube video, an uploader claims that the ancient Greek statue “depicts an astonishing object that bears a striking resemblance to a modern laptop or some handheld device”.

“When I look at the sculpture I can't help but think about the Oracle of Delphi, which was supposed to allow the priests to connect with the gods to retrieve advanced information,” continued the video's upload.

They dismissed more feasible explanations, arguing that the container's base is too shallow to be a jewellry box.

This is not the first time the conspiracy theory has popped up. In 2016, the Daily Mail published an article questioning whether the funerary statue was indeed proof that a time traveler had brought back a laptop to ancient Greece.

Back in 2016, archaeologist Kristina Killgrove wrote in Forbes debunking the theory that the ancient Greeks had somehow come across advanced computer technology.

“It's a typical funeral marker, depicting the deceased individual in a vibrant way, often, in the case of women, in a household scene,” explained Killgrove. “These stelai were carved in relief, and were almost always painted, although the painting doesn't survive in most cases.”

“In this stele, a woman reclines on a chair and reaches to touch the lid of an object that is held by a girl whose hairstyle and clothes indicate she is a slave. This is a rather typical trope in funeral stelai, the image of a wealthy adult woman reaching to a servant, and may have reflected her family's desire for her to retain her status into the afterlife,” continued Killgrove.

Killgrove suggested a variety of more tangible explanations for what the object held by the woman in the statue may have been, including a wax tablet or some kind of jewellery box or other container.

Rather than being USB ports, the holes on the side of the container may have originally been used to hold wooden items that have long since rotted away.

It is also possible that the holes were made during efforts to rework or copy the sculpture. Other parts of the stele are missing, so this is certainly a plausible explanation.

Astronomers spotted nine galaxies with characteristics that have never been seen as a collection before. It's possible this is a newly found type of star-forming galaxy.

A new category of space objects dubbed ""platypus galaxies"" is defying explanation.

These nine strange cosmic objects, spotted in archival data from the James Webb Space Telescope, cannot easily be characterized by their features. They are small and compact, but they don't appear to host active supermassive black holes or to be quasars, enormous black holes that glow as brightly as galaxies, according to new research.

Researchers have dubbed the cosmic oddballs ""platypus galaxies"" because, like platypuses — rare egg-laying mammals — they are difficult to classify, Haojing Yan, an astronomer at the University of Missouri who led the team, said when presenting the findings at the 247th meeting of the American Astronomical Society in Phoenix this week.

""The detailed genetic code of a platypus provides additional information that shows just how unusual the animal is, sharing genetic features with birds, reptiles, and mammals,"" Yan said in a statement describing the research, which is available as a preprint via arXiv. ""Together, Webb's imaging and spectra are telling us that these galaxies have an unexpected combination of features.""

Looking at this collection of galaxy characteristics, he added, is like looking at a platypus. ""You think that these things should not exist together, but there it is right in front of you, and it's undeniable,"" he said.

For example, typical quasars — which are extremely luminous and energetic objects — have emission lines in their spectra that look a bit like hills. The spectra also indicate that gas is circulating quickly around a supermassive black hole in the center.

Yet the nine newfound galaxies have narrow and sharp spectra, signaling that the gas is moving more slowly. Although some galaxies with narrow and sharp spectra have supermassive black holes in their centers, unlike that group, the new galaxies don't look like ""points"" in the images.

So if the mysterious objects aren't quasars and they don't host supermassive black holes, what are they? One possibility is that they represent a newly found type of star-forming galaxy that populated the early universe, which JWST is optimized to see.

But even that possibility is confusing the team, co-investigator Bangzheng Sun, a graduate student at the University of Missouri, said in the same statement.

""From the low-resolution spectra we have, we can't rule out the possibility that these nine objects are star-forming galaxies,"" Sun said. ""That data fits. The strange thing in that case is that the galaxies are so tiny and compact, even though Webb has the resolving power to show us a lot of detail at this distance.""

If that's the case, it may be that JWST is looking at a type of even earlier galaxies than have ever been spotted. If that is indeed what JWST is seeing, Yan said, perhaps there is more to learn about how galaxies evolved.

—'How can all of this be happening?': Scientists spot massive group of ancient galaxies so hot they shouldn't exist

—James Webb telescope finds that galaxies in the early universe were much more chaotic than we thought

—'Puzzling' object discovered by James Webb telescope may be the earliest known galaxy in the universe

""I think this new research is presenting us with the question, how does the process of galaxy formation first begin?"" Yan said. ""Can such small, building-block galaxies be formed in a quiet way, before chaotic mergers begin, as their point-like appearance suggests?""

The team said they will need more galactic samples to further the research. Luckily, JWST is still early in its observing lifetime. The telescope launched in 2021 and is expected to last at least another 15 years in its deep-space position, gazing at faraway objects in the early universe.

David Grusch vs. James Clapper: The Disclosure Line Just Broke



Why Grusch's Megyn Kelly Interview May Be the Most Explosive Admission in Modern UAP History



Grusch crossed a line that hadn't been crossed before. Ross Coulthart reacted to David Grusch's interview with Megyn Kelly, where Grusch, a former intelligence officer directly named a former Director of National Intelligence as someone who managed a UAP crash retrieval program.



      As Ross points out, in ""The Age of Disclosure"", James Clapper appeared to acknowledge awareness of a program that tracked UAPs. At the time, that felt significant but vague. What Grusch has now done is remove the ambiguity. According to him, Clapper wasn't just aware of crash retrievals, he actually managed them. While serving as DNI, he placed people into critical roles to control how the issue was handled, both publicly and through channels that were not public at all.
    


      If Clapper managed a crash retrieval program, then the idea that senior intelligence figures ""didn't really know"" falls apart. Silence all of s sudden looks less like uncertainty and more like policy. It also forces a harder question about just how many other officials who now speak publicly about UAPs once had operational roles inside the same legacy program?
    


      Grusch didn't stop with Clapper. He also referenced Stephanie O'Sullivan and others who were present in rooms where this issue was discussed and managed. This reveals a structured program, overseen, and staffed at the highest levels.
    


      Personally I think at this point, the debate has changed. We are no longer arguing about whether programs existed or parsing blurry footage. We're dealing with named individuals and specific roles. That's a different phase of disclosure entirely. For the first time ever, accountability has been placed squarely in view.
    


This wasn't a slip of the tongue or careless phrasing by Grusch. It was deliberate, measured, and put on the public record for a reason. Now its up to us to put the pressure on.

      When it comes to the most convincing UFO sightings ever reported, Redditors have shared a variety of cases that stand out for their credibility, multiple witnesses, and corroborating evidence. Here are some of the most frequently mentioned and compelling incidents:
    


Description: Over 60 children at the Ariel School in Zimbabwe witnessed a craft landing in their schoolyard and a few beings coming out. The incident was investigated by a well-known psychologist, and a documentary on YouTube provides detailed accounts.
    


Quotes: ""The Ariel school incident in Africa is my favourite. Surprised it hasn't been mentioned. 60 plus children apparently witnessed a craft landing in the schoolyard and a few beings came out. It was investigated by a well known psychologist, you can find a documentary on YouTube so go check it out!""



Description: A Japanese cargo pilot and his crew reported a multi-hour encounter with a UFO over Alaska, which was also tracked by ground radar. The pilot's career was significantly impacted by his decision to speak out about the incident.
    


Quotes: ""Japan Air Lines flight 1628 incident & Belgian UFO wave"", ""JAL Flight 1628... The pilot was put on desk duty for speaking on this too, and for me it's hard to imagine a professional Japanese man to outright make this shit up.""



Description: Military personnel at RAF Woodbridge and Bentwaters in England reported multiple UFO sightings over several nights, including a craft that landed in Rendlesham Forest. The incident involved radar tracking and direct eyewitness accounts from highly trained individuals.
    


Quotes: ""Rendelsham Forest or Shag Harbour. When it comes to Rendelsham, I am confident in thinking a crew of military men as they were would not have mistaken a light house for a UFO."", ""Imo, the most convincing UFO event was the Rendlesham Forest incident.""



Description: Thousands of people across Arizona, including the governor at the time, reported seeing a massive V-shaped formation of lights moving silently across the sky. The event was well-documented with numerous eyewitness accounts and video footage.
    


Quotes: ""phoenix 97"", ""Phoenix lights...""



Description: US Navy pilots from the USS Nimitz carrier strike group encountered a highly advanced, tic-tac-shaped object that performed impossible maneuvers. The incident was captured on FLIR video and corroborated by multiple pilots and radar operators.
    


Quotes: ""For me, it's the eyewitness testimony of David Fraver, the fighter pilot who described his interactions with the 'tic tac' ufo off the coast of California during his training runs."", ""If I were to try and convince a sceptic, the 2004 Nimitz encounter.""



Description: Iranian Air Force pilots were scrambled to intercept a UFO that was tracked on radar and caused instrumentation and communications failures on their aircraft. The incident was also recorded by a military spy satellite.
    


Quotes: ""1976 Tehran UFO incident: Nothing beats this one. Military personals, radars and civilian plane encountered the UFO.""



Description: Several residents of Varginha, Brazil, reported seeing a malfunctioning ship and multiple creatures, which were allegedly captured by the army. The case is supported by numerous eyewitness accounts and a documentary.
    


Quotes: ""Finally in the 90's what appeared to be a malfunctioning ship was sighted near Varginha, MG. Over the next days the army showed up there in large numbers, several creatures were sighted around town.""



Description: A security guard in Kumburgaz, Turkey, recorded multiple videos of a UFO over several nights. The footage was investigated and determined to be authentic by a Turkish scientific agency.
    


Quotes: ""As a Turkish person I experienced this when it happened, Turkish TV didn't give a damn, it was on news for 1 evening and thats it, it was investigated thoroughly and was determined authentic by TÜBİTAK.""



Battle of Los Angeles (1942): The military used anti-aircraft weapons against a perceived threat that was later dismissed as a weather balloon. ""The Battle of Los Angeles where the military had to resort to using AA weapons against a 'weather balloon'.""



Chicago O'Hare UFO (2006): A UFO was sighted by multiple airline employees and passengers at O'Hare International Airport, but all evidence reportedly disappeared. ""I heard the Chicago O'Hare ufo was pretty legit but all the evidence disappeared.""

 Protests sweeping across Iran neared the two-week mark Saturday, with the country's government acknowledging the ongoing demonstrations despite an intensifying crackdown and as the Islamic Republic remains cut off from the rest of the world.

With the internet down in Iran and phone lines cut off, gauging the demonstrations from abroad has grown more difficult. But the death toll in the protests has grown to at least 72 people killed, with over 2,300 others detained, according to the U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency. Iranian state TV is reporting on security force casualties while portraying control over the nation.

Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has signaled a coming clampdown, despite U.S. warnings. Tehran escalated its threats Saturday, with the Iran's attorney general, Mohammad Movahedi Azad, warning that anyone taking part in protests will be considered an “enemy of God,” a death-penalty charge. The statement carried by Iranian state television said even those who “helped rioters” would face the charge.

“Prosecutors must carefully and without delay, by issuing indictments, prepare the grounds for the trial and decisive confrontation with those who, by betraying the nation and creating insecurity, seek foreign domination over the country,” the statement read. “Proceedings must be conducted without leniency, compassion or indulgence.”

Iran's Revolutionary Guards warned on Saturday that safeguarding security was a 'red line' and the military vowed to protect public property, as the clerical establishment stepped up efforts to quell the most widespread protests in years.

Reuters

U.S. President Donald Trump offered support for the protesters, saying on social media that “Iran is looking at FREEDOM, perhaps like never before. The USA stands ready to help!!!”

U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio offered support for the protesters.

“The United States supports the brave people of Iran,” Rubio wrote Saturday on the social platform X. The State Department separately warned: “Do not play games with President Trump. When he says he'll do something, he means it.”

Saturday marks the start of the work week in Iran, but many schools and universities reportedly held online classes, Iranian state TV reported. Internal Iranian government websites are believed to be functioning.

State TV repeatedly played a driving, martial orchestral arrangement from the “Epic of Khorramshahr” by Iranian composer Majid Entezami, while showing pro-government demonstrations. The song, aired repeatedly during the 12-day war launched by Israel, honors Iran's 1982 liberation of the city of Khorramshahr during the Iran-Iraq war. It has been used in videos of protesting women cutting away their hair to protest the 2022 death of Mahsa Amini as well.

“Field reports indicate that peace prevailed in most cities of the country at night,” a state TV anchor reported. “After a number of armed terrorists attacked public places and set fire to people's private property last night, there was no news of any gathering or chaos in Tehran and most provinces last night.”

A timeline of the protests in Iran and how they grew

That was directly contradicted by an online video verified by The Associated Press that showed demonstrations in northern Tehran's Saadat Abad area, with what appeared to be thousands on the street.

“Death to Khamenei!” a man chanted.

The semiofficial Fars news agency, believed to be close to Iran's paramilitary Revolutionary Guard and one of the few media outlets able to publish to the outside world, released surveillance camera footage of what it said came from demonstrations in Isfahan. In it, a protester appeared to fire a long gun, while others set fires and threw gasoline bombs at what appeared to be a government compound.

The Young Journalists' Club, associated with state TV, reported that protesters killed three members of the Guard's all-volunteer Basij force in the city of Gachsaran. It also reported a security official was stabbed to death in Hamadan province, a police officer killed in the port city of Bandar Abbas and another in Gilan, as well as one person slain in Mashhad.

State television also aired footage of a funeral service attended by hundreds in Qom, a Shiite seminary city just south of Tehran.

Iran's theocracy cut off the nation from the internet and international telephone calls on Thursday, though it allowed some state-owned and semiofficial media to publish. Qatar's state-funded Al Jazeera news network reported live from Iran, but they appeared to be the only major foreign outlet able to work.

Iran's exiled former crown prince Reza Pahlavi, who called for protests Thursday and Friday, asked in his latest message for demonstrators to take to the streets Saturday and Sunday. He urged protesters to carry Iran's old lion-and-sun flag and other national symbols used during the time of the shah to “claim public spaces as your own.”

Who is Reza Pahlavi, the exiled former Iranian crown prince calling on citizens to protest?

Pahlavi's support of and from Israel has drawn criticism in the past — particularly after the 12-day war. Demonstrators have shouted in support of the shah in some protests, but it isn't clear whether that's support for Pahlavi himself or a desire to return to a time before the 1979 Islamic Revolution.

The demonstrations began Dec. 28 over the collapse of the Iranian rial currency, which trades at over 1.4 million to $1, as the country's economy is squeezed by international sanctions in part levied over its nuclear program. The protests intensified and grew into calls directly challenging Iran's theocracy.

Airlines have cancelled some flights into Iran over the demonstrations. Austrian Airlines said Saturday it had decided to suspend its flights to Iran “as a precautionary measure” through Monday. Turkish Airlines earlier announced the cancellation of 17 flights to three cities in Iran.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:dw.com","Germany news: Snowstorm moves south after blanketing north","https://www.dw.com/en/germany-news-snowstorm-moves-south-after-blanketing-north/live-75458964","Sat, 10 Jan 2026 13:46:14 GMT","

The snowy weather is heading south after causing severe disruption in the north. Meanwhile, several rallies are to take place in Germany's capital, Berlin, in support of anti-government protests in Iran. DW has more.

This is a roundup of the top news stories from and about Germany on Saturday, January 10, 2026:

Winter storm ""Elli"" has continued to disrupt large parts of Germany, with rail travel still heavily affected in the north and more severe weather looming.

Services in the north were suspended on Friday amid heavy snowfall, are set to continue to see disruptions until Sunday, a spokeswoman for operator Deutsche Bahn told the DPA news agency. Key links such as the Hamburg-Hanover-Frankfurt and Berlin-Hanover-Düsseldorf lines remain affected, she said.

Other long-distance services to destinations outside Germany also remained suspended, including connections from northern Germany to Copenhagen and Amsterdam.

Regional rail services have also been restarting only gradually, after many trains and buses were temporarily halted.

Snowdrifts have caused particular problems in the north, where numerous accidents were reported at the start of the weekend, with similar conditions in eastern regions.

Attention has now shifted south, where the weather system is moving, bringing heavy snowfall to central and southern Germany.

The German Weather Service has forecast 20 to 30 centimeters (up to a foot) of fresh snow in the Black Forest and the Allgäu region by late night, with up to 50 centimeters possible at higher elevations.

Winter sports operators have welcomed the conditions, with ski areas reporting strong turnout.

More large-scale power outages such as the recent five-day blackout in Berlin could easily affect other large cities across Germany unless there is a drastic improvement in the government's crisis response, the dbb civil servants union warned on Saturday.

""Berlin has shown that we are not prepared for crises of this kind. It's a disaster,"" union chairman Volker Geyer told the Rheinische Post newspaper.

""What happened in Berlin could happen anywhere else at any time — in Cologne, Stuttgart or Munich. The state must not allow itself to be made to look so foolish,"" he said.

He said the privatization of critical infrastructure had left the state helpless in such cases as the outage in Berlin, which was caused by an arson attack by suspected left-wing extremists on a bridge carrying cables over the Teltow Canal.

Among other things, Geyer called for an urgent review of the control mechanisms and legal requirements pertaining to the operators of critical infrastructure.

The dbb is Germany's largest union for public servants and employees in related private sectors, with more than 1.2 million members.

The power outage in Berlin initially left 100,000 people without electricity, heating, internet and mobile phone services amid freezing temperatures.

The blackout lasted from Saturday to Wednesday, when power was completely restored.

Politicians from both coalition partners in Germany's government have come out in favor of higher prices for alcohol to help reduce excessive consumption.

The remarks by health affairs spokespeople from the parliamentary parties of Christian Democrats (CDU) and the Social Democrats (SPD) come after figures released by the German Federal Statistical Office showed that alcoholic beverages in Germany cost 14% below the EU average, with only Italy selling them more cheaply.

""International experiences show very clearly that a moderate rise in alcohol prices reduces risky consumption in particular, above all in the case of youth and big drinkers,"" Christos Pantazis from the SPD told the daily Rheinische Post.

The current tax on alcohol in Germany was no longer in keeping with the times, Pantazis said, as it had barely been changed over many years and had thus lost its power to guide behavior.

This meant ""a central instrument of prevention"" was not being used, he added.

His CDU counterpart, Simone Borchardt, said revenue from any tax on alcohol should be used to pay for more ""prevention, addiction counselling, therapy services and the treatment of alcohol-related diseases.""

She said the focus should ""clearly be on high-percentage alcoholic beverages.""

Her ideas were seconded by Nicola Buhlinger-Göpfarth, the chair of the family doctors association (HÄV), who said the revenue from a tax should go toward ""measures promoting a healthy lifestyle and enhancing care.""

 

Ahead of German Chancellor Friedrich Merz's trip to India with an economic delegation on Sunday, a leading foreign trade expert has told the dpa news agency that German business could benefit greatly from the visit.

 ""India is an increasingly important trading partner for the German economy,"" Volker Treier, foreign trade chief of the German Chamber of Industry and Commerce (DIHK), said.

""Given its economic dynamism, young population and growing industrial base, India is rapidly gaining relevance for our companies — especially for the diversification of supply chains and the expansion of international value creation.""

He said, however, that despite its size, India currently ranks only 23rd among Germany's trading partners, while Germany holds first place among India's EU trading partners.

But the trade volume between the two countries has doubled in the past decade, reaching €31 billion ($36 billion) in 2024, with Germany exporting more than it imported.

German products sent to India include machinery, chemical products, aircraft, ships and trains, while the main imports to Germany are pharmaceuticals and goods from the Indian chemical industry, machinery and clothing.

In addition, some 2,000 German companies have branches in India that employ more than 500,000 people overall.

Merz's three-day trip comes as Berlin seeks to reduce reliance on China by strengthening trade ties with other countries.

In 2023, direct German investment in India stood at €27 billion, while German companies have built manufacturing capacities in China worth €100 billion.

A number of demonstrations are to take place in the German capital on Saturday to show support with Iranian protesters calling for the end of the clerical system in place in their country since the 1979 Islamic revolution.

The series of rallies will kick off with a demonstration entitled ""Solidarity with the just uprising of the Iranian people, remembrance of victims of the recent violence in Iran and protest against the death penalty,"" which is to be held in the morning on the ""Platz des 18. März"" in the Mitte district.

Three other demonstrations have been registered with authorities for the afternoon.

DW will bring you coverage of the demonstrations throughout the day.

As northern German regions begin to experience some relief after heavy snowfall on Friday, the south of the country is bracing for its turn to be covered in white.

The Allgäu region in the states of Bavaria and Baden-Württemberg is predicted to receive 20 to 30 cm (8 to 12 inches) of fresh snow by Saturday night, while the Black Forest could see as much as 50 cm, forecasters say.

Long-distance train services in the north were initially expected to resume operations from 10 a.m. (0900 GMT), according to national rail operator Deutsche Bahn, but a spokeswoman later told the dpa news agency that they would restart at midday.

She said services would, however, remain heavily limited.

This comes after a day on which bus and train services were severely disrupted, with all buses canceled in Hannover and surrounding regions on Friday evening. Many traffic accidents were also reported.

The snow has had its positive side for those who enjoy winter sports, with numerous ski regions in Saxony, Thuringia and Hesse profiting from excellent conditions.

Temperatures are also expected to fall across the country on Saturday, with -15 C (5 F) possible in some locations during the night to Sunday.

The DW newsroom in Bonn says guten Tag as Germany remains in the grip of a cold spell that has brought lower-than-average temperatures and snow across the country.

The heavy snowfall seen in many northern regions, which has caused severe disruptions to transport, is now forecast to move southward, with parts of Bavaria and the Black Forest expected to be particularly affected.

Despite the literally freezing weather in Berlin, protests are to held in solidarity with Iranian anti-government demonstrators who are currently facing the threat of a brutal crackdown.

            Hot Stocks 





            Robots took over the floor at the biggest technology show of the year: I watched a towering humanoid robot march forward, spin its head and wave at an excited crowd. Then I almost bumped into a four-legged doglike robot behind me.
    


            They're just a couple of the many robots I encountered this week designed for a range of purposes, from playing chess to performing spinal surgery. These are common occurrences on the Las Vegas Convention Center's show floor during CES, which wrapped on Friday. Every January, companies from around the world gather to flaunt new technologies, products and services.
    


            The show is just as much spectacle as it is substance; many of the most eye-catching wares either haven't come to fruition (like flying cars) or are wildly expensive and impractical (think TVs that cost tens of thousands of dollars). But CES provides a glimpse into the bets being made by industry giants like Nvidia, Intel, Amazon and Samsung.
    


            AI once again dominated the conference. Companies showed off everything from humanoid robots they claim will staff factories to refrigerators you can open with your voice to the next-generation chips that will power it all. CES, in some ways, turned the Strip into a bubble of its own, shielded from AI skepticism.
    


            CNN asked a handful of tech executives at CES about an AI bubble and how it might impact their businesses. Some said their businesses aren't relevant to the bubble concerns, while others expressed optimism about AI's potential and said they are focused on building products that show it.
    


            “We're in the earliest stage of what's possible. So when I hear we're in a bubble, I'm like… This isn't a fad,” said Panos Panay, Amazon's devices and services chief. “It's not going to pass.”
    


            Tech companies poured more than $61 billion into data center investments in 2025, according to S&P Global, fueling concerns that investments may be far outpacing demand.
    


            And investments are only expected to grow, with Goldman Sachs reporting that AI companies are estimated to invest more than $500 billion in capital expenditures this year. Julien Garran, researcher and partner for research firm MacroStrategy Partnership, said in a report last year that the AI bubble is 17 times bigger than the dot com bubble.
    


            Most of the concerns around an AI bubble have centered on investments in data centers built for AI tasks that are too power-hungry for devices like laptops and smartphones to handle alone. Nvidia, the poster child of the AI boom and the company at the center of the bubble debate, announced at CES that the next version of its computing platform that powers those data centers is arriving in the second half of this year.
    


            When asked about the AI bubble, executives from chipmakers Intel and Qualcomm pointed to their respective companies' efforts to improve how computers process AI tasks locally rather than in the cloud.
    


            Qualcomm, which makes chips for smartphones and other products, announced last year that it's expanding into data centers. But that represents a very small part of its business.
    


            “As far as we're concerned, where we operate is not where the bubble conversation exists,” Akash Palkhiwala, Qualcomm's chief financial officer and chief operating officer, told CNN.
    


            Intel is focused on products that are important to its consumers, like chips that boost laptop performance, rather than making a big bet “that takes a lot of investment that may or may not make it,” said its client computing group head, Jim Johnson.
    


            CK Kim, executive vice president and head of Samsung's digital appliances business, said in an interview through an interpreter that it's not for him to say whether the industry is in an AI bubble. He added that the company is more focused on whether AI is bringing value to consumers.
    


            What that “value” looks like is exactly what the thousands of exhibitors at CES tried to demonstrate this week. Humanoid robots were a big part of that equation for companies like Nvidia, Intel, Hyundai and Qualcomm, all of which announced new tech to power human-shaped robots.
    


            Boston Dynamics and Hyundai debuted Atlas, a humanoid robot developed in partnership with Google's DeepMind AI division designed for industrial work like order fulfillment. It'll be deployed to Google DeepMind and Hyundai's Robotics Metaplant Applications center in the coming months, and additional customers will adopt it in early 2027.
    


            “With one investment, we can explore any application in the world, from industrial use cases to retail use cases to home use cases,” Aya Durbin, who leads Boston Dynamics' humanoid application product strategy, said in an interview at Hyundai's booth when asked what's driving the interest in humanoid robots. (Hyundai owns a controlling stake in Boston Dynamics.)
    


            Tech companies have also been chasing the next big product following the smartphone and think AI could be key to finding it. At CES, a wave of companies introduced discrete listening devices that can record conversations or voice notes. These products included AI jewelry from a startup called Nirva, the Index 01 ring from smartwatch maker Pebble and the now Amazon-owned wristband from Bee.
    


            Speaking to gadgets is often faster than typing, but Amazon and Nirva also see their devices as another means to gather data that can provide insights about a user's life, though doing so will surely raise privacy concerns.
    


            Business leaders seem to agree that AI is here to stay — even for those like Pete Erickson, CEO of tech events and education company Modev, who said the industry is indeed in a bubble.
    


            But Erickson also believes AI is “just a part of our lives” now.
    


            “I don't think it's going anywhere,” he said.

DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Just after 8 p.m. Thursday, Iran's theocracy pulled the plug and disconnected the Islamic Republic's 85 million people from the rest of the world.

Following a playbook used both in demonstrations and in war, Iran severed the internet connections and telephone lines that connect its people to the vast diaspora in the United States, Europe and elsewhere. Until now, even while facing strict sanctions over the country's nuclear program, Iranians still could access mobile phone apps and even websites blocked by the theocracy, using virtual private networks to circumvent restrictions.

Thursday's decision sharply limits people from sharing images and witness accounts of the nationwide protests over Iran's ailing economy that have grown to pose the biggest challenge to the government in years. It also could provide cover for a violent crackdown after the Trump administration warned Iran's government about consequences for further deaths among demonstrators.

As the country effectively goes dark, loved ones abroad are frantic for any scrap of news, especially as Iran's attorney general warned on Saturday that anyone taking part in protests will be considered an “enemy of God,” a death-penalty charge

“You can't understand our feelings. My brothers, my cousins, they will go on the street. You can't imagine the anxiety of the Iranian diaspora,” said Azam Jangravi, a cybersecurity expert in Toronto who opposes Iran's government. “I couldn't work yesterday. I had meetings but I postponed them because I couldn't focus. I was thinking of my family and friends.”

Her voice cracked as she added: “A lot of people are being killed and injured by the Islamic Republic of Iran, and we don't know who.”

This is the third time Iran has shut down the internet from the outside world. The first was in 2019, when demonstrators angry about a spike in government-subsidized gasoline prices took to the streets. Over 300 people reportedly were killed.

Then came the protests over the 2022 death of Mahsa Amini following her arrest by the country's morality police over allegedly not wearing her hijab, or headscarf, to the liking of authorities. A monthslong crackdown killed more than 500 people.

While the connectivity offered by Starlink played a role in the Amini demonstrations, the deployment of its receivers is now far greater in Iran. That's despite the government never authorizing Starlink to function, making the service illegal to possess and use.

A year ago, an Iranian official estimated tens of thousands of Starlink receivers in the Islamic Republic, a figure that Los Angeles-based internet freedom activist Mehdi Yahyanejad said sounded right.

While many receivers likely are in the hands of business people and others wanting to stay in touch with the outside world for their livelihoods, Yahyanejad said some are now being used to share videos, photos and other reporting on the protests.

“In this case, because all those things have been disrupted, Starlink is playing the key for getting all these videos out,” Yahyanejad said.

However, Starlink receivers are facing challenges. Since its 12-day war with Israel last June, Iran has been disrupting GPS signals, likely in a bid to make drones less effective. Starlink receivers use GPS signals to position themselves to connect to a constellation of low-orbit satellites.

Amir Rashidi, director of digital rights and security at the Miaan Group and an expert on Iran, said that since Thursday he had seen about a 30% loss in packets being sent by Starlink devices — basically units of data that transmit across the internet. In some areas of Iran, Rashidi said there had been an 80% loss in packets.

“I believe the Iranian government is doing something beyond GPS jamming, like in Ukraine where Russia tried to jam Starlink,” Rashidi said. He suggested Iran may be using a mobile jammer, like it did in previous decades to disrupt satellite television receivers.

The International Telecommunication Union, a United Nations agency, has called on Iran to stop jamming in the past.

Meanwhile, Iran has been advocating at the ITU for Starlink service to the country to be stopped.

It appears that the majority of information coming out of Iran since Thursday night is being transmitted via Starlink, which is now illegal. That carries dangers for those possessing the devices.

“It's really hard to use it because if they arrest a person, they can execute the person and say this person is working for Israel or the United States,” Jangravi said.

Not using it, however, means the world knows even less about what's happening inside Iran at a pivotal moment.

“This sort of nonviolent protest is not sustainable when the violence (by security forces) is so extreme,” Yahyanejad said. “Unless something changes in the next two or three days, these protests can die down, too. If there's any help, it needs to come soon.”

KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — A Ukrainian drone strike sparked a fire at an oil depot in Russia's southern Volgograd region, officials said Saturday, after Russia launched a powerful hypersonic missile along with drones and other weapons that disrupted Kyiv's power supply and heating.

There were no immediate reports of casualties, Volgograd Gov. Andrei Bocharov was quoted as saying in a Telegram post published on the channel of the local administration. The post did not specify the damage, but said that people living near the depot may have to be evacuated.

Ukraine's General Staff said Saturday it had struck the Zhutovskaya oil depot overnight. In a statement on Telegram, it said the depot is supplying fuel to Russian forces, adding that damage was being assessed. 

Ukraine's long-range drone strikes on Russian energy sites aim to deprive Moscow of the oil export revenue it needs to pursue its full-scale invasion. Russia wants to cripple the Ukrainian power grid, seeking to deny civilians access to heat, light and running water in what Kyiv officials say is an attempt to “weaponize winter.”

Saturday's attack came the day after Russia bombarded Ukraine with hundreds of drones and dozens of missiles overnight into Friday, according to Ukrainian officials, killing at least four people in the capital. For only the second time in the nearly 4-year-old war, it used a powerful new hypersonic missile that struck western Ukraine in a clear warning to Kyiv's NATO allies.

The intense barrage and the launch of the nuclear-capable Oreshnik missile followed reports of major progress in talks between Ukraine and its allies on how to defend the country from further Moscow aggression if a U.S.-led peace deal is struck.




Stéphane Dujarric, spokesman for the U.N. secretary-general, said Friday's attacks “have resulted in significant civilian casualties and deprived millions of Ukrainians of essential services, including electricity, heating and water at a time of acute humanitarian need.”

Ukrainian Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko said heat supply would be fully restored in Kyiv by the end of Saturday.

She said areas on the right bank of the Dnieper River would gradually lift emergency blackouts and return to scheduled outages. But resuming power supply on the left bank, where Russian attacks were concentrated, is more complicated due to significant damage to the power grid, she added. 

Russia's Defense Ministry said Saturday that its forces used aviation, drones, missiles and artillery to strike Ukrainian energy facilities and fuel-storage depots. 

Russia struck Ukraine with 121 drones and one Iskander-M ballistic missile, according to the Ukrainian air force. It said 94 drones were shot down. 

Separately, the Russian Defense Ministry said 59 Ukrainian drones were neutralized overnight over Russia and occupied Crimea. 

Ukraine's military said that besides the oil depot in Volgograd, it had struck a drone storage facility belonging to a unit of Russia's 19th Motor Rifle Division in Zaporizhzhia, southern Ukraine, as well as a drone command and control point near the eastern city of Pokrovsk.

New video shows hooded figure walking near Ohio home where Spencer and Monique Tepe were killed in December. (columbus_police_ via Instagram)

Columbus Police Chief Elaine Bryant is speaking out about the murder of an Ohio dentist and his wife, calling the case ""disturbing."" 

Spencer Tepe, 37, and his 39-year-old wife, Monique, were found shot to death inside their Weinland Park home in Columbus on Dec. 30. Investigators have ruled out a murder-suicide and released surveillance video of a person of interest seen walking through a nearby alley near the couple's home in the lead-up to the murders. 

""This case is definitely disturbing. It's definitely something that we want to make sure that we pour a lot of energy into, to try to address and solve. We want to bring some justice to the family,"" Bryant told WSYX in an interview. 

""We know that there are a lot of concerns and a lot of questions surrounding this case. And we want to be able to be as transparent and answer as many of them as we can. Unfortunately, there are some things that we can't talk about for the integrity of the investigation,"" she continued.

""It puts a lot of stress on us, but I just want to reiterate, while this case is getting a lot of national attention, we look at all of our homicides in that manner,"" she also told the station. ""They all bring us stress because someone lost their lives."" 

Investigators believe the killings occurred between 2 a.m. and 5 a.m. on Dec. 30, and authorities are urging anyone with video, photos or other digital evidence from that timeframe to contact police.

Newly released body camera video this week also showed a Columbus police officer going to the wrong address during an initial welfare check. 

Bryant said the officer believed he was at the correct location and followed protocol, but the couple was not discovered until co-workers went to the couple's home about 40 minutes later, according to WBNS-10TV.

President Donald Trump discusses how companies can help rebuild Venezuela following the capture of dictator Nicolas Maduro.

President Donald Trump has signed an executive order blocking U.S. courts from seizing Venezuelan oil revenues held in American Treasury accounts.

The order states that court action against the funds would undermine U.S. national security and foreign policy objectives.

Trump signed the order on Friday, the same day that he met with nearly two dozen top oil and gas executives at the White House. 

The president said American energy companies will invest $100 billion to rebuild Venezuela's ""rotting"" oil infrastructure and push production to record levels following the capture of Venezuelan dictator Nicolás Maduro.

The U.S. has moved aggressively to take control of Venezuela's oil future following the collapse of the Maduro regime.

After the Pittsburgh Steelers clinched the AFC North, NFL Films cameras caught Aaron Rodgers and Mike Tomlin thanking one another for the quarterback joining the Steelers in his 21st season.

It is clear that Rodgers has enjoyed his time in Pittsburgh — after making the playoffs himself for the first time in four years, how could he not?

Rodgers was asked about what he likes about the Steelers organization, and he took a not-so-subtle shot at his last team, the New York Jets.

""One thing I really love, and it's kind of the antithesis of where I was — there's not really any leaks in the boat,"" Rodgers told reporters this week. ""Every year, you have difficulties and adversity, both on the field and off, and to go through a season like this and be able to focus on football and not have a lot of other little bulls--- out there has been really nice.""

During his time with the Jets, Rodgers was adamant that media leaks were a ""problem with the organization.""

""There's no place in a winning culture (for this),"" Rodgers said on a December 2023 edition of ""The Pat McAfee Show.""

BROCK PURDY SAYS 49ERS HAVE A ‘CHIP ON THEIR SHOULDER' ENTERING PLAYOFFS AFTER MISSING LAST SEASON

""They're not your friends. And even if they are, is that really what you want to be about? You want to be about using someone in the media to leak stuff to in order, for what, to get them to put your name out there for a job, or if you're a player to get you a write-up? I think it's chicken s--- at its core, and I think it has no place in a winning organization… Put your name on something and stand behind it.""

After the 2023 season, almost all of which Rodgers missed with a torn Achilles suffered on the Jets' fourth offensive play of the year, Rodgers said the team needed to get ""the bulls--- that has nothing to do with winning... out of the building.""

""If you want to be a winning organization and put yourself in a position to win championships and be competitive, everything that you do matters,"" Rodgers told reporters in January 2024.

The Jets decided to move on from Rodgers while hiring first-year head coach Aaron Glenn, and it seems Rodgers has the last laugh.

Rodgers is in the playoffs, while the Jets lost 14 games for the third time in franchise history. Gang Green also became the first team in NFL history to go an entire season without recording an interception. They ended the year losing each of their last five games by 23 or more points — a feat never before seen.

A Biden-appointed federal judge on Friday blocked President Donald Trump‘s funding threat regarding changes to states' voting systems and voter registration forms.

The judge, U.S. District Judge John Chun, ruled that Trump's threat to pull funds from the Election Assistance Commission puts unconstitutional pressure on states.

TRUMP FIRST YEAR REPORT CARD: A- PROMISE KEEPER OR ‘NIGHTMARE' FAILURE

“The President has no authority to unilaterally impose new conditions on federal funds,” Chun wrote in a 75-page ruling. He also wrote that the court determined Trump's executive orders constitute a violation of the separation of powers.

Chun argued that the president's powers are aimed at overseeing laws, not to be a lawmaker.

“The Court concludes that Plaintiffs have plausibly alleged, and for some provisions proved, that the EO violates separation of powers,” he wrote. “As stated by the Supreme Court, although the Constitution vests the executive power in the President, ‘[i]n the framework of our Constitution, the President's power to see that the laws are faithfully executed refutes the idea that he is to be a lawmaker.'”

Chun is the third federal judge to block Trump's March 25 executive order, “PRESERVING AND PROTECTING THE INTEGRITY OF AMERICAN ELECTIONS.” The order set new standards for election integrity, including on mail-in ballots.

TRUMP WARNS OF JANUARY GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN OVER OBAMACARE

A White House spokesperson told Politico that Trump “cares deeply about the integrity of our elections and his executive order takes lawful actions to ensure election security.”

“This is not the final say on the matter and the Administration expects ultimate victory on the issue,” spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said.

The administration is expected to appeal the latest ruling and has also appealed rulings by Washington, D.C. U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly, an Obama appointee, and Massachusetts U.S. District Judge Denise Casper, also an Obama appointee.

DEMOCRATS CALL FOR RELEASE OF DNC'S 2024 ELECTION AUTOPSY

Chun later wrote, “The Constitution assigns no authority to the President over federal election administration.”

President Donald Trump's capture of former Venezuelan dictator Nicolas Maduro in Caracas last weekend may have earned him praise from Republican hawks, but it has also exposed fissures in the GOP.

Five Republican senators on Thursday voted with Democrats to proceed with a resolution restricting Trump's war powers regarding Venezuela, as questions are raised concerning what comes next for the oil-rich country now grappling with a change of leadership.

The vote, which requires further consideration in the Senate before even being discussed by the House, comes as more centrist Republicans express their reservations regarding Trump's desire to purchase Greenland.

“This is a topic that should be dropped,” Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Roger Wicker (R-MS) told reporters this week.

“This nonsense on what's going on with Greenland is a distraction from the good work he's doing, and the amateurs who said it was a good idea should lose their jobs,” Sen. Thom Tillis (R-NC) added during a speech on the Senate floor. 

Even before Sen. Tim Kaine (D-VA) underscored Republican divisions regarding Trump's Venezuela war powers with his resolution, Sen. Ruben Gallego (D-AZ) had previewed his plan to introduce a similar measure related to Greenland.

“We must stop him before he invades another country on a whim,” Gallego wrote on social media. “No more forever wars.”

The Trump administration has sent mixed messages regarding its overarching strategy related to Greenland, with Secretary of State Marco Rubio repeating to senators and reporters this week during separate briefings that the president hopes to purchase the autonomous territory from Denmark.

Simultaneously, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt has been careful not to rule out a military response from Trump against the NATO ally.

“The president has been very open and clear with all of you and with the world that he views it in the best interest of the United States to deter Russian and Chinese aggression in the Arctic region, and so that's why his team is currently talking about what a potential purchase would look like,” Leavitt told reporters. “All options are always on the table for President Trump as he examines what's in the best interest of the United States, but I will just say that the president's first option always has been diplomacy.”

Trump on Friday alluded to acquiring Greenland the “easy” or “hard way,” adding, “When we own it, we defend it. We'll have to defend Greenland. NATO has got to understand that.”

“We are going to do something on Greenland, whether they like it or not, because if we don't do it, Russia or China will take over Greenland — and we're not going to have Russia or China as a neighbor,” the president told reporters. “I would like to make a deal the easy way.”

Regardless, lawmakers like Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-SD) have downplayed the prospect of the “hard way,” telling reporters this week he does not “see military action being an option” regarding Greenland.

“That, to me, is not something that anybody is contemplating seriously,” he said.

In an interview with the Washington Examiner, a White House official dismissed Republican criticism, saying the senators were “speaking to a hypothetical situation” regarding Greenland.

“We've heard a lot of voices” regarding Trump's foreign policy, the official said, but “the president has shown time and time again” the strength of his decisions.

To that end, the official cited Trump's assassination of Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Quds Force Commander Qasem Soleimani in 2020 during his first term and Operation Midnight Hammer last June in which the U.S. struck three of Iran's uranium enrichment nuclear facilities.

There is confusion regarding Trump's Greenland strategy as Rubio prepares to meet next week with Danish and Greenlandic diplomats, the first Trump administration sit-down related to a possible purchase. However, there is no confusion with respect to how the president will respond to another war powers resolution.

Trump had a sharp reaction to Sens. Susan Collins (R-ME), Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), Rand Paul (R-KY), Josh Hawley (R-MO), and Todd Young (R-IN) supporting the Democratic-led Venezuela resolution, imploring the public to “never” elect them to office again, going on to say they should be “ashamed” of themselves. 

“This Vote greatly hampers American Self Defense and National Security, impeding the President's Authority as Commander in Chief,” he wrote on Truth Social. “In any event, and despite their ‘stupidity,' the War Powers Act is Unconstitutional, totally violating Article II of the Constitution, as all Presidents, and their Departments of Justice, have determined before me.”

The same White House official told the Washington Examiner the administration is confident it can counter Republican scrutiny, pointing to three bipartisan briefings already provided to Congress, describing the Venezuela war powers resolution vote as “not the result we wanted” before reiterating there were more votes on it to come. 

The official predicted a “steady tempo” of similar briefings to “sketch out” the administration's plans regarding what Trump wants to “achieve with his foreign policy,” including related to Venezuela, in the weeks and months ahead.

“The vast, vast majority of Republicans support the president's positions,” the source said. “Stay tuned for additional engagements with the Hill, so everyone understands where we're going from here.” 

After the Republican senators' dissent on Thursday, 17 House Republicans similarly defied House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) in voting with Democrats to extend Obamacare health insurance premium subsidies for three years.

The Affordable Care Act proposal – which only received a vote because of a discharge petition, a parliamentary procedure that typically helps minority parties push legislation onto the floor – is unlikely to pass the Senate but could be the pretext for a compromise between the two chambers of Congress. 

Disagreements, nevertheless, remain among Republicans regarding provisions related to abortion, with senators, including Sen.Bernie Moreno (R-OH), pitching a two-year extension with income caps and a reopened enrollment period.

Trump told House Republicans earlier this week they needed to be more “flexible” regarding the Hyde Amendment, which prevents federal funding from being used to terminate pregnancies in most cases.

The Epstein Files Transparency Act was passed in November, also because of a discharge petition, another demonstration of Republican dissent after Trump tried to stop the legislation from coming to the floor, in part, by holding a briefing with Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-CO) in the White House Situation Room.

DEFENSE HAWKS GET UPPER HAND IN TUG-OF-WAR OVER TRUMP FOREIGN POLICY

At the same time, the earlier White House official emphasized to the Washington Examiner that the House did not override Trump's vetoes of two pieces of legislation, including one regarding a Colorado water project in Boebert's home state. However, 35 Republicans voted with Democrats to override the veto.

“We had some success in Congress… on the veto override votes,” the official said, continuing on to call this week “a mixed bag for the president.”

Men could use artificial intelligence to help cure cancer. Instead, they turn everything into pornography. This is a bit tongue-in-cheek, of course, but thanks to some men on the internet, no woman is safe from the perverted digital hands of AI.

Many feminists and libertarians argue that pornography is acceptable or even empowering when all parties are consenting. Fine, what about when there isn't consent? What happens when a woman sees that a stranger with very few X followers took her profile, LinkedIn, or wedding image and stripped her down for his pleasure without her consent? This isn't a hypothetical; it's happening in real time.

MARGO MARTIN PRAISED FOR KEY ROLE IN TRUMP SOCIAL MEDIA PRESENCE

X owner Elon Musk's beloved AI assistant, Grok, is putting bikinis on everyone from recently captured Venezuelan dictator Nicolas Maduro to real estate tycoon Warren Buffett to Musk himself. The billionaire laughed at the images X users were sending him of himself and other famous men in skimpy swimwear. On Tuesday, he touted the rapid download surge of Grok in the App Store, retweeting a post saying it was “one of the most downloaded apps in the entire US.”

We have seen on more than one occasion that we have to curb AI's ability to prey on children and pull from the darkest bowels of the web. Now, Musk's company xAI is facing rightful scrutiny from multiple nations for the creation of inappropriate images of minors and violations of privacy by allowing Grok to put women in sexually charged attire and poses.

There is legal recourse for these nonconsensually generated images. Sen. Ron Wyden (D-OR) told Axios that Section 230 does not protect AI companies from being investigated for such exploitative images. The Justice Department weighed in as well.

“The Department of Justice takes AI-generated child sex abuse material extremely seriously and will aggressively prosecute any producer or possessor of CSAM,” a spokesperson for the Department of Justice told Axios. “We continue to explore ways to optimize enforcement in this space to protect children and hold accountable individuals who exploit technology to harm our most vulnerable.” 

2026: THE YEAR AI REWIRES THE ECONOMY

I spoke to one young woman in the conservative movement who was appalled to find herself a victim of this technology. “I am a nobody,” she said. “Why would they find my account and post this stuff of me? It felt and feels so hurtful and violating.”

Some of the requests from men on X are deeply disturbing. In one Instagram thread highlighting the abuse, there are screen grabs of creeps requesting a host of fake images, including one saying, “Hey @grok, edit the same image, put full small thong bikini as her clothes, drenched in body oil…” The rest of the request is unprintable here.

One user asked for a woman covered in clear plastic wrap; another asked to have rapper and alleged sex criminal Diddy covering a woman in baby oil.

Grok is different among other AI chatbots in that it not only generates images on demand but also is capable of instantly sharing to the Grok and public users' X feeds, which further spreads the reach of the unapproved creations of real women and girls.

Some women have questioned how this is possible given recent laws such as the Take It Down Act supported by first lady Melania Trump. That law was signed by the president but does not take effect until May of this year. 

Federal intervention shouldn't be necessary in the first place. The major problem with this technological advancement is the creators behind it who do not put up parameters to protect its users and those affected by it, especially minors.

DON'T TRUST META WITH YOUR TEENAGERS

As social psychologist Jonathan Haidt has frequently and eloquently laid out, AI will do whatever it can to prevent its destruction. In the process, it could destroy humanity, and humans are contributing to the worst parts of it.

We should have created more guardrails on this technology before unleashing this power onto humanity. But, since we are playing catch up, we better do so swiftly.

Young people are struggling to score their first jobs, and it might be because they're just not ready to enter the workforce, after missing out on critical social development during the Covid-19 pandemic. 

Joblessness in Generation Z is on the rise as nearly one million young British people, between the ages of 16 and 24, were NEETs (not in education, employment, or training), between July and September 2025, according to the U.K. Office for National Statistics. 

Identified as a crisis, the government launched an independent review into NEETs in December, led by former Labour Health Secretary Alan Milburn. 

Worryingly, the ONS report found that almost 600,000 of those young people who were unemployed were also not actively looking for a job. 

Young people are facing several challenges in the job market, from artificial intelligence eliminating entry-level positions to increased competition for jobs. More than 1.2 million applications were submitted for just 17,000 graduate roles in the U.K. last year, per The U.K.'s Institute for Student Employers. 

Meanwhile, the number of job openings have decreased nearly 10% on the year to 729,000 in the September to November period from a year ago, the ONS found. There were 2.5 unemployed people per vacancy between August and October, up from 1.8 the previous year. 

It's not just the economic climate, with employers and experts saying that Gen Z are not adequately prepared to join the workforce. 

Milburn told The Times in a recent interview that employers find that young people ""aren't work ready"" when they enter full-time jobs after school. ""Young people don't necessarily have work experience, and what they have learnt at school isn't necessarily pertinent for the world of work."" 

U.K.-based charity Shaw Trust helps people find employment and is working to end the NEETs crisis. Chief Impact Officer Julie Leonard broke down how virtual learning and being at home during the 2020 lockdown created a socialization gap in Gen Z, particularly between the ages of 20 and 24, in an interview with CNBC Make It. 

""You've got a lot of young people who missed out on years of in person, education, work experience, work readiness, soft skills, and who now find themselves adults and in a very difficult job market, and also in a recruitment landscape that has completely changed over the years,"" Leonard said. 

Soft skills like learning to lead a team, collaboration, following instructions are ""so core to being work-ready,"" and Gen Z ""missed out.""

Many young people weren't forced to get out of their comfort zone at home, which includes talking to strangers, showing up on time for school or work, she added. 

MP Milburn explained that young people can't be blamed for not being ready to work and said opportunities for young people are in ""sharp decline."" 

""There's been a longstanding decline in 16 and 17-year-olds getting Saturday jobs,"" Milburn said, in comments reported by The Times. ""Previous generations, including mine, were all brought up where most of us had that type of job or had a paper round or whatever. That not only provided youngsters with the opportunity to earn but it also allowed teenagers to learn about what it meant to be in a workplace.

Leonard says these part time jobs such as babysitting, gardening, or being on the paper route were ""critical"" to getting young people familiar with the discipline of work. ""We've lost that kind of stepping stone approach that is so critical,"" she said. 

In fact, employers at Big Four firms like KPMG and PWC have identified that their youngest recruits are lacking essential work etiquette skills like communication and collaboration. 

PWC started offering resilience training to toughen up its new graduate recruits in 2025 and pinned the lack of ""human-skills"" on the pandemic. In 2023, KPMG started offering soft skill sessions for young recruits including on teamwork and how to give presentations. 

Leonard recommends going back to old-school tactics to secure jobs, rather than sitting behind a screen and sending off an endless number of CVs that will eventually be rejected by AI.

Indeed, now that job hunting has become primarily digital, many young people are sending off CVs written by AI. ""It's become so depersonalized, and they send off the email, they often get no response whatsoever, which is extremely demotivating,"" Leonard said. 

""Actually, what you do is you make a CV, you go down the high street, you have somebody walk with you and give you that resilience and that confidence to go and say 'I would like a job,'"" she advised saying that this is an exercize Shaw Trust advisors often carry out with young people. 

The kind of shop where this tactic might be most successful includes local mom-and-pop busineses, bars, cafes, or other small and medium enterprizes. 

""You go in there with your CV, you have a conversation with a manager, you start to open doors. That's the type of work that we do. It's the hand holding, the resilience, the confidence building to step out. It's not sitting behind a laptop and just sending CVs,"" Leonard added.

NASA Announces Return Date for Evacuating ISS Astronauts

Four ISS crew members are set to touch down on Thursday after NASA announced the first medical evacuation in the space station's history

Join Our Community of Science Lovers!

NASA has revealed the return date for four International Space Station (ISS) crew members who are being evacuated from the station after one fell ill with an unknown condition.

The crew are set to begin their return to Earth no earlier than 5 p.m. EST on Wednesday, Jan. 14. The SpaceX capsule is then expected to splash down off the coast of California at about 3:40 a.m. EST on Thursday, Jan. 15.

The announcement follows the space agency's Thursday decision to cut the Crew-11 mission short after an unidentified member of the crew experienced an undisclosed “medical concern.” The medical evacuation marks a first in the space station's 25-year history.

The exact timing for the return depends on weather and could change. In a statement, NASA said mission managers are monitoring sea conditions in the spacecraft recovery area. “NASA and SpaceX will select a specific splashdown time and location closer to the Crew-11 spacecraft undocking,” the agency said in a statement.

NASA has not revealed the extent of the sick crew member's medical issue. When revealing the decision to return the crew early on January 8, Isaacman said the problem was a “serious medical condition” but described the affected crew member as “stable.”

Crew-11 includes two NASA astronauts, the mission's commander Zena Cardman and its pilot Mike Fincke,as well as Japanese astronaut Kimiya Yui and Russian cosmonaut Oleg Platonov. They had been expected to remain on the ISS until mid-February, when the replacement crew, Crew-12, are still anticipated to arrive.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","This natural amino acid could help stop cavities before they start","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/01/260108231335.htm","Sat, 10 Jan 2026 01:35:17 GMT","

When bacteria in the mouth break down sugars from food, they release acids that gradually erode tooth enamel and cause cavities. These bacteria do not live alone. They form dense, plaque-like structures known as ""dental biofilms"" that cling to the surface of teeth. Within these biofilms, acid production can accelerate tooth damage.

Researchers have found that arginine, an amino acid naturally present in saliva, plays an important role in reducing tooth decay. Certain beneficial bacteria use an arginine deiminase system (ADS) to convert arginine into alkaline compounds that help counteract harmful acids. When more arginine is available, these protective bacteria tend to grow more easily, while acid-producing bacteria struggle to thrive. Earlier laboratory studies conducted outside the human body also suggested that arginine can change the overall makeup of dental biofilms.

Testing Arginine Inside the Human Mouth

To confirm whether these effects also occur in real mouths, a research team led by Post.doc. Yumi C. Del Rey and Professor Sebastian Schlafer at Aarhus University in Denmark carried out a clinical study. Their findings were published in the International Journal of Oral Science.

The study included 12 participants who had active tooth decay. Each person received specially designed dentures that allowed researchers to collect intact dental biofilms from both sides of the jaw. Participants were asked to dip the dentures into a sugar solution for 5 minutes, followed immediately by either distilled water (as placebo) or arginine for 30 minutes. One treatment was applied to one side of the mouth, and the other treatment to the opposite side. This routine was repeated three times daily, with arginine always applied to the same side.

""The aim was to investigate the impact of arginine treatment on the acidity, type of bacteria, and the carbohydrate matrix of biofilms from patients with active caries,"" explains Sebastian Schlafer, professor at the Department of Dentistry and Oral Health. After 4 days, once the biofilms had fully formed, the dentures were removed for detailed examination.

Arginine Reduces Acid Levels After Sugar Exposure

To measure acidity inside the biofilms, researchers used a pH-sensitive dye known as ""C-SNARF-4."" This dye allowed them to assess acidity in different areas of the biofilm. Biofilms that received arginine treatment showed noticeably higher pH levels, meaning lower acidity, at 10 and 35 minutes after exposure to sugar.

""Our results revealed differences in acidity of the biofilms, with the ones treated with arginine being significantly more protected against acidification caused by sugar metabolism"" says the first author, Yumi C. Del Rey.

Changes in Biofilm Structure and Sugary Components

The team also examined structural components of the biofilms using fluorescently labeled lectins, which are proteins that bind to specific carbohydrates. Two major carbohydrate components were studied: fucose and galactose. These sugars make up a large portion of dental biofilms and are thought to contribute to the formation of ""acidic pockets"" that trap damaging acids.

Biofilms exposed to arginine showed an overall decrease in fucose-based carbohydrates, which may reduce their ability to cause harm. Researchers also observed a structural shift in the biofilms. Galactose-containing carbohydrates became less abundant near the base of the biofilm and more concentrated toward the top, suggesting a reorganization that may limit acid buildup near tooth surfaces.

Shifting the Balance of Mouth Bacteria

To identify which bacteria were present, researchers analyzed bacterial DNA using ""16S rRNA gene sequencing."" Biofilms treated with either arginine or placebo were largely dominated by Streptococcus and Veillonella species. However, arginine treatment led to a significant reduction in the mitis/oralis group of streptococci. These bacteria produce acid but are weak at generating alkali.

At the same time, arginine slightly increased the presence of streptococci that are better at metabolizing arginine. This shift helped raise pH levels inside the biofilm. Taken together, the findings show that arginine made dental biofilms less harmful by lowering acidity, altering carbohydrate composition, and reshaping the microbial community.

A Safe and Promising Strategy Against Tooth Decay

Tooth decay affects people of all ages around the world. The researchers suggest that adding arginine to products such as toothpaste or oral rinses could help protect people who are especially prone to cavities. Because arginine is a naturally occurring amino acid produced by the body and found in many dietary proteins, it is considered safe and could even be suitable for use in children.

I would advocate for banning all non-necessary body modification on small children.

I think your claim proves too much:If you pick a different religion (my siblings and their kids are religious - not Jewish), you could similarly say ""even though they're happy being raised in their religion, they have no way to know whether they would prefer to have been raised agnostic/atheist"" (or some other religion)Of course that's true for many decisions parents make on behalf of their children.I am curious if folks in this thread are similarly incensed by young children having their ears pierced? It's obviously different, but it still seems like a cultural decision.To my knowledge (having only learned about it incidentally during the pregnancy/birthing process since it wasn't a relevant decision) it didn't seem like circumcision had strong medical recommendations for or against

Circumcision removes nerve endings and results in an exposed glans, which thickens the skin and further dulls its nerve endings. This is a 1-way reduction in sexual capacity, which the child doesn't have any say in. Comparing it to ear piercing isn't the same, which, while cartilage doesn't heal easily, there's no sexual sensation interaction and leaving piercings empty tends to reverse them over time.

Germany's home for the World Cup has been announced.

The Germany national team's base camp for the 2026 FIFA World Cup has been announced as North Carolina.

According to the DFB, as captured by @iMiaSanMia, Julian Nagelsmann's team will set up shop in Winston-Salem, a little over an hour away from Charlotte, give or take.

The DFB announced that the team will stay at The Graylyn Estate hotel and train on the grounds of Wake Forest University, which is just minutes away from the hotel.

The base camp itself is strategically located in the middle of Germany's group stage venues - Houston, Toronto, and New York/New Jersey. All three cities are a two to three hour flight away from Charlotte.

From this writer's research, the location looks like a quiet, remote place, fully detached from the hustle and bustle of the World Cup (or völlig losgelöst, as the Germans may say).

Whether that is a good choice remains to be seen, though. Germany also set up camp far away from the capital area of Doha during the last World Cup, and the results were not exactly satisfying. Another bad example would be the women's national team making a horrible accommodation decision and being forced to hide their shoes from snakes and spiders during their last World Cup in Australia/New Zealand, which also ended prematurely.

The national team will first fly to Chicago for their dress rehearsal against the USA (June 6) before settling into their new home. Fans, including yours truly, will be hoping it stays their home for as long as possible.

US President Donald Trump has come under fire (Image: Getty Images)

Over 20 MPs have demanded the United States be kicked out of the World Cup after Donald Trump's alleged violations of international law.

The cross-party group has called on FIFA to consider booting the USA over its actions in Venezuela and the President's ""veiled and overt threats"" towards Colombia, Cuba and Denmark. Trump stands accused of breaching international law after deploying special forces to seize Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro.

Relations have soured further after the White House hinted it might try to seize control of Greenland, which belongs to Denmark. Trump also warned Colombian President Gustavo Petro to ""watch his ass"", implying he could face the same fate as Maduro.

He went on to claim Cuba is ""ready to fall"" and declared the US is ""going to have to do something"" about Mexico. A bloc of 21 MPs is now calling for America to be barred from major international sporting events.

The parliamentary motion asks the Commons to express alarm over the ""kidnapping"" of Maduro and threatening remarks aimed at sovereign nations, including Colombia, Cuba and Denmark.

Labour MP Brian Leishman, who put forward the motion, told The Mirror: ""This is rank hypocrisy by the international community and by sporting bodies. FIFA says it's not political, but then it gives awards to Donald Trump.""

The global football governing body presented the President with its inaugural FIFA Peace Award in December.

Mr Leishman continued: ""Let's have consistency. It's an invasion of a sovereign nation and the kidnapping of a president in Venezuela. I'm very critical of Maduro, I want to be very clear on that, but what we've seen is a breach of international law. When you see how Russia has been treated, which is absolutely correct, I just want there to be consistency.""

The motion contends that Trump's actions ""undermine the rules-based international order"" and that sporting events ""should not be used to legitimise or normalise violations of international law by powerful states"".

The cross-party group - made up of 15 Labour backbenchers, Your Party's Jeremy Corbyn, a Lib Dem MP and four from Plaid Cymru - also demanded the Government must tackle ""double standards in the enforcement of international norms"".

The Government has declared it is the White House's responsibility to provide the legal justification for the operation in Venezuela.

Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, were seized and transported to the US, where they face trial on conspiracy charges.

The US has labelled the ousted leader a ""narco-terrorist"", but he claimed to be a ""kidnapped president"" and a ""prisoner of war"".

Britain has said it stands with Denmark following Trump's threat to annex Greenland on national security grounds. Keir Starmer has asserted that the future of Greenland should be determined by its people and those of Denmark. This topic was broached during a conversation with the US President.

The FIFA World Cup 2026 is set to kick off in June, with a record-breaking 48 nations heading to the USA, Canada and Mexico to compete. Four countries - Cape Verde, Curacao, Jordan and Uzbekistan - will be making their first appearances at the prestigious tournament, where they will face formidable competition.

England and Scotland have already secured their places at the World Cup. Meanwhile, Wales, Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland are all eagerly awaiting the play-off rounds, hoping to clinch their spots. Thousands of supporters will be making the journey over for various stages of the tournament and will be looking to secure tickets for their nation's group stage matches and potentially beyond. Here's all the information on the World Cup 2026 ticket prices and how you can get your hands on them.

Grabbing tickets for the FIFA World Cup 2026 involves navigating several sales phases, as FIFA is using a lottery system to distribute tickets. To purchase official entry into the World Cup 2026, you'll need to access the FIFA ticketing portal and register for a FIFA ID.

The registration window for tickets closes on January 13, so fans must act swiftly if they want a chance to secure their seat. Until this date, fans can submit an application for the matches and categories they're interested in but it's not on a first-come, first-served basis.

If your application is successful (or partially so), you'll be informed in late January, with automatic charges applied in February 2026. Any leftover tickets will be sold on a first-come, first-served basis from spring onwards. Those who aren't lucky enough to secure tickets initially can turn to the official FIFA resale marketplace to find tickets that original buyers no longer want.

Ticket prices fluctuate greatly depending on the stage of the match and the category of the seat. Category 1 seats are usually pitch-side, while Category 4 offers the most budget-friendly options.

These seats are often reserved for residents of the host nations or supporter groups from each country. FIFA has also introduced a supporter entry tier ticket, priced at roughly £45 ($60), available for all 104 matches.

These are specifically for fans of qualified teams and are distributed through national football associations. The prices, converted from US dollars, are as follows:

Group Stage: Category 4/Supporter £44-£104, Category 3 £104-£160, Category 2 £231-£346, Category 1 £305-£461.

Opening Matches: Category 4/Supporter £55+, Category 3 £149+, Category 2 £298+, Category 1 £447.

Round of 32: Category 4/Supporter £78, Category 3 £130-£186, Category 2 £260-£335, Category 1 £409-£558.

Round of 16: Category 4/Supporter £126, Category 3 £164-£223, Category 2 £335-£447, Category 1 £521-£730.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:goal.com","Man Utd handed huge AFCON boost as key man Bryan Mbuemo is knocked out of tournament & will return in time for Manchester derby","https://www.goal.com/en-us/lists/man-utd-afcon-boost-key-man-knocked-out-tournament-return-manchester-derby/blta607949e19e92b70","Sat, 10 Jan 2026 18:57:37 GMT","

Two Manchester United players faced off in the Africa Cup of Nations quarter-finals on Friday, with Noussair Mazraoui's Morocco knocking out Bryan Mbeumo's Cameroon 2-0. Despite the disappointment for the former Brentford forward, Cameroon's elimination provides a timely boost for the Red Devils, who will be pleased to once again be able to call on Mbeumo's services.

Morocco took the lead in under half an hour when former Manchester City midfielder Brahim Diaz bundled in from close range. The Real Madrid man got onto the end of an Ayoub El Kaabi header from an Achraf Hakimi corner to nudge past the goalkeeper and make it five goals in as many games.

The tournament hosts and favourites dominated much of the game and were able to double their lead and put the game beyond doubt on the 74th minute. Abde Ezzalzouli's free-kick evaded everyone in the box and fell to Ismael Saibari, who drilled low and hard into the bottom corner.

At Mbeumo's expense, Morocco will take on either Algeria or Nigeria, who face each other on Saturday afternoon, in the semi-finals on Wednesday. This means that Mazraoui's absence from United will be prolonged until at least late next week, but Mbeumo will likely be heading back to Manchester this weekend.

The return of their major summer signing will mark a relief for United, who are in the midst of turmoil on and off of the pitch. The Red Devils had Mbeumo, Mazraoui and Amad Diallo head off to represent their respective nations this winter and have seen their options, particularly on the right-hand side of the pitch, depleted significantly.

Mbeumo will return to Carrington this week, but will find a new man in charge of the Red Devils. When the forward left for international duty, Portuguese tactician Ruben Amorim was still in the dugout and, in spite of a mixed season, appeared to be relatively secure in his position as head coach.

However, last weekend, Amorim kicked up a fuss at a post-match press conference after a 1-1 draw with rivals Leeds United and was strangely insistent that he saw himself as a 'manager', not a head coach at the club. The comments, which offered shades of former Chelsea boss Enzo Maresca's own press conference meltdown, were the final straw for the United hierarchy who called time on the ex-Sporting CP boss' stint at the club.

United and Scotland legend Darren Fletcher has been named as the interim boss and will oversee their game against Brighton on Sunday. The FA Cup third round will come too soon for Mbeumo, but the attacking player will have his eyes locked on the Manchester derby next weekend and his return to the pitch at Old Trafford will be just what Pep Guardiola's side will have hoped to have avoided.

City will be frustrated to have to come up against the Cameroon forward next weekend and would have fancied their chances against a weakened United. Guardiola's team have squandered their slender pre-Christmas lead over Arsenal and now sit six points behind the Gunners.

City have drawn their last three games in the Premier League, handing Mikel Arteta a significant advantage and a little bit of breathing room at the top of the table. Yet, they will be boosted by the introduction of their own marquee forward signing with Bournemouth's Antoine Semenyo completing his move to the Etihad on Friday.

It is unclear who will take the role as the next permanent head coach in the United dugout. The current availability of elite managers is slim pickings and given United have been so poor at recruiting managerial staff, they will be determined to avoid yet another disaster,

Amorim clung on to the position for just over a year and United forked out millions upon millions of pounds to help bring in players suitable for his rigid 3-4-3 formation. Mbeumo was one of the big-money signings for the Portuguese coach and Fletcher, as well as the succeeding person in the dugout, will have to find a way get the best out of the Cameroon forward.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Nick Reiner's weight gain and change of meds for his schizophrenia treatment was reportedly the catalyst behind his parents Rob Reiner and Michele Singer Reiner's brutal murders. 

Sources made the revelations surrounding Nick's 2020 diagnosis and subsequent struggles with his medication regimen in TMZ's new documentary, “The Reiner Murders: What Really Happened,” which aired on Friday. 

In December, the outlet reported that Nick, 32, was diagnosed with schizophrenia — and in the weeks leading up to his parents' deaths, the meds he was taking allegedly made him “erratic and dangerous.”

Multiple sources told the outlet that Nick was under the care of a psychiatrist for mental illness and that his behavior had gotten “alarming” in the month before the murders.

Nick reportedly received care from a Los Angeles-based rehab facility in the weeks leading up to his parents' murders. 

However, sources in the documentary told the outlet that Nick complained to his doctors about the weight gain he had experienced, which is a common side effect of the medication. 

As a result of his complaint, his doctors changed his meds which led him to become “more erratic.” 

Insiders added that Rob and Michele Reiner were aware of the troubling updates with their son, but were unsure of what to do.

Doctors also allegedly decided not to place Nick on a temporary psych hold to stabilize him during this time, the sources continued.

Nick's attorney, public defender Kimberly Greene, did not immediately respond to Page Six's request for comment.

Rob and Michele were found fatally stabbed to death in their Los Angeles home on Dec. 14, 2025, after having been involved in a heated argument with Nick the night before. Rob was 78 and Michele was 70.

The young filmmaker, who has had a notoriously rocky relationship with his parents and publicly struggled with drug addiction for years, was arrested hours after his parents' bodies were discovered. He is currently facing two counts of first degree murder in the stabbing death of his parents.

After changing out his representation from famed attorney Alan Jackson to Greene, it was reported that Nick doesn't understand why he's in jail.

Sources claim Nick believes those who put him behind bars are engaged in a “conspiracy” against him. While he is aware of his alleged crime, the insiders added that he's experiencing a break from reality. 

In light of his representation updates, his arraignment date was pushed back once again during his Jan. 7 appearance in court.

A warrant has reportedly been issued in New Mexico for actor and director Timothy Busfield, with the thirtysomething and West Wing performer facing charges on two counts of criminal sexual contact of a minor and one count of child abuse. The allegations, per People, stem from Busfield's time on Fox's now-canceled crime drama The Cleaning Lady, where he served as an executive producer and periodic episode director during its third and fourth seasons. The accusations have been levied by the family of two now-11-year-old boys, who told parents and mental health professionals that Busfield had touched them inappropriately when they were working on the series at the ages of 7 and 8.

The boys' mother reportedly filed a police report in October of 2025, telling Child Protective Services that “her children both disclosed that there was sexual abuse by Timothy from around November 2022 to Spring 2024.” Quotes from the warrant state that Busfield had befriended the family during his time as a producer and director on the show, including spending time with them outside of filming, and states that the parents apparently became worried after hearing allegations that the actor had been “handsy” on past sets. (Busfield was accused of sexual assault in 1994, by a 17-year-old extra he'd appeared with in Little Big League, eventually settling the suit.) When the parents asked the children if they'd ever been touched in a way that made them feel uncomfortable on the set of the show, they allegedly responded “You mean like Uncle Tim?” One of the children, who was diagnosed with moderate post-traumatic stress disorder and anxiety, eventually told a therapist that Busfield “had touched and rubbed his penis 3 or 4 times.” The police warrant alleges that Busfield “exploited the hectic film sets to tickle and touch [the child] on his penis and buttocks, masking it as play.”

The warrant also quotes police interviews with Busfield, who told investigators that Warner Bros. Television, producer on The Cleaning Lady, had launched a third-party investigation into the allegations. In the interviews, Busfield reportedly acknowledged that it was “highly likely” he had picked up or tickled the children on the set, in the interest of maintaining “a playful environment,” and that he had a relationship with the family outside of work. The warrant also states that Busfield told police that he had been told the family “wanted revenge” after the children's part on the series was re-cast.

Busfield, also known for roles in films like Field Of Dreams and as a regular on the TV directing circuit, has so far neither commented on the charges, or reportedly been detained. Warner Bros. Television has issued a statement in response to the news, saying, “The health and safety of our cast and crew is always our top priority, especially the safety of minors on our productions. We take all allegations of misconduct very seriously and have systems in place to promptly and thoroughly investigate, and when needed, take appropriate action… [We] have been and will continue to cooperate with law enforcement.”

      Apparently they used sonic weapons unlike any technology that the Venezuelan government has seen before which incapacitated both their military/military radar and men. Just goes to shows that we are in fact miles ahead of other countries in terms of the technology.
    


      When it comes to the most convincing UFO sightings ever reported, Redditors have shared a variety of cases that stand out for their credibility, documentation, and the sheer number of witnesses involved. Here are some of the most frequently mentioned and highly regarded sightings:
    


Location: Ruwa, Zimbabwe
    


Details: Over 60 schoolchildren witnessed a craft landing in their schoolyard and several beings emerging from it. The incident was investigated by a well-known psychologist, and a documentary on YouTube provides more details. ""The Ariel school incident in Africa is my favourite. Surprised it hasn't been mentioned. 60 plus children apparently witnessed a craft landing in the schoolyard and a few beings came out.""



Location: Alaska, USA
    


Details: A JAL cargo flight crew, including the pilot and co-pilot, observed a massive UFO for over 30 minutes. The object was also tracked by ground radar. The pilot's career was significantly impacted by his decision to speak out about the incident. ""JAL Flight 1628... What the pilot and co-pilot saw that day was also being tracked by ground radar as well.""



Location: Suffolk, England
    


Details: US Air Force personnel stationed at RAF Woodbridge and RAF Bentwaters reported multiple nights of strange lights and a craft landing in Rendlesham Forest. The incident involved direct interaction with the object and detailed military testimonies. ""Rendelsham Forest or Shag Harbour. When it comes to Rendelsham, I am confident in thinking a crew of military men as they were would not have mistaken a light house for a UFO.""



Location: Phoenix, Arizona, USA
    


Details: Thousands of people, including the then-governor of Arizona, witnessed a massive V-shaped formation of lights moving silently across the night sky. The event was widely reported and remains one of the most famous mass UFO sightings. ""Phoenix lights...""



Location: Off the coast of California, USA
    


Details: US Navy pilots, including Commander David Fravor, encountered a Tic Tac-shaped object that displayed incredible speed and maneuverability. The incident was captured on FLIR video and corroborated by multiple witnesses and radar data. ""For me, it's the eyewitness testimony of David Fraver, the fighter pilot who described his interactions with the 'tic tac' ufo off the coast of California during his training runs.""



Location: Tehran, Iran
    


Details: Iranian Air Force pilots were scrambled to intercept a UFO that was also tracked by radar. The pilots reported instrumentation failures and communications blackouts when approaching the object. ""1976 Tehran UFO incident: Nothing beats this one. Military personals, radars and civilian plane encountered the UFO.""



Location: Los Angeles, California, USA
    


Details: During World War II, the military fired anti-aircraft artillery at a large object in the sky, which was illuminated by searchlights. The event was widely reported by the media and involved numerous civilian witnesses. ""The Battle of Los Angeles where the military had to resort to using AA weapons against a 'weather balloon'.""



Location: Chicago, Illinois, USA
    


Details: Airline employees and witnesses reported a disc-shaped object hovering over Gate C17 at O'Hare International Airport. The FAA initially dismissed the reports but later acknowledged the incident. ""I heard the Chicago O'Hare ufo was pretty legit but all the evidence disappeared.""



Location: Varginha, Minas Gerais, Brazil
    


Details: Multiple witnesses reported seeing a strange creature and a UFO crash. The Brazilian military allegedly captured several creatures and covered up the incident. ""Finally in the 90's what appeared to be a malfunctioning ship was sighted near Varginha, MG.""



Location: McMinnville, Oregon, USA
    


Details: A local farmer and his wife took two photographs of a metallic, disc-shaped object in the sky. The photos have been extensively analyzed and remain a subject of debate. ""Good picks. Please add the McMinnville photos.""



      These sightings represent some of the most compelling and well-documented cases in UFO history, supported by multiple witnesses, radar data, and official investigations. While skepticism is healthy, these incidents have left many convinced that there is something truly inexplicable happening in our skies.

The UK will spend nearly $270 million on equipping troops it plans to deploy in Ukraine after a ceasefire is reached, British Defense Secretary John Healey announced during a trip to Kiev on Friday.

Russia has repeatedly said it would not allow Western soldiers to be stationed in Ukraine and has warned that it would treat foreign troops as legitimate targets.

Nevertheless, Healey said the funds would be invested in units intended to form part of a multinational force aimed at providing “long-term security guarantees” to Ukraine.

“We are surging investment into our preparations following the prime minister's announcement this week, ensuring that Britain's Armed Forces are ready to deploy and lead the Multinational Force Ukraine, because a secure Ukraine means a secure UK,” Healey said.

Ukrainian Defense Minister Denis Shmigal said after the meeting that the UK would begin producing 1,000 Octopus interceptor drones per month in February and deliver them to Ukraine.

Despite their continued support for military aid, some European countries, including Germany and Italy, have refused to commit to sending troops to the country.

NATO members Hungary and Slovakia have declined to send weapons to Kiev, urging the West to focus on diplomacy instead. The US, which has been attempting to mediate a truce between Russia and Ukraine, has also ruled out sending American soldiers to the country.

The Russian Foreign Ministry reiterated on Thursday that Moscow would treat “the stationing of military units, sites, depots and other Western infrastructure in Ukraine as a foreign intervention posing a direct threat to Russia's security.”

Assuming flight conditions are good, there would be a region around the wire (line of charge) with an electric/magnetic field that the drones could use, any shielding notwithstanding.

reply

Drones consume a lot of power while in flight. You can get a little bit of power out of powerlines standing underneath them with some tricks, but it's not enough to keep a drone in flight. At least not without something prohibitively large to couple to the line.It's also risky to hover near a stationary object because the longer you hover, the more you're exposed to the risk of a wind gust knocking you into the nearby obstacle.

You get a million times more power if you can put a coil 1mm away from the wire than if you hover 1 meter away.

I can't say,  as a citizen,  that I'm particularly excited about this.> Autonomous drones can deliver over 20x the inspection coverage for the same cost.And we have 20x the manpower to review this footage?  I wonder if you're just generating a bunch of data that cannot be practically used.""More coverage"" isn't always the best answer.  ""Better informed coverage"" is probably the problem to solve here.  Aside from that what is the maintenance interval on those drones?  How does that incorporate into this system?I think this is solving the problem in the wrong direction.

And in most cases of inspection, you need to look at the stuff anyway, so any cost reduction is very welcome. And if you do increase the total coverage volume while reducing human time, you get a double benefit of being able to provide more granular information, either in time or in space, which can often be useful.(And as a commenter below notes - this all works pretty well with several year old CNNs. We use a limited amount of image-LLM stuff to surface things zero-shot, but a lot of what we end up doing is a very conventional classifier with a lot of engineering work to make it very fast for the experts to see only the important things.)

I was involved with a startup that did inspections of power generation windmills.  The computer vision anomaly detection was really good and that was about five years ago.  The goal was to have the automated visual inspections route images with suspected anomalies to humans for review and it was working well the last time I heard.Compared to having a human who needs to rappel down to the blades for a manual inspection, this is a huge productivity and safety boost.

They rewrite the functions on the fly. I.e. if Mouse4 is ""navigation back"" by default and you ""set"" it in the software to ""Keyboard button A"" then the software running on your computer (not the mouse) rewrites ""navigation back"" to ""keyboard button A"" on the go.It's so bad what if you CPU is hogged then sometimes you would occasionally get the ""real"" button function (ie navigation back) instead of the ""reprogrammed"" one. Or sometimes - both.It's utter bullshit of the design and the reason I threw that shit in the wall on day 2 and went  to the store to buy Razer DeathAdder V2 HyperSpeed (R)(TM). Despite the ridiculous name and quite shitty application - most of the functions are actually stored on the mouse (besides some macro things, which is a pity, but again...).Oh, by the way, the software I installed on my notebook to ""program"" that Logishit kept working, downloading updates, updating and not deleting the previous versions. I suddenly got ""low disk space warning"" and was like... what? And then I found this Logishit spent 20GBs of space for it. For doing nothing. Literally nothing.But what is really puzzling is why @dghlsakjg is defending Logitech here. Maybe he has their stock or have some form of so called Stockholm syndrome.

                Reading time 2 minutes
      

On Saturday, Indonesia, the fourth most populous country on Earth, apparently issued a temporary block of the the Grok chatbot, with Meutya Hafid, Indonesia's minister of communication and digital affairs saying in a statement, “The government views the practice of non-consensual sexual deepfakes as a serious violation of human rights, dignity, and the security of citizens in the digital space.” As of this writing, it was not readily apparent what if anything was actively blocked in Indonesia. Local X accounts in Indonesia were still able to communicate with the source of the headline-grabbing deepfakes: the Grok X account. The bot at that account was, however, replying to users in Indonesian, saying it was restricted, and that it was obeying the restrictions. Grok's images were still available on X with my location set to Indonesia with a VPN, and when I tried to access Grok.com from Indonesia—again, via VPN—the page still loaded. Assuming this block has some actual effect, Indonesia is the first, and so far only, country to take action against Grok over deepfakes. According to one report, countries and regions where government agencies have taken steps to publicly scrutinize, caution about, or condemn Grok's recent spate of non-consensual sexual images—including images of underage people—includes the EU, the UK, France, Germany, Italy, Sweden, India, Malaysia, and Australia.About a day earlier, Elon Musk's X provided a slight tweak to Grok following the global deepfake backlash: whereas Grok had formerly generated images in response to X posts from anyone who tagged @grok, it now only provides this level of convenience to paying X users, although free users can still generate images at the Grok website. Grok is the flagship product of Elon Musk's xAI, which is technically the parent company of the X social media platform. Indonesia is sometimes called “the world's third-largest democracy,” particularly by people closely tied to U.S. diplomats, since it typically has close ties to the US. The current administration is on friendly terms with President Trump. In addition to ranking fourth in raw population, it also ranks fourth in number of internet users. The Guardian notes that the Indonesian digital affairs ministry has invited X to discuss the Grok ban.

When reached for comment, Grok parent company xAI replied, as it does to all emails, “Legacy Media Lies.”
