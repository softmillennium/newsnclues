                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Over time, however, these stem cells begin to accumulate epigenetic changes. These are chemical tags attached to DNA that work like on and off switches, controlling which genes stay active and which are turned down. The scientists identified a process they call ACCA (Aging- and Colon Cancer-Associated) drift, a gradual shift in epigenetic markers that becomes stronger as people age. "We observe an epigenetic pattern that becomes increasingly apparent with age," says Prof. Neri, formerly a group leader at the Leibniz Institute on Aging -- Fritz Lipmann Institute in Jena. The genes most affected by this drift are those that help maintain normal tissue balance. Researchers found that the same drifting pattern appears not only in aging intestinal tissue but also in nearly all colon cancer samples they analyzed. One striking finding is that aging does not affect the intestine evenly. The gut is made up of tiny structures called crypts, each formed from a single stem cell. Through the natural process of crypt division, these regions continuously enlarge and can continue to grow over many years." Some regions remain relatively healthy, while others are more likely to produce damaged cells, increasing the chances of cancer growth. The researchers also uncovered why this epigenetic drift happens. As intestinal cells age, they take in less iron while releasing more of it. Iron (II) is essential for the proper function of TET (ten-eleven translocation) enzymes, which normally help remove excess DNA methylations. When iron levels drop, these enzymes no longer work efficiently. As a result, excess DNA methylations remain in place instead of being broken down. And the cells lose their ability to remove these markings," says Dr. Anna Krepelova. As TET activity declines, DNA methylations build up, key genes are switched off, and they "fall silent." The team showed that even mild inflammatory signals can disrupt iron balance inside cells and place additional stress on metabolism. Together, iron imbalance, inflammation, and reduced Wnt signaling act as an accelerator for epigenetic drift. Because of this, aging in the intestine may begin earlier and progress faster than scientists previously believed. In laboratory experiments using organoid cultures, miniature intestinal models grown from stem cells, researchers were able to slow or partly reverse epigenetic drift. Both approaches reactivated TET enzymes and allowed cells to start clearing excess DNA methylations again. "This means that epigenetic aging does not have to be a fixed, final state," Dr. Anna Krepelova says. Note: Content may be edited for style and length.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Astronomers analyzing fresh observations from NASA's Hubble Space Telescope and several ground-based observatories have uncovered clear signs that a recently identified companion star is shaping the environment around Betelgeuse. Researchers identified the influence of Siwarha by carefully measuring subtle changes in Betelgeuse's light over nearly eight years. These long-term observations revealed the effects of a companion star that had previously been suspected but not confirmed. This detection resolves one of the most enduring puzzles surrounding Betelgeuse. Betelgeuse is located about 650 light-years from Earth in the constellation Orion. It is a red supergiant of extraordinary size, large enough to contain more than 400 million Suns. Because it is both enormous and relatively close to Earth, Betelgeuse is one of the few stars whose surface and surrounding atmosphere can be directly studied, making it a key target for understanding how giant stars grow older, lose material, and eventually explode as supernovae. These changes are linked to a dense wake formed by the companion star. The wake appears shortly after the companion passes in front of Betelgeuse approximately every six years, or about 2,100 days, in agreement with earlier theoretical predictions. "For the first time, we're seeing direct signs of this wake, or trail of gas, confirming that Betelgeuse really does have a hidden companion shaping its appearance and behavior." Interest surged in 2020 when the star unexpectedly dimmed after what was described as a stellar "sneeze." Scientists identified two major cycles in Betelgeuse's variability: a shorter 400-day period linked to pulsations inside the star, and a much longer cycle lasting about 2,100 days. Before this discovery, scientists explored many explanations for Betelgeuse's long-term changes. Recent studies suggested that the longer cycle was best explained by a low-mass star orbiting deep within Betelgeuse's atmosphere. Although one group reported a possible detection, there was no definitive evidence until now. "The idea that Betelgeuse had an undetected companion has been gaining in popularity for the past several years, but without direct evidence, it was an unproven theory," said Dupree. Finding the wake from its companion means we can now understand how stars like this evolve, shed material, and eventually explode as supernovae." From Earth's perspective, Betelgeuse is currently eclipsing its companion star. Astronomers are planning additional observations when the companion becomes visible again in 2027. Researchers say this discovery could also help solve similar mysteries involving other giant and supergiant stars. Hubble is a collaborative project between NASA and ESA (European Space Agency). The Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, manages Hubble's scientific operations for NASA.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When bacteria in the mouth break down sugars from food, they release acids that gradually erode tooth enamel and cause cavities. They form dense, plaque-like structures known as "dental biofilms" that cling to the surface of teeth. To confirm whether these effects also occur in real mouths, a research team led by Post.doc. Yumi C. Del Rey and Professor Sebastian Schlafer at Aarhus University in Denmark carried out a clinical study. Their findings were published in the International Journal of Oral Science. The study included 12 participants who had active tooth decay. Each person received specially designed dentures that allowed researchers to collect intact dental biofilms from both sides of the jaw. Participants were asked to dip the dentures into a sugar solution for 5 minutes, followed immediately by either distilled water (as placebo) or arginine for 30 minutes. This routine was repeated three times daily, with arginine always applied to the same side. To measure acidity inside the biofilms, researchers used a pH-sensitive dye known as "C-SNARF-4." This dye allowed them to assess acidity in different areas of the biofilm. Biofilms that received arginine treatment showed noticeably higher pH levels, meaning lower acidity, at 10 and 35 minutes after exposure to sugar. These sugars make up a large portion of dental biofilms and are thought to contribute to the formation of "acidic pockets" that trap damaging acids. To identify which bacteria were present, researchers analyzed bacterial DNA using "16S rRNA gene sequencing." Biofilms treated with either arginine or placebo were largely dominated by Streptococcus and Veillonella species. However, arginine treatment led to a significant reduction in the mitis/oralis group of streptococci. These bacteria produce acid but are weak at generating alkali. Taken together, the findings show that arginine made dental biofilms less harmful by lowering acidity, altering carbohydrate composition, and reshaping the microbial community. Tooth decay affects people of all ages around the world. The researchers suggest that adding arginine to products such as toothpaste or oral rinses could help protect people who are especially prone to cavities. Because arginine is a naturally occurring amino acid produced by the body and found in many dietary proteins, it is considered safe and could even be suitable for use in children.
