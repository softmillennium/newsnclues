                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>On Saturday, Indonesia, the fourth most populous country on Earth, apparently issued a temporary block of the the Grok chatbot, with Meutya Hafid, Indonesia's minister of communication and digital affairs saying in a statement, “The government views the practice of non-consensual sexual deepfakes as a serious violation of human rights, dignity, and the security of citizens in the digital space.” As of this writing, it was not readily apparent what if anything was actively blocked in Indonesia. The bot at that account was, however, replying to users in Indonesian, saying it was restricted, and that it was obeying the restrictions. Grok's images were still available on X with my location set to Indonesia with a VPN, and when I tried to access Grok.com from Indonesia—again, via VPN—the page still loaded. Assuming this block has some actual effect, Indonesia is the first, and so far only, country to take action against Grok over deepfakes. According to one report, countries and regions where government agencies have taken steps to publicly scrutinize, caution about, or condemn Grok's recent spate of non-consensual sexual images—including images of underage people—includes the EU, the UK, France, Germany, Italy, Sweden, India, Malaysia, and Australia.About a day earlier, Elon Musk's X provided a slight tweak to Grok following the global deepfake backlash: whereas Grok had formerly generated images in response to X posts from anyone who tagged @grok, it now only provides this level of convenience to paying X users, although free users can still generate images at the Grok website. Indonesia is sometimes called “the world's third-largest democracy,” particularly by people closely tied to U.S. diplomats, since it typically has close ties to the US. The current administration is on friendly terms with President Trump. When reached for comment, Grok parent company xAI replied, as it does to all emails, “Legacy Media Lies.” Subscribe and interact with our community, get up to date with our customised Newsletters and much more.

One X user had Grok put a bikini on an image of her dead body.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>I would advocate for banning all non-necessary body modification on small children. That's like saying date rape drugs are no big deal because the victim can't remember it. And maybe the teenager doesn't want to have that identity, but now it's too late Male genital mutilation on minors for non-medical reasons should also be made illegal. However this practice has become deeply culturally ingrained, whether through religion or other custom, so it is going to be a hard slog to eradicate it worldwide. I think your claim proves too much:If you pick a different religion (my siblings and their kids are religious - not Jewish), you could similarly say "even though they're happy being raised in their religion, they have no way to know whether they would prefer to have been raised agnostic/atheist" (or some other religion)Of course that's true for many decisions parents make on behalf of their children.I am curious if folks in this thread are similarly incensed by young children having their ears pierced?

To my knowledge (having only learned about it incidentally during the pregnancy/birthing process since it wasn't a relevant decision) it didn't seem like circumcision had strong medical recommendations for or against Circumcision removes nerve endings and results in an exposed glans, which thickens the skin and further dulls its nerve endings. Comparing it to ear piercing isn't the same, which, while cartilage doesn't heal easily, there's no sexual sensation interaction and leaving piercings empty tends to reverse them over time. That's still seven deaths too many for a surgery (without anesthetics!) Tonsillectomy is also a very safe procedure, yet we don't just do them willy-nilly because any form of surgery carries its own risk, no matter how small. I think it would be better to have the debate on circumcision in the legislature/parliament, but I am not opposed to outlawing it. If the left is unwilling to throw men a bone with this issue, they will lose men as a majority left wing voting bloc forever. Also, this issue is how the left gets men back to vote for it again. If the left is unwilling to throw men a bone with this issue, they will lose men as a majority left wing voting bloc forever. What Trump has proven is that millions of single issue voters can be created on any issue if a political party desires it.Underestimating this reality will only keep political parties that depend on unwritten rules of decorum from winning more and more elections.There are now new unwritten rules of election issue decorum now. Which is to say there are no longer any unspoken rules of election issue decorum.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>OpenAI is asking third-party contractors to upload real assignments and tasks from their current or previous workplaces so that it can use the data to evaluate the performance of its next-generation AI models, according to records from OpenAI and the training data company Handshake AI obtained by WIRED. The project appears to be part of OpenAI's efforts to establish a human baseline for different tasks that can then be compared with AI models. In September, the company launched a new evaluation process to measure the performance of its AI models against human professionals across a variety of industries. OpenAI says this is a key indicator of its progress towards achieving AGI, or an AI system that outperforms humans at most economically valuable tasks. “We've hired folks across occupations to help collect real-world tasks modeled off those you've done in your full-time jobs, so we can measure how well AI models perform on those tasks,” reads one confidential document from OpenAI. OpenAI is asking contractors to describe tasks they've done in their current job or in the past and to upload real examples of work they did, according to an OpenAI presentation about the project viewed by WIRED. OpenAI says people can also share fabricated work examples created to demonstrate how they would realistically respond in specific scenarios. Real-world tasks have two components, according to the OpenAI presentation. Under a section labeled “Important reminders,” OpenAI tells the workers to “remove or anonymize any: personal information, proprietary or confidential data, material nonpublic information (e.g., internal strategy, unreleased product details).” One of the files viewed by WIRED document mentions a ChatGPT tool called “Superstar Scrubbing” that provides advice on how to delete confidential information. Evan Brown, an intellectual property lawyer with Neal & McDevitt, tells WIRED that AI labs that receive confidential information from contractors at this scale could be subject to trade secret misappropriation claims. Contractors who offer documents from their previous workplaces to an AI company, even scrubbed, could be at risk of violating their previous employers' nondisclosure agreements or exposing trade secrets. “If they do let something slip through, are the AI labs really taking the time to determine what is and isn't a trade secret? It seems to me that the AI lab is putting itself at great risk.” Firms like OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google are hiring armies of contractors who can generate high-quality training data in order to develop AI agents capable of automating enterprise work. AI labs have long relied on third-party contracting firms such as Surge, Mercor, and Scale AI to hire and manage networks of data contractors. In recent years, however, AI labs have required higher-quality data in order to improve their models, forcing them to pay more for skilled talent capable of producing it. That has created a lucrative sub-industry within the AI training world. OpenAI appears to have explored other ways of sourcing real company data. An individual who helps companies sell assets after they go out of business told WIRED that a representative of OpenAI inquired about obtaining data from these firms, providing that personally identifiable information could be removed. The source, who spoke to WIRED on condition of anonymity because they did not want to sour any business relationships, said the data would have included documents, emails, and other internal communications.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>On Friday, the company's lawyers filed a blistering response, calling the former employee a “serial liar” and stating his lawsuit “asserts false claims for improper and extortionate purposes.” The case offers a rare inside look at how employee lawsuits can become a public airing of dirty laundry from otherwise opaque internal happenings, thanks to the ubiquitous private arbitration clauses in Silicon Valley employee agreements. Bender worked as Chief of Staff to Hidary from August 2024 through July 2025, the complaint states. The company's lawyer Orin Snyder, a well-known partner at white shoe law firm Gibson Dunn, tells TechCrunch: “This case is a complete fabrication. We look forward to debunking these baseless allegations and exposing the lawsuit — as detailed in our answer — for what it is — an opportunistic and extortionate abuse of the judicial process.” The company is an AI quantum computing startup that began as a moonshot unit of Google parent company Alphabet, led at Google by Hidary. Hidary is also well-known in Silicon Valley as a longtime X Prize board member. Other billionaire investors include Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff, venture capitalist Jim Breyer, and Bridgewater hedge fund founder Ray Dalio. Bender's attorneys say in another court document that the redacted sections “describe sexual encounters and the physical condition of non-party individuals observed by Plaintiff during business travel.” In other words, the alleged incidents involve people who Bender is not suing. Various explanations exist for such a tactic, and TechCrunch couldn't ascertain what the motivations are in this case. Generally speaking, the possibilities range from protecting innocent third parties who aren't accused of wrongdoing, to a shakedown strategy — signaling that more damaging details could emerge if the defendants don't offer an acceptable settlement. The unredacted portion of the suit provides a few more general details of the allegations that were hidden: Bender is alleging that Hidary used company resources and investor funds to “solicit, transport, and entertain female companions.” In an attached exhibit of a text message from Bender, he mentions prostitutes. “The Company did not make fraudulent disclosures to investors regarding its tender offer or otherwise. Bender, for his part, alleges that the company has been trying to smear him. Sources told The Information that Hidary was using company resources to fly women he was dating on corporate jets, and that the company's revenues were far below its projections. Bender references The Information story in his lawsuit but denies he was a source for it. SandboxAQ claims he was a source and is lying about his involvement. (A copy of SandboxAQ's full corporate response, including more allegations about the employee, can be found here.) Despite any controversies, big-name investors were eager to invest in the company last year.
