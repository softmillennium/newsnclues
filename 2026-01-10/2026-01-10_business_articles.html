                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump's attack on Venezuela and threats to other countries, as well as concerns about affordability, exposed fractures within the congressional GOP this week at the start of a challenging midterm election year. Trump avoided defeat when most House Republicans declined to override the first of two vetoes of his presidency, which spiked a pair of nonpartisan infrastructure bills that would've benefited Colorado and Florida. But it was otherwise a less-than-stellar week for Trump on Capitol Hill, though Republicans are projecting confidence. "This isn't an unusual situation, particularly coming into midterm elections, where you have senators that are in tough situations," Sen. Bill Hagerty, R-Tenn., said Friday on CNBC's "Squawk Box." Still, cracks in GOP unity emerged on multiple fronts. On Thursday, 17 House Republicans broke ranks and voted with Democrats on legislation to extend enhanced Affordable Care Act tax credits for three years, despite opposition from House Speaker Mike Johnson of Louisiana and the widespread unpopularity of the Obamacare subsidies within the Republican party. The White House official said Trump opposes a three-year extension, but the vote was not viewed internally as a defeat. The enhanced tax credits were first enacted under President Joe Biden in 2021 and have been a focal point of Democratic messaging on health care and affordability. The credits expired at the end of 2025, resulting in sharply higher premiums for millions of Americans who get their health insurance on ACA marketplaces. "I have long opposed the damage the Unaffordable Care Act has done to our country, but I will not watch Wisconsinites lose health care because Democrats let their own law collapse," Rep. Derrick Van Orden, R-Wis., who voted for their extension, posted on X. Van Orden is running for reelection in a toss up district, according to Cook Political Report. Earlier on Thursday, five Senate Republicans bucked the president and joined Democrats on a procedural vote that could rein in his ability to take military action in Venezuela. Trump responded in a Truth Social post that "Republicans should be ashamed" of the senators who supported the preliminary vote and said they "should never be elected to office again." Sen. Todd Young, R-Ind., one of the members called out by Trump, declined to comment on the president's comments on Thursday. When asked if he was open to changing his stance on subsequent War Powers votes, Young told reporters, "Why would I?" Meanwhile, Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., who is retiring at the end of his term in January 2027, has found himself at odds with the administration on several fronts. On Wednesday, Tillis took aim at White House senior adviser Stephen Miller from the Senate floor, calling Miller's comments about the U.S. taking over Greenland "amateurish" and "stupid." The White House official called those remarks "disappointing." A day after U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents killed a civilian in Minnesota, Tillis also announced he was blocking all Department of Homeland Security nominees. Tillis, however, said the hold was not related to the shooting, and instead had to do with Trump's Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem so far refusing to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee. And on Thursday, Tillis and Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., secured passage of a resolution to place a plaque honoring police officers who defended the Capitol on Jan. 6 in the Senate. Language authorizing the plaque was passed into law as part of a larger appropriations bill in 2022. Trump and his Republican allies in Congress have sought to shift the narrative on Jan. 6. Officers "risked their lives to defend the United States Capitol and protect members of Congress. Their brave actions upheld the rule of law and ensured that our democratic institutions could continue to function as intended," Tillis said in a statement.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A cooling labor market, characterized by sluggish hiring and anemic job creation, made it hard for job seekers to find work in 2025, according to economists. "It's fair to say that 2025 was a hiring recession in the United States," Heather Long, chief economist at Navy Federal Credit Union, wrote in a note Friday. That recession affects both blue- and white-collar workers, she wrote. U.S. employers added 584,000 jobs last year, according to a Bureau of Labor Statistics report issued Friday. That marks the worst year for total job gains outside of a recession since 2003, according to Long. There has been little job creation since April, meaning most gains took place early in the year, she wrote. Most hiring has also been concentrated in the health-care sector, making it difficult for workers to participate across the broad labor market, economists said. "Healthcare alone accounted for roughly 69% of all job growth across 2025," Nicole Bachaud, a labor economist at career site ZipRecruiter, wrote in a note Friday. In December, 26% of all unemployed workers had been out of work for at least six months, the highest share since February 2022, according to the BLS. That's one of the lowest rates since 2013, according to Long. At that time, the so-called "great resignation" was in full swing, with job openings at record highs, pay growth at its highest in decades and workers able to leave their jobs in droves for better positions. Economists called that labor market, in which workers enjoyed considerable leverage, unsustainable over the long run. Additionally, several factors coalesced into an anemic hiring environment, Long wrote: economic policy such as tariffs, business uncertainty, over-hiring in recent years, and a reluctance to hire more workers until the use cases for artificial intelligence become clearer. While the hiring recession will likely continue in the first half of 2026, the second half should be better for job seekers, due to tax cuts, lower interest rates and a clearer tariff picture, Long wrote. There are ways for job seekers to improve their chances at landing a new position, even in a lackluster hiring environment, according to job experts. Employers and recruiters have gradually shifted to so-called "skills-based hiring," meaning they prioritize a candidate's skills and experience rather than educational attainment, said Sam DeMase, a career expert at ZipRecruiter. ZipRecruiter data shows 88% of entry-level jobs omit degree requirements in the job description, and about 70% of recently hired workers have less than a bachelor's degree, said DeMase. "Many employers want to hire folks who can hit the ground running immediately," she said. This helps candidates stand out with recruiters and make it through the automated applicant tracking systems on which employers increasingly rely to sort applications, she said. DeMase gave an example of what candidates can write to highlight value proposition: "Using my background in X, I helped companies achieve Y." Priya Rathod, a career expert at job site Indeed, recommends that applicants use artificial intelligence to match keywords in job descriptions with those in their resume. This helps applicants get through the first round of resume screening, she said. It's important for job seekers to follow employer demand, said Rathod. Workers should target certain areas of the job market that are growing, including health care, skilled trades, infrastructure and revenue-critical jobs, especially within technology, she said. "Getting hired in 2026 isn't necessarily about applying everywhere," Rathod said. "It's really about aligning your skills and where employers are actually investing." Think about transferable skills, and work to upskill via additional credentials, licenses or certifications to fill in any gaps, she said. Don't ignore the value of networking, Rathod said. Whether a person has a job, is unemployed, or has a part-time role and is looking for full-time work, "networking is always going to be one of your best friends," she said. DeMase recommends certain nuts-and-bolts resume formatting guidelines to further help make it through applicant tracking system firewalls. For instance, resumes should be in a single-column format with clearly labeled sections, including a headline, about me, achievements, work experience, areas of expertise and education, if applicable, she said. "There's a myth about the one-page resume," she said. A resume can be two pages for people with five to 10 years of experience, and three pages for those with more than 10 years of experience, DeMase said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bill Gates is as optimistic about the world's future as ever, despite the fact that we're living through "an era with so many challenges and so much polarization," the billionaire philanthropist and Microsoft co-founder wrote in a blog post on Friday. The world faces plenty of causes for concern over issues like climate change, global health and poverty, and disruptions caused by artificial intelligence, Gates wrote. However, "we are far better off than when I was born 70 years ago," wrote Gates, due particularly to innovations in technology and global health. Gates also believes that conditions will keep improving over the next two decades, especially as AI spurs new advances, he wrote: "I am still an optimist because I see what innovation accelerated by artificial intelligence will bring." The number of worldwide deaths of children under 5 years old was projected to increase by roughly 200,000 in 2025, rising for the first time in 25 years, according to a report released by the Gates Foundation in December. "Over the last 25 years, those deaths went down faster than at any other point in history. But in 2025, they went up for the first time this century..." wrote Gates. "This trend will continue unless we make progress in restoring aid budgets." The global standard of living's continued improvement depends, in part, on wealthy countries and individuals — like himself — re-committing to contribute some of their abundant resources to help those in need and reduce inequality around the world, Gates wrote. The billionaire announced plans in May 2025 to step up his own charitable giving as part of a pledge to give away "virtually all" of his wealth — which is currently estimated at $118 billion by Bloomberg — by 2045. It must also include philanthropy from the wealthy to help those in need — both domestically and globally — which should grow rapidly in a world with a record number of billionaires and even centibillionaires," he wrote on Friday. Gates' optimism is bolstered by his belief in the power of technology, particularly AI, to create new breakthroughs in medical treatments, he wrote. Gates pointed to AI-powered advances in Alzheimer's research, as well as cancer and health crises still faced by developing countries, from malaria to malnutrition. AI tutors could eventually "be like a great high school teacher," providing personalized instruction to students across all income levels and geographies, Gates said on his "Unconfuse Me" podcast in August 2023. DON'T MISS: How to build custom GPTs and use AI agents In his blog post, Gates also linked environmental issues to global equality, writing that climate change could "join poverty and infectious disease in causing enormous suffering, especially for the world's poorest people." After previously arguing for some climate research funding to be redirected to issues like poverty and health care, Gates wrote on Friday that he still plans on "investing and giving more than ever to climate work in the years ahead." AI's agricultural applications could help provide farmers in developing countries with better advice, and more adaptive crops, to help them survive the challenges of growing food in warming environments, he wrote. "Both are real risks that we need to do a better job managing," wrote Gates. Gates didn't offer any specific suggestions, but did push back against the idea that AI might significantly damage the prospects of human workers, writing that "we should be able to allocate these new capabilities in ways that benefit everyone," including the potential for shorter work weeks for some people. Such optimism stems from his belief in "two core human capabilities," he noted. "The first is our ability to anticipate problems and prepare for them, and therefore ensure that our new discoveries make all of us better off. The second is our capacity to care about each other," Gates wrote, adding that history is filled with examples of people who put "the greater good" ahead of their own personal interests. "Those two qualities — foresight and care — are what give me hope as the year begins," Gates wrote.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Business: Lululemon Athletica is a technical athletic apparel, footwear, and accessories company. It conducts its business through different channels in each market, including the company-operated stores, e-commerce, temporary locations, wholesale, outlets, a re-commerce program, as well as license and supply arrangements. Its apparel assortment includes items such as shorts, tops and jackets designed for a healthy lifestyle, including athletic activities such as yoga, running, training and most other activities. It also offers apparel designed for being on the move and fitness-inspired accessories. It operates stores in the United States, Canada, China Mainland, Australia, South Korea and others. Elliott is the most active of activist investors, engaging with companies across industries and multiple geographies. On Dec. 18, it was reported that Elliott has taken a more than $1 billion position in Lululemon and is bringing in Jane Nielsen, former CFO and COO of Ralph Lauren, as a potential CEO candidate at the company. While the company remains anchored in its core North America market (~70% of revenue), it has built a significant presence in APAC (~25%), and China specifically (18%), as well as Europe (~5%). In fact, these ancillary markets have grown quite rapidly, with APAC and Europe delivering average compound annual growth rates of 33% and 22% respectively, over the past year. This international expansion has helped drive strong overall topline growth, with sales growing from $8 billion in 2023 to $11.9 billion today. However, in that same period, the company's share price has gone down from over $500 to now below $220 per share. Growth in this core market has slowed to low single digits, and now has turned negative, with comparable sales down 5% in the most recent quarter. Further, while the China growth story resonated with investors when North America was showing continued expansion, this narrative on its own in the face of North American core uncertainty is not something that is very appetizing to public market investors. While this environment delivered years of share price appreciation, it also masked a series of strategic missteps that would later come back to bite them. Moreover, while these initiatives may have been tolerable on their own during a period of rapid growth, they ultimately distracted management from the core North America business that was key to revenue growth. This loss of focus became especially pronounced in May 2024, when the company's chief product officer resigned. Since then, product direction and design have widely been perceived to be largely centralized under McDonald. Lululemon has shifted from its historically sleek and highly functional aesthetic toward louder branding and collaborations, such as with Disney, that are not aligned with the core customer. As a result, the company's brand perception has shifted, allowing competitors like Alo and Vuori to gain momentum and begin taking share, particular among Lululemon's core customer base of young women. While store traffic and brand awareness remain high, conversion has deteriorated. These product missteps have been further compounded by broader operational issues in the areas of marketing, supply chain and corporate cost controls. Together, these issues have driven margin pressure, eroded brand momentum in North America, and ultimately contributed to the sharp decline in the company's stock price. On Dec. 11, 2025, Lululemon announced that McDonald would step down as CEO effective Jan. 31, 2026. This impending leadership transition is what set the stage for Elliott to disclose a more than $1 billion position in Lululemon and bring in Jane Nielsen, former CFO and COO of Ralph Lauren, as a potential CEO candidate at the company. It does not need a CEO who knows all the answers (if that exists) but one who will hire the best talent and institute the right processes so management can work as a team of marketers, merchandisers and product developers to come up with the solutions. At the same time by delegating these duties to competent senior executives, Nielsen will be able to also oversee the company's supply chain and corporate structure to solve the problems there and institute a cost discipline that has been absent. This is what Nielsen has experience doing at both Ralph Lauren and Coach. In 2014, when Nielsen was at Coach, the manufacturer of luxury handbags was losing out to rivals and announced that it expected same-store sales in North America to be down by a high-teens percentage in the coming year. Nielsen told investors that Coach would be back to profitability within two years. Nielsen helped Coach close underperforming stores and get inventory under control and by March 2016, the Coach brand posted its first quarterly sales increase in North America in nearly three years. In a 2024 article in The Wall Street Journal, Nielsen was quoted as saying, "The brand was bigger and better than the business was showing" — which is similar to Lululemon today. When an activist comes to a company with an idea or recommendation, they are just as happy if the company takes that recommendation or comes up with a better one. And while Elliott would like to see Nielsen as the next CEO, if the board decides on someone else who is equally qualified, Elliott will support that decision. In practicality, whoever the next CEO is will be pseudo-approved by Elliott because we have never seen a qualified CEO with options take a job like this if they knew an activist like Elliott opposed his or her appointment. First, it justifies a sense of urgency, which is needed here. Second, the firm brings to the table a more than qualified CEO candidate who is ready and willing to take on this role. Third, an activist of Elliott's stature and reputation can give the board cover in whatever decision they make. This third point is particularly important when there is an outspoken founder in the wings like Chip Wilson who has been publicly criticizing board decisions. This is very similar to Elliott's recent campaign at Starbucks, another iconic brand facing popularity, competition and image challenges with an outspoken founder not afraid to give his opinion. At Starbucks, Elliott's efforts quickly culminated in the appointment of Brian Niccol as CEO, now working to reset the company's strategy and restore investor confidence. Since Elliott engaged Lululemon, on Dec. 29, Chip Wilson has nominated three directors – Marc Maurer, the former co-CEO of On Holding AG; Laura Gentile, former chief marketing officer of ESPN; and Eric Hirshberg, former CEO of Activision, the largest segment of Activision Blizzard – for election to the board at the 2026 annual meeting. Ken Squire is the founder and president of 13D Monitor, an institutional research service on shareholder activism, and the founder and portfolio manager of the 13D Activist Fund, a mutual fund that invests in a portfolio of activist investments.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Maybe a brow gel that goes from borrowed to bought. For many men, like Daniel Rankin, makeup has transformed from something taboo into a tool to make them look less tired and more put together. Rankin, a 24-year-old advertising agent from New York who likes to shop at Sephora, told CNBC. In front of bathroom mirrors and in gym locker rooms, more men are now adding cosmetics to their routines, industry experts told CNBC. "Men's beauty is one of the last categories left where brands can likely still see easy double-digit growth potential simply by showing up," said Delphine Horvath, professor of cosmetics and fragrance marketing at the Fashion Institute of Technology. Much of the momentum is coming from Gen Z. In the U.S., 68% of Gen Z men ages 18 to 27 used facial skin-care products in 2024, a sharp jump from 42% just two years earlier, according to data from market intelligence firm Mintel. "This is no longer niche," said Linda Dang, CEO of Canada-based Asian beauty retailer Sukoshi. "Men are forming routines, that usually starts at skin care and then expands further, they are no longer just buying random products. Unlike one-off grooming purchases, makeup encourages repeat use and experimentation. A man who starts with concealer often adds primer, setting powder or tinted SPF over time, said Farah Jemai, global marketing associate lead at beauty brand Unleashia. "When men discover makeup that works, they don't use once and never again," Jemai told CNBC. Market researchers estimate that in 2022, about 15% of U.S. heterosexual men ages 18 to 65 were already using cosmetics and makeup, while another 17% said they would consider it, according to Ipsos. Industry experts say those figures are likely higher in 2026. Openness to cosmetics has grown, as the share of U.S. men who say they never wear makeup has fallen from more than 90% in 2019 to about 75% in 2024, Statista survey data show. Ulta Beauty and and Sephora have begun integrating men's complexion products into gender-neutral, skin care-first displays rather than having "Men's" aisles. Those gender-specific displays can feel intimidating or stigmatizing to some men, Horvath said. Big-box retailers like Walmart and Target have also expanded their men's cosmetics or grooming offerings. For example, in 2025, Target partnered with online streaming collective AMP, Any Means Possible, to launch TONE. The men‑forward personal care brand debuted in Target stores nationwide in July, leveraging AMP's massive Gen Z male following across YouTube and Twitch. "So many brands are now putting most of their marketing budget into influencer marketing to meet people where they already are online and make it easier to click 'buy,'" said Janet Kim, a vice president at K-beauty brand Neogen. Others are leaning into digital education to teach men what different items do. The brand War Paint sells makeup products like concealer pens, tinted moisturizers and anti-shine powders that feature QR codes on the packaging. Scanning them launches video tutorials explaining what each product does — without forcing customers to ask questions in a store. "The biggest barrier isn't price, it's uncertainty," Dang said. But the path to mass adoption isn't guaranteed. Industry analysts warn that social stigma remains high and inflation threatens to curb spending on experimental, nonessential goods. Retailers also face a steep learning curve: It is difficult to scale a market when the core customer doesn't know how to use the product. While men have worn makeup for centuries, from ancient Egypt to Elizabethan England, the modern commercial men's makeup movement traces its roots to the mid-2010s. In 2016, CoverGirl made history by appointing then 17-year-old YouTuber James Charles as its first-ever "CoverBoy," placing a male face on a mass-market cosmetics brand for the first time. Still, beauty conglomerates largely focused on women until recently, Sukoshi's Dang said. Now, a broader cultural reset around masculinity is taking place and companies are racing to monetize it, FIT's Horvath said. Social media has been the single biggest accelerant, Dang said. On TikTok and Instagram, male creators post step-by-step makeup routines, product breakdowns and before-and-after results that often emphasize subtle changes rather than dramatic looks. "You don't have to ask your sister or guess anymore. Gen Z men are also more comfortable rejecting rigid gender categories and more skeptical of marketing that frames products as inherently masculine or feminine, Horvath said. At the same time, makeup has increasingly been folded into a broader wellness and optimization culture — sometimes referred to as "looksmaxxing" — that includes fitness tracking, supplements, hair-loss prevention and longevity routines. "Many men have started framing grooming and, for some, makeup as maintenance, not vanity," Horvath said. Celebrity influence has further accelerated adoption, with stars like Harry Styles, Brad Pitt and Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson launching their own skin care and makeup brands, mirroring the trend of celebrity saturation largely seen in spirits. Johnson's brand Papatui, which launched at Target in 2024 and spans skin, hair, body and tattoo care, was created in response to ongoing questions about his grooming regimen. It now competes directly with legacy names like Clinique, L'Oréal and Kiehl's. Horvath said there is a "bifurcation" in how companies are marketing their products. Brands like War Paint and Stryx argue that men need products designed for their thicker, oilier skin, and packaged in masculine, tool-like containers that feel at home in a gym bag. But Gen Z consumers are increasingly gravitating toward gender-neutral brands like LVMH co-owned Fenty Beauty, The Ordinary and Haus Labs. "In ten years, I don't think we'll be talking about 'men's makeup' anymore," Horvath said. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Leading U.S. oil executives told President Donald Trump at the White House on Friday that Venezuela will need major reforms to attract investment. Trump said Friday the industry would invest at least $100 billion to rebuild Venezuela's energy sector with U.S. security guarantees. But the CEOs of big oil companies like ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips did not commit at the meeting to quickly re-enter Venezuela. Exxon CEO Darren Woods told Trump that the Venezuelan market is "uninvestable" in its current state. Venezuela seized Exxon's and Conoco's assets in 2007, and Caracas owes the companies billions of dollars in outstanding claims from arbitration cases. "We've had our assets seized there twice, and so you can imagine to re-enter a third time would require some pretty significant changes from what we've historically seen here," Woods told Trump at the White House. "If we look at the legal and commercial constructs and frameworks in place today in Venezuela today, it's uninvestable." Exxon is prepared to send a technical team to evaluate the current state of Venezuela's oil industry and assets, Woods said. ConocoPhillips CEO Ryan Lance congratulated Trump on ousting former President Nicolás Maduro. Lance also called for the restructuring of state-owned oil company Petróleos de Venezuela (PDVSA). "As we think that big and bold, we need to be also thinking about even restructuring the entire Venezuelan energy system including PDVSA," Lance told the president. "We're not going to look at what people lost in the past, because that was their fault," Trump said. Chevron is the only U.S. oil major operating in Venezuela through joint ventures with PDVSA. Vice Chairman Mark Nelson said Chevron has a way forward to rapidly ramp up its production, which currently stands at about 240,000 barrels per day. "We have a path forward here very shortly to be able to increase our liftings from those joint ventures 100% essentially effective immediately," Nelson told Trump. "We are also able to increase our production within our own disciplined investment schemes by about 50% just in the next 18 to 24 months." Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent indicated Thursday that the U.S. might rely more on smaller oil companies, rather than the majors, to invest in Venezuela. "The big oil companies who move slowly, who have corporate boards, are not interested," Bessent said Thursday at the Economic Club of Minnesota. "I can tell you that the independent oil companies and individuals, wildcatters – our phones are ringing off the hook," Bessent said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>You can sign up here to receive it every Friday evening in your inbox.) Berkshire's filing this week doesn't say anything about additional compensation for Abel, but the company has said it will never use its stock to pay employees. After crunching a lot of proxy numbers from MyLogIQ, The Wall Street Journal reports Abel's salary "would be the highest a chief executive running a current S&P 500 company has earned in any single year between 2010 and 2024." When those are included, Abel still tops 2024's median of just over $16 million for S&P 500 chief executives. But the Journal says, "Most of the top 100 best-paid executives received more than $25 million, when stock and other noncash awards are added." Glenview Trust's CIO Bill Stone tells the newspaper that since Abel is leading one of the S&P's 10 largest companies, "One would expect his compensation to be commensurate with that level of CEOs." While not unusual for the CEO of a very large American corporation, Abel's paycheck is a striking departure from Buffett's annual salary of $100,000 (plus another $300K or so for personal and home security services provided by Berkshire. He also typically repaid half of his salary to cover personal expenses paid for the company.) Unlike Abel, however, Buffett was, in effect, the founder of what is now a giant conglomerate, with virtually all of his current net worth of almost $150 billion generated by enormous gains for his Berkshire shares over the decades. According to the 2025 annual meeting proxy, Abel owns Berkshire shares currently valued at around $171 million. That's a "fair amount" according to investor Jonathan Boyar, but he recently told Yahoo Finance Abel should "buy an extremely large amount of Berkshire stock personally and really put his money where his mouth is." At the 2017 annual meeting, Buffett suggested his then-unknown CEO successor might be so rich "they might even wish to perhaps set an example by engaging for something far lower than ... their true market value." Or, he thought, you could "pay them a very modest amount" in cash and, unlike standard CEO option packages with a fixed strike price, give them an option with annual strike price increases to account for retained earnings, "because why should somebody retain a bunch of earnings and then claim they've actually improved the value simply because they withheld the money from shareholders." (You can watch and/or read his entire response in "Highlights from CNBC's Buffett Archive" below.) Professor Randall Peterson at the London Business School focuses on organizational behavior. He told me that when founders leave, or become less involved, with the distinctive companies they've created, those companies "start to do more things the way other people do them." Abel's big salary looks like a step toward "normalization." If Berkshire does eventually become indistinguishable from its corporate peers, however, he thinks it will be a very long process that probably won't accelerate until Buffett dies. Even though Abel has already been getting big paychecks, Buffett told CNBC last May the Iowa resident is not a "distorted individual" and "lives what would look like a normal life." Professor Peterson notes that while he can't predict Abel's specific future, there are many examples of people who start out "normal" but don't stay that way after experiencing years of great wealth. Buffett's previously unseen May interviews with CNBC will be featured in a special two-hour program, "Warren Buffett: A Life and Legacy," next Tuesday, January 13 at 7 pm ET. Berkshire Hathaway shares gained slightly during Greg Abel's first full week as CEO but lagged behind the S&P 500 by roughly one percentage point. Last year, the S&P with dividends, Buffett's standard metric, outperformed Berkshire's A shares by 7.0 percentage points. More than eight years ago, when it was not yet known who Berkshire Hathaway's next CEO would be, Warren Buffett shared his thoughts on how much that person should be paid, given his own famously small annual salary of $100,000 (plus personal protection services.) ANDREW ROSS SORKIN: Three years ago, you were asked at the meeting about how you thought we should compensate your successor. WARREN BUFFETT: There's a couple of possibilities, actually, and I don't want to get into details on them. But you may have, and I actually would hope that we would have somebody, A) who's already very rich, which they should be, if they've been working a long time and have got that kind of ability, that's very rich, and really is not motivated by whether they have ten times as much money than they and the families can need or a hundred times as much. And they might even wish to perhaps set an example by engaging for something far lower than, actually, what you could say their true market value is. But I can't blame anybody for wanting their market value. And then, if they didn't elect to go in that direction, I would say that you would probably pay them a very modest amount and then have an option which increased in value by — or increased in striking price annually — nobody does this hardly. The Washington Post company did a little bit — but would increase because it's assuming that there were substantial retained earnings every year. Because why should somebody retain a bunch of earnings and then claim they've actually improved the value simply because they withheld the money from shareholders. But they might have a very substantial one that could be exercised but where  the ... shares had to be held for a couple years after retirement so that they really got the result over time that the majority of the stockholders would be able to get and not be able to pick their spots as to when they exercised and sold a lot of stock. And it really depends who you're dealing with in terms of actually how much they care about money and having money beyond what they can possibly use.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>CNBC's Jim Cramer said Friday that investors shouldn't read too much into uneventful unemployment data, arguing that a lack of surprises on the labor front is actually giving the market room to reveal the real story: a broad-based rally spreading well beyond last year's winners. "When you get an employment report that's basically uneventful, it allows you to focus on what's really happening in the market," Cramer said. In his view, money is rotating aggressively into overlooked corners of the market, with data storage stocks among the biggest beneficiaries. Companies tied to that theme have delivered what he called breathtaking rallies, even as some of the market's former leaders struggle to gain traction. Instead, he said both companies are still humming along, but have become sources of funds as investors sell winners to buy newer opportunities. Looking ahead, Cramer said next week will be packed with catalysts, starting with the JPMorgan Healthcare Conference, where he plans to interview a dozen pharmaceutical executives. Historically, the event has been a hotbed for dealmaking, and Cramer said investors should expect a wave of merger-and-acquisition headlines. On the economic front, Tuesday's December consumer price index will matter far more than the latest labor data. Cramer said strong signs from forwarding holiday spending suggest inflation may remain sticky, setting up tension between a president eager to contain prices and consumers who have borne the brunt of inflation. Earnings season also kicks off Tuesday with JPMorgan Chase. Cramer said he expects an excellent quarter but warned that CEO Jamie Dimon is known for emphasizing risks on conference calls — a tone that has knocked the stock down before. His strategy: wait for any cautious commentary, then buy on weakness. Later in the week, Cramer expects strong results from Delta Air Lines, and sees banks as the early stars of earnings season. He highlighted Citigroup as a potential standout, while reaffirming confidence in Wells Fargo, Bank of America, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley. Cramer also said BlackRock could post strong numbers, though expectations may already be high. On the tech side, he's watching Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, whose report could finally shake sellers out of Nvidia. In the meantime, he said money continues to flow into storage and equipment plays like Western Digital, SanDisk, Micron, Seagate and Applied Materials. Cramer also flagged transport stocks, saying a solid report from J.B. Hunt would reinforce his bullish stance on FedEx.
