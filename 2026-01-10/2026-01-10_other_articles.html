                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Apparently they used sonic weapons unlike any technology that the Venezuelan government has seen before which incapacitated both their military/military radar and men. Just goes to shows that we are in fact miles ahead of other countries in terms of the technology. When it comes to the most convincing UFO sightings ever reported, Redditors have shared a variety of cases that stand out for their credibility, documentation, and the sheer number of witnesses involved. Here are some of the most frequently mentioned and highly regarded sightings: Details: Over 60 schoolchildren witnessed a craft landing in their schoolyard and several beings emerging from it. "The Ariel school incident in Africa is my favourite. Details: A JAL cargo flight crew, including the pilot and co-pilot, observed a massive UFO for over 30 minutes. The object was also tracked by ground radar. "JAL Flight 1628... What the pilot and co-pilot saw that day was also being tracked by ground radar as well." Details: US Air Force personnel stationed at RAF Woodbridge and RAF Bentwaters reported multiple nights of strange lights and a craft landing in Rendlesham Forest. Location: Off the coast of California, USA Details: US Navy pilots, including Commander David Fravor, encountered a Tic Tac-shaped object that displayed incredible speed and maneuverability. Details: Iranian Air Force pilots were scrambled to intercept a UFO that was also tracked by radar. "1976 Tehran UFO incident: Nothing beats this one. Military personals, radars and civilian plane encountered the UFO." Details: During World War II, the military fired anti-aircraft artillery at a large object in the sky, which was illuminated by searchlights. "The Battle of Los Angeles where the military had to resort to using AA weapons against a 'weather balloon'." Details: Airline employees and witnesses reported a disc-shaped object hovering over Gate C17 at O'Hare International Airport. "Finally in the 90's what appeared to be a malfunctioning ship was sighted near Varginha, MG." Details: A local farmer and his wife took two photographs of a metallic, disc-shaped object in the sky. The photos have been extensively analyzed and remain a subject of debate. These sightings represent some of the most compelling and well-documented cases in UFO history, supported by multiple witnesses, radar data, and official investigations. While skepticism is healthy, these incidents have left many convinced that there is something truly inexplicable happening in our skies.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Astronomers spotted nine galaxies with characteristics that have never been seen as a collection before. It's possible this is a newly found type of star-forming galaxy. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. A new category of space objects dubbed "platypus galaxies" is defying explanation. These nine strange cosmic objects, spotted in archival data from the James Webb Space Telescope, cannot easily be characterized by their features. They are small and compact, but they don't appear to host active supermassive black holes or to be quasars, enormous black holes that glow as brightly as galaxies, according to new research. "The detailed genetic code of a platypus provides additional information that shows just how unusual the animal is, sharing genetic features with birds, reptiles, and mammals," Yan said in a statement describing the research, which is available as a preprint via arXiv. "Together, Webb's imaging and spectra are telling us that these galaxies have an unexpected combination of features." "You think that these things should not exist together, but there it is right in front of you, and it's undeniable," he said. For example, typical quasars — which are extremely luminous and energetic objects — have emission lines in their spectra that look a bit like hills. Although some galaxies with narrow and sharp spectra have supermassive black holes in their centers, unlike that group, the new galaxies don't look like "points" in the images. Get the world's most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. So if the mysterious objects aren't quasars and they don't host supermassive black holes, what are they? One possibility is that they represent a newly found type of star-forming galaxy that populated the early universe, which JWST is optimized to see. "From the low-resolution spectra we have, we can't rule out the possibility that these nine objects are star-forming galaxies," Sun said. The strange thing in that case is that the galaxies are so tiny and compact, even though Webb has the resolving power to show us a lot of detail at this distance." If that's the case, it may be that JWST is looking at a type of even earlier galaxies than have ever been spotted. ': Scientists spot massive group of ancient galaxies so hot they shouldn't exist —James Webb telescope finds that galaxies in the early universe were much more chaotic than we thought "I think this new research is presenting us with the question, how does the process of galaxy formation first begin?" "Can such small, building-block galaxies be formed in a quiet way, before chaotic mergers begin, as their point-like appearance suggests?" Luckily, JWST is still early in its observing lifetime.

Astronomers looking at data from the JWST, humanity's most powerful space telescope, have found a number of objects in the distant universe so odd that they have been dubbed "platypus galaxies". JWST has allowed astronomers to look back further into the past than any other infrared or optical telescope, seeing infrared light that was emitted by distant galaxies just 280 million years after the Big Bang. With the infrared telescope, we were hoping to learn more about the formation of galaxies, as well as clear up mysteries about how supermassive black holes became so large. One such surprise is the tiny, bright red points of light that appear to be dotted throughout the early universe, around 600-800 million years after its birth, which have come to be known as Little Red Dot (LRD) galaxies. But this was at odds with how cosmological models expect galaxies to form – as small clouds of dust and stars that grow larger over long periods of time. "It was the fact that a significant fraction of LRDs being point-like in the high-resolution JWST images inspired a simple question that we intended to address: are there any other new kinds of objects among point-like sources that we did not notice previously?" the team explains in their study, which has not yet been peer reviewed. Looking at these objects, which emitted their light when the universe was just over a billion years old, the team found they didn't fit neatly into any known category of space object. On the one hand they are extremely tiny and compact, like a point source, yet we do not see the characteristics of a quasar, an active supermassive black hole, which is what most distant point sources are,” principal investigator Haojing Yan said in a NASA press release. You think that these things should not exist together, but there it is right in front of you, and it's undeniable." These "platypus" objects are point-like, like quasars, but their spectral emission lines look sharp and jagged. GPs are compact galaxies at low redshifts (z ≲ 0.4) that have extremely strong emission lines, which make them green in the color composite of optical images," the team explained in their paper. "However, there are still notable differences that distinguish our objects from GPs," the team continues. While GPs appear to be unresolved in ground-based images, those that have HST images all show that the GP regions are embedded in extended hosts, which often have complex morphologies indicative of mergers." If that is the case, we could be looking at very early galaxy formation. “I think this new research is presenting us with the question, how does the process of galaxy formation first begin?" "Can such small, building-block galaxies be formed in a quiet way, before chaotic mergers begin, as their point-like appearance suggests?” "If they are confirmed to be SF [star-forming] galaxies, they likewise will constitute a new kind because of their pointlike morphologies and young ages, which will imply that they began their star formation secularly (and in isolation) from a very compact core, which is in line with a monolithic collapse," the team added in their paper. More observations are needed to determine what these objects are, before we get too excited about seeing how galaxies begin. "If these objects are really a new type of galaxy, it tells us we've been missing part of the story,” Bangzheng "Tom" Sun, a graduate student in Yan's lab and co-author of the study, added in a separate statement.

A new kind of circus is captivating audiences in Fort Myers, promising a blend of horror, comedy, and classic circus acts. Paranormal Cirque II has arrived at JetBlue Park, offering a unique experience that combines laughter with chills. "Last night, we found out that it was paranormal, so now we're, like, freaking out, but I'm kind of excited," she said. My girlfriend came a week ago, so she said it was really good," they said, adding, "No, you can't scare me." "This is our show's first time in Fort Myers," said Copeland. "They're going to scare the heck out of you, and then they're going to amaze you during our show." Stacy Brucci, another audience member, shared her curiosity. "I can't imagine Cirque du Soleil with all the horror. So it's gonna be interesting," she said. Copeland explained the show's appeal, saying, "There's a little bit of everything. Here's a little bit of something for everyone. He also reflected on the joy of entertaining. They can come enjoy some controlled fun horror, and I get to laugh and make them forget their problems for a couple of hours," said Copeland. Paranormal Cirque II will be at JetBlue Park in Fort Myers through Monday.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The statue once marked a grave and was created around 100 BC. Many inventions beyond their time are associated with the ancient Greek civilization, but the laptop was certainly not one of them…until now. Of course, historians have dismissed the theory as nonsense and provided more grounded explanations, suggesting that the object in the statue may be a box or wax tablet. In one viral YouTube video, an uploader claims that the ancient Greek statue “depicts an astonishing object that bears a striking resemblance to a modern laptop or some handheld device”. They dismissed more feasible explanations, arguing that the container's base is too shallow to be a jewellry box. In 2016, the Daily Mail published an article questioning whether the funerary statue was indeed proof that a time traveler had brought back a laptop to ancient Greece. Back in 2016, archaeologist Kristina Killgrove wrote in Forbes debunking the theory that the ancient Greeks had somehow come across advanced computer technology. “These stelai were carved in relief, and were almost always painted, although the painting doesn't survive in most cases.” This is a rather typical trope in funeral stelai, the image of a wealthy adult woman reaching to a servant, and may have reflected her family's desire for her to retain her status into the afterlife,” continued Killgrove. Killgrove suggested a variety of more tangible explanations for what the object held by the woman in the statue may have been, including a wax tablet or some kind of jewellery box or other container. Rather than being USB ports, the holes on the side of the container may have originally been used to hold wooden items that have long since rotted away. It is also possible that the holes were made during efforts to rework or copy the sculpture. Other parts of the stele are missing, so this is certainly a plausible explanation.
