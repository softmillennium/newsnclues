On Monday, Bishop William Barber and other religious leaders gathered in Charlotte to demand an end to ICE raids. “​​What you have is a conglomerate of policy violence, and it's deadly,” says Barber, who is organizing protests against ICE and Medicaid cuts across the country. Barber notes that 51,000 people may die from preventable deaths because of the so-called Big Beautiful Bill, according to research from the University of Pennsylvania and Yale. This is literally about life versus death.” Copy may not be in its final form. AMY GOODMAN: This is Democracy Now!, democracynow.org. I'm Amy Goodman, with Juan González. On Monday, Bishop Barber and other religious leaders gathered in Charlotte. BISHOP WILLIAM BARBER II: So, they hit North Carolina with ICE raids, and they hit North Carolina with ICE raids right at the same time people are raising concerns about Medicaid and healthcare and racist voter redistricting. And some people think that that means what we have to do is go to the ICE raids and forget about the other things. But what we know in this movement is it all connects. RELIGIOUS LEADERS: It all connects, yes. AMY GOODMAN: That was Bishop William Barber speaking Monday in Charlotte, North Carolina, joining us now from North Carolina. Can you talk about the protests around immigration raids, and then what you're talking about when it comes to healthcare and other issues right now? BISHOP WILLIAM BARBER II: Well, thank you so much. We had a Moral Monday in 20 states yesterday. We were in Charlotte because the ICE raids came. We went there to deliver “Liberty Vans,” which is a concept through the Save America Movement. Steve Schmidt and others have come together. These vans, on public ground, travel constantly to film what ICE is doing, that news may not get a hold of, and to put it out there and also to document the trauma that people are going through. But we also gathered hundreds of people right there in that church, and thousands online, who are saying that when you look at the ICE raids and then the raiding of Medicaid for millions of people, the raiding of food stamps for millions of people, and, in North Carolina, the raiding of our voting rights, what you have is a — is a conglomerate of policy violence, and it's deadly. But also, we know 51,000 people are scheduled to — may die from preventable deaths because of what has happened in the Big Beautiful — big, ugly, destructive bill. And the reason, Amy, we keep raising that is because that same bill, that cut 16 million people's healthcare, 22 million people's food stamps, takes that cut and then puts $160 billion into ICE agents. They're hiring more agents with masks. And we recognize that we have to connect this together, and we have to stand strong together, and it has to be a moral issue. We cannot let this merely be a issue between Democrats or Republicans. We had clergy from everywhere, as well as activists, as well as impacted people, on Monday night, who are determined for the long haul and who understand what policy murder, policy violence, policy destruction looks like, and why, in this moment, we must raise it like never before. And we're talking about long term. This is literally about life versus death. JUAN GONZÁLEZ: And, Reverend Barber, in Chicago, everyone from the governor on down to all the community organizations finally succeeded in basically pushing ICE out of the city, at least temporarily. What's your sense of the kind of solidarities that are being built between Black and Brown communities in North Carolina right now? BISHOP WILLIAM BARBER II: Well, Black and Brown and white, you know, people are coming together. We had Christian in the room. You know, sometimes what happens is, pain that is caused by powerful politicians who forget that what they ought to be doing is picking up humanity rather than pulling down humanity, it actually has a reversal effect, and it makes people come together, because it's so blatant and so ugly, so harsh and so mean. And that's what we see happening. And people are not believing that ICE has ever gone anywhere. They are saying they may go underground, they may stop for a minute, but just like what you see in Charlotte, the people that were planning there, even before we went down on Monday, they've been planning. And get ready by connecting the dots. Get ready by connecting the dots. We must organize this pain, the same pain that is caused by millions of people losing healthcare, millions of people losing their food stamps, millions of people's voting rights being challenged, millions of people without living wages, and millions of immigrants being challenged and harmed and deported. We must connect all of that pain into a powerful movement. And then, lastly, Amy, this is not new. This has a deep American history. And we must do it together. AMY GOODMAN: And as we move into this holiday weekend, people should remember, according to Feeding America, one in five children are going hungry in the United States. That does it for our show.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Exclusive: Former US secretary of state calls for more demanding steps from Australia as it takes over presidency of next year's UN climate summit Follow our Australia news live blog for latest updates Australia's government, which will preside over the next UN climate summit, should gather the world's 25 biggest greenhouse gas emitting countries and push them to draw up a roadmap to end the era of fossil fuels, former US secretary of state John Kerry has said. Only by “hard-nosed” confrontation with fossil fuel producers, and reducing their consumption in major economies, would the world be able to tackle the climate crisis, he said. Australia's climate change and energy minister, Chris Bowen, has been given the role of “president of negotiations”, even though the Cop31 climate summit will be held in Turkey, after the two countries agreed to compromise on hosting arrangements. Only if you get China, Russia, the US, India and Europe together and they decide to really do the transition [to a clean economy] everyone else will follow.” The US under Donald Trump was also unlikely to take part without severe pressure. But Kerry said: “I think some fossil fuel producers will set a roadmap.” Everyone has to run out of patience with the games that are being played.” Australia will host the Cop31 meeting next November, after Cop30 in Brazil ended last Saturday with only a partial deal that omitted direct mention of the “transition away from fossil fuels” that countries are supposed to be embarked on, but allowed for a voluntary initiative for willing countries to start drawing up a roadmap for the phaseout. Kerry has personal experience of tough negotiations with both China and Saudi Arabia, which is what leads him to believe a fossil fuel roadmap is possible. At the Cop28 summit in Dubai in 2023, nations agreed for the first time to “transition away from fossil fuels”, but they set no end date or process for it. Kerry, as US presidential climate envoy, helped broker that deal at a climactic meeting with Saudi Arabia's oil minister Prince Abdulaziz in the early hours of the final morning after a marathon all-night negotiating session. In January, Kerry will visit the UAE and Saudi Arabia to push his ideas further. Australia also must “do proper spadework” in preparing the ground for Cop31, Kerry warned, unlike what happened at Cop30, when the idea was only really championed by a group of more than 80 developed and developing countries halfway through the process. “It was a shame they did not try earlier to begin the process with the fossil fuel [roadmap] and then build it up at Cop,” he said. [They need to] respect other countries' positions, and what is possible for them.” “Mother Nature is going to make it crystal clear,” he said. “You will have to show your people how you will keep them alive at 50C, or where their food and water is going to come from. But he also spoke of the run-up to Cop30, in which countries were supposed to set out strengthened plans on cutting their emissions, in line with the goal of limiting global heating to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, with that of Cop26, where the last round of plans were to be unveiled. “Raising ambition [on emissions cuts] was the whole focus of our diplomacy,” he said. Though Kerry did not allude to it directly, Brazil claimed frequently ahead of Cop30 that the national plans – called nationally determined contributions (NDCs) – were nothing to do with the Cop presidency. “By not achieving something concrete, the Cops get discredited,” Kerry warned. Kerry also enjoyed a warm relationship with China's climate envoy, Xie Zhenhua. “I do not feel that kind of effort of diplomacy [from developed countries towards the Chinese] was made in the walk-up to this Cop,” he said. Already, with insurers refusing to insure homes at threat in Florida, Texas, Louisiana and other US states, people were facing higher mortgage rates or the possibility of not being able to buy or stay in their homes. “If you say to people, you could save money on energy and here is what you will have to spend on your mortgage [if we stick with fossil fuels], then people will begin to understand the practicalities.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>I believe that is (US President Donald) Trump's logic. Petro has been at odds with Trump since he returned to the White House. In response to Petro's comments, a US State Department spokesperson said the Trump administration remains “firm in its counter-drug operations in the Caribbean and its commitment to protecting Americans from the (Venezuelan President Nicolás) Maduro regime's deadly poison.” CNN has also reached out to the White House for comment. The sanctions were imposed days after Trump said he would halt all US payments and subsidies  to Colombia, claiming Petro “does nothing to stop” the production of drugs in his country. Petro defended his efforts to fight the drug trade, telling CNN that his government had seized more cocaine than any other in history. “So much so that in recent years, I have managed to ensure that the growth in crops, which is stagnating, is far surpassed by the growth in seizures,” he said. Asked why Trump hadn't acknowledged this, Petro said: “Because of pride. Petro also told CNN that he believes the US is comparing him to Maduro. His comments come a day after the US designated the Cartel de los Soles, an alleged drug trafficking group that the US has claimed Maduro leads, as a foreign terrorist organization. Venezuela has denied the claims, and experts say the phrase is more a description of allegedly corrupt government officials than an organized crime group. While Maduro has a problem with democracy, Petro said he is not that convinced about the Venezuelan president's drug trafficking links. “The problem of Maduro is called democracy … the lack of democracy,” Petro told CNN, adding that “no Colombian investigation … has shown us a relationship between Colombian drug trafficking and Maduro.” According to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), Venezuela is not a cocaine-producing country. Investigators from the US Drug Enforcement Agency reached similar conclusions, writing in their annual report published in March that 84% of the cocaine seized in the US comes from Colombia. Over the weekend, Colombian news program Noticias Caracol reported alleged links between Colombian officials and dissidents of the now-defunct rebel group FARC. Petro has denied the allegations but acknowledged to CNN on Tuesday that ties between officials and drug traffickers have existed for years, even before he took office. A spokesperson for the US State Department said it is aware of the recent reports and urged Petro and other Colombian institutions to “thoroughly investigate these allegations and take all appropriate actions.” Colombia has long been Washington's most reliable ally in South America on security and defense. Despite recent tensions at the top, US-Colombia relations remain intact. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio has made clear publicly that the administration's issues are with Petro, not the institutions in Colombia. “Our relationships with the people of Colombia, the economic sector of Colombia, the majority of people in politics in Colombia, and their institutions, in particular their defense institutions, are strong and enduring, and they're going to be strong and enduring long after this individual is no longer the president there,” Rubio previously said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bruna Ferreira, who has a child with the White House press secretary's brother, is now in custody at an ICE facility Bruna Ferreira, a Boston-area resident who migrated with her family to the US from Brazil as a child, is now in custody at an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility in Louisiana, according to the Boston radio station WBUR, which first reported the arrest. The White House press secretary's brother, Michael Leavitt, 35, had a relationship with Ferreira, 33, and they had a son, Michael Leavitt Jr, aged 11. Ferreira's sister, Graziela Dos Santos Rodrigues, told the outlet that the agents demanded her name and driver's license, but Ferreira did not have an identification card. A White House source familiar with the situation said: “This individual is the mother of Karoline's nephew and they have not spoken in many years. The child has lived full time in New Hampshire with his father since he was born. They added: “Under President Trump and Secretary Noem, all individuals unlawfully present in the United States are subject to deportation.” Tricia McLaughlin, the Department of Homeland Security spokesperson, said in a statement to WBUR that Ferreira had a “previous arrest for battery”. At a minimum, Ferreira's detention and likely deportation has brought home the close or casual connections many Americans have to the administration's immigration crackdown. Leavitt, the 28-year-old New Hampshire native, is best known for her high-ranking role as Trump's spokesperson. When Trump entered office for a second time in January, Leavitt made history by becoming the youngest-ever White House press secretary. Less is known about her brother except that he won $1m in a DraftKings fantasy sports contest in 2014, according to The North Andover Eagle Tribune. Ferreira's attorney, Todd Pomerleau, told CNN that his client had been arrested on 12 November and was currently in the middle of a “lawful immigration process” for US citizenship. Ferreira has maintained her legal status through Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (Daca), a program which grants temporary protection from deportation for those who entered the country as children, according to the post. As of Wednesday morning, more than $16,000 has been raised. “She is hardworking, kind, and always the first to offer help when someone needs it,” Dos Santos Rodrigues wrote. “Whether it's supporting family, friends, or even strangers, Bruna has a heart that puts others before herself.” The Associated Press reported on Tuesday that Daca recipients have been among those detained in immigration sweeps, although steps taken by Trump to end Daca during his first term were blocked by the supreme court. In a recent statement to the Associated Press, McLaughlin said those with status under the Obama-era program “are not automatically protected from deportations”, adding, “Daca does not confer any form of legal status in this country.”</p>

Support justice-driven, accurate and transparent news — make a quick donation to Truthout today! A newly published study reveals that a certain kind of gender-affirming care for transgender kids and young adults likely lowers rates of suicidality among those populations. Patients who were set to receive gender-affirming care filled out Ask Suicide-Screening Questions (ASQ) surveys prior to receiving hormone therapy (HT) treatment, then repeated the questionnaire at future visits. Upon examining the results, the study found that suicidality among these patients “significantly declined from pretreatment to post-treatment,” and was “consistent across sex assigned at birth, age at start of therapy, and treatment duration.” What's more, of the hundreds of patients who started hormone therapy, only seven discontinued their treatment, with four saying they had a “shift in gender identity” (while still identifying as gender diverse), and one stopping out of concerns over “hair loss.” Two stopped for unknown reasons. These study findings provide clinical evidence supporting the mental health benefits of timely access to HT in this population. In response to the study, trans rights journalist Erin Reed wrote, “gender-affirming care saves lives.” Such care “remains one of the most effective interventions available for transgender youth who need it,” Reed added. Last week, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) updated a questionable study it published in May that claimed such care caused children more harm than good. The report did not include authorship when it was first released.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Quality journalism takes work — and a community that cares. This is Jared Goyette, reporting from Kyiv on a foggy November day. While news coverage and public discussion focus on the peace negotiations, the front lines continue to boil, as Russia's full-scale invasion enters its 1,372nd day. Russian forces have completed the capture of two villages, Promin in Donetsk Oblast, and Vysoke in Zaporizhzhia Oblast, Ukrainian analytical and mapping group DeepState reported on Nov. 26. While leaked reports of a U.S.-proposed peace plan have sparked international debates about the future of Ukraine`s occupied territories and the people who live there, Russia is forging ahead, entrenching its control on the ground by expanding illegal mobilization. On the ground, that translates into forcing civilians and prisoners of war (POWs) to join its military and systematically preparing children for future service, experts said at a Nov. 25 roundtable in Kyiv organized by The Reckoning Project, a global war crimes documentation initiative that was initially created in response to Russia's full. Researchers with the initiative described how  Moscow has built a full-scale system of militarization in occupied areas — from indoctrination in schools and youth camps to the coercion of men and Ukrainian POWs into combat. "Since 2015, Russia has been systematically preparing Ukrainian society under occupation for participation in hostilities. Ukrainian officials are pushing back against Russian claims and social media rumors that Ukrainian troops near Huliaipole in Zaporizhzhia Oblast are encircled: front-line units remain supplied, and medical evacuation routes continue to function despite heavy fighting, the Southern Defense Forces said in a statement on Nov. 26. The command accused Moscow of exaggerating its “so-called successes” and magnifying problems in Ukraine's ranks to sow panic. Over the past day, Russian forces carried out more than 30 assaults, over 500 artillery strikes using more than 2,100 rounds, about a dozen airstrikes, 250 drone drops and nearly 2,000 kamikaze drone attacks in the Huliaipole sector, according to the statement. The update comes as Russian forces continue to press the front in Zaporizhzhia Oblast, where Ukrainian troops have pulled back from some positions amid intense fighting. In a previous Kyiv Independent anlysis of the Zaporizhzhia front on Nov. 12, we reported that, according to figures published by the highly trusted Ukrainian mapping and analytical organization Deep State, 69% of all Russian territorial gains in October were made in the area around Huliaipole and in eastern Zaporizhzhia and Dnipropetrovsk oblasts, even though the area saw only 16% of Russia's total assault operations, based on General Staff data. In the afternoon, Ukraine's General Staff claimed to have struck the VNIIR-Progress factory in the city, which manufacturers navigation equipment and other electronics for an array of Russian weapons, including Shahed-style strike drones, cruise and ballistic missiles, and glide bomb kits. At least one person has been killed and 37 others injured in Russian attacks against Ukraine over the past day, local arthritis reported on Nov. 26. Ukraine's Air Force said Russia attacked overnight with two Iskander-M ballistic missiles launched from Russia's Rostov Oblast and 90 attack drones of various types, including around 55 Shaheds. Ukrainian air defenses shot down or suppressed 72 of the drones, while missile and drone strikes were recorded at 10 locations, the Air Force said on Telegram. In southern Zaporizhzhia Oblast, 19 people were injured when Russian forces carried out 11 airstrikes on the city of Zaporizhzhia and struck other parts of the region over the past day, Zaporizhzhia Governor Ivan Fedorov said on Telegram. In southern Kherson Oblast, seven people, including a child, were injured over the past day as Russian forces hit at least four apartment blocks and 21 private houses in towns and villages across the region, Governor Oleksandr Prokudin said on his official Telegram channel Doctors are treating him for a concussion and blast-related head injuries. In Kharkiv Oblast, a 51-year-old man who had been injured in the Nov. 23 mass drone attack on Kharkiv died in hospital overnight, increasing the death toll from that strike to five, Kharkiv Governor Oleh Syniehubov said on Telegram. Syniehubov separately reported that Russian forces attacked eight settlements in the region over the past day, but no new casualties were recorded from those strikes. In Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, regional authorities reported overnight drone and missile attacks on a postal facility, homes, and administrative buildings, but said there was no information on casualties as of the morning of Nov. 26 Russia has lost around 1,168,550 troops in Ukraine since the beginning of its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Staff of Ukraine's Armed Forces reported on Nov. 25. According to the report, Russia has also lost 11,372 (+4)  tanks, 23,625 (+1) armored fighting vehicles, 68,242 (+124) vehicles and fuel tanks, 34,688 (+44) artillery systems, 1,549 multiple launch rocket systems, 1,252 (+2) air defense systems, 428 airplanes, 347 helicopters, 84,960 (+743) drones, 28 ships and boats, and one submarine. According to the NABU, Timur Mindich, a close Zelensky associate, committed his crimes by influencing Rustem Umerov, former defense minister and current secretary of the National Security and Defense Council. While leaked reports of a U.S.-proposed peace plan have sparked international debates about the future of Ukraine`s occupied territories and the people who live there, Russia is forging ahead, entrenching its control on the ground by expanding illegal mobilization. "The president will give me a lot of space and discretion to get to the deal," U.S. Special Envoy Steve Witkoff told top Kremlin aide Yuri Ushakov in a recorded phone call obtained by Bloomberg. VNIIR-Progress is a Russian state institute involved in designing electronic warfare systems, including the Kometa antenna used to interfere with satellite, radio, and radar signals. U.S. President Donald Trump said on Nov. 25 that there is no specific deadline for Ukraine to accept the initially drafted 28-point proposal, easing previous statements that implied he hoped for a Thanksgiving agreement. "The deadline for me is when it's over," Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One. Ukraine has had its share of promises that were shattered by successive Russian aggressions, and real rock-solid guarantees are a necessity," French President Emmanuel Macron said. The arrests of NABU detectives in July were seen by critics as part of a crackdown on the bureau triggered by its investigations against Zelensky's top allies. "The original 28-Point Peace Plan, which was drafted by the United States, has been fine-tuned, with additional input from both sides, and there are only a few remaining points of disagreement," U.S. President Donald Trump said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>How Brian Glenn, a White House correspondent and Trump ally, found himself at the centre of a story he never expected to cover When Marjorie Taylor Greene, the flame-throwing conservative congresswoman, posted her resignation online on Friday, it upended Washington, blindsided Republicans, and shocked reporters. But even with the video completed, Ms Greene waited until the very last moment to decide whether she would set it live and in turn, throw a grenade into Donald Trump's Maga movement. And we both agreed that this is the right decision,” said Glenn, White House correspondent for the Trump-aligned Real America's Voice television station. The resignation announcement capped an extraordinary seven days of turmoil. On Nov 14, the president turned on his one-time ally over her insistence that his government publish the Epstein files in full. And in an explosive post sent from his Mar-a-Lago home he called her a “traitor”. Mr Glenn was forced into the role of Ms Greene's spokesman, counsellor and lightning rod, as she weighed whether her political career could survive. And it made for a terrifying 48 hours at their home in Rome, Georgia. On Tuesday, while nursing a cup of coffee in between live broadcasts from the White House, Glenn described the fallout. The first sign of trouble came when a pizza delivery driver arrived at their door. “Somebody's feeling us out, seeing if we are home.” At least one came from a foreign email address. And the bomb squad arrived to ensure everyone was safe. “That made her mad, because she is someone who works on an executive level like president Trump,” he said. It all meant Glenn, 56, a familiar face in the Oval Office, found himself at the centre of a story he never expected to cover. Glenn's phone exploded with messages, mostly supportive, he said. They watched together as the video ticked past a million views on social media and they spent the rest of the weekend hunkered down at home, fending off dozens of requests for interviews. The couple split their time between Washington, DC and Georgia. Friends wonder whether an engagement might follow Ms Greene's departure from Congress on Jan 5. With his tousled blond hair, Glenn has the air of a perpetually surprised schoolboy. He was once a features reporter at a local television station in Dallas, covering dog shows and state fairs but rose to prominence while Mr Trump was out of power. He covered the former president's raucous rallies, filling time between speeches, an exhausting job that at times involved broadcasting for more than seven hours. He would see Ms Greene at rallies but they became a couple three years ago after being introduced by a mutual friend. “So we were at kind of similar situations in life.” As the insults and threats piled up after Mr Trump's social media post, Glenn waded in to support his girlfriend. He posted images of them together with the message: “I love this woman. “This is a little bit more difficult to navigate,” he admitted. He said he had no intention of avoiding the president and hoped to be back asking questions soon, even if that meant listening to the president teeing off on his girlfriend. “I'm gonna look forward with a poker face, and I'm not gonna say a word,” he said, even though his instincts would be crying out to push back. He was back at the White House on Tuesday for the traditional turkey pardon, and had even instructed his team to make sure he had a spot where the president would see him. In the meantime, he is ready to shoot down stories that her resignation is part of a plan to run for president in 2028. “I think she's much more powerful actually outside of an elected position, because she can help message the party very much like president Trump did when he was out of office,” he said. Ms Greene's resignation shocked Republicans in Washington and launched a thousand theories about her motivations. No one could believe that Ms Greene, one of the most influential women in Congress and spoken about as a future vice-presidential pick, could simply quit. But there are no immediate plans for her next move, insisted Glenn.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>An exhibition dedicated to poet Vasyl Stus (1938-1985), one of the era's greatest Ukrainian dissidents, in Kyiv, Ukraine, on Nov. 13, 2025. While the Soviet authorities promoted their vision of ideological "universalism" — a homogenized identity that suppressed national cultures — dissenting voices were silenced through arrests, intimidation, and even murder. Yet amid this repression, courageous figures refused to surrender their cultural identity. The new exhibition "As Long As We're Here, Everything Will Be Fine" at Kyiv's Mystetskyi Arsenal cultural and art complex is open from Nov. 13 to Feb. 8 and celebrates Stus's legacy, In the Soviet Union, defense lawyers were often tools of the totalitarian state apparatus rather than protectors of their clients' interests. Medvechuk, who would go on to become a fugitive pro-Russian oligarch and godfather to Russian President Vladimir Putin's children, argued in court that Stus "deserved" punishment. In 1985, the same year Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev announced an "easing" of restrictions across society, Stus died under questionable circumstances after launching a hunger strike in a forced labor camp for political prisoners in Russia's Perm region. The title of Mystetskyi Arsenal's exhibition — taken from a line written in a letter by Stus to a friend — resonates not only with the plight of an anti-Soviet dissident but with the current struggles of Ukrainians living through Russia's ongoing full-scale war. This included vital materials from Kyiv's Sixtiers Museum, dedicated to the anti-Soviet dissident movement of Stus' time. Stus scholars, his relatives and friends, private collectors, and other individuals were also involved in the behind-the-scenes work to bring the exhibition to life. During this time a new field — Stus Studies — has been created, and it is perhaps one of the largest bodies of work in Ukrainian culture." Despite the heavy subject matter, the process of preparing the exhibition came with pleasant surprises, according to Naidukh — like when they discovered previously unseen photos from Stus' reburial in Ukraine, after his body was repatriated from Russia. "We were fortunate to meet a woman who, as a schoolgirl in 1989, had captured unique photographs alongside her father, a photojournalist, of the reburials of Stus and fellow dissidents) Yurii Lytvyn and Oleksa Tykhyi," she said. This includes an installation that recreates a holding cell, with three concrete-framed displays that showcase artifacts such as the tiny, nearly illegible handwriting of Stus's poems later sewn into clothing by friends to be smuggled out of the Soviet Union. Playing faintly from speakers above the holding cell is a recording of Ukrainian human rights activist Nadiya Svitlychna reading Stus' pivotal work "Palimpsests" — as well as the recording of a bird singing. Its label, "Bird of the Soul," refers to the poetry collection Stus was working on before his death — a manuscript confiscated by Soviet authorities. "Dmytro Stus, Vasyl's son, tried to locate it in the Russian archives but was unsuccessful," Naidukh said. "We still don't know whether Stus' work survived or was destroyed forever."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The US and Ukraine presented a condensed peace proposal to Russian representatives in the UAE; lifting sanctions on Russia will need unanimous EU approval; and Washington presses Caracas by labeling the Cartel de los Soles a terrorist group to force political change. These stories topped Wednesday's newspaper headlines across Russia. Negotiations between the United States and Ukraine on the American peace plan continued in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) on November 24-25, following a round held in Geneva on November 23. The Financial Times (FT) was the first to report on November 25, citing sources, about US Army Secretary Daniel Driscoll's trip to Abu Dhabi, almost simultaneously with Politico and CBS News. The New York Times reported that two other prominent American negotiators - Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Special Envoy Steven Witkoff - did not fly from Switzerland to the UAE. Experts argue that Washington may be using symbolic, informal negotiations to pressure Moscow towards concessions, Vedomosti writes. According to FT, Driscoll is conducting talks with head of Ukraine's military intelligence Kirill Budanov (listed in Russia as a terrorist and extremist), as well as with some Russian representatives. Axios, citing sources, reported that Russia was allegedly represented by the "head of military intelligence," without specifying a name. In his view, the choice of the US negotiator carries particular symbolic significance: before any official high-level meeting, Washington may seek to signal readiness to "appease" Moscow and secure concessions on several points of the peace plan. Russian authorities consider it appropriate to discuss only the document agreed upon in Alaska, Skorikov noted. "Therefore, the Europeans' proposals are not subject to discussion, as they would merely delay the peace process," he said. "EU decisions on sanctions traditionally require unanimous approval by the member states. At present, however, there is no clear timeline for easing the restrictive measures, he said. This means Brussels will be able to reinstate restrictions against Russia at any moment, even those that may be lifted. "In other words, Council of the EU Regulations No. Since 2022, the European Union has adopted 19 sanctions packages, and preparations for a new set of restrictions are already underway. The EU's promise to lift restrictions "gradually" appears too vague for now, Valdai Club expert Andrey Kortunov told the newspaper. "There are so many sanctions - tens of thousands, that it is always possible to find certain measures that can be easily lifted by an executive decision in the United States or the European Union. "The key question, therefore, is what exactly is meant by sanctions relief: which sanctions are being lifted, in what sequence, and to what extent the decision can be considered universal," he added. A decision by the US Department of State to designate the so-called Cartel de los Soles as a foreign terrorist organization has taken effect. According to US authorities, this drug cartel is allegedly headed by Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro himself. Experts interviewed by Nezavisimaya Gazeta argue Maduro's departure remains unlikely. Counterterrorism operations provide a mechanism that allows the United States to justify actions that might otherwise be viewed as violations of international law. The decision is also intended to increase psychological pressure on Maduro. CNN wrote, citing a well-informed source, that Trump hopes to achieve a change of regime in Venezuela without resorting to military action. This is because an operation would entail significant costs for the United States - militarily and in terms of the political fallout, given that it would be met negatively in many Latin American countries. Therefore, the US would prefer to resolve everything through a negotiating process. Another matter is whether Maduro himself and his inner circle are prepared for this," the expert told Nezavisimaya Gazeta. But this is a scenario in which the chavistas would be taking a major risk by relying solely on the United States," he said. Such measures would hardly provide tangible benefits to Washington, but they would at least constitute a demonstrative gesture signaling strengthened US influence in the region. As discussions of Washington's peace plan continue, Kiev has also entered into debate over the potential peacetime size of its Armed Forces. Figures of 600,000, 800,000, and even 1 mln service members are being circulated. Yet maintaining "an army of one million" under peacetime conditions would inevitably push Ukraine into default, analysts inside the country warn. According to experts interviewed by Nezavisimaya Gazeta, a million-strong Ukrainian army would be financially ruinous, strategically unacceptable to Russia, and that any realistic security arrangement should involve troop levels closer to pre-conflict norms and include broader international participation. Back in late January, speaking with journalists at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Vladimir Zelensky said that without such security guarantees as an invitation for Ukraine to join NATO or the deployment of foreign contingents on its territory, Kiev would need to expand its army to 1 mln troops. The question of financing such decisions is far from theoretical—especially at a time when Washington has announced the cessation of financial support for Kiev. And in European capitals, which had previously debated how to transfer nearly $300 bln in frozen Russian assets concentrated in the European Union, leaders must now also contend with another provision of the US plan that would effectively place control of those funds under their authority. Therefore, the level that appears adequate today would be 200,000-250,000 troops. This would allow the Ukrainian state to carry out its necessary functions, but would exclude the formation of a new military fist threatening Russia's security," Semibratov emphasized. The expert also noted that Russia and Global South countries should be included in the ongoing discussions surrounding potential security guarantees for Ukraine. US company Ramoco Fuels intends to lease all 194 Lukoil gas stations located in the United States. Experts characterize it as relatively modest, estimating the discount at roughly 50-70%. According to one of the sources, Ramoco is proposing a 24-month master lease that would automatically convert into the purchase of Lukoil's entire US retail fuel business "as soon as all regulatory, environmental, and franchising requirements have been met." Sofya Lukinova, head of the legal department at VMT Consult, told Izvestia that a lease-to-own arrangement could be viewed as a reasonably balanced solution that would allow foreign operations to continue until sanctions are lifted. "Funds received under the lease agreement would also be blocked in a special account unless OFAC authorizes their use for operational needs," she added. According to the industry portal InfoTEK, the cost of a single gas station in Europe typically ranges between €2 mln and €3 mln. The price depends on numerous factors, including location, station size, traffic volume, the presence of a convenience store, and various additional services such as a car wash or service station. Olga Orlova, head of the Industry Department at the Institute of Oil and Gas Technology, stressed that each gas station's valuation is highly individual and depends on many variables, but Ramoco Fuels' offer can clearly be considered below market, representing a discount of approximately 50-70%. In Orlova's view, the buyer's proposed structure is generally workable. It is also possible, she concluded, that all the assets will ultimately be sold to a single investor, in which case Ramoco Fuels would have to negotiate with that buyer and present a higher price.

He said, “I'll strive diligently to live up to the name of ozeki and aim even higher,”  at a ceremony in Kurume, Fukuoka Prefecture, where he was informed of the decision. Beside the 21-year-old wrestler from Ukraine was his stablemaster Ajigawa, 47, a former sekiwake Aminishiki. Ajigawa has carefully trained Aonishiki for the past three years. “[In my speech,] I wanted to express about my strong desire to aim for one more rank above ozeki [the highest rank of yokozuna]. Aonishiki, whose real name is Danylo Yavhusishyn, joined the Ajigawa stable as a practice member in December 2022, eight months after arriving in Japan. Ajigawa had a policy against taking foreign-born wrestlers into his stable, but he accepted Aonishiki following an introduction from Koji Fukuda, a 74-year-old former sumo club coach at Hotoku Gakuen High School in Hyogo Prefecture. Ajigawa, a six-time winner of the Technique Prize, among other awards, carefully taught Aonishiki. He showed Aonishiki effective ways to deal with an opponent depending on their position as well as how to grab an opponent's mawashi belt. On Sunday evening, Aonishiki brought a good news of winning the Kyushu Grand Sumo Tournament earlier that day to Ajigawa, and embraced his stablemaster. There is still a long way to go for me, but I was able to reward him a little,” Aonishiki said. Ajigawa said, “Having come from a foreign land, he has been working so hard to understand the culture of sumo.” Watching his protege, who was promoted to ozeki only three years after joining the stable, Ajigawa added, “He will only get stronger.” Aonishiki has won the Technique Prize in three consecutive tournaments, seemingly having inherited his master's techniques. “I want to continue striving for the highest rank,” Aonishiki said.

The conversation took place on Oct 14 and led to Mr Trump holding a call with Vladimir Putin a day before Volodymyr Zelensky's White House visit where the US president was expected to hand over Tomahawk missiles to Ukraine. Mr Trump subsequently refused to hand over the long-range missiles, noting that Putin “didn't like” the idea. Mr Witkoff, a former real estate developer who has become Mr Trump's personal envoy to Putin, has faced sustained criticism for his lack of diplomatic experience and has been accused of being too close to Russia. A second leaked phone call between Yuri Ushakov and another top Putin aide suggests that Russia wrote large parts of the contentious 28-point plan – a claim that the White House has been forced to repeatedly deny. Mr Ushakov said they should ask for “the maximum” and Kirill Dmitriev, Putin's economic adviser, said that even if the US rejected some demands, the peace proposal would be as close to their demands “as possible”. He then gave his Russian counterpart advice on what Putin should say to Mr Trump. “I think from that it's going to be a really good call.” “I think that very point our leaders could discuss,” Mr Ushakov replied, adding that Putin would hail Mr Trump as a “real peace man”. Mr Witkoff said he had told Mr Trump, a long-time friend from their days in New York real estate, that “the Russian Federation has always wanted a peace deal”. Trump's envoy then suggested that Ukraine would have to give up the partially occupied eastern Donetsk region – a longtime Russian demand – and “maybe a land swap somewhere”. At the time, Mr Trump's frustration with Putin's refusal to negotiate had been growing. Yet, after the two leaders' “very productive” two-and-a-half-hour call the day before Mr Zelensky's visit – which Mr Witkoff had suggested – a level of cordial relations appeared to be restored. Mr Trump even announced plans to meet Putin face to face in Budapest, although the summit never materialised. The US president told reporters on Tuesday night that he hadn't heard the tape but called it “a very standard form of negotiation”. The original 28-point plan was widely accused of being a Kremlin wish list, granting Moscow the entire Donbas region which it has failed to conquer, banning Ukraine from joining Nato and dramatically cutting the size of its military. Three sources familiar with the matter confirmed to Reuters that Mr Trump's peace plan drew heavily from a Russian-authored paper submitted to the Trump administration in October. The paper, a non-official communication known as a “non-paper”, contained language that the Russian government had previously put forward at the negotiating table, including concessions that Ukraine had always rejected, including ceding a significant chunk of its territory in the east. On Tuesday, Mr Trump said the original plan had been “fine-tuned” following input from Moscow and Kyiv, and that there were a “few remaining points of disagreement” following negotiations that have whittled it down to 19 points. He said he would send Mr Witkoff to meet Putin in Moscow to iron out the final stages of the peace deal.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Israeli forensic examiners have identified the remains of a deceased Israeli hostage returned from Gaza as those of Dror Or, the prime minister's office said on Wednesday. The handover leaves two deceased hostages – an Israeli and a Thai national – still in Gaza from Hamas' October 7, 2023 attacks on Israel. Israel and Hamas reached a ceasefire agreement in October, ending two years of war that killed more than 69,000 Palestinians, according to the Gaza health ministry, and reduced much of the enclave to rubble. The last 20 living hostages were released in mid-October. Or, 48, was killed in Kibbutz Be'eri during the attacks. He was initially believed to have been abducted, but in May 2024 his family was informed that he had been killed in the attack alongside his wife, Yonat. The parents left behind three children, two of whom were also abducted and taken into Gaza but were released in November 2023. In Hebrew, Dror means “freedom” and Or means “light.” Or's family said his name described him perfectly: “a free spirit spreading strong light around the world,” according to the Hostages and Missing Families Forum. Or was described by the forum as a devoted father. The release of his remains comes after a series of such transfers in recent weeks as Hamas has handed over the deceased hostages still in Gaza. Israeli intelligence has assessed that Hamas may not be able to find and return all the remaining dead hostages in Gaza. But Hamas has continued to search for remains in different parts of the enclave. These are the hostages released from Gaza, and whose bodies still remain</p>

The Japan Sumo Association unanimously decided on Wednesday to promote Aonishiki from sekiwake to the second highest rank of ozeki. Aonishiki, 21, is from Ukraine and now belongs to the Ajigawa stable. The promotion was discussed at a meeting to decide the rankings of wrestlers competing in the New Year Grand Sumo Tournament, which will be held at Ryogoku Kokugikan in Tokyo from Jan. 11, and was approved during a subsequent board meeting. “I'll strive diligently to live up to the name of ozeki and aim even higher,” Aonishiki said after the association's envoy came to a lodging used by the Ajigawa stable in Kurume, Fukuoka Prefecture, to deliver the news of his promotion. He arrived in Japan in the spring of 2022 following Russia's aggression against his homeland and made his debut at the Autumn Grand Sumo Tournament in 2023. His promotion to ozeki in just 14 tournaments is the fastest since the introduction of the six-tournament schedule in 1958, surpassing the previous record of 19 tournaments held by Kotooshu, excluding “tsukedashi” wrestlers who were promoted via a grade skipping system. At 21 years and 8 months old, Aonishiki is the fourth youngest new ozeki ever, surpassing Asashoryu, who was 21 years and 9 months old.
