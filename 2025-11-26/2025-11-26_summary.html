“​​What you have is a conglomerate of policy violence, and it's deadly,” says Barber, who is organizing protests.

Protests have erupted in North Carolina after federal agents arrested 370 people in immigration raids. On Monday, Bishop William Barber and other religious leaders gathered in Charlotte to demand an end to ICE raids. “​​What you have is a conglomerate of policy violence, and it's deadly,” says Barber, who is organizing protests against ICE and Medicaid cuts across the country. Barber notes that 51,000 people may die from preventable deaths because of the so-called Big Beautiful Bill, according to research from the University of Pennsylvania and Yale. “This is not just about Democrat and Republican and left versus right. This is literally about life versus death.”

This is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form.

AMY GOODMAN: This is Democracy Now!, democracynow.org. I'm Amy Goodman, with Juan González.

In North Carolina, protests are continuing, as they're continuing around the country. In North Carolina, federal agents arrested 370 people in immigration raids. On Monday, Bishop Barber and other religious leaders gathered in Charlotte.

BISHOP WILLIAM BARBER II: So, they hit North Carolina with ICE raids, and they hit North Carolina with ICE raids right at the same time people are raising concerns about Medicaid and healthcare and racist voter redistricting. And some people think that that means what we have to do is go to the ICE raids and forget about the other things. But what we know in this movement is it all connects.

RELIGIOUS LEADERS: It all connects, yes.

AMY GOODMAN: That was Bishop William Barber speaking Monday in Charlotte, North Carolina, joining us now from North Carolina. He's president of Repairers of the Breach, national co-chair of Poor People's Campaign, founding director of the Center for Public Theology and Public Policy at Yale Divinity School.

We only have a few minutes, Bishop, but your agenda is a big one. Can you talk about the protests around immigration raids, and then what you're talking about when it comes to healthcare and other issues right now?

BISHOP WILLIAM BARBER II: Well, thank you so much. Amy.

We had a Moral Monday in 20 states yesterday. And in North Carolina, we had two: one at 12:00, one at 7:00. And the focus is to connect the dots and to bring people out, of every different race, creed and color.

We were in Charlotte because the ICE raids came. We knew they were coming. People stood up, had been planning for months and waiting for it. We went there to deliver “Liberty Vans,” which is a concept through the Save America Movement. Steve Schmidt and others have come together. These vans, on public ground, travel constantly to film what ICE is doing, that news may not get a hold of, and to put it out there and also to document the trauma that people are going through.

But we also gathered hundreds of people right there in that church, and thousands online, who are saying that when you look at the ICE raids and then the raiding of Medicaid for millions of people, the raiding of food stamps for millions of people, and, in North Carolina, the raiding of our voting rights, what you have is a — is a conglomerate of policy violence, and it's deadly. It's deadly. It kills dreams. It kills hopes. It kills democracy. But also, we know 51,000 people are scheduled to — may die from preventable deaths because of what has happened in the Big Beautiful — big, ugly, destructive bill. And the reason, Amy, we keep raising that is because that same bill, that cut 16 million people's healthcare, 22 million people's food stamps, takes that cut and then puts $160 billion into ICE agents. They're hiring more agents with masks.

And we recognize that we have to connect this together, and we have to stand strong together, and it has to be a moral issue. We cannot let this merely be a issue between Democrats or Republicans. We had clergy from everywhere, as well as activists, as well as impacted people, on Monday night, who are determined for the long haul and who understand what policy murder, policy violence, policy destruction looks like, and why, in this moment, we must raise it like never before. And we're talking about long term. These Moral Mondays will continue. They began in the South in 10 states. Now they've spread to 20. And we're going to continue to raise it.

In fact, Amy, lastly, when we go, we're not only going with vans. We're going with caskets. We're literally taking caskets to the General Assembly, sometimes to the office of these congresspersons and senators, to say, “These policies are destructive to lives.” And we must make that case before America. This is not just about Democrat and Republican and left versus right. This is literally about life versus death.

JUAN GONZÁLEZ: And, Reverend Barber, in Chicago, everyone from the governor on down to all the community organizations finally succeeded in basically pushing ICE out of the city, at least temporarily. What's your sense of the kind of solidarities that are being built between Black and Brown communities in North Carolina right now?

BISHOP WILLIAM BARBER II: Well, Black and Brown and white, you know, people are coming together. And I think it's important to say that — and Asian. We had Jewish, we had Muslim in the room. We had Christian in the room. You know, sometimes what happens is, pain that is caused by powerful politicians who forget that what they ought to be doing is picking up humanity rather than pulling down humanity, it actually has a reversal effect, and it makes people come together, because it's so blatant and so ugly, so harsh and so mean. And that's what we see happening.

And people are not believing that ICE has ever gone anywhere. They are saying they may go underground, they may stop for a minute, but just like what you see in Charlotte, the people that were planning there, even before we went down on Monday, they've been planning. They've been training. They've been getting ready. And that's what we're saying to cities and states and counties, in states all over the country: Get ready. Don't wait. Get ready now. And get ready by connecting the dots. Get ready by connecting the dots.

We must organize this pain, the same pain that is caused by millions of people losing healthcare, millions of people losing their food stamps, millions of people's voting rights being challenged, millions of people without living wages, and millions of immigrants being challenged and harmed and deported. We must connect all of that pain into a powerful movement.

And then, lastly, Amy, this is not new.

AMY GOODMAN: We have 10 seconds.

BISHOP WILLIAM BARBER II: Yeah. Well, the bottom line is, we also said this is not new. This has a deep American history. People have had to fight it for years, and it's our time now that we have to fight it. And we must do it together.

AMY GOODMAN: And as we move into this holiday weekend, people should remember, according to Feeding America, one in five children are going hungry in the United States. That's despite the government reopening. Bishop William Barber, president of Repairs of the Breach, national co-chair of the Poor People's Campaign, thanks so much for being with us.

Exclusive: Former US secretary of state calls for more demanding steps from Australia as it takes over presidency of next year's UN climate summit

Australia's government, which will preside over the next UN climate summit, should gather the world's 25 biggest greenhouse gas emitting countries and push them to draw up a roadmap to end the era of fossil fuels, former US secretary of state John Kerry has said.

Only by “hard-nosed” confrontation with fossil fuel producers, and reducing their consumption in major economies, would the world be able to tackle the climate crisis, he said.

Australia's climate change and energy minister, Chris Bowen, has been given the role of “president of negotiations”, even though the Cop31 climate summit will be held in Turkey, after the two countries agreed to compromise on hosting arrangements.

“We need to be more demanding, more pushy,” he told the Guardian in an exclusive interview. “The Australian president [of the Cop31 climate summit] needs to take charge. Only if you get China, Russia, the US, India and Europe together and they decide to really do the transition [to a clean economy] everyone else will follow.”

This would be difficult, he admitted. “Saudi Arabia and Russia will be hard,” he said. The US under Donald Trump was also unlikely to take part without severe pressure. But Kerry said: “I think some fossil fuel producers will set a roadmap.”

Even the process of calling such a meeting would be useful, by isolating those who refuse to take part, many of whom prefer to stay in the shadows, according to Kerry, who was climate envoy to Joe Biden after serving as secretary of state in Barack Obama's second term.

“It will expose the objectors,” he said. “Call them out. People need to see that if you're not part of the process, you're part of the problem. Everyone has to run out of patience with the games that are being played.”

Australia will host the Cop31 meeting next November, after Cop30 in Brazil ended last Saturday with only a partial deal that omitted direct mention of the “transition away from fossil fuels” that countries are supposed to be embarked on, but allowed for a voluntary initiative for willing countries to start drawing up a roadmap for the phaseout.

Donald Trump stayed away from the summit, having dismissed the climate crisis as a “con job” in a speech at the UN general assembly in September.

Kerry has personal experience of tough negotiations with both China and Saudi Arabia, which is what leads him to believe a fossil fuel roadmap is possible. At the Cop28 summit in Dubai in 2023, nations agreed for the first time to “transition away from fossil fuels”, but they set no end date or process for it.

Kerry, as US presidential climate envoy, helped broker that deal at a climactic meeting with Saudi Arabia's oil minister Prince Abdulaziz in the early hours of the final morning after a marathon all-night negotiating session.

For the first time, he spoke openly to the Guardian about the experience. “Abdulaziz wanted to try to find a way to be a helpful player,” he said. “At least, one part of him wanted not to know, but the other part of him was more open. Very happily, it was that part that came.”

He went on: “I like him, he is very direct, he is honest about what his concerns are, and what the realities of the marketplace are. He puts it on the table. I find him to be a good interlocutor.”

In January, Kerry will visit the UAE and Saudi Arabia to push his ideas further.

Australia also must “do proper spadework” in preparing the ground for Cop31, Kerry warned, unlike what happened at Cop30, when the idea was only really championed by a group of more than 80 developed and developing countries halfway through the process.

“It was a shame they did not try earlier to begin the process with the fossil fuel [roadmap] and then build it up at Cop,” he said. “Australia needs to come to the table with options for what the proposal ought to be. [They need to] respect other countries' positions, and what is possible for them.”

Even reluctant countries would have to acknowledge their role in the climate crisis, as its impacts continue to gather force, he added. “Mother Nature is going to make it crystal clear,” he said. “You will have to show your people how you will keep them alive at 50C, or where their food and water is going to come from. That is an inevitability.”

Kerry praised the Brazilian presidency which ran Cop30. “They did their best in difficult circumstances. Cop is very difficult, it's the hardest diplomacy in the world, made harder when big countries that have a big impact are not pulling their weight or rowing in the same direction.”

But he also spoke of the run-up to Cop30, in which countries were supposed to set out strengthened plans on cutting their emissions, in line with the goal of limiting global heating to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, with that of Cop26, where the last round of plans were to be unveiled. “Raising ambition [on emissions cuts] was the whole focus of our diplomacy,” he said.

Though Kerry did not allude to it directly, Brazil claimed frequently ahead of Cop30 that the national plans – called nationally determined contributions (NDCs) – were nothing to do with the Cop presidency.

“By not achieving something concrete, the Cops get discredited,” Kerry warned. “And the planet itself gets further in extremis.”

Kerry also enjoyed a warm relationship with China's climate envoy, Xie Zhenhua. They gave a joint press conference at the end of Cop28 in which they talked of their friendship, and soon afterwards retired within weeks of each other.

By contrast, China played little public role at Cop30, though behind the scenes it did not object to the fossil fuel phaseout roadmap nor to attempts to make direct reference to it in the legal outcome text.

“I do not feel that kind of effort of diplomacy [from developed countries towards the Chinese] was made in the walk-up to this Cop,” he said.

Kerry also warned that new ways must be found to persuade people to make the climate crisis “a voting issue” to force politicians to take notice. “What is clear here is that people do not want to hear all the bad things. They want to know how this [transition to clean energy] makes their lives better,” he said. “If you say it, their eyes glaze over. You have to say there is a better choice for you.”

Already, with insurers refusing to insure homes at threat in Florida, Texas, Louisiana and other US states, people were facing higher mortgage rates or the possibility of not being able to buy or stay in their homes. “If you say to people, you could save money on energy and here is what you will have to spend on your mortgage [if we stick with fossil fuels], then people will begin to understand the practicalities.”

            As US military activity ramps up in the Caribbean and the Pacific, Colombia's president alleged the Trump administration's pressure campaign on Venezuela is more about accessing the South American country's oil than fighting drug trafficking.
    


            “(Oil) is at the heart of the matter,” Gustavo Petro told CNN in an exclusive interview, noting that Venezuela has what are considered the largest oil reserves in the world.
    


            “So, that's a negotiation about oil. I believe that is (US President Donald) Trump's logic. He's not thinking about the democratization of Venezuela, let alone the narco-trafficking,” he continued, adding that Venezuela is not considered a major drug producer and that only a relatively small portion of the global drugs trade flows through the country.
    


            Petro has been at odds with Trump since he returned to the White House. In the past year, the Colombian leader has harshly criticized the Trump administration's immigration policies, its support for Israel and its military activity around Latin America.
    


            On Tuesday, he accused the US of trying to impose its will on its neighbors, comparing its actions to imperialism. “The United States cannot be considered an empire, but one of the nations among others,” the president said.
    


            In response to Petro's comments, a US State Department spokesperson said the Trump administration remains “firm in its counter-drug operations in the Caribbean and its commitment to protecting Americans from the (Venezuelan President Nicolás) Maduro regime's deadly poison.”
    


            CNN has also reached out to the White House for comment.
    


            Asked if he had a message to the American people, Petro replied, “My message is the one they give to all members of the United States special forces: Your function, as they say in the oaths, is to fight against oppression. I repeated that on the streets in the United States, and it also cost me,” Petro said.
    


            He appeared to be referring to the US State Department revoking his visa at the conclusion of the UN General Assembly in September after he publicly called on American soldiers to disobey Trump and “not to point their rifles at humanity.”
    


            It's one of the many actions the Trump administration has taken against the Colombian leader in recent months.
    


Colombians caught in fallout of Trump-Petro feud



            In October, the US Treasury sanctioned Petro, accusing him of playing a “role in the global illicit drug trade,” a claim the Colombian leader has rejected.
    


            The sanctions were imposed days after Trump said he would halt all US payments and subsidies  to Colombia, claiming Petro “does nothing to stop” the production of drugs in his country.
    


            Petro defended his efforts to fight the drug trade, telling CNN that his government had seized more cocaine than any other in history. “So much so that in recent years, I have managed to ensure that the growth in crops, which is stagnating, is far surpassed by the growth in seizures,” he said.
    


            Asked why Trump hadn't acknowledged this, Petro said: “Because of pride. Because he thinks I'm a subversive thug, a terrorist, and things like that, simply because I was a member of the M-19,” a Colombian guerrilla movement active in the 1970s and 1980s.
    


            Petro also told CNN that he believes the US is comparing him to Maduro.
    


            His comments come a day after the US designated the Cartel de los Soles, an alleged drug trafficking group that the US has claimed Maduro leads, as a foreign terrorist organization. Venezuela has denied the claims, and experts say the phrase is more a description of allegedly corrupt government officials than an organized crime group.
    


            While Maduro has a problem with democracy, Petro said he is not that convinced about the Venezuelan president's drug trafficking links.
    


            “The problem of Maduro is called democracy … the lack of democracy,” Petro told CNN, adding that “no Colombian investigation … has shown us a relationship between Colombian drug trafficking and Maduro.”
    


            According to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), Venezuela is not a cocaine-producing country. Of the 3,700 tons of coca produced worldwide, more than 2,500 tons come from Colombia, while Venezuela does not appear on production maps, according to the UNODC, which said: “The majority of Colombian cocaine is being trafficked north along the Pacific coast.”
    


            Investigators from the US Drug Enforcement Agency reached similar conclusions, writing in their annual report published in March that 84% of the cocaine seized in the US comes from Colombia.
    


            Over the weekend, Colombian news program Noticias Caracol reported alleged links between Colombian officials and dissidents of the now-defunct rebel group FARC. According to the report, senior military and intelligence officials shared sensitive intelligence with the armed groups and advised them about how to secretly acquire weapons and evade military scrutiny.
    


            Petro has denied the allegations but acknowledged to CNN on Tuesday that ties between officials and drug traffickers have existed for years, even before he took office.
    


            A spokesperson for the US State Department said it is aware of the recent reports and urged Petro and other Colombian institutions to “thoroughly investigate these allegations and take all appropriate actions.”
    


            Colombia has long been Washington's most reliable ally in South America on security and defense. In 2022, the Biden administration designated the Andean country as a “major non-NATO ally.”
    


            Despite recent tensions at the top, US-Colombia relations remain intact.
    


            US Secretary of State Marco Rubio has made clear publicly that the administration's issues are with Petro, not the institutions in Colombia.
    


            “Our relationships with the people of Colombia, the economic sector of Colombia, the majority of people in politics in Colombia, and their institutions, in particular their defense institutions, are strong and enduring, and they're going to be strong and enduring long after this individual is no longer the president there,” Rubio previously said.

Bruna Ferreira, who has a child with the White House press secretary's brother, is now in custody at an ICE facility

US politics live – latest updates

Karoline Leavitt's nephew's mother has been detained by US immigration agents in Revere, Massachusetts, as part of the Trump administration's immigration crackdown.

Bruna Ferreira, a Boston-area resident who migrated with her family to the US from Brazil as a child, is now in custody at an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility in Louisiana, according to the Boston radio station WBUR, which first reported the arrest.

The White House press secretary's brother, Michael Leavitt, 35, had a relationship with Ferreira, 33, and they had a son, Michael Leavitt Jr, aged 11.

Ferreira was leaving her home to pick up her son from school in New Hampshire when her car was “suddenly swarmed” by ICE agents, according to the Boston Globe. Ferreira's sister, Graziela Dos Santos Rodrigues, told the outlet that the agents demanded her name and driver's license, but Ferreira did not have an identification card.

“They were not the most gentle with her,” she told the Globe.

“I'm sure my sister was terrified, frantic. She's been here since she was six years old. She's more American than she is anything else. I'm sure she tried to just use whatever she could come up with in the moment. However, it didn't really help very much.”

A White House source familiar with the situation said: “This individual is the mother of Karoline's nephew and they have not spoken in many years. The child has lived full time in New Hampshire with his father since he was born. He has never resided with his mother.”

Separately, a Department of Homeland Security spokesperson confirmed that “ICE arrested Bruna Caroline Ferreria [sic], a criminal illegal alien from Brazil. She has a previous arrest for battery. She entered the US on a B2 tourist visa that required her to depart the US by 6 June 1999. She is currently at the South Louisiana ICE Processing Center and is in removal proceedings.”

They added: “Under President Trump and Secretary Noem, all individuals unlawfully present in the United States are subject to deportation.”

Tricia McLaughlin, the Department of Homeland Security spokesperson, said in a statement to WBUR that Ferreira had a “previous arrest for battery”.

Neither the record of Ferreira's arrest record or how any charges were resolved were immediately available.

At a minimum, Ferreira's detention and likely deportation has brought home the close or casual connections many Americans have to the administration's immigration crackdown.

Leavitt, the 28-year-old New Hampshire native, is best known for her high-ranking role as Trump's spokesperson. Leavitt began her career interning at Fox News in 2016 before serving in the communications office during Trump's first term.

When Trump entered office for a second time in January, Leavitt made history by becoming the youngest-ever White House press secretary.

Less is known about her brother except that he won $1m in a DraftKings fantasy sports contest in 2014, according to The North Andover Eagle Tribune. At the time, the newspaper said, Leavitt and Ferreira were engaged and their son was eight months old.

In a statement to WBUR, Leavitt said: “My only concern has always been the safety, wellbeing, and privacy of my son.”

Ferreira's attorney, Todd Pomerleau, told CNN that his client had been arrested on 12 November and was currently in the middle of a “lawful immigration process” for US citizenship.

Ferreira's sister, Graziela Dos Santos Rodrigues, has now started a GoFundMe page to help with legal costs to fight the ICE charges and permit her sister to stay in the US.

Ferreira has maintained her legal status through Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (Daca), a program which grants temporary protection from deportation for those who entered the country as children, according to the post.

Ferreira has “followed every requirement, and has always strived to do the right thing”, according to her sister's GoFundMe page. As of Wednesday morning, more than $16,000 has been raised.

“She is hardworking, kind, and always the first to offer help when someone needs it,” Dos Santos Rodrigues wrote. “Whether it's supporting family, friends, or even strangers, Bruna has a heart that puts others before herself.”

The Associated Press reported on Tuesday that Daca recipients have been among those detained in immigration sweeps, although steps taken by Trump to end Daca during his first term were blocked by the supreme court.

In a recent statement to the Associated Press, McLaughlin said those with status under the Obama-era program “are not automatically protected from deportations”, adding, “Daca does not confer any form of legal status in this country.”

Justice department maintains that Trump administration didn't violate judge's order to return flights to US

The Department of Justice said in a statement that Kristi Noem, secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, was the one who made the decision to continue with the deportation flights of Venezuelan immigrants to El Salvador in March, despite a federal judge's directive that the flights must be returned to the United States.

In a court filing on Tuesday, the justice department said that “Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche and Principal Associate Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove provided DHS with legal advice regarding the court's order as to flights that had left the United States before the order issued, through DHS Acting General Counsel Joseph Mazzara” and that “after receiving that legal advice, Secretary Noem directed that the AEA detainees who had been removed from the United States before the Court's order could be transferred to the custody of El Salvador”.

The justice department argued that “as explained below, that decision was lawful and was consistent with a reasonable interpretation of the Court's order”.

The filing came as James Boasberg, a US district judge, recently resumed his inquiry into whether the Trump administration violated his March orders to halt the deportation flights.

That month, the Trump administration had invoked the 18th-century Alien Enemies Act, designed primarily for use in wartime, to deport roughly 250 alleged Venezuelan gang members to El Salvador's Cecot mega-prison.

Boasberg had quickly issued a temporary restraining order and issued a verbal directive ordering that the deportation flights already in the air be returned to the US.

However, the White House insisted at the time that the detainees were no longer in US territory when the order came down, and claimed that the ruling did not apply and so the planes were not turned around.

In the filing on Tuesday, the justice department maintained that the administration did not “violate” Boasberg's order.

“Although the substance of the legal advice given to DHS and Secretary Noem is privileged, the government has repeatedly explained in its briefs – both in this court on appeal – why its actions did not violate the court's order, much less constitute contempt,” the government wrote.

“Specifically, the court's written order did not purport to require the return of detainees who had already been removed, and the earlier oral directive was not a binding injunction, especially after the written order.”

The White House and DHS did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the new filing.

After spending several months in the notorious El Salvador prison, the Venezuelan nationals were repatriated to Venezuela in July in a deal between the US and Venezuelan governments.

Twenty-seven states in the US ban gender-affirming treatments for trans youth, including hormone therapy.

Support justice-driven, accurate and transparent news — make a quick donation to Truthout today! 

A newly published study reveals that a certain kind of gender-affirming care for transgender kids and young adults likely lowers rates of suicidality among those populations. 

The study, published in the Journal of Pediatrics, examined 432 patients between the ages of 12 and 20 years old who received treatment at an unnamed Midwestern academic medical center. Patients who were set to receive gender-affirming care filled out Ask Suicide-Screening Questions (ASQ) surveys prior to receiving hormone therapy (HT) treatment, then repeated the questionnaire at future visits. 

Upon examining the results, the study found that suicidality among these patients “significantly declined from pretreatment to post-treatment,” and was “consistent across sex assigned at birth, age at start of therapy, and treatment duration.”

The study included all youth who initiated hormone treatment therapy during the years 2017 to 2024 at the medical center in question. The average follow-up to the surveys the patients took occurred around two years after their treatment began, with some patients providing feedback up to five years after they started. 

Suicidality scores among the patients who provided responses dropped by over 67 percent, the study discovered. What's more, of the hundreds of patients who started hormone therapy, only seven discontinued their treatment, with four saying they had a “shift in gender identity” (while still identifying as gender diverse), and one stopping out of concerns over “hair loss.” Two stopped for unknown reasons. 

The study concluded:

HT was associated with clinically meaningful reductions in suicidality over time, extending prior findings with a larger sample and longer follow-up. These study findings provide clinical evidence supporting the mental health benefits of timely access to HT in this population.

In response to the study, trans rights journalist Erin Reed wrote, “gender-affirming care saves lives.”

Such care “remains one of the most effective interventions available for transgender youth who need it,” Reed added. 

Despite multiple studies coming to the same conclusion — that gender-affirming care for trans youth is highly beneficial — 27 states across the country have banned the practice, usually by citing unfounded fears regarding potential regret, errant concerns about a supposed “social contagion,” or misinformation regarding the safety of treatment methods. 

The study comes as the Trump administration appears to be readying itself to attempt to ban youth-based gender-affirming care across the entirety of the U.S.

Last week, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) updated a questionable study it published in May that claimed such care caused children more harm than good.

The report did not include authorship when it was first released. The new version includes the authors' names, which critics have pointed out include a hodge-podge of anti-LGBTQ voices — including one “expert” who is the founder of a noted hate group. 

Meredithe McNamara, an adolescent medicine specialist at the Yale School of Medicine, described that report's authors as “engineers of a cottage industry that solely exists to dismantle health care for a vulnerable group of people.”

“Transgender identity is real, transgender people of all ages thrive when they have access to the care they need, and politics needs to get out of medicine,” McNamara added in her criticism of the HHS report.

The Not With My Dollars campaign takes aim at Amazon, Whole Foods, Dell, Microsoft, Home Depot, Spotify, and Target.

Truthout is an indispensable resource for activists, movement leaders and workers everywhere. Please make this work possible with a quick donation.

A Gen Z-led advocacy group fighting for working-class priorities on Tuesday announced a boycott campaign targeting major corporations “that enable, profit from, or directly collaborate with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and the broader racist policies of the Trump administration.”

Beyond the Ballot launched “Not With My Dollars: ICE Out of My Wallet” as President Donald Trump's violent crackdown on immigrants in diverse communities across the United States continues and just days before Black Friday kicks off the winter holiday shopping season.

“We cannot out-organize a fascist administration while simultaneously bankrolling the companies profiting from its cruelty,” said Victor Rivera, the organization's executive director, in a statement. “Every dollar spent at a complicit corporation is a dollar funding the abduction and disappearance of our neighbors. It's time to make corporate complicity unprofitable, for good.”

The group is taking aim at e-commerce behemoth Amazon and its grocery subsidiary, Whole Foods; tech giants Dell and Microsoft; Home Depot; streaming platform Spotify; and retail chain Target. The boycott webpage explains the reason each is listed, actions shoppers should take, and the campaign's demands. In some cases, it also offers alternative companies.

Target is under fire for its “broad range of cooperation with the Trump administration's racist policies.” The campaign is calling on the company to not only publicly commit to refusing collaboration with ICE but also immediately reinstate its scrapped diversity, equity, and inclusion policies.

Spotify is on the list for airing ICE recruitment ads — a decision that also recently prompted a boycott call from the group Indivisible.

The campaign site calls out Home Depot because it has “repeatedly allowed ICE agents to patrol and detain workers and customers in its parking lots and stores, usually without presenting judicial warrants or establishing probable cause,” and demands an end to those practices.

The group is urging Microsoft to end its “$19.4 million contract with ICE to provide artificial intelligence capabilities and processing data.” The Dell section highlights that it has provided $18.8 million to “support the office of ICE's chief information officer through the purchase of Microsoft enterprise software licenses,” and similarly calls for terminating that contract with the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS).

The Amazon section states:

REASON: Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the digital backbone of ICE's machinery, selling the cloud power that helps track, target, and tear families apart.

ACTION: Stop shopping on Amazon where possible; cancel Prime subscriptions if feasible; push universities, unions, nonprofits, and campaigns to move off AWS when and where feasible, and to issue statements condemning Amazon's role in corporate-sponsored mass deportations.

DEMAND: End all ICE/DHS immigration enforcement contracts and data hosting that enable deportations; adopt a binding human-rights policy banning support for immigration policing.

ALTERNATIVES: Bookshop.org and local bookstores; direct-from-brand purchasing; cooperatives; independent retailers.

The site also stresses that “every dollar spent at Whole Foods directly strengthens Amazon, whose AWS platform is the digital backbone of ICE's machinery, powering the tools used to track, target, and tear families apart.”

While the campaign is beginning just before Black Friday, boycott organizers aim to ensure it will “not disappear” after this week.

“Unlike other consumer boycotts, Not With My Dollars is designed for long-term pressure and escalation,” Beyond the Ballot said. “To be removed from the boycott list, each targeted corporation must fulfill the specific demands outlined for its company. Anything less is not accountability, just more corporate PR.”

“If you bankroll a violent, unaccountable agency that terrorizes our communities, you will not do it with our money,” the group added. “Across the country, poor and working-class migrant families are facing a wave of state-sponsored abductions, violence, and political policing under the fascist Trump administration. Corporations that choose to partner with, advertise on, bankroll, or provide critical infrastructure to ICE are not neutral; they are complicit.”

Massachusetts is now one of only two states that don't use specialized courts to mandate forced psychiatric treatment.

Support justice-driven, accurate and transparent news — make a quick donation to Truthout today! 

On November 18, 2025, Massachusetts advocates gathered for hours at the State House as they have, year after year, to beat back yet another legislative proposal for involuntary outpatient commitment, or IOC. Involuntary outpatient commitment laws create a layer of specialized courts that use the so-called “Black Robe Effect,” which uses a judge's authority to compel people with diagnoses of “severe mental illness” to accept mental health and/or substance use intervention against their will — in the form of psychotropic medication, drug testing, and invasive and time-consuming requirements.

While the specifics vary state by state, there are consequences for noncompliance. If the person does not follow their court-ordered treatment plan, they could be snatched by the cops, transported to a locked psychiatric facility for evaluation, and subject to ongoing state surveillance. It's also not entirely clear where the offramp lies, as treatment orders can theoretically be renewed ad infinitum at a judge's discretion.

Starting in 1999 in New York, the conservative think tank Treatment Advocacy Center rebranded involuntary outpatient commitment and began using the language of “assisted outpatient treatment (AOT),” a euphemized term erasing any reference to coercion. Along with the Treatment Advocacy Center, a coalition of police, psychiatrists, social workers, and family caregivers have pushed the laws through in 48 states and the District of Columbia. Massachusetts and Connecticut remain the only holdouts. Fern Fairchild, director of Massachusetts' Wild Ivy Social Justice Network, part of the Wildflower Alliance, who has organized against forced treatment in both states, told Truthout that she attributes the lack of such laws in those two states, in large part, to “very strong survivors' movements” aligned with disability rights and legal advocates.

As Bowen Cho wrote in a 2024 report for the Disability Rights Education and Defense Fund, entitled Equity for Whom? How Private Equity and the Punishment Bureaucracy Exploit Disabled People, “Carceral industries and their logics shapeshift and expand in response to public attention, often replacing one egregious system for another and calling it reform.”

Involuntary outpatient commitment is a perfect example of this shapeshifting. In Massachusetts, the law's framing has been “forcewashed” — in other words, the carceral logic of it has been obscured beneath a language of care. The 2017-2018 version, entitled “An act establishing court ordered mental health assisted outpatient treatment” was further euphemized in 2021-2022 to refer to “assisted outpatient therapy,” with no mention of court orders. H.1801/S.1115, the bills currently before the Massachusetts legislature, now refer simply to a “continuum of care for severe mental illness,” and use the language of “critical community mental health services,” without mentioning “assisted outpatient treatment.”

“The mainstream view of AOT is generally that this mechanism is a ‘less restrictive' alternative to inpatient hospitalization and means of connecting folks to care, who may be unhoused or ‘abandoned to the streets,'” Dr. Nev Jones, associate professor in the School of Social Work at the University of Pittsburgh, told Truthout via email. Jones is actively studying the implementation and impacts of AOT across multiple U.S. states.

The reality is often quite different from the hype. “Once on AOT orders, many individuals will remain unhoused if that's where they've started — very few states guarantee housing to individuals on AOT,” Jones wrote.

A “Systemically Racist” Law

Involuntary outpatient commitment has often been likened to probation, and as Fairchild testified, is “systemically racist.” Clinicians diagnose Black people with schizophrenia, psychosis spectrum disorders, and other “severe mental illnesses” that make them eligible for coercive programs like involuntary outpatient commitment in far greater numbers than their white counterparts. This injustice persists due to clinicians' documented racial bias and the white supremacist, colonial roots of the psychiatric profession itself.

Everywhere the involuntary outpatient commitment program has been implemented and studied, Black and Brown people are overrepresented. As legal scholar Victoria Rodríguez-Roldán wrote of the racially disparate outcomes of New York State's outpatient commitment law, “the conclusion that any overrepresentation of minorities in the AOT program is harmful is inescapable.”

Fairchild's testimony noted that involuntary outpatient commitment “would also likely impact other communities, such as trans people and immigrants who are also disproportionately diagnosed and are being targeted right now by the Trump administration.”

The 2025-2026 bill text further violates privacy and autonomy by redefining who can initiate a petition for court-ordered psychiatric intervention — expanding beyond the already massive net of spouses, parents and relatives, intimate partners, and legal guardians, to include “any responsible adult or individual partner in a substantive relationship.” Fairchild noted in her written testimony that this wide net could easily be misused “in furtherance of domestic abuse, giving these individuals another level of power to wield over victims.”

In the new bill, parole and probation officers are also granted the power to petition for court-ordered treatment. “The probation and parole systems are particularly punitive, regularly reincarcerating people for minor violations,” Fairchild testified. “Involving these systems and actors within them in IOC order petitions would likely result in even more psychiatric incarcerations resulting from violations of the conditions set forth in an IOC order.”

Eligibility criteria have also been expanded, broadening the justification for psychiatric force. This bill expands the definition of “gravely disabled,” a “vague term that could apply to anyone a mental health provider believes is not taking adequate care of themselves, including people who are unhoused,” according to written testimony by the Mental Health Legal Advisors Committee. Grave disability now includes people who “demonstrate psychosis” — and again, given the demonstrated racial bias in such assessments, this designation is deeply problematic.

Advocates noted yet another disturbing new criterion: “unlikely to voluntarily participate in outpatient treatment.” This allows the court to mandate treatment based on a prediction that people will not seek services on their own, and an assumption that they are incapable of making informed decisions. “The most common factor for this type of determination,” Fairchild wrote in her testimony, “Is that the person disagrees with the facility or provider's recommendations. This gives facilities more pathways to override a person's autonomy … where they disagree with their provider and do not consent to treatment.”

In most states, individuals facing an assisted outpatient treatment order have no right to a patient advocate and no right to a state-sponsored second opinion.

“Most people think AOT follows from a robust legal (court) process — like what many of us have seen in courtroom dramas,” Jones wrote. “Although this varies by state, there are places in which court hearings occur less than 10 percent of time, and/or otherwise amount to brief, six-to-ten minute ‘rubber stamping' opportunities. In most states, individuals facing an AOT order have no right to a patient advocate and no right to a state-sponsored second opinion (psychiatrist or other evaluator of their choosing). This is most definitely not what most of us have in mind when we think about ‘procedural due process.'”  

Often missing from the conversation are the voices of people currently or formerly on these treatment orders. As journalist Rob Wipond reported, a 2023 Treatment Advocacy Center satisfaction survey is deeply biased, with clinicians cherry-picking respondents. Michael Simonson's 2019 survey of 28 people impacted by treatment orders depicts a very different, mostly negative, picture of the experience.

As a researcher, Jones has spoken to many recipients of the treatment orders, as well as the judges and clinicians involved in implementing them. “Direct stories of what clients/service users are put through are deeply disturbing,” she wrote. “The level of neglect and abandonment of some on AOT orders can be gut-wrenching to hear.”

“While of course there are kind and thoughtful providers and staff,” she added, “Far too many individuals I've met invoke some of the worst, most harmful stereotypes and slurs I've ever come across. To see this level of prejudice normalized to this degree, is actually pretty terrifying. And it's only a short stone's throw … to Brian Kilmeade's public advocacy for ‘lethal injections,'” referring to the disturbing comments made by the Fox News host who called on the state to execute unhoused people. “We're not just talking about individual dehumanization, but dehumanization of an already ultra-marginalized group on a systems level.”

A Persistent Mischaracterization of the Problem

Pro-force advocates at the November 18, 2025, hearing, largely family caregivers, told horrific stories of trying to get timely and quality care for their adult children in Massachusetts' labyrinthine systems of punishment, confinement, and abandonment. They shared devastating testimony of their loved ones' encounters with police; of their children repeatedly rotating between psych wards, prisons, and the streets; and of loved ones who took their own lives.

At least two of the parents who testified noted that they already had access to every possible lever of state power, including Rogers guardianships, to compel their loved ones to follow prescribed treatment, yet they had failed to force their adult children to take medication.

Few ever bother to ask why individuals “go off their meds.” U.K. psychologist Dr. John Read, who has researched this question in-depth, has written in the past that respondents cite a lack of informed consent as well as an average of 11 adverse effects of antipsychotics and concerns with long-term health outcomes (well-founded, as these drugs can induce fatal cardiac events and metabolic disorders). Western biopsychiatry has produced dismal outcomes, including early mortality, for people with “severe mental illness” labels.

Family caregivers and medical authorities explain away any resistance to treatment using the controversial concept of “anosognosia,” a term inappropriately borrowed from neurology and often used interchangeably with “lack of insight,” to describe people who reject their diagnosis and medication or other treatments. While people can and do enter into various states, or say and do things that get labeled by systems and society as “lack of insight,” applying force and coercion in such circumstances only serves to increase mistrust and drive individuals further away from care, as many individuals testified at the hearing.

There are many paths beyond the extremes of force and abandonment to support people who would otherwise be eligible for coercive programs like involuntary outpatient commitment. Abolitionist organizers have long called for anti-carceral community crisis supports and providing the kind of care that people want, while ensuring that everyone's needs for food, shelter, meaning, and human connection are met. Permanent supportive housing programs for disabled people, like Housing First, have long been a target of the right, and are on Trump's chopping block.

Liberatory community supports already exist in Massachusetts, like Wildflower Alliance's peer respites, a nonclinical, anti-carceral alternative to emergency rooms and locked facilities. A bill for expanding their availability in the state, including respites for BIPOC and LGBTQ+ people, is also currently before the legislature. Enduring Connections, a new program, also proposes to serve as an alternative to forced intervention, centering consistent, patient outreach led by peer workers. Psychiatric advance directives, health care proxies, self-directed care, and supported decision-making all allow people to exercise their legal capacity. There is no shortage of ideas, just a lack of political will to implement them.

“I wonder what's possible if we stopped putting so much energy into going back and forth over this year after year, and truly focused on innovative, trust-building community supports,” testified Sera Davidow, co-founder of the newly formed Wildflower Roots and a longtime activist who has written and spoken extensively on involuntary outpatient commitment. “I hope we get to find out.”

Bloomberg publishes extraordinary transcripts of secret discussions, but their provenance remains unclear

Bloomberg's scoop showing how Trump aide Steve Witkoff coached the Kremlin on the best way to get into Trump's good graces is extraordinary for what it tells us about Witkoff's dubious loyalties and the Kremlin's potential influence over US negotiation efforts. But equally interesting is the leaked material itself and where it may have come from.

The story covers two intercepted phone calls: one between Witkoff and top Kremlin aide Yuri Ushakov, and another between Ushakov and Kirill Dmitriev, who has been deeply involved in negotiations with the Trump White House.

Bloomberg's story was published without any byline or dateline, presumably because noting where the story was written or who wrote it could give clues as to the identity of the source. Bloomberg says only that it has “reviewed and transcribed audio” of the two phone calls, without giving any hint as to the sourcing or any checks done to verify authenticity.

Given the agency's reputation for rigorous reporting however, it can be assumed that the source was considered to be very trustworthy before a decision was made to publish.

Ushakov, who was on both of the calls, appeared to confirm the authenticity of the recordings on Wednesday: although he claimed some of it was “fake”, he said he would not comment on the rest because the calls were confidential, and said leaking such discussions is “of course unacceptable”.

In an interview with the newspaper Kommersant, Ushakov said some of his conversations were conducted on encrypted government channels, but suggested the calls with Dmitriev and Witkoff may have been made over WhatsApp. “There are certain conversations on WhatsApp that, generally speaking, someone might somehow be able to listen to,” he said.

The content of the calls provides proof of what many already suspected about Witkoff's closeness to the Russian position in negotiations. The question of who took the highly unusual step of leaking such sensitive audio to a news agency is more complicated.

“It's really hard to speculate. It could be 100m different things, including somebody on the Russian side trying to hurt Witkoff's reputation,” said Daniel Hoffman, a former CIA Moscow station chief.

Russian intelligence agencies have a long pedigree of intercepting and releasing sensitive political calls, but there is no obvious motive for Moscow to have compromised Ushakov, a key aide to Vladimir Putin, and Witkoff, Russia's friendliest interlocutor in the Trump administration. However, given reports of splits in the Kremlin elite over who manages relations with the US, nothing can be ruled out.

Ukraine may have the motive to make the call public – Kyiv is extremely uneasy with Witkoff's role in negotiations and would be keen to undermine his position, as well as publicise the shocking extent of collaboration between the Kremlin and the White House adviser. But the risk of a catastrophic bust-up with the Americans if caught would probably give Ukrainian officials pause for thought, and it would also be an impressive technical coup for Ukrainian agencies to be able to monitor a WhatsApp call that took place outside Ukrainian territory.

One senior former intelligence official said that while any number of agencies could have intercepted the call, the most likely source was someone inside the US system.

“There are different ways of intercepting calls, including traditional signals intelligence methods, cyber-attacks, and having access to the devices, so anything is theoretically possible, but my strong suspicion is that this came from the US side, and if that's the case, you have two entities who are capable of doing this, the CIA and the NSA,” said the official.

There are many people inside US intelligence agencies unhappy with the current administration and its policies on Ukraine and Russia, but leaking audio of the call would be a difficult and potentially extremely dangerous move for any disgruntled employee.

One notable detail is that Bloomberg obtained audio of the recording, rather than just a transcript or report of the call, suggesting the source was either directly involved in intelligence collection or senior enough to obtain the raw audio. Another former intelligence official suggested a European intelligence service horrified at Witkoff's pro-Russian position was most likely to be behind the leak.

What makes the publication so surprising is that, if the interception of Ushakov's calls was part of a longstanding penetration, releasing the information would probably cause him to change his device and communication habits, and thus would close down a fruitful intelligence window for whichever agency had obtained it.

“It's completely unsurprising that any number of agencies might have got hold of this recording, but it's extremely surprising that someone would leak it,” said one of the former officials.

This is Jared Goyette, reporting from Kyiv on a foggy November day. While news coverage and public discussion focus on the peace negotiations, the front lines continue to boil, as Russia's full-scale invasion enters its 1,372nd day.

The top story of the day so far:

Russian forces have completed the capture of two villages, Promin in Donetsk Oblast, and Vysoke in Zaporizhzhia Oblast, Ukrainian analytical and mapping group DeepState reported on Nov. 26.

Both villages sit on two of the most active and contested sectors of the front line, and their loss reflects steady Russian advances ahead of the winter fighting season

Promin is located near the city of Myrnohrad, which remains under Ukrainian control despite its near-complete encirclement over the last month as Russian forces continue to overrun the neighboring city of Pokrovsk.

Meanwhile, Vysoke lies just northeast of the small city of Huliaipole, which — despite being one of the most stable parts of the front line for most of the full-scale war — is now threatened by Russia's brisk push into eastern Zaporizhzhia Oblast.

Updated at 6:09 p.m. Kyiv time

While leaked reports of a U.S.-proposed peace plan have sparked international debates about the future of Ukraine`s occupied territories and the people who live there, Russia is forging ahead, entrenching its control on the ground by expanding illegal mobilization.

On the ground, that translates into forcing civilians and prisoners of war (POWs) to join its military and systematically preparing children for future service, experts said at a Nov. 25 roundtable in Kyiv organized by The Reckoning Project, a global war crimes documentation initiative that was initially created in response to Russia's full.

Researchers with the initiative described how  Moscow has built a full-scale system of militarization in occupied areas — from indoctrination in schools and youth camps to the coercion of men and Ukrainian POWs into combat. The researchers argue that these practices may constitute war crimes and could form the basis for international criminal charges against both individuals and the Russian state.

"Since 2015, Russia has been systematically preparing Ukrainian society under occupation for participation in hostilities. This includes children as young as preschool age," said Roman Avramenko, executive director of The Reckoning Project.

Updated at 3:05 p.m. Kyiv time

Ukrainian officials are pushing back against Russian claims and social media rumors that Ukrainian troops near Huliaipole in Zaporizhzhia Oblast are encircled: front-line units remain supplied, and medical evacuation routes continue to function despite heavy fighting, the Southern Defense Forces said in a statement on Nov. 26.

The command accused Moscow of exaggerating its “so-called successes” and magnifying problems in Ukraine's ranks to sow panic.

The fighting remains heavy. Over the past day, Russian forces carried out more than 30 assaults, over 500 artillery strikes using more than 2,100 rounds, about a dozen airstrikes, 250 drone drops and nearly 2,000 kamikaze drone attacks in the Huliaipole sector, according to the statement. Ukrainian units are “holding the defense,” maintaining communications and logistics, the command added.

The update comes as Russian forces continue to press the front in Zaporizhzhia Oblast, where Ukrainian troops have pulled back from some positions amid intense fighting. 

In a previous Kyiv Independent anlysis of the Zaporizhzhia front on Nov. 12, we reported that, according to figures published by the highly trusted Ukrainian mapping and analytical organization Deep State, 69% of all Russian territorial gains in October were made in the area around Huliaipole and in eastern Zaporizhzhia and Dnipropetrovsk oblasts, even though the area saw only 16% of Russia's total assault operations, based on General Staff data.

Updated at 2:30 pm Kyiv time

Drones struck the Russian city of Cheboksary in the Chuvashia Republic in the early hours of Nov. 26, with Ukraine's General Staff claiming successful hits on a factory producing electronics for Russian weapons.

According to the Telegram channel SHOT, the first blast was heard at around 2:40 a.m. local time. Residents also reported additional explosions on the outskirts of the city and in the airspace near the village of Lapsary, roughly 10 kilometers (six miles) away. Footage circulating online shows fire and thick smoke rising from one of the districts following the reported drone attack.

In the afternoon, Ukraine's General Staff claimed to have struck the VNIIR-Progress factory in the city, which manufacturers navigation equipment and other electronics for an array of Russian weapons, including Shahed-style strike drones, cruise and ballistic missiles, and glide bomb kits.

According to the General Staff, the strikes led to a fire breaking out at the facility. The units or weapons involved in the deep strike operation were not disclosed.

At least one person has been killed and 37 others injured in Russian attacks against Ukraine over the past day, local arthritis reported on Nov. 26.

Ukraine's Air Force said Russia attacked overnight with two Iskander-M ballistic missiles launched from Russia's Rostov Oblast and 90 attack drones of various types, including around 55 Shaheds. Ukrainian air defenses shot down or suppressed 72 of the drones, while missile and drone strikes were recorded at 10 locations, the Air Force said on Telegram.

In southern Zaporizhzhia Oblast, 19 people were injured when Russian forces carried out 11 airstrikes on the city of Zaporizhzhia and struck other parts of the region over the past day, Zaporizhzhia Governor Ivan Fedorov said on Telegram.

In eastern Donetsk Oblast, nine civilians were wounded on Nov. 25, including seven people in Sloviansk and two in Kostiantynivka, Governor Vadym Filashkin said on Telegram. 

In southern Kherson Oblast, seven people, including a child, were injured over the past day as Russian forces hit at least four apartment blocks and 21 private houses in towns and villages across the region, Governor Oleksandr Prokudin said on his official Telegram channel

In a separate incident on Nov. 26, Russian forces attacked a house with a drone in the Korabelnyi district of Kherson city, wounding a 63-year-old man, the Kherson Oblast Military Administration and Kherson city authorities said on Telegram.  Doctors are treating him for a concussion and blast-related head injuries.

In Sumy Oblast, a 45-year-old woman was wounded in the Velykopysarivska community as Russia carried out about 70 attacks on 34 settlements in 13 communities over the past day, Sumy Governor Oleg Hryhorov said on Telegram.

In Kharkiv Oblast, a 51-year-old man who had been injured in the Nov. 23 mass drone attack on Kharkiv died in hospital overnight, increasing the death toll from that strike to five, Kharkiv Governor Oleh Syniehubov said on Telegram.

Syniehubov separately reported that Russian forces attacked eight settlements in the region over the past day, but no new casualties were recorded from those strikes.

In Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, regional authorities reported overnight drone and missile attacks on a postal facility, homes, and administrative buildings, but said there was no information on casualties as of the morning of Nov. 26

Russia has lost around 1,168,550 troops in Ukraine since the beginning of its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Staff of Ukraine's Armed Forces reported on Nov. 25.

The number includes 980 casualties that Russian forces suffered over the past day. 

According to the report, Russia has also lost 11,372 (+4)  tanks, 23,625 (+1) armored fighting vehicles, 68,242 (+124) vehicles and fuel tanks, 34,688 (+44) artillery systems, 1,549 multiple launch rocket systems, 1,252 (+2) air defense systems, 428 airplanes, 347 helicopters, 84,960 (+743) drones, 28 ships and boats, and one submarine.

Jared Goyette is an American journalist based in Kyiv and an assistant editor on the Kyiv Independent's War Desk.   His reporting has appeared in The Nation and on PRI's “The World,” and he previously served as the English-language editor for The Ukrainians Media. His work has also appeared in The Guardian and The Washington Post.

Russian forces captured the villages of Promin in Donetsk Oblast and Vysoke in Zaporizhzhia Oblast, Ukrainian mapping group DeepState reported Nov. 26.

In mid-November, the RRC and the Movement of the First co-organized a first aid competition for children from across Russia and the occupied Ukrainian territories. 

Promin in Donetsk Oblast and Vysoke in Zapoirzhzhia Oblast were reported taken, the analytical and mapping group reported on Nov. 26. 

According to the NABU, Timur Mindich, a close Zelensky associate, committed his crimes by influencing Rustem Umerov, former defense minister and current secretary of the National Security and Defense Council.

While leaked reports of a U.S.-proposed peace plan have sparked international debates about the future of Ukraine`s occupied territories and the people who live there, Russia is forging ahead, entrenching its control on the ground by expanding illegal mobilization.

 Ukraine is facing its biggest wartime corruption scandal. The Kyiv Independent's Dominic Culverwell explains how Energoatom — Ukraine's nuclear energy operator — became a breeding ground for corruption during the war, how a $100 million kickback scheme in the nuclear energy sector reached the highest levels of power, and what this crisis means for President Volodymyr Zelensky and the country.





"The president will give me a lot of space and discretion to get to the deal," U.S. Special Envoy Steve Witkoff told top Kremlin aide Yuri Ushakov in a recorded phone call obtained by Bloomberg. 

VNIIR-Progress is a Russian state institute involved in designing electronic warfare systems, including the Kometa antenna used to interfere with satellite, radio, and radar signals.

U.S. President Donald Trump said on Nov. 25 that there is no specific deadline for Ukraine to accept the initially drafted 28-point proposal, easing previous statements that implied he hoped for a Thanksgiving agreement. "The deadline for me is when it's over," Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One.

"The absolute condition for a good peace is a set of very robust security guarantees and not paper guarantees. Ukraine has had its share of promises that were shattered by successive Russian aggressions, and real rock-solid guarantees are a necessity," French President Emmanuel Macron said.



The arrests of NABU detectives in July were seen by critics as part of a crackdown on the bureau triggered by its investigations against Zelensky's top allies. 

"The original 28-Point Peace Plan, which was drafted by the United States, has been fine-tuned, with additional input from both sides, and there are only a few remaining points of disagreement," U.S. President Donald Trump said.

When Marjorie Taylor Greene, the flame-throwing conservative congresswoman, posted her resignation online on Friday, it upended Washington, blindsided Republicans, and shocked reporters.

All except for one White House correspondent.

Brian Glenn, her “significant other” of three years, was by her side in her Georgia living room while she recorded her 10-minute and 42-second address to the nation.

But even with the video completed, Ms Greene waited until the very last moment to decide whether she would set it live and in turn, throw a grenade into Donald Trump's Maga movement.

“We made the video, and we sat back and we said, ‘you know, are you sure this is what you want to do?' And we both agreed that this is the right decision,” said Glenn, White House correspondent for the Trump-aligned Real America's Voice television station.

The resignation announcement capped an extraordinary seven days of turmoil.

On Nov 14, the president turned on his one-time ally over her insistence that his government publish the Epstein files in full.

He said he would support any Republican who ran against her in the 2026 midterm elections. And in an explosive post sent from his Mar-a-Lago home he called her a “traitor”.

Mr Glenn was forced into the role of Ms Greene's spokesman, counsellor and lightning rod, as she weighed whether her political career could survive.

And it made for a terrifying 48 hours at their home in Rome, Georgia.

On Tuesday, while nursing a cup of coffee in between live broadcasts from the White House, Glenn described the fallout.

The first sign of trouble came when a pizza delivery driver arrived at their door.

“I instantly knew what was happening, because I had not ordered a pizza,” he said. “It's always a precursor to something more.

“Somebody's feeling us out, seeing if we are home.”

Multiple bomb threats followed. At least one came from a foreign email address. And the bomb squad arrived to ensure everyone was safe.

“It kept escalating to the point where she said how long is this going to go on for? I don't need to do this anymore,” said Glenn.

Why put up with the abuse and stress and grind of re-election, he added, when the House of Representatives did not even sit for weeks during the recent government shutdown.

“That made her mad, because she is someone who works on an executive level like president Trump,” he said. “She's used to getting s--- done, right?”

It all meant Glenn, 56, a familiar face in the Oval Office, found himself at the centre of a story he never expected to cover.

The impact of her resignation was immediate. Glenn's phone exploded with messages, mostly supportive, he said.

They watched together as the video ticked past a million views on social media and they spent the rest of the weekend hunkered down at home, fending off dozens of requests for interviews.

The couple split their time between Washington, DC and Georgia. Friends wonder whether an engagement might follow Ms Greene's departure from Congress on Jan 5.

With his tousled blond hair, Glenn has the air of a perpetually surprised schoolboy.

He was once a features reporter at a local television station in Dallas, covering dog shows and state fairs but rose to prominence while Mr Trump was out of power. He covered the former president's raucous rallies, filling time between speeches, an exhausting job that at times involved broadcasting for more than seven hours.

He would see Ms Greene at rallies but they became a couple three years ago after being introduced by a mutual friend.

“We both were going through divorces,” he said. “So we were at kind of similar situations in life.”

Today, he is the figure that Maga faithful wake up to when they turn on the televisions in the morning.

As the insults and threats piled up after Mr Trump's social media post, Glenn waded in to support his girlfriend.

He posted images of them together with the message: “I love this woman. I love this country. God bless America.”

It was not the first time he had found himself at the heart of a story. In March, he was the reporter who asked Volodymyr Zelensky, the president of Ukraine, why he was not wearing a suit in the Oval Office, triggering what became a famous showdown.

“This is a little bit more difficult to navigate,” he admitted.

He is loyal to his girlfriend, but also wants the world to know he remains loyal to Mr Trump.

“I stand with the president,” he said.

It all puts him in uncharted territory. As a close Trump ally, he has been afforded special access at rallies during the campaign, flying on Trump Force One, and has been a regular guest in the Oval Office, alongside the rest of the White House press pool.

He said he had no intention of avoiding the president and hoped to be back asking questions soon, even if that meant listening to the president teeing off on his girlfriend.

“I'm gonna look forward with a poker face, and I'm not gonna say a word,” he said, even though his instincts would be crying out to push back. “It's gonna be really hard to do, though, really hard.”

He was back at the White House on Tuesday for the traditional turkey pardon, and had even instructed his team to make sure he had a spot where the president would see him.

A few days off for Thanksgiving, eating turkey and watching the Dallas Cowboys take on the Kansas City Chiefs, follows.

In the meantime, he is ready to shoot down stories that her resignation is part of a plan to run for president in 2028.

“I think she's much more powerful actually outside of an elected position, because she can help message the party very much like president Trump did when he was out of office,” he said. “He helped message the party in the right direction.”

Ms Greene's resignation shocked Republicans in Washington and launched a thousand theories about her motivations.

At the very least, her departure provides cover to like-minded Republicans who worry that Qatari jumbo jets and Nobel Peace Prize nominations have distracted the president from the economic worries of the blue-collar voters who elected him.

And, as one of the loudest voices of Maga, it puts the 51-year-old in a leading position to shape the future of the party after Mr Trump leaves office.

No one could believe that Ms Greene, one of the most influential women in Congress and spoken about as a future vice-presidential pick, could simply quit.

But there are no immediate plans for her next move, insisted Glenn. Not even a podcast.

“Her plan is to get away from politics, just get away from it,” he said. “I mean, it's been five hard years. She wants to take a break.”

While the Soviet authorities promoted their vision of ideological "universalism" — a homogenized identity that suppressed national cultures — dissenting voices were silenced through arrests, intimidation, and even murder.

Yet amid this repression, courageous figures refused to surrender their cultural identity. Among them was the poet Vasyl Stus (1938-1985), one of the era's greatest Ukrainian dissidents.

The new exhibition "As Long As We're Here, Everything Will Be Fine" at Kyiv's Mystetskyi Arsenal cultural and art complex is open from Nov. 13 to Feb. 8 and celebrates Stus's legacy,

The exhibition showcases his life and work that echoes Ukraine's ongoing struggle for freedom in the face of continued Russian aggression.

As the exhibition materials note, Stus seemed to understand — perhaps more deeply than most — that the dissident's path often meant "standing alone against the whole world."

The poet spent years cycling in and out of forced labor camps and exile. Following his 1980 arrest on charges of "anti-Soviet activity," he was assigned a young Viktor Medvedchuk by the state as his lawyer — against his wishes.

In the Soviet Union, defense lawyers were often tools of the totalitarian state apparatus rather than protectors of their clients' interests.

Medvechuk, who would go on to become a fugitive pro-Russian oligarch and godfather to Russian President Vladimir Putin's children, argued in court that Stus "deserved" punishment.

In 1985, the same year Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev announced an "easing" of restrictions across society, Stus died under questionable circumstances after launching a hunger strike in a forced labor camp for political prisoners in Russia's Perm region.


"Bearing the highest cost in human lives to deter the enemy, we often feel alone in holding back a force that threatens the entire democratic world."
    

The title of Mystetskyi Arsenal's exhibition — taken from a line written in a letter by Stus to a friend — resonates not only with the plight of an anti-Soviet dissident but with the current struggles of Ukrainians living through Russia's ongoing full-scale war.

The decision by Mystetskyi Arsenal to stage the exhibition was inspired by those very parallels, according to the organizers.

"Bearing the highest cost in human lives to deter the enemy, we often feel alone in holding back a force that threatens the entire democratic world," Yulia Naidukh, the curatorial team's project manager, told the Kyiv Independent.

"Yet, the examples of those who suffered at the hands of the same evil half a century ago — fighting for the very cause we defend, and with even less support — can serve as a source of resilience and a remedy for despair."

The team behind the exhibition devoted a year and a half to its preparation, collaborating with more than 15 institutions. This included vital materials from Kyiv's Sixtiers Museum, dedicated to the anti-Soviet dissident movement of Stus' time.

Stus scholars, his relatives and friends, private collectors, and other individuals were also involved in the behind-the-scenes work to bring the exhibition to life.

Dmytro Stus, the son of Vasyl Stus, told the Kyiv Independent that his overall impression of the exhibition was positive.

Speaking on his father's enduring popularity today, he said,  "I've been working on (my father's) legacy for 35 years. During this time a new field — Stus Studies — has been created, and it is perhaps one of the largest bodies of work in Ukrainian culture."

Despite the heavy subject matter, the process of preparing the exhibition came with pleasant surprises, according to Naidukh — like when they discovered previously unseen photos from Stus' reburial in Ukraine, after his body was repatriated from Russia.

"We were fortunate to meet a woman who, as a schoolgirl in 1989, had captured unique photographs alongside her father, a photojournalist, of the reburials of Stus and fellow dissidents) Yurii Lytvyn and Oleksa Tykhyi," she said.

As visitors progress through the exhibition, the atmosphere grows increasingly somber. This includes an installation that recreates a holding cell, with three concrete-framed displays that showcase artifacts such as the tiny, nearly illegible handwriting of Stus's poems later sewn into clothing by friends to be smuggled out of the Soviet Union.

Playing faintly from speakers above the holding cell is a recording of Ukrainian human rights activist Nadiya Svitlychna reading Stus' pivotal work "Palimpsests" — as well as the recording of a bird singing.

The most striking of the concrete-framed displays is the one left intentionally empty. Its label, "Bird of the Soul," refers to the poetry collection Stus was working on before his death — a manuscript confiscated by Soviet authorities. To this day, its whereabouts remain unknown.

"Dmytro Stus, Vasyl's son, tried to locate it in the Russian archives but was unsuccessful," Naidukh said. "We still don't know whether Stus' work survived or was destroyed forever."

The exhibition ends with a photo of a smiling Stus waving goodbye — a reminder that despite all Ukrainians have lost to Russia, those who survive will always find a way to keep their memories alive.

Kate Tsurkan here, thanks for reading my latest article. Walking into this exhibition I immediately understood it was a matter of if, not when, I would cry. Vasyl Stus is one of my favorite Ukrainian writers not only for his brilliant poetry but for his strong moral conviction. If more people like him existed in this world, I think we'd be much better off.

MOSCOW, November 26. /TASS/. The US and Ukraine presented a condensed peace proposal to Russian representatives in the UAE; lifting sanctions on Russia will need unanimous EU approval; and Washington presses Caracas by labeling the Cartel de los Soles a terrorist group to force political change. These stories topped Wednesday's newspaper headlines across Russia.

 

Negotiations between the United States and Ukraine on the American peace plan continued in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) on November 24-25, following a round held in Geneva on November 23. The Financial Times (FT) was the first to report on November 25, citing sources, about US Army Secretary Daniel Driscoll's trip to Abu Dhabi, almost simultaneously with Politico and CBS News. The New York Times reported that two other prominent American negotiators - Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Special Envoy Steven Witkoff - did not fly from Switzerland to the UAE. Experts argue that Washington may be using symbolic, informal negotiations to pressure Moscow towards concessions, Vedomosti writes.

According to FT, Driscoll is conducting talks with head of Ukraine's military intelligence Kirill Budanov (listed in Russia as a terrorist and extremist), as well as with some Russian representatives. Axios, citing sources, reported that Russia was allegedly represented by the "head of military intelligence," without specifying a name.

Driscoll's talks are most likely unofficial, head of the Ukraine Department of the Institute of CIS Countries Ivan Skorikov told Vedomosti. In his view, the choice of the US negotiator carries particular symbolic significance: before any official high-level meeting, Washington may seek to signal readiness to "appease" Moscow and secure concessions on several points of the peace plan. Moreover, a meeting between American and Russian representatives in the UAE is likely intended to outline the steps both sides would take should the peace process collapse by the end of November.

According to Politico, Driscoll's objective in the UAE was to present to Russian officials the peace plan that the United States and Ukraine discussed on November 23, which has been reduced from 28 points "to roughly 19." Lavrov had earlier said that Russian authorities had only received the unofficial version of Trump's 28-point plan and had not seen any other drafts.

Russian authorities consider it appropriate to discuss only the document agreed upon in Alaska, Skorikov noted. "Therefore, the Europeans' proposals are not subject to discussion, as they would merely delay the peace process," he said.

 

Lifting sanctions on Russia will require consensus within the European Union and coordination with the United States, a Member of the European Parliament told Izvestia. The timeline and mechanism for any potential rollback of restrictions have not yet been determined, but such a provision appears in both the American and the European versions of the peace plan for Ukraine. At the same time, the European Union will retain the legal framework enabling it to impose restrictions, and the process of lifting them could be hindered by individual EU member states opposed to normalizing relations with Moscow, experts noted.

"EU decisions on sanctions traditionally require unanimous approval by the member states. At the same time, the EU continues to work in close cooperation with the United States and other international partners to maintain a unified and coordinated approach," Tomas Zdechovsky, a Member of the European Parliament from the largest and leading group, the European People's Party, told Izvestia. At present, however, there is no clear timeline for easing the restrictive measures, he said.

Ivan Timofeev, Director General of the Russian International Affairs Council (RIAC), told Izvestia that the European Union will not abandon the legal mechanisms governing the imposition of sanctions against Russia. This means Brussels will be able to reinstate restrictions against Russia at any moment, even those that may be lifted.

"In other words, Council of the EU Regulations No. 833/2014 and No. 269/2014 will remain in force. We see this, in particular, with the example of Belarus, against which the EU has imposed sanctions since 2004. Periodically they ease them, but the legal mechanisms behind these sanctions are never abolished," the analyst told Izvestia.

Since 2022, the European Union has adopted 19 sanctions packages, and preparations for a new set of restrictions are already underway. In addition, sanctions introduced in 2014 remain in effect. The EU's promise to lift restrictions "gradually" appears too vague for now, Valdai Club expert Andrey Kortunov told the newspaper.

"There are so many sanctions - tens of thousands, that it is always possible to find certain measures that can be easily lifted by an executive decision in the United States or the European Union. Some sanctions require approval from legislative bodies, and others require bilateral consultations and agreements," he told Izvestia. "The key question, therefore, is what exactly is meant by sanctions relief: which sanctions are being lifted, in what sequence, and to what extent the decision can be considered universal," he added.

 

A decision by the US Department of State to designate the so-called Cartel de los Soles as a foreign terrorist organization has taken effect. According to US authorities, this drug cartel is allegedly headed by Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro himself. The move steps up pressure on the leadership of the Latin American country. As CNN reported, President Donald Trump intends to force Maduro from office without resorting to military action. Experts interviewed by Nezavisimaya Gazeta argue Maduro's departure remains unlikely.

The designation of the Cartel de los Soles as a foreign terrorist organization, the US administration stated, expands the range of maneuver available to American authorities. Counterterrorism operations provide a mechanism that allows the United States to justify actions that might otherwise be viewed as violations of international law. This applies both to the possibility of direct intervention in Venezuela and to strikes on vessels in the Caribbean region, which began in September of this year and have already resulted in more than 80 deaths.

The decision is also intended to increase psychological pressure on Maduro. CNN wrote, citing a well-informed source, that Trump hopes to achieve a change of regime in Venezuela without resorting to military action.

According to Dmitry Rozental, Director of the Institute of Latin America of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Maduro's voluntary departure from office currently appears unlikely. "This would be the optimal outcome for the US: securing certain concessions from Venezuela without the use of military force. This is because an operation would entail significant costs for the United States - militarily and in terms of the political fallout, given that it would be met negatively in many Latin American countries. Therefore, the US would prefer to resolve everything through a negotiating process. Another matter is whether Maduro himself and his inner circle are prepared for this," the expert told Nezavisimaya Gazeta.

The potential negotiating process being discussed in the media could involve a number of concessions from Venezuela. "In the oil and economic spheres, this could mean certain privileges for American capital and replacing Russian and Chinese businesses. But this is a scenario in which the chavistas would be taking a major risk by relying solely on the United States," he said.

In the political sphere, the discussion could concern the activities of branches of US government agencies on Venezuelan territory, primarily the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), Rozental believes. Such measures would hardly provide tangible benefits to Washington, but they would at least constitute a demonstrative gesture signaling strengthened US influence in the region.

 

As discussions of Washington's peace plan continue, Kiev has also entered into debate over the potential peacetime size of its Armed Forces. Figures of 600,000, 800,000, and even 1 mln service members are being circulated. Yet maintaining "an army of one million" under peacetime conditions would inevitably push Ukraine into default, analysts inside the country warn.

According to experts interviewed by Nezavisimaya Gazeta, a million-strong Ukrainian army would be financially ruinous, strategically unacceptable to Russia, and that any realistic security arrangement should involve troop levels closer to pre-conflict norms and include broader international participation.

Back in late January, speaking with journalists at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Vladimir Zelensky said that without such security guarantees as an invitation for Ukraine to join NATO or the deployment of foreign contingents on its territory, Kiev would need to expand its army to 1 mln troops. Since Ukraine does not have the necessary funds, he added, European countries would have to cover the upkeep of the armed forces.

The question of financing such decisions is far from theoretical—especially at a time when Washington has announced the cessation of financial support for Kiev. And in European capitals, which had previously debated how to transfer nearly $300 bln in frozen Russian assets concentrated in the European Union, leaders must now also contend with another provision of the US plan that would effectively place control of those funds under their authority.

Evgeny Semibratov, Deputy Director of the Institute for Strategic Studies and Forecasts at the Peoples' Friendship University of Russia, told Nezavisimaya Gazeta that the proposed troop levels of 600,000, 800,000, or 1 mln in the Ukrainian Armed Forces are clearly unacceptable from Russia's perspective. "By the way, some time ago President Vladimir Putin mentioned that during the Istanbul negotiations in spring 2022, Moscow insisted on the Ukrainian Armed Forces troop level of 250,000-300,000. If we look at what this number was before the military conflict triggered by the 2014 coup, we find that under then-President Viktor Yanukovych the Ukrainian army numbered 230,000-250,000. Therefore, the level that appears adequate today would be 200,000-250,000 troops. This would allow the Ukrainian state to carry out its necessary functions, but would exclude the formation of a new military fist threatening Russia's security," Semibratov emphasized.

The expert also noted that Russia and Global South countries should be included in the ongoing discussions surrounding potential security guarantees for Ukraine.

 

US company Ramoco Fuels intends to lease all 194 Lukoil gas stations located in the United States. The total value of the transaction is $150 mln, with the purchase to be completed no later than December 31, 2027, sources familiar with the American proposal told Izvestia. Experts characterize it as relatively modest, estimating the discount at roughly 50-70%. The Russian company may decline the offer.

According to one of the sources, Ramoco is proposing a 24-month master lease that would automatically convert into the purchase of Lukoil's entire US retail fuel business "as soon as all regulatory, environmental, and franchising requirements have been met."

Sofya Lukinova, head of the legal department at VMT Consult, told Izvestia that a lease-to-own arrangement could be viewed as a reasonably balanced solution that would allow foreign operations to continue until sanctions are lifted. "Funds received under the lease agreement would also be blocked in a special account unless OFAC authorizes their use for operational needs," she added.

Experts consider Ramoco Fuels' proposal rather modest. According to the industry portal InfoTEK, the cost of a single gas station in Europe typically ranges between €2 mln and €3 mln. The price depends on numerous factors, including location, station size, traffic volume, the presence of a convenience store, and various additional services such as a car wash or service station.

Olga Orlova, head of the Industry Department at the Institute of Oil and Gas Technology, stressed that each gas station's valuation is highly individual and depends on many variables, but Ramoco Fuels' offer can clearly be considered below market, representing a discount of approximately 50-70%.

In Orlova's view, the buyer's proposed structure is generally workable. However, if the Russian company considers the amount insufficient, the offer will simply be turned down. It is also possible, she concluded, that all the assets will ultimately be sold to a single investor, in which case Ramoco Fuels would have to negotiate with that buyer and present a higher price.

Aonishiki's promotion from sekiwake to ozeki — the second highest rank in professional sumo — was announced Wednesday. He said, “I'll strive diligently to live up to the name of ozeki and aim even higher,”  at a ceremony in Kurume, Fukuoka Prefecture, where he was informed of the decision.

Beside the 21-year-old wrestler from Ukraine was his stablemaster Ajigawa, 47, a former sekiwake Aminishiki. Ajigawa has carefully trained Aonishiki for the past three years.

“[In my speech,] I wanted to express about my strong desire to aim for one more rank above ozeki [the highest rank of yokozuna]. I discussed with my stablemaster that a simple speech would suit me better,” Aonishiki said at a press conference. “I practiced the speech many, many times,” he said.

Aonishiki, whose real name is Danylo Yavhusishyn, joined the Ajigawa stable as a practice member in December 2022, eight months after arriving in Japan. Ajigawa had a policy against taking foreign-born wrestlers into his stable, but he accepted Aonishiki following an introduction from Koji Fukuda, a 74-year-old former sumo club coach at Hotoku Gakuen High School in Hyogo Prefecture. Ajigawa said he did so because he was impressed by Aonishiki's sincere dedication to sumo.

Ajigawa, a six-time winner of the Technique Prize, among other awards, carefully taught Aonishiki. He showed Aonishiki effective ways to deal with an opponent depending on their position as well as how to grab an opponent's mawashi belt.

They sometimes had drinks together and talked about sumo as well as personal matters.

On Sunday evening, Aonishiki brought a good news of winning the Kyushu Grand Sumo Tournament earlier that day to Ajigawa, and embraced his stablemaster. Aonishiki won the tournament on the final day of the event that ensured his promotion to ozeki,

“I was incredibly happy because I wanted to share my victory with my stablemaster the most. There is still a long way to go for me, but I was able to reward him a little,” Aonishiki said.

Ajigawa said, “Having come from a foreign land, he has been working so hard to understand the culture of sumo.” Watching his protege, who was promoted to ozeki only three years after joining the stable, Ajigawa added, “He will only get stronger.”

“Seeing a disciple going above [the sumo rank where I was] is a joy only a stablemaster can truly appreciate,” Ajigawa said at a press conference.

Aonishiki has won the Technique Prize in three consecutive tournaments, seemingly having inherited his master's techniques. His simple, humor-filled way of speaking also seems to resemble his master's.

“I want to continue striving for the highest rank,” Aonishiki said. His story with his stablemaster will likely have more chapters to come.

			Steve Witkoff advises Putin aide on how to handle the US president and suggests Ukraine cede land

Steve Witkoff advised Russia on how to flatter Donald Trump in peace negotiations, according to a leaked telephone call.

Mr Witkoff, the president's special envoy, told Russian negotiators to “congratulate” the US president over his deal to end the war in Gaza before making their demands for Ukraine.

He also spoke of his “deep respect” for Vladimir Putin and detailed what the Russian leader should say in a direct call to Mr Trump.

The conversation took place on Oct 14 and led to Mr Trump holding a call with Vladimir Putin a day before Volodymyr Zelensky's White House visit where the US president was expected to hand over Tomahawk missiles to Ukraine.

Mr Trump subsequently refused to hand over the long-range missiles, noting that Putin “didn't like” the idea.

Mr Witkoff, a former real estate developer who has become Mr Trump's personal envoy to Putin, has faced sustained criticism for his lack of diplomatic experience and has been accused of being too close to Russia.

The leaks threaten to derail the talks and raise questions about his position as a key negotiator. Mr Witkoff is due to visit the Kremlin to meet in person with Putin next week. 

A second leaked phone call between Yuri Ushakov and another top Putin aide suggests that Russia wrote large parts of the contentious 28-point plan – a claim that the White House has been forced to repeatedly deny.

Mr Ushakov said they should ask for “the maximum” and Kirill Dmitriev, Putin's economic adviser, said that even if the US rejected some demands, the peace proposal would be as close to their demands “as possible”.

He then suggests talking later “to Steve about this paper”, referring to Mr Witkoff.

The calls provide a clear insight into Mr Witkoff's close relationship with his Russian counterparts and his negotiating tactics that resulted in the peace plan that Washington is pressuring Kyiv to accept as the foundations of the deal. 

In his call with Mr Ushakov on October 14, Mr Witkoff said: “Well listen. I am going to tell you something. I think, I think if we can get the Russia-Ukraine thing solved, everybody'll be jumping for joy.”

He then gave his Russian counterpart advice on what Putin should say to Mr Trump. 

“Yuri, here's what I would do. My recommendation,” Mr Witkoff told Mr Ushakov on Oct 14, according to a transcript reviewed and transcribed by Bloomberg.

“I would make the call and just reiterate that you congratulate the president on this achievement, that you supported it… that you respect that he is a man of peace and you're just, you're really glad to have seen it happen. So I would say that.

“I think from that it's going to be a really good call.”

At the time, Mr Trump was being widely praised for his efforts to end the war in Gaza. He had secured the release of the final hostages held by Hamas, and the day before, had addressed the Israeli Knesset.

“I think that very point our leaders could discuss,” Mr Ushakov replied, adding that Putin would hail Mr Trump as a “real peace man”.

Mr Witkoff said he had told Mr Trump, a long-time friend from their days in New York real estate, that “the Russian Federation has always wanted a peace deal”.

Trump's envoy then suggested that Ukraine would have to give up the partially occupied eastern Donetsk region – a longtime Russian demand – and “maybe a land swap somewhere”.

At the time, Mr Trump's frustration with Putin's refusal to negotiate had been growing.

Yet, after the two leaders' “very productive” two-and-a-half-hour call the day before Mr Zelensky's visit – which Mr Witkoff had suggested – a level of cordial relations appeared to be restored.

Mr Trump even announced plans to meet Putin face to face in Budapest, although the summit never materialised.

The US president told reporters on Tuesday night that he hadn't heard the tape but called it “a very standard form of negotiation”.

“He's got to sell this to Ukraine, he's got to sell Ukraine to Russia,” the US president said. “That's what a dealmaker does.”

Asked if Mr Witkoff was too pro-Russian, he pivoted to the human cost of the war.

“Look, this war could go on for years, and Russia's got a lot more people, got a lot more soldiers, so I think if Ukraine can make a deal, it's a good thing.”

The original 28-point plan was widely accused of being a Kremlin wish list, granting Moscow the entire Donbas region which it has failed to conquer, banning Ukraine from joining Nato and dramatically cutting the size of its military.

It was reportedly drawn up by Mr Witkoff and Jared Kushner, Mr Trump's son-in-law, with Mr Dmitriev following days of negotiations in Miami without input from the Ukrainians.

Three sources familiar with the matter confirmed to Reuters that Mr Trump's peace plan drew heavily from a Russian-authored paper submitted to the Trump administration in October.

The paper, a non-official communication known as a “non-paper”, contained language that the Russian government had previously put forward at the negotiating table, including concessions that Ukraine had always rejected, including ceding a significant chunk of its territory in the east.

Mr Dmitriev, who is widely suspected of leaking the 28-point peace plan to the media, has called the transcript a “fake”.

On Tuesday, Mr Trump said the original plan had been “fine-tuned” following input from Moscow and Kyiv, and that there were a “few remaining points of disagreement” following negotiations that have whittled it down to 19 points.

He said he would send Mr Witkoff to meet Putin in Moscow to iron out the final stages of the peace deal.

            Israeli forensic examiners have identified the remains of a deceased Israeli hostage returned from Gaza as those of Dror Or, the prime minister's office said on Wednesday.
    


            Earlier in the day, Hamas transferred the remains to Israel through the Red Cross. The handover leaves two deceased hostages – an Israeli and a Thai national – still in Gaza from Hamas' October 7, 2023 attacks on Israel.
    


            Israel and Hamas reached a ceasefire agreement in October, ending two years of war that killed more than 69,000 Palestinians, according to the Gaza health ministry, and reduced much of the enclave to rubble.
    


            As part of the deal, Hamas agreed to release the remainder of the 251 hostages – dead and alive – that it kidnapped on October 7. The last 20 living hostages were released in mid-October.
    


            Or, 48, was killed in Kibbutz Be'eri during the attacks. He was initially believed to have been abducted, but in May 2024 his family was informed that he had been killed in the attack alongside his wife, Yonat. His body was taken to Gaza.
    


            The parents left behind three children, two of whom were also abducted and taken into Gaza but were released in November 2023.
    


            In Hebrew, Dror means “freedom” and Or means “light.” Or's family said his name described him perfectly: “a free spirit spreading strong light around the world,” according to the Hostages and Missing Families Forum.
    


            Or was described by the forum as a devoted father. He was the chief cheesemaker at the Be'eri dairy, and a yoga teacher.
    


            The release of his remains comes after a series of such transfers in recent weeks as Hamas has handed over the deceased hostages still in Gaza.
    


Israeli intelligence has assessed that Hamas may not be able to find and return all the remaining dead hostages in Gaza. But Hamas has continued to search for remains in different parts of the enclave.
    


            The Hostages and Missing Families Forum has continued to organize rallies in Tel Aviv and elsewhere across Israel calling for the release of the remaining deceased hostages.
    


These are the hostages released from Gaza, and whose bodies still remain

15:02 JST, November 26, 2025

The Japan Sumo Association unanimously decided on Wednesday to promote Aonishiki from sekiwake to the second highest rank of ozeki.

Aonishiki, 21, is from Ukraine and now belongs to the Ajigawa stable. His birth name is Danylo Yavhusishyn.

The promotion was discussed at a meeting to decide the rankings of wrestlers competing in the New Year Grand Sumo Tournament, which will be held at Ryogoku Kokugikan in Tokyo from Jan. 11, and was approved during a subsequent board meeting.

“I'll strive diligently to live up to the name of ozeki and aim even higher,” Aonishiki said after the association's envoy came to a lodging used by the Ajigawa stable in Kurume, Fukuoka Prefecture, to deliver the news of his promotion.

Aonishiki is the first ozeki from Ukraine and the 14th foreign-born wrestler to achieve the rank. He arrived in Japan in the spring of 2022 following Russia's aggression against his homeland and made his debut at the Autumn Grand Sumo Tournament in 2023.

At the Kyushu Grand Sumo Tournament this month, he achieved his first tournament victory.

His promotion to ozeki in just 14 tournaments is the fastest since the introduction of the six-tournament schedule in 1958, surpassing the previous record of 19 tournaments held by Kotooshu, excluding “tsukedashi” wrestlers who were promoted via a grade skipping system.

At 21 years and 8 months old, Aonishiki is the fourth youngest new ozeki ever, surpassing Asashoryu, who was 21 years and 9 months old. The New Year Grand Sumo Tournament will feature two yokozuna and two ozeki.

Quality journalism takes work — and a community that cares.  Help us reach 25,000 members by the end of 2025.

Unidentified drones struck the Russian city of Cheboksary in the Chuvashia Republic in the early hours of Nov. 26, with Ukraine's General Staff claiming successful hits on a factory producing electronics for Russian weapons.

According to the Telegram channel SHOT, the first blast was heard at around 2:40 a.m. local time. Residents also reported additional explosions on the outskirts of the city and in the airspace near the village of Lapsary, roughly 10 kilometers (six miles) away. Footage circulating online shows fire and thick smoke rising from one of the districts following the reported drone attack.

In the afternoon, Ukraine's General Staff claimed to have struck the VNIIR-Progress factory in the city, which manufacturers navigation equipment and other electronics for an array of Russian weapons, including Shahed-style strike drones, cruise and ballistic missiles, and glide bomb kits.  

According to the General Staff, the strikes led to a fire breaking out at the facility. The units or weapons involved in the deep strike operation were not disclosed.

Local authorities also acknowledged the incident. Oleg Nikolayev, the head of the Chuvashia Republic, confirmed that the region had been attacked by drones. Two people, including a teenager, were wounded in the attack and two residential buildings were damaged. 

The Kyiv Independent can't immediately verify the claims. 

Several Russian Telegram channels claimed that the strike hit the VNIIR-Progress plant in Cheboksary, located roughly 970 kilometers (603 miles) from the nearest parts of Ukraine's border. 

VNIIR-Progress is a Russian state institute involved in designing electronic warfare systems, including the Kometa antenna used to interfere with satellite, radio, and radar signals. The enterprise is currently subject to sanctions imposed by both the United States and the European Union.

The same plant was previously targeted on June 9, when a Ukrainian drone strike triggered large explosions and fires at the VNIIR-Progress and ABS Electro facilities. 

At the time, Ukraine's General Staff confirmed responsibility, saying the operation was part of efforts to degrade Russia's ability to manufacture components for attack drones, guided bombs, and other precision-strike systems.

Head of North America desk

Olena Goncharova is the Head of North America desk at The Kyiv Independent, where she has previously worked as a development manager and Canadian correspondent. She first joined the Kyiv Post, Ukraine's oldest English-language newspaper, as a staff writer in January 2012 and became the newspaper's Canadian correspondent in June 2018. She is based in Edmonton, Alberta. Olena has a master's degree in publishing and editing from the Institute of Journalism in Taras Shevchenko National University in Kyiv. Olena was a 2016 Alfred Friendly Press Partners fellow who worked for the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette for six months. The program is administered by the University of Missouri School of Journalism in Columbia.

Russian forces captured the villages of Promin in Donetsk Oblast and Vysoke in Zaporizhzhia Oblast, Ukrainian mapping group DeepState reported Nov. 26.

In mid-November, the RRC and the Movement of the First co-organized a first aid competition for children from across Russia and the occupied Ukrainian territories. 

Promin in Donetsk Oblast and Vysoke in Zapoirzhzhia Oblast were reported taken, the analytical and mapping group reported on Nov. 26. 

According to the NABU, Timur Mindich, a close Zelensky associate, committed his crimes by influencing Rustem Umerov, former defense minister and current secretary of the National Security and Defense Council.

While leaked reports of a U.S.-proposed peace plan have sparked international debates about the future of Ukraine`s occupied territories and the people who live there, Russia is forging ahead, entrenching its control on the ground by expanding illegal mobilization.

 Ukraine is facing its biggest wartime corruption scandal. The Kyiv Independent's Dominic Culverwell explains how Energoatom — Ukraine's nuclear energy operator — became a breeding ground for corruption during the war, how a $100 million kickback scheme in the nuclear energy sector reached the highest levels of power, and what this crisis means for President Volodymyr Zelensky and the country.





"The president will give me a lot of space and discretion to get to the deal," U.S. Special Envoy Steve Witkoff told top Kremlin aide Yuri Ushakov in a recorded phone call obtained by Bloomberg. 

VNIIR-Progress is a Russian state institute involved in designing electronic warfare systems, including the Kometa antenna used to interfere with satellite, radio, and radar signals.

U.S. President Donald Trump said on Nov. 25 that there is no specific deadline for Ukraine to accept the initially drafted 28-point proposal, easing previous statements that implied he hoped for a Thanksgiving agreement. "The deadline for me is when it's over," Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One.

"The absolute condition for a good peace is a set of very robust security guarantees and not paper guarantees. Ukraine has had its share of promises that were shattered by successive Russian aggressions, and real rock-solid guarantees are a necessity," French President Emmanuel Macron said.



The arrests of NABU detectives in July were seen by critics as part of a crackdown on the bureau triggered by its investigations against Zelensky's top allies. 

"The original 28-Point Peace Plan, which was drafted by the United States, has been fine-tuned, with additional input from both sides, and there are only a few remaining points of disagreement," U.S. President Donald Trump said.

WASHINGTON (AP) — The National Park Service said Tuesday it is going to start charging the millions of international tourists who visit U.S. parks each year an extra $100 to enter some of the most popular sites, while leaving them out of fee-free days that will be reserved for American residents.

The announcement declaring “America-first entry fee policies” comes as national parks deal with the strain of a major staff reduction and severe budget cuts, along with recovering from damage during the recent government shutdown and significant lost revenue due to fees not being collected during that time.

The fee change will impact 11 national parks, including Grand Canyon, Yellowstone and Yosemite, according to the U.S. Department of the Interior.

As part of the changes, which are set to take effect Jan. 1, foreign tourists will also see their annual parks pass price jump to $250, while U.S. residents will continue to be charged $80, according to the department's statement.

Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said in a post on the social platform X that the changes make sure U.S. taxpayers who support the park service “continue to enjoy affordable access, while international visitors contribute their fair share to maintaining and improving our parks for future generations!”

A White House post on X laying out the increased fees ended with the phrase, “AMERICANS FIRST.”

The announcement follows a July executive order in which President Donald Trump directed the parks to increase entry fees for foreign tourists.




“There's a lot to unpack in this announcement, including many questions on its implementation – all which NPCA will raise with the Department of Interior,” Kati Schmidt, a spokesperson for National Parks Conservation Association, said in an email.

The U.S. Travel Association estimated that in 2018, national parks and monuments saw more than 14 million international visitors. Yellowstone reported that in 2024, nearly 15% of its visitors were from outside the country, which was down from 30% in 2018.

The money made off the new fees will help support the national parks, including with upgrading facilities for visitors and maintenance, according to the statement.

The “resident-only patriotic fee-free days” next year include Veterans Day, which was one of the parks' eight free days open to everyone in 2025. The Department of the Interior had announced those days by saying they wanted to ensure that “everyone, no matter their ZIP code, can access and enjoy the benefits of green spaces and our public lands.”

Watch live from the scene as a fire spreads across seven high-rise apartment buildings in a Hong Kong housing complex, killing 13 people and leaving others trapped, according to the city's fire services.

HONG KONG (AP) — Hong Kong's deadliest fire in years blazed through high-rise apartment buildings into the night Wednesday as the city's leader confirmed at least 36 people, including a firefighter, had died and another 279 people were reported missing.

Hundreds of residents were evacuated as the blaze spread across seven of the eight buildings in a housing complex in Tai Po district, a suburb in the New Territories. At least 29 others remained hospitalized. Bright flames and smoke shot out of windows as night fell. 

Investigators will be looking into factors including whether material on the exterior walls of high-rise buildings met fire resistance standards, as the rapid spread of the fire was unusual, authorities said.

Officials earlier said the fire started on the external scaffolding of one of the buildings, a 32-storey tower, and later spread to inside the building and then to nearby buildings, likely aided by windy conditions. 

“Police and the Fire Services Department have already set up a dedicated investigation team to investigate” the fire and its cause, John Lee, Hong Kong's chief executive, said. The probe includes whether criminal elements are involved.

Chinese leader Xi Jinping on Wednesday expressed condolences to the firefighter who died and extended sympathies to the families of the victims, according to state broadcaster CCTV. He also urged efforts to minimize casualties and losses.




The fire at three of the buildings was “coming under control” shortly past midnight, according to the Fire Services Department.

The housing complex consisted of eight buildings with almost 2,000 apartments housing about 4,800 residents, including many elderly people. It was built in the 1980s and had recently been undergoing a major renovation.

Fire chiefs said high temperatures at the scene made it difficult for crews to mount rescue operations. A column of flames and thick smoke rose as the blaze spread quickly on bamboo scaffolding and construction netting that had been set up around the exterior of the buildings. About 900 people were evacuated to temporary shelters.

Authorities said that hundreds of firefighters, police officers and paramedics were deployed. Firefighters aimed water at the intense flames from high up on ladder trucks.

The blaze, which started mid-afternoon, was upgraded a level 5 alarm — the highest level of severity — as night fell. Authorities said that conditions remained very challenging for firefighters. 

“Debris and scaffolding of the affected buildings (is) falling down,” said Derek Armstrong Chan, deputy director of Fire Service operations. “The temperature inside the buildings concerned is very high. It's difficult for us to enter the building and go upstairs to conduct firefighting and rescue operations.”

The fire department said that it received “numerous” calls requesting assistance. It said some residents remained trapped as of Wednesday night.

Firefighters deployed more than 140 fire trucks and more than 60 ambulances to the scene.

The dead included a 37-year-old firefighter, while another received treatment for heat exhaustion, Director of Fire Services Andy Yeung said.

District officials in Tai Po have opened temporary shelters for people left homeless by the fire.




“I've given up thinking about my property,” a resident who only provided her surname, Wu, told local TV station TVB. “Watching it burn like that was really frustrating.”

Tai Po is a suburban area in the New Territories, in the northern part of Hong Kong and near the border with the mainland Chinese city of Shenzhen.

Bamboo scaffolding is a common sight in Hong Kong at building construction and renovation projects, though the government said earlier this year that it would start phasing it out for public projects because of safety concerns.

The fire is the deadliest in Hong Kong in years. In November 1996, 41 people died in a commercial building in Kowloon in a level 5 fire that lasted for around 20 hours.

Paul Skenes is getting rewarded for his historic performance.

In just his second season in the big leagues, the Pittsburgh Pirates flamethrower led the majors with a 1.97 ERA while striking out 216 batters en route to a unanimous National League Cy Young Award victory.

Skenes, who is not even eligible for arbitration yet, will receive a record $3.4 million from the pre-arbitration bonus pool that was created in 2022.

The $50 million pool was implemented in the newest collective bargaining agreement to reward top players who aren't yet arbitration eligible (no more than three years of MLB service). The previous high was Bobby Witt Jr.'s $3.1 million for the 2024 season, which came after signing a $288.7 million, 11-year deal with the Kansas City Royals before the year started.

Skenes received $2.5 million alone for winning the Cy Young Award. He made more than $2 million last year for his unanimous Rookie of the Year performance despite not making his MLB debut until May 11.

Skenes is under team control for the rest of this decade, but given the Pirates' history of not paying big-time players, his name has already been circulating in the rumor mill.

RED SOX ADD SONNY GRAY TO ROTATION IN TRADE, WHILE CARDINALS PICK UP PAIR OF YOUNG PITCHERS

Skenes was linked to the New York Yankees in a report from NJ Advance Media. A former Pirates teammate of Skenes reportedly told the outlet the pitcher was "hoping for a trade" before he becomes a free agent in 2029. Skenes, however, dismissed the notion.

More MLB records could be well on the way for Skenes, who is set to reach free agency at age 28. The largest deal ever given to a pitcher, both in dollars and years, is Yoshinobu Yamamoto's $325 million over 12 years with the Los Angeles Dodgers. At age 25, he received that deal before even throwing an MLB pitch, having won three consecutive MVP awards in Japan.

The largest contract ever given out by the Pirates is the $106.8 million deal they gave to Bryan Reynolds ahead of the 2023 season. Ke'Bryan Hayes is second at $70 million, and before that, it was the $60 million given to Jason Kendall in 2000.

MEXICO CITY (AP) — Mexico unveiled plans Wednesday to build what it claims will be Latin America's most powerful supercomputer — a project the government says will help the country capitalize on the rapidly evolving uses of artificial intelligence and exponentially expand the country's computing capacity.

Dubbed “Coatlicue” for the Mexica goddess considered the earth mother, the supercomputer would be seven times more powerful than the region's current leader in Brazil, José Merino, head of the Telecommunications and Digital Transformation Agency.

President Claudia Sheinbaum said during her morning news briefing that the location for the project had not been decided yet, but construction will begin next year.

“We're very excited,” said Sheinbaum, an academic and climate scientist. “It is going to allow Mexico to fully get in on the use of artificial intelligence and the processing of data that today we don't have the capacity to do.”

Merino said that Mexico's most powerful supercomputer operates at 2.3 petaflops — a unit to measure computing speed, meaning it can perform one quadrillion operations per second. Coatlicue would have a capacity of 314 petaflops.

KHAN YOUNIS, Gaza Strip (AP) — Israel handed over the bodies of 15 Palestinians on Wednesday, a day after Hamas returned the remains of an Israeli hostage. This is the latest exchange as part of a U.S.-brokered ceasefire reached last month, whose first phase is winding down even as violence continues in Palestinian territories.

The remains of two hostages, one Israeli and a Thai national who were abducted in the Oct. 7, 2023 Hamas-led attack on Israel that ignited the war, are still to be returned. 

Hamas said it's committed to handing them over even though the recovery is made difficult by widespread destruction in Gaza, while Israel has accused the militants of stalling after the last living hostages were released on Oct. 13 during the most urgent phase of the ceasefire.

Turkish, Qatari and Egyptian mediators met in Cairo on Tuesday to discuss the second phase of the ceasefire.

That is expected to include deploying an armed International Stabilization Force, tasked with ensuring the disarmament of Hamas, a key demand of Israel, and developing an international body to govern Gaza and oversee reconstruction.

But major questions hang over nearly every part of the plan and the time frame for implementation of the fragile ceasefire that has held despite accusations of violations by both sides.

Separately, Israel's military said Wednesday that it conducted airstrikes and a “broad counterterrorism operation” in the northern part of the Israeli-occupied West Bank. It said the operation followed the killing of “three terrorists who took part in terror attacks against IDF soldiers and Israeli civilians.”

According to the ceasefire, Israel has agreed to return 15 Palestinian bodies for each hostage recovered. So far, 345 bodies have been returned, said the Gaza Health Ministry. It is unclear if they were people killed in Israel during the Oct. 7 attack, Palestinian detainees who died in Israeli custody or bodies taken from Gaza by Israeli troops during the war.

Meanwhile, Israel mourned the latest hostage to be returned by the Palestinian militants, Dror Or. Israel's military said Or and his wife, Yonat Or, were killed by militants who overran their community of Kibbutz Be'eri on Oct. 7, 2023.

Before they were killed, the couple evacuated two of their children, Alma and Noam, from their burning house through a window, said the Hostages Families Forum. The children were abducted by the militants and released in a hostage deal in November 2023.

The forum remembered Or as a devoted father and talented cheesemaker who spent years working at the Be'eri dairy, eventually managing it.

In total, Palestinian militants killed some 1,200 people across southern Israel and abducted 251 to Gaza in their attack.

Israeli troops opened fire Wednesday on a group of people in central Gaza, killing a Palestinian man and wounding at least two others, according to Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital, which received the casualties.

Israel's military said it did not have enough information about the incident to comment.

Also Wednesday, the military said its troops targeted a group of six militants in the southern city of Rafah, killing one. The military statement said that the militants had “most likely emerged from the underground terror infrastructure in the area.” Troops then searched a nearby building, killing three more and apprehending two, it said. 

Later on Wednesday, the military said troops had killed two “terrorists” – one a member of Islamic Jihad – who had approached the IDF in two separate incidents in southern Gaza.

The Gaza Health Ministry said at least 69,775 Palestinians have been killed — 345 Palestinians since the ceasefire — and 170,863 injured in Israel's offensive in Gaza. It does not distinguish between civilians and combatants in its figures, but has said women and children make up a majority of those killed. The ministry is staffed by medical professionals and maintains detailed records viewed as generally reliable by independent experts.

An Israeli military operation took place on Wednesday in the governorate of Tubas in the West Bank.

Gov. Ahmad Al-Asaad said the operation involved Apache helicopters and military vehicles, saying Tubas was essentially “cut off” by Israeli troops.

“This military operation is a prelude to annexation, and since the early hours of the morning, we have activated the central emergency committee to respond to the citizens' distress call in the Tubas Governorate,” he said.

The IDF said its operation — which included the Air Force striking “to isolate and contain the area” — was a response to “attempts to establish terrorist strongholds and construction of terror infrastructures in the area.”

Last week, Israel's prime minister met with top security officials to discuss a rising tide of Israeli settler violence in the West Bank, which Israel captured alongside Gaza and east Jerusalem in the 1967 war and Palestinians see as central to a future state. 

A few days earlier, Palestinian attackers stabbed an Israeli to death and wounded three more before being shot down by troops in the latest violence to rock the occupied territory.

Officials have warned that the unrest could spill over and undermine the fragile truce in Gaza.

Turkey's intelligence chief Ibrahim Kalin met in Cairo on Tuesday with Qatar's Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani and Egypt's intelligence chief Hasan Reshat to discuss advancing to the second phase of the Gaza ceasefire agreement, a Turkish security official said. 




The talks also centered on intensifying joint efforts with the United States to strengthen the truce, according to the official who requested anonymity in line with Turkish regulations. 

Indonesia, the world's largest Muslim-majority nation with a long experience in U.N. peacekeeping missions, is among the countries the U.S. has discussed the ISF plan with, in addition to Azerbaijan, Egypt and Qatar.

On Tuesday, Gen. Agus Subianto, Chief of the Indonesian Armed Forces, said they're “in the selection phase for the peacekeeping force.”

On Thursday, Pope Leo XIV is expected to take his first foreign trip, traveling first to various sites in Turkey and then to Beirut, Lebanon. Israel struck Lebanon's capital on Sunday, killing Hezbollah's chief of staff Haytham Tabtabai and warning the Iran-backed militant group not to rearm and rebuild.

Watch live from the scene as a fire spreads across seven high-rise apartment buildings in a Hong Kong housing complex, killing 13 people and leaving others trapped, according to the city's fire services.

HONG KONG (AP) — Hong Kong's deadliest fire in years blazed late into the night on Wednesday as the city's leader confirmed at least 36 people, including a firefighter, had died and another 279 people were reported missing.

Hundreds of residents were evacuated as the blaze spread across seven high-rise apartment buildings in a housing complex in Tai Po district, a suburb in the New Territories. At least 29 others remained hospitalized.

“Police and the Fire Services Department have already set up a dedicated investigation team to investigate the cause of the fire,” John Lee, Hong Kong's chief executive, said.

He said the fire was “coming under control” shortly past midnight.

Chinese leader Xi Jinping on Wednesday expressed condolences to the firefighter who died and extended sympathies to the families of the victims, according to state broadcaster CCTV. He also urged efforts to minimize casualties and losses.

The housing complex consisted of eight buildings with almost 2,000 apartments housing about 4,800 residents, including many elderly people. The housing complex was built in the 1980s and has recently been undergoing a major renovation.

Fire chiefs said high temperatures at the scene made it difficult for crews to mount rescue operations. It was not immediately known how the fire started, but officials said the fire started at the external scaffolding of one of the buildings, a 32-storey tower, and later spread to inside the building and then to nearby buildings, likely aided by windy conditions. 




A column of flames and thick smoke rose as the blaze spread quickly on bamboo scaffolding and construction netting that had been set up around the exterior of the buildings. About 900 people were evacuated to temporary shelters.

Multiple buildings close to each other were set ablaze, with bright flames and smoke shooting out of windows as night fell. Authorities said that hundreds of firefighters, police officers and paramedics were deployed. Firefighters aimed water at the intense flames from high up on ladder trucks.

The blaze, which started mid-afternoon, was upgraded a level 5 alarm — the highest level of severity — as night fell. Authorities said that conditions remained very challenging for firefighters. 

“Debris and scaffolding of the affected buildings (is) falling down,” said Derek Armstrong Chan, deputy director of Fire Service operations. “The temperature inside the buildings concerned is very high. It's difficult for us to enter the building and go upstairs to conduct firefighting and rescue operations.”

The fire department said that it received “numerous” calls requesting assistance. It said some residents remained trapped as of Wednesday night.

Firefighters deployed more than 140 fire trucks and more than 60 ambulances to the scene.

The dead included a 37-year-old firefighter, while another received treatment for heat exhaustion, Director of Fire Services Andy Yeung said.

District officials in Tai Po have opened temporary shelters for people left homeless by the fire.




“I've given up thinking about my property,” a resident who only provided her surname, Wu, told local TV station TVB. “Watching it burn like that was really frustrating.”

Tai Po is a suburban area in the New Territories, in the northern part of Hong Kong and near the border with the mainland Chinese city of Shenzhen.

Bamboo scaffolding is a common sight in Hong Kong at building construction and renovation projects, though the government said earlier this year that it would start phasing it out for public projects because of safety concerns.

The fire is the deadliest in Hong Kong in years. In November 1996, 41 people died in a commercial building in Kowloon in a level 5 fire that lasted for around 20 hours.

Julian Edelman joins Colin Cowherd to discuss Shedeur Sanders' first start in the NFL, the Kansas City Chiefs, and Drake Maye's MVP-like season with the New England Patriots. 

Ed Kelce has a message for Travis Kelce's critics. 

Kelce, 74, took to social media to praise his youngest son's play this season. 

"If anyone questions how good Travis is playing; through Week 10 he leads all tight ends in total yardage," Kelce posted on Instagram.

The Kansas City Chiefs tight end was the NFL league leader among tight ends in total yards through Week 10, but fell to second after Week 12. Arizona Cardinals tight end Trey McBride leads all tight ends in both receptions (80) and yards (797). 

Kelce is second in the NFL among tight ends with 674 yards, with the Indianapolis Colts' rookie Tyler Warren just behind him with 662 yards. The 36-year-old has been resurgent for the Chiefs this season, as he has 54 catches and four touchdowns in addition to his 674 yards.

The 10-time Pro Bowler already has more touchdowns than he did last season and, despite his diminished athleticism, has been a reliable target for Patrick Mahomes.

The four-time All-Pro quickly quashed any retirement rumors last season, as shortly after the team's crushing Super Bowl loss to the Philadelphia Eagles, he announced his return. Last week, Kelce said he would let the Chiefs know his intentions to play in 2026 before NFL free agency begins in March 2026 to give the team ample time to plan their offseason. 

Kelce had four catches for 43 yards in the Chiefs' 23-20 win over the Colts on Sunday. The Chiefs improved to 6-5 with the win but remain outside the playoff picture.

The Chiefs must get hot down the stretch if they want to make the playoffs, let alone win the division. 

Their next game will be on center stage, as they will take on the surging Dallas Cowboys (5-5-1) on Thanksgiving at 4:30 p.m. ET.

The Brazilian mother of White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt‘s 11-year-old nephew has been arrested by Immigration and Customs Enforcement for overstaying her visa by decades.

Bruna Caroline Ferreria was formerly engaged to Michael Leavitt, the press secretary's brother. The pair has joint custody over their son, CNN reported.

Ferreria has lived in the United States illegally since overstaying her visa in June 1999, and her attorney said she is a former recipient of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals. She was unable to renew her status during President Donald Trump's first term, the attorney added.

Ferreria is the mother of Leavitt's nephew, and they have not spoken in many years, a source familiar with the situation told the Washington Examiner. The child has lived full-time in New Hampshire with his father since he was born and has never lived with his mother, they added.

She was arrested while driving to pick up her son in New Hampshire, CNN reported. A Department of Homeland Security spokesperson referred to her as a “criminal illegal alien from Brazil” and confirmed her arrest. The spokesperson also noted Ferreria has a prior arrest for battery.

Ferreira's attorney, Todd Pomerleau, said she is a good mother and that he is fighting to get her out of custody.

“I'm just trying to fight to get her out of jail,” Pomerleau said. “She should not be sitting in a jail hours away from her family and from her child's life. She's a great mom, and from what I heard, I think he's been a pretty good dad.”

The DHS spokesperson said Ferreira is being detained in Louisiana and is undergoing removal proceedings.

“She entered the U.S. on a B2 tourist visa that required her to depart the U.S. by June 6, 1999,” the spokesperson said. “She is currently at the South Louisiana ICE Processing Center and is in removal proceedings. Under President Trump and Secretary Noem, all individuals unlawfully present in the United States are subject to deportation.”

Michael Leavitt told WMUR that he wants the best for his son, and his biggest concern is his son's safety and well-being following the arrest.

A GoFundMe has been started for Ferreira by her sister, Graziela Dos Santos Rodrigues, for legal fees and expenses. More than $16,500 has been raised so far. Rodrigues said Ferreira was brought to the U.S. as a child in December 1998.

“My family is going through one of the most difficult moments of our lives, and we're reaching out with a humble plea for help,” Rodrigues wrote. “My sister, Bruna, was recently detained by immigration and is now fighting to stay in the country she has called home for nearly her entire life.”

“Since then, she has done everything in her power to build a stable, honest life here,” she added. “She has maintained her legal status through DACA, followed every requirement, and has always strived to do the right thing.”

Rodrigues said Ferreira's absence has been “especially painful” for her son, “who needs his mother and hopes every single day that she'll be home in time for the holidays.”

LEAVITT DOES DAMAGE CONTROL AFTER ‘FRUSTRATED' TRUMP LASHES OUT AT REPORTER AND CALLS FOR EXECUTING DEMOCRATS

Trump attempted to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program during his first term but was rebuffed by the court for not taking the proper steps to do so. DHS spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin recently told the Associated Press that those under DACA “are not automatically protected from deportations,” and added that “DACA does not confer any form of legal status in this country.”

The Washington Examiner reached out to the White House press secretary for comment but did not receive a response.

A judge on Wednesday dismissed the Georgia election interference case against President Donald Trump and others after the prosecutor who recently took over the case said he would not pursue the charges.

The case's abandonment ends the last effort to punish the president for his efforts to overturn his 2020 election loss.

Pete Skandalakis, the executive director of the Prosecuting Attorneys' Council of Georgia, took over the case earlier this month from Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis, who was removed over an “appearance of impropriety” created by a romantic relationship with the special prosecutor she chose to lead the case.

Willis' 2023 indictment against Trump and 18 others alleged a wide-ranging conspiracy to illegally overturn Trump's loss to Joe Biden in Georgia. 

It was unlikely that legal action against Trump could have moved forward while he is president. But other defendants, including former New York mayor and Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani and former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, still faced charges.

A coalition of current, former and retired employees at the National Park Service is denouncing a plan by the Trump administration to charge international tourists an extra $100 to enter some of the most popular U.S. parks, on top of the normal entrance fee. Fees for an annual park pass will also jump to $250 for international visitors.

“In a year where national park staff have already been cut by nearly 25%, we worry this will be yet another burden for already overworked employees,'' said Emily Thompson, executive director of the Coalition to Protect America's National Parks.

Parks attract millions of international visitors every year who are “an important economic driver for our parks,” Thompson added.

“National parks should be available and accessible to all, or America's best idea will become America's greatest shakedown,'' she said.

Although a series of cases once threatened to imperil Trump's political career and personal liberty, the abandonment of the Georgia case is the latest reflection of how he has emerged mostly unscathed.

Former Justice Department special counsel Jack Smith, who had charged Trump with conspiring to overturn the results of the 2020 election and hoarding classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida, dropped both cases after Trump won the White House last year. He cited longstanding Justice Department policy against the indictment of a sitting president.

And though Trump was convicted of felony charges in New York in connection with hush money payments during the 2016 election, he was sentenced in January to an unconditional discharge, leaving his conviction intact but sparing him any punishment.

“The political persecution of President Trump by disqualified DA Fani Willis is finally over,” attorney Steve Sadow said. “This case should never have been brought. A fair and impartial prosecutor has put an end to this lawfare.”

The nonpartisan Prosecuting Attorneys' Council of Georgia was tasked with replacing Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis from the case after she was disqualified over an “appearance of impropriety” created by a romantic relationship with the special prosecutor she'd chosen to lead the case.

Fulton County Superior Court Judge Scott McAfee set a Nov. 14 deadline for the appointment of a new prosecutor, so Pete Skandalakis, executive director for the Prosecuting Attorneys' Council of Georgia chose to appoint himself rather than allowing the case to be dismissed.

“Several prosecutors were contacted and, while all were respectful and professional, each declined the appointment,” Skandalakis said in an emailed statement.

The prosecutor who recently took over the Georgia election interference case against Trump and others said in a court filing Wednesday that he has decided not to pursue the case further.

A senior Kremlin official confirmed Wednesday that U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff is set to visit Moscow next week as efforts pick up speed to find a consensus on ending the nearly four-year war between Russia and Ukraine.

But Yuri Ushakov, Putin's foreign affairs adviser, insisted that Kremlin officials haven't officially received the initial U.S. peace proposal, although they have acknowledged that they have seen a copy obtained through back channels. Representatives of the United States, Russia and Ukraine held talks earlier this week in the United Arab Emirates.

“Contact is ongoing, including via telephone, but no one has yet sat down at a roundtable and discussed this point by point. That hasn't happened,” Ushakov told Russian state media.

Trump's chief interlocutor with the Russian government last month advised a senior aide to Vladimir Putin on how the Russian leader should go about pitching the U.S. president on a Ukraine peace plan. 

That's according to a transcript of the Oct. 14 call published Tuesday by Bloomberg News. The news agency said it reviewed a recording of the call. 

It said Trump envoy Steve Witkoff advised Putin's foreign policy adviser Yuri Ushakov that Putin should call the U.S. leader to congratulate him and praise Trump for the Gaza peace deal. Trump described Witkoff's approach as “standard” in negotiations.

Trump brought insults and grievances to the traditional Thanksgiving turkey pardoning ceremony at the White House.

On Tuesday, he joked about sending the turkeys to a prison in El Salvador and suggested naming them after Democratic stalwarts Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi. Trump also claimed that last year's turkey pardons by President Joe Biden were invalid.

Trump eventually got around to the business at hand, which was pardoning the turkeys Gobble and Waddle. 

Trump used part of his ceremonial remarks to insist that the price of Thanksgiving meals was dropping under his leadership, although his numbers are misleading. Some research indicates that holiday dinners could cost more this year, a reminder of persistent frustration with inflation.

            President Donald Trump brushed off concerns about his special envoy Steve Witkoff's engagements with the Kremlin after a new phone call transcript provided rare insight into how the president's top negotiator advised his Russian counterpart.
    


            In the October 14 audio recording reviewed and transcribed by Bloomberg, Witkoff counsels top Russian foreign policy adviser Yuri Ushakov on how Russian President Vladimir Putin should approach a call with Trump. The transcript offers key new insight about the behind-the-scenes talks that produced a 28-point peace plan that has been the subject of intense discussions between the Trump administration, Russia and Ukraine in recent days.
    


            “He's gotta sell this to Ukraine, he's gotta sell Ukraine to Russia. That's what a deal maker does,” Trump told reporters on Air Force One Tuesday evening when asked about the reported transcript of the call.
    


            “I haven't heard it, but I heard it was standard negotiation. And I would imagine he's saying the same thing to Ukraine, because each party has to give and take,” the president added.
    


            The transcript generated concern among some GOP Russia hawks on Capitol Hill who asserted that Witkoff was too much under Russia's spell. Rep. Don Bacon called for him to be fired.
    


            “For those who oppose the Russian invasion and want to see Ukraine prevail as a sovereign & democratic country, it is clear that Witkoff fully favors the Russians. He cannot be trusted to lead these negotiations. Would a Russian paid agent do less than he?” Bacon wrote on X.
    


            Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick called it “a major problem. And one of the many reasons why these ridiculous side shows and secret meetings need to stop.”
    


            Trump, when asked if he was worried Witkoff was too “pro-Russian,” said the war could “go on for years,” adding, “Russia's got a lot more people – got a lot more soldiers. So I think if Ukraine can make a deal, it's a good thing.”
    


            Ushakov, meanwhile, expressed frustration about the leak.
    


            “Some of these leaks are fake. Others I would prefer not to comment on at all, as, for example, my conversations with Witkoff are confidential. No one should disclose them. No one!” he said in comments reported by Russian state media.
    


            Brett McGurk, a CNN global affairs analyst who served in senior national security positions under multiple presidents, said as a former negotiator his first thought was the call may have been leaked by a foreign intelligence service. He also told CNN's John Berman on Tuesday that it's unclear if it's the full transcript.
    


            McGurk added that it seemed like negotiators should regroup: “I just see this going sideways if not backwards.”
    


            According to Bloomberg's transcript of the call, Witkoff advised Ushakov to encourage his boss to congratulate Trump on a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas when the two leaders spoke. That was indeed communicated two days later.
    


            “President Putin congratulated me and the United States on the Great Accomplishment of Peace in the Middle East, something that, he said, has been dreamed of for centuries. I actually believe that the Success in the Middle East will help in our negotiation in attaining an end to the War with Russia/Ukraine,” Trump said in a social media post after the two leaders spoke in October.
    


            Witkoff, notably, encouraged Ushakov in the call to have the leaders speak before Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky held talks with Trump at the White House.
    


            Trump's call with Putin took place on October 16 and the two-and-a-half-hour conversation appeared to shift the US president's tone toward Russia after weeks of frustration with a lack of progress toward ending the war.
    


            The next day, Trump hosted Zelensky at the White House for a working lunch that turned tense when Trump insisted Ukraine make territorial concessions to Russia to end the war, according to European officials briefed on the meeting at the time.
    


            Trump, who would later endorse a freeze in current battle lines as part of a peace settlement, grew frustrated and raised his voice multiple times, the officials said.
    


            Witkoff also floated the idea of putting together a “20-point peace proposal” during his call with Ushakov similar to his efforts in Gaza. That eventually led to a 28-point peace proposal that included many concessions to Russia, including Kyiv ceding territory, giving up ambitions to join NATO and limiting the size of its army.
    


            After high-level diplomatic talks between the US and Ukraine in Geneva, Switzerland, and between the US and Russia in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, the contours of that plan have shifted.
    


            Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Sunday described the plan as a “living, breathing document.”
    


            Witkoff is now expected to travel to Moscow for additional negotiations as soon as next week, according to Trump, who told reporters that the envoy could also be joined by his son-in-law, Jared Kushner.
    


Army Secretary Dan Driscoll is also expected to travel to Kyiv later this week for peace talks.
    


            Trump suggested he would be open to meeting with Zelensky and Putin, but not until the deal is final or in final stages.
    


            Asked if that meant his Thanksgiving deadline was flexible, he said, “I don't have a deadline – I just – you know what the deadline for me is? When it's over.”

Imagine we had cheap and abundant energy. Some radical ideas are actually within our reach.

What could you do with energy that's cheap, clean, and near unlimited?

You could live in a home built to your precise needs that stays cozy and cool all year long. You could swim in a heated pool filled with ultra-pure recycled water. You could grill a steak grown in a factory, from cell on up, marbled, textured, and flavored to perfection. You could visit a nature preserve on land reclaimed from mines and farms, teeming with once-endangered animal life. You could get whisked comfortably and quietly anywhere by robots, whether down the street or the other side of the world. You could plan every weekend outing for the next month, counting on reliable, far-reaching weather forecasts. And all of your garbage would break down into its constituent elements, destined to be reassembled into new shoes, cars, and refrigerators.

This is all speculation, but the pace of improvement in clean energy and the scale of its deployment put these ideas within the realm of possibility.

Energy shapes the limits of what a society can build, sustain, and imagine, and the more of it we have at our disposal, the further we can push those boundaries. What we would decide to do with vastly more energy has huge implications for our politics, our economy, our environment, and our prosperity.

This year, the world is poised to spend $2.2 trillion on clean energy — power from the wind, the sun, the water, and splitting atoms. It also includes upgrades to the power grid, new forms of energy storage, and increased efficiency.

This investment has mostly been trumpeted as a way to help limit climate change. Humanity's collective deployment of clean energy and increasing efficiency so far has already helped take some of the worst-case scenarios off the table.

However, climate change is a low political priority now. A more compelling case for clean energy is that it's often the best way to get cheap energy, and to get a lot of it. The deployment of wind and solar power around the world continues to defy expectations, while the growth trajectory of energy storage is following close behind. This suite of technologies is taking off around the world — not because of a carbon tax or even environmental concerns, but because clean energy is simply better at meeting the needs of a moment when energy appetites are growing.

Suppose we alter the framing and approach solving climate change not as a task merely of curbing emissions, but of increasing access and lowering costs of better ways to power the world even further. It's an approach that leads with prosperity and quality of life, while creating a more stable climate in the process.

If we make it a priority to get more clean energy, that raises the interesting — and fun — question of what we should do with it. After all, we're not collecting energy for the sake of energy but to do stuff.

Cheap, clean, plentiful energy doesn't just help people save money on their power bills; it unlocks new industries, makes thorny political problems moot, and helps repair the planet. These use cases are important motivations for why the transition to clean energy needs to happen and how it can bring about a better world for all of us. It's why we're doing this at all.

We can exchange heat and electrons for just about anything on Earth. How much energy a person uses is an effective proxy for how well off they are — how much food they can eat, how comfortable they are at home, how educated they are. We can see this play out in the cost and quality of lighting, which, in the UK alone, dropped 99.9 percent since 1700, tracing how economies grew as people shifted from campfires, to kerosene lamps, to LED bulbs, and beyond.

The global energy landscape is changing rapidly. Fossil fuels are still the dominant ways we heat, power, and get around the world, but renewable energy capacity is rocketing upward.

“Energy is prosperity,” said Eric Toone, chief technology officer at Breakthrough Energy, a high-tech clean energy funding firm founded by Bill Gates in 2015. “Energy is the capacity to do work. Energy is the capacity to build things, to make things, to move things.”

The potential of near-unlimited energy has been tantalizing researchers for decades, since the last big energy revolution, the dawn of the nuclear age.

“It is not too much to expect that our children will enjoy in their homes electrical energy too cheap to meter, will know of great periodic regional famines in the world only as matters of history, will travel effortlessly over the seas and under them and through the air with a minimum of danger and at great speeds, and will experience a lifespan far longer than ours, as disease yields and man comes to understand what causes him to age,” said Lewis Strauss, chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission, in 1954. “This is the forecast for an age of peace.”

Nuclear power didn't make this dream come true. It did provide huge amounts of electricity, but its construction and operating costs rose as other energy sources got cheaper. Meanwhile, environmental activists and some policymakers shifted their energy strategy to conservation rather than expanding the pool of power. Yet, the prospect of producing energy in such vast quantities that its cost is a minor concern is still one that lures scientists, engineers, and investors. And the recent technology trends do give some observers hope that this dream is within reach.

“Long-term, I think there's good reason to think that at least lots of places in the world will have much less expensive and more stable energy, especially once they've made the investment in the next generation infrastructure,” said Daniel Vermeer, a researcher at Duke University studying the future of energy. “And I think that's going to happen in a lot of places.”

How much more energy? “I think we're looking at double the electricity production,” Vermeer said.

So, in the best tradition of economic thought experiments, let's assume a can opener. What do we open first?

If we vastly increase our energy supply from current levels, food and water are where we can get the most bang for the British Thermal Unit (BTU). “It's so fundamental to human prosperity,” Vermeer said. “It's also where people will see benefits the fastest.”

We already spend a huge amount of our energy to produce food, and agriculture accounts for one-third of humanity's greenhouse gas output. The fertilizer used to grow crops alone accounts for 5 percent of the world's greenhouse gases — more than aviation and shipping combined — and most fertilizers rely on natural gas as a feedstock. If we had the power and materials to produce more zero-emissions fertilizer, farmers could extract greater yields from the same amount of land. And decarbonizing the supply chain with electric tractors and trucks to bring food to markets would further increase efficiency. Getting the most out of our existing farms will be essential to feeding the world's growing population. Otherwise, expanding farms will continue to devour forests and wildlands.

The next generation of farming techniques could create similar yields on even smaller plots of land, allowing food to be produced year round, nearer to major population centers or even within them. One approach is vertical farming, where crops are grown vertically in controlled indoor environments instead of horizontally across fields. Many vertical farming techniques are already being used today. But with more cheap energy to run pumps, lights, and fans, we can scale this up further.

Water is essential to all life as we know it, and we haven't been doing a great job of judiciously using it. In recent years, some major cities have been teetering on the brink of running out of water. And with average temperatures rising, many regions are poised to see more severe droughts.

However, two-thirds of the world is covered in water, and widespread desalination would allow the world to tap into that vast, currently undrinkable supply. The main techniques for desalination are distillation and reverse osmosis, and right now, both require a lot of energy. But, if there's a lot of cheap power on tap, then desalination could be a primary source of water for some communities, allowing freshwater rivers and aquifers to recharge. It would also resolve many of the political conflicts around water.

Unlimited energy could allow us to bioengineer our food sources from individual nutrients to maximize nourishment. Precision fermentation, or electro-food, is an emerging technology that uses specially designed microorganisms like yeast or bacteria to make proteins, fats, or nutrients like those found in animal products. Instead of raising cows or chickens, you could “brew” milk, eggs, or meat ingredients in fermentation tanks — just like the process of making beer.

Cheap, clean electricity can power these breweries as they use captured carbon and hydrogen as ingredients. Companies are already selling animal-free dairy and egg proteins made this way. As renewable power becomes abundant, precision fermentation could scale up, feeding growing populations with a fraction of the land, water, and emissions of traditional agriculture

Now, let's take precision fermentation even further. Cultivating cells into whole steaks is starting to become possible, but it's an expensive and involved process. If this could truly get off the ground, it would have huge knock-on benefits for the environment. Raising livestock right now draws a huge toll in terms of land use, energy and water consumption, and waste production, not to mention the immense ethical problems embedded in raising and killing animals for food. If we can turn energy into meat that replaces conventional livestock, that would solve so many environmental issues all at once. But, convincing people to eat it remains a barrier. Already, there are seven states that have banned lab-grown meat. “Laboratory agriculture and producing things without animals is possible from a technical perspective, but we have to get a lot more sophisticated about how people make those decisions,” Toone said.

Whether or not you're bullish on AI, it's clear that more of our jobs and lives hinge on access to computing power and storage. Right now, data centers are a big part of the story of growing electricity demand, and speculation about their future energy needs is already starting to drive up electricity prices for ordinary people.

But with fewer energy constraints, more computing tools could become available to more people, and these resources can then be used to resolve some of our biggest energy and environmental challenges. It may also be a necessary investment for the US to retain a competitive edge. “I, for one, have become completely convinced that it's necessary to win at AI for national security,” said Neil Chatterjee, a former commissioner on the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. “How do we generate the power to win the AI race while keeping electricity affordable and not backsliding? There's no simple solution, but I'm confident we can get there.”

How can we mitigate their worst effects?

Utilities can require tech firms to pay a deposit to for their future power needs so they don't over-inflate their needs. Data centers can also face mandates to bring their own generation and energy storage, which could also support the broader grid.

Operators of these facilities can shift energy-intensive tasks to low-demand periods, though this flexibility may be limited. Their size incentivizes efficient electricity use, and computing will likely grow more energy-efficient over time as the technology improves.

AI can further accelerate the clean-energy transition by streamlining permitting applications for wind and solar projects, improving materials design, enhancing weather forecasting, and strengthening models of energy demand.

With food and water sorted, we can then start to chip away at the root cause of climate change: the rising concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere from burning fossil fuels that are heating up the planet. Halting climate change thus means stopping these emissions entirely. And in the increasingly likely scenario where we overshoot our goal of limiting global average temperatures from rising more than 1.5 degrees Celsius, it also means deliberately pulling carbon back out from the environment. It's not enough to simply produce more energy; the world needs negative greenhouse gas emissions.

Humanity currently spews more than 40 gigatons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere every year. So, to move the needle, we need to think about carbon management solutions that can work on this scale.

There are a few ways to do this. One is capturing carbon dioxide at the source. At conventional coal and natural gas-fired power plants, carbon capture systems currently impose a large parasitic load, around a quarter of the generator's power output. That makes it hard to build a business case for carbon capture at fossil fuel power plants. But other industrial processes, like steel production, also emit carbon dioxide, and point-source capture can decarbonize this and other processes that don't currently have an easy zero-emissions alternative.

We can also capture carbon dioxide straight from the air. There are already companies developing machines that can filter carbon from the atmosphere. Some businesses are also working on ways to pull carbon dioxide dissolved in seawater. The challenge is that it requires a lot of energy to move the amount of air and water needed to draw out significant amounts of carbon, which in turn raises the cost.

“Two things have to happen: One is that we have to continue to work to bring down the cost of air capture,” Toone said. Currently, it costs around $500 per ton to pull carbon dioxide out of the air. The goal is to get it down to $100 per ton or less. “Then societies have to become affluent enough that they're willing to do it and recognize the dangers caused by climate change,” Toone added.

Another approach is enhanced weathering, which speeds up natural processes where rocks like limestone react with carbon dioxide in rainwater, forming a chemical bond that permanently locks it away.

If you don't lock away carbon dioxide, you can put it to work. It's an important raw ingredient for chemicals and materials. You can use it to make fuels reconstituted from the air, polymers, enzymes, concrete, as well as make your drinks bubbly. This has the potential to become a trillion-dollar industry.

Waste is a mounting problem, and many synthetic materials like plastics have no natural mechanisms that break them down, making them a problem that can last for generations. Recycling plastic materials has largely failed to live up to the promise, and the bulk of plastic waste ends up in landfills. To meaningfully reuse and reconstitute polymers, the process needs to be competitive with producing virgin materials, which means the energy you use for recycling has to be dirt cheap. When we get there, we may be able to close the loop, making, unmaking, and remaking everything we need with minimal extraction from the Earth.

The next place to look is transportation. Cheap fossil fuels have shrunk the world, allowing people to cross continents and oceans in hours rather than months. How we get around is now the second-largest source of greenhouse gas emissions. Four-wheeled vehicles already have a glide path to zero emissions with electrification. The tougher challenges are going to be electrifying or decarbonizing bigger vehicles like ships and airplanes.

Container ships are the gargantuan worker ants of the global economy, transporting just about every tangible good around the world. Right now, most container ships burn some of the cheapest and dirtiest fuels imaginable, but with abundant clean energy, they could draw on cleaner sources of power. These ships may be too big to run on batteries, but with much cheaper, clean electricity, shipping companies can generate hydrogen, ammonia, methanol, or synthetic versions of conventional fuels, moving cargo without the carbon footprint.

Climate-friendly flying is still trying to get off the ground. Right now, there aren't any batteries that come anywhere close to the energy density of fossil fuels. Some airlines are deploying electric aircraft on shorter routes. However, without a breakthrough, long-haul flights will need to run on synthetic zero-emissions fuels, which demand vast quantities of low-cost energy. Or, they'll need a mechanism like direct air capture to offset their emissions.

With even more energy, we can begin thinking about commercializing promising innovations that exist only in labs or are still on the drawing board. Many of these ideas sound far-fetched, but abundant clean energy moves them into the realm of possibility.

Materials built molecule-first Imagine designing stuff the way you'd build a playlist: starting from tiny pieces and crafting exactly what you need. Shoes that bounce just right. Home insulation that actually understands seasons. Skin grafts that heal without scars. We already 3D print things, but scaling it is pricey and slow. Smarter, custom materials could make industrial printing faster, cleaner, and way less wasteful.

Space that's closer — and cleaner Getting to orbit still takes a ton of energy, and today's rocket fuels leave a pretty heavy carbon footprint. Pulling carbon dioxide out of the air could help offset launches, and cleaner electricity can make low-carbon fuels from the start. The result: space access that's not just cheaper, but easier on the planet.

Solar power that never sleeps Above the atmosphere, sunlight doesn't quit. Space-based solar collectors could soak up that uninterrupted energy and beam it back to Earth via microwaves. No clouds, no sunsets — just steady power when we need it.

Become a spacefaring civilization And instead of dragging every nut and bolt off Earth, we could mine asteroids for the raw materials already floating out there. That opens the door to building more in space — moon bases, deep-space missions, the whole sci-fi starter kit — without the crushing cost of launching every ounce from Earth.

Even if we could realize all of the exciting potential of this clean energy-powered future, some new problems could emerge if we're not careful.

First, there will be a big dislocation in the job market. There are almost 2 million people in the US working in coal, oil, and gas sectors — mining, building, transporting, and combusting these fuels. They will need new jobs or a soft landing pad that will help them move or retire. “We're potentially seeing huge shifts in governance and unionization around the world,” said Adam Cowart, who is on the faculty of foresight at the University of Houston.

Additionally, “abundant” does not necessarily mean “equal” when it comes to energy. In the year 2025, there are still 685 million people in the world who don't have access to electricity, and there's no guarantee that increasing the global supply of energy will benefit them without concerted policies to match.

Having more energy could also end up indulging people's worst impulses. Already, we've seen across much of the world that as fuels and electricity get cheaper, people end up driving bigger cars over longer distances, running their thermostats less efficiently, and eating more meat.

Valerie Thomas, professor of industrial engineering at the Georgia Institute of Technology, noted that our recent history shows that we have not used the energy we already have in a judicious way. “If we look back in history just a little bit, what do we do? We use it up on things maybe we don't even understand, like bigger houses with more air conditioning, or we would commute even longer distances,” Thomas said. It will take concerted effort to make sure new energy doesn't just go to frivolous uses.

And in her work looking at some of the poorest populations in the world, Thomas said she found that the key limits to prosperity are often things like local corruption, a lack of prenatal care, not enough vaccines, political instability, and bad economic policies. “What tends to be the barrier to the good life? I don't think it's energy,” Thomas said. That said, the world's poorest stand to gain the most from the transition to clean energy, not just for having more useful power in their lives but breathing in less pollution and having more economic autonomy.

The post-energy abundance world is not one where every problem is solved, but it's one with greater prosperity, improved human welfare, and generally a more stable climate. It will raise its own challenges, so there's no scenario where we can take it for granted.

The fossil fuel era, and much of human history, was governed by constraints. The age of clean energy is poised to be one that's more limited by imagination and choices, and the remaining solutions will be much more fun to implement.

Former White House chief information officer Theresa Payton joined 'Fox & Friends First' to discuss how OpenTable is surveilling its users and Google's warning to VPN users about a recent security threat. 

Maybe you order sparkling water, start every meal with an appetizer or prefer dining right when the restaurant opens. You might not track these habits. OpenTable might.

Some restaurants are now seeing new AI-assisted tags about diners when they book a table. These tags can note drink patterns, spending levels, review habits and last-minute cancellations.

These insights surfaced after Kat Menter, a host at a Michelin-starred restaurant who posts about food under the name Eating Out Austin, spotted the new "AI-assisted" tags at work. She shared a look at the system in a TikTok video that quickly caught attention. Media outlets then confirmed the test with additional restaurants.

WOULD YOU EAT AT A RESTAURANT RUN BY AI?

OpenTable integrates with POS (Point of Sale) platforms such as Toast or Epos. These systems handle orders, payments and timing during a meal. When your contact details match your OpenTable account, the platform can connect your visit to your profile.

This can include arrival time, general order details, time spent and bill totals. Reporting shows that these items help OpenTable generate AI summaries of non-identifiable guest data when the restaurant uses a supported POS system and has enabled data sharing. You do not need to book through OpenTable for this to happen. You only need an account and matching contact information.

Some users who pulled their data through OpenTable's privacy request form saw very limited information. Basic contact details and a list of past reservations were the main items. That suggests the insight level depends on which restaurants use POS integrations and how long they have used them.

Restaurants have tracked guest preferences for years. Staff may note favorite dishes or preferred seating. They may watch for frequent lateness or recurring celebrations. This helps them shape a smooth visit.

OpenTable's AI-summarized guest insights aim to offer a simplified version of these notes. They highlight drink categories, spending ranges or behavior patterns. However, Menter notes the tags can be off base. A single business dinner can mark someone as a high spender. Eating with friends who order cocktails can make a person look like a cocktail lover. Because of this, Menter treats the tags as loose suggestions rather than reliable signals.

THAT'S NOT A HUMAN TALKING TO YOU IN THE FAST FOOD DRIVE-THRU

OpenTable says the AI does not process personal guest data. Instead, it is employed for high-level classification and categorization of large, anonymized data sets. For instance, the AI analyzes various point-of-sale descriptions (like "glass of cabernet") to consistently categorize them as "red wine," "white wine," etc., without ever interacting with specific guest profiles.

The platform says these insights can help staff suggest dishes or set a relaxed pace. OpenTable also says the use of POS information depends on the privacy settings you choose, and you can review, adjust or opt out of data sharing at any time. Still, the privacy policy uses broad terms like dining preferences.

"Guest insights are the engine of personalization, allowing restaurants to optimize their service and deliver the kind of thoughtful hospitality that both benefits the business and offers a special experience for the diner," an OpenTable representative told CyberGuy. "These insights come from a mix of sources — including OpenTable, our restaurant partners, and POS partners — and are limited to non-confidential information."

"They might help a server suggest a dish you'll love or recognize that you prefer a more relaxed dining pace," the representative said. "We also share these insights across our network so restaurants can learn and improve the hospitality experience for everyone, not just individual guests. You're in charge of what data you share. Through your OpenTable preferences and settings, you can review, adjust, or opt out of data sharing at any time. What we share with restaurants is guided by the choices you've made in your privacy preferences."

If a diner is opted in, OpenTable shares your name, contact details, party size and special requests with the restaurant you book. The company also confirms that participating restaurants share POS data with OpenTable. This can include items ordered, bill totals and how long you stayed. OpenTable then turns this into aggregated insights.

RESTAURANT INSIDERS SHARE THE SECRETS OF SNAGGING HARD-TO-GET RESERVATIONS

OpenTable reportedly shares insights across its broader restaurant network. This applies only where enabled and only for restaurants on the OpenTable Pro plan, and is a feature in Beta.

If you want more privacy, you can turn off the "Point of sale information" setting:

This stops your order history from contributing to future insights.

Your dining habits may move with you when you dine at restaurants that use OpenTable Pro.

This awareness helps you understand what your apps track. It also gives you the chance to adjust your privacy settings so you stay in control of your information.

BE ON HIGH ALERT IF YOU USE THIS POPULAR RESERVATION APP

Dining out should feel simple, yet today's tech adds a new layer to the experience. These AI-assisted tags give restaurants extra insight, but they also remind you how much of your behavior gets logged behind the scenes. By checking your privacy settings and turning off POS data sharing, you keep more control over what follows you from one meal to the next. Staying aware makes a big difference. It helps you enjoy your night out without wondering who's tracking your habits or how your data might appear on a screen. With a few quick choices, you can shape what restaurants see and keep your preferences truly personal.

Would you change how you dine out if you knew your ordering habits might follow you to restaurants you have never visited? Let us know by writing to us at Cyberguy.com.

Chefs John McLemore and John McLemore II join 'Fox & Friends Weekend' to show how to deep-fry, smoke, or spatchcock grill a Thanksgiving turkey, plus brining tips and sides from their 'Gather & Grill' cookbook.

Thanksgiving is a time of indulgence — so if you're looking to feel fuller with less food, what are your options for packing your meal with protein?

Thanksgiving food doesn't need to throw off your weight-loss progress — or taste any less delicious — according to Stephen Campolo, a fitness trainer and weight-loss expert based in Naples, Florida. 

"The single best move you can make is simple: Start with protein and get full on turkey and ham first," Campolo told Fox News Digital. 

THANKSGIVING COSTS BY THE NUMBERS REVEAL WHAT'S CHEAPER, WHAT'S STILL PRICEY

"Skip the bread basket and load your plate with at least 6 to 8 ounces of lean turkey, plus a solid portion of ham," he added. 

People should eat their protein "slowly and completely before even glancing at the sides," he also recommended.

"High-quality protein triggers satiety faster than any carb on the table," Campolo said. 

PUMPKIN OR APPLE? AMERICA'S FIERCEST THANKSGIVING DESSERT DEBATE HEATS UP

"Once your stomach registers 'enough,' those mashed potatoes, stuffing and rolls lose their power. You'll naturally take smaller portions — or skip them altogether — and still feel completely satisfied."

But if you're abstaining from meat, a filling Thanksgiving meal doesn't need to be all ham and turkey.

Plant-based proteins, such as lentils, can also enhance Thanksgiving meals, said Becky Geisel, owner of Bex Kitchen & Catering in New Jersey.

"At Bex, we love incorporating lentils into sides like our popular lentil and cauliflower salad or lentil and butternut squash salad," Geisel told Fox News Digital. 

"Chickpeas, quinoa and nuts such as almonds, pecans and peanuts also pack in protein and add satisfying texture. Seeds, especially pumpkin and chia, are easy to sprinkle into salads or roasted vegetable dishes for an extra boost of protein."

"Another tasty and easy way to up your protein game is by using your turkey's bone broth as the base for your gravy," said one expert. (iStock)

The chef also emphasized greens such as broccoli, spinach and Brussels sprouts.

"As a chef who focuses on whole foods and nutrition, I always remind people that Thanksgiving can be both indulgent and balanced," Geisel said.

"It's all about creating dishes that nourish your body while celebrating flavor and tradition."

Danielle Vauthy, a Washington-based professional chef at Hungryroot, also recommended combining protein with greens.

Lentils, chickpeas and nuts can make plant-based meals more filling, a chef told Fox News Digital. (iStock)

"I love adding more protein to Thanksgiving with a simple yet refreshing protein-packed salad," Vauthy said. 

"It's easily made using cooked or canned chickpeas, shaved Brussels sprouts and fennel tossed in a light vinaigrette," she told Fox News Digital. "It's crisp, colorful and a great balance to heavier dishes."

She also suggested starting the meal with protein.

"Serve hummus with fresh veggies, add a cheese plate to your spread, and top salads with toasted pepitas or slivered almonds for a quick crunch and a nice protein lift," Vauthy recommended.

            Publicly, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth has been highly critical of the six Democratic lawmakers who released a video last week urging military service members to disobey illegal orders, calling the lawmakers the “Seditious Six” and categorizing their message as “despicable, reckless, and false.”
    


            That criticism has particularly focused on Sen. Mark Kelly, the member of the group who had the longest tenure in the military and who achieved the highest rank of captain in the Navy.
    


            Hegseth has attacked Kelly by name, unlike the other lawmakers. He mocked Kelly for a picture of him in uniform — “you can't even display your uniform correctly” — and wrote that Kelly's “conduct brings discredit upon the armed forces and will be addressed appropriately.”
    


            Behind closed doors, Hegseth is weighing his options to punish Kelly for participating in the video, ones that range from reducing the retired US Navy captain's rank and pension to prosecuting him under military law, according to a source familiar with the matter.
    


            In Kelly, Hegseth sees a critic worth making an example of, and he could technically use the military justice system to do so, the source said. Unlike the other five Democrats who appeared in the video, Kelly is a military retiree — meaning he served long enough to receive a pension, and thus, is still beholden to the Uniform Code of Military Justice, or UCMJ, including its restrictions on free speech, legal experts told CNN.
    


            Kelly could be recalled to active service and court-martialed because of that status, but doing so over his role in the video would be extraordinary, legal experts said. That's because not only has the UCMJ mainly been used in recent years to prosecute former service members who commit crimes overseas outside of US civil jurisdiction, but also because Kelly is a US senator.
    


            Prosecuting him would raise unprecedented separation-of-powers issues, with the executive branch going after someone in the legislative branch, said Rachel E. VanLandingham, a national security law expert and former active-duty judge advocate in the US Air Force.
    


            It would also be an uphill battle for the administration, VanLandingham and other legal experts said, in large part because Hegseth's public statements deriding Kelly's video appear to be a clear-cut case of “unlawful command influence,” in which a superior commander implies or dictates a predetermined outcome for a military trial and thus makes a fair hearing impossible.
    


            Because everyone at the Defense Department works for Hegseth, VanLandingham noted, it's hard to see who could fairly convene a court to hear his case.
    


            “Hegseth has completely tainted this process,” she said.
    


            A coalition of former and retired military judge advocates has also issued a rare joint statement warning that the Pentagon's effort to recall Kelly for UCMJ prosecution is partisan in nature, legally baseless and compromised by unlawful command influence.
    


            “We are confident the unlawful influence reflected in the press reports will ultimately disqualify all convening authorities except possibly the president himself from actually referring a case for court martial,” the statement said.
    


            In his various public messages, Hegseth has suggested Kelly's comments violated several statutes of the UCMJ, which lays out legal requirements for those in the military, but they don't seem to cohere to a single theory of the case, legal experts said.
    


            In the video that triggered the Trump administration's calls for consequences, lawmakers said that “threats to our Constitution” are coming “from right here at home,” and repeatedly urged the military and intelligence community to “refuse illegal orders.”
    


            Although the video didn't reference what orders service members might be receiving that would potentially be illegal, lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have raised concerns repeatedly about the legality of US military strikes against suspected drug boats in the Caribbean and the US military's deployment to cities over the protest of governors.
    


            The administration has argued that by emphasizing service members' duty to disobey unlawful orders, Kelly and the other lawmakers were inciting troops to disobey lawful orders. President Donald Trump has called the video “seditious behavior at the highest level.”
    


            Kelly's involvement in the video is under “review” by the Pentagon, rather than subject to a formal investigation, meaning military police are not involved, the source familiar with Hegseth's thinking said.
    


            At this stage, it remains unclear whether Kelly will ultimately face a recall and court-martial or a lesser administrative penalty. It's also not clear what, exactly, Kelly might be charged with if he were to be charged.
    


            “There are many options,” the source told CNN.
    


            In the short term, Hegseth is deferring to his Navy secretary, who oversees the military branch Kelly served in, for advice — giving him a deadline of December 10 to provide his recommendations.
    


            “I am referring this, and any other related matters, for your review, consideration and disposition as you see fit,” Hegseth wrote in a memo to the Navy secretary, dated November 25.
    


            Hegseth has hinted at one option he is considering in response — to administratively reduce Kelly's rank — referring to him in a social media post as a “retired Navy Commander,” which is below the senator's rank of captain.
    


            Because Kelly was a senior officer who retired from the Navy, he is required to remain available for recall to the military by law. The other five lawmakers in the video, Sen. Elissa Slotkin and Reps. Jason Crow, Maggie Goodlander, Chris Deluzio and Chrissy Houlahan, are not eligible for recall to a military service.
    


            That gives Hegseth options for action against Kelly that he doesn't have for the others, though the FBI is also seeking interviews with the lawmakers.
    


            While retired service members have been called back to face military law before, it has generally been for violent crimes. It's unclear what crime Kelly could be charged with.
    


            In its response, the administration has pointed to a number of legal provisions. A Pentagon statement referenced a World War II-era federal law prohibiting actions intending to interfere with the discipline or loyalty of the military, which the military could theoretically charge through a backdoor provision that allows it to charge federal crimes not explicitly laid out by the UCMJ.
    


            But that law has not been used in the modern era and is widely viewed as a dead letter after a series of postwar Supreme Court decisions reinforcing free-speech protections, VanLandingham said.
    


            Other legal terms of art referenced by Hegseth in response to Kelly and the other lawmakers seem to match with provisions in the UCMJ criminalizing behavior against good order and discipline or which bring “discredit” upon the armed services.
    


            If Kelly is recalled for prosecution under the UCMJ, his case will be handled by officers in the Judge Advocate General corps.
    


            Hegseth has significantly changed the role and responsibilities of those military lawyers and fired some who ran afoul of the policies he is trying to implement, moves sources previously told CNN were viewed inside the Pentagon as the first warning shots by an administration intent on pushing the boundaries of the law.
    


            But using the Uniform Code of Military Justice to punish a sitting senator and retired Navy captain for something that, for private citizens, is protected as free speech, would mark a significant escalation by Hegseth.
    


            GOP Sens. Lisa Murkowski and John Curtis defended their Democratic colleague after the Pentagon's announcement.
    


            Murkowski noted in a post on X that Kelly had served the country “valiantly,” and “to accuse him and other lawmakers of treason and sedition for rightfully pointing out that servicemembers can refuse illegal orders is reckless and flat-out wrong.”
    


            “The Department of Defense and FBI surely have more important priorities than this frivolous investigation,” she added.
    


            Curtis, a first-term senator from Utah, didn't directly reference the investigations into Kelly, but said on Tuesday evening he has “respect” for the Arizona Democrat and values his “friendship.”
    


            “I know him as someone whose career has been defined by service. His record as a combat naval aviator and NASA astronaut reflects his example of the discipline and dedication that are important for success,” Curtis wrote on X.
    


            Court-martialing Kelly is technically a viable option for Hegseth because three appellate courts have upheld that it's constitutional to court-martial retired service members, though there have been long-standing arguments from some legal scholars that this should not be the case.
    


            Among other things, the UCMJ places stiff limitations on free speech that some legal analysts believe are unconstitutional for people who are in every other way living as civilians. It could in theory allow the government to court-martial a Korean War veteran for saying something critical about the sitting president, for example.
    


            There are other problems, beyond the potential issue of Unlawful Command Influence, said Steve Vladeck, a professor of law at the Georgetown University Law Center and a CNN legal analyst.
    


            “Prosecuting [Kelly] for saying something that is literally true is going to raise the mother of all First Amendment objections,” he said. Separately, Kelly enjoys additional protections on his speech as a member of the Senate under what's known as the “speech and debate clause” of the Constitution. That defense is a bit less clear-cut, Vladeck noted — Kelly didn't make his remarks on the Senate floor — and the lower courts have offered different interpretations of the limits of those protections.
    


            “UCI is the cleanest shot here,” Vladeck said. “The First Amendment is the second cleanest. Speech and debate is the most obvious but the trickiest.”
    


            For his part, Kelly has been defiant in response to Hegseth's threats, posting that he will not be intimidated or “silenced by bullies who care more about their own power than protecting the Constitution.”

            International tourists visiting popular national parks in the US next year will be required to pay additional fees and raised rates on annual passes, the US Department of the Interior announced Tuesday.
    


            In a statement hailing a new “resident-focused fee structure that puts American families first,” the department said as of January 1, 2026, the annual pass will cost non-US residents $250 to obtain, more than triple the standard $80 which US residents will continue to pay.
    


            Foreign tourists who don't purchase the pass will pay a $100-per-person fee, in addition to the standard entrance fee, to enter 11 of the most visited national parks, including the Grand Canyon, Rocky Mountain, Yellowstone and Yosemite, the statement said. The department co-manages the America the Beautiful Pass series and controls more than 70 percent of all federal public lands.
    


            “These policies ensure that US taxpayers, who already support the National Park System, continue to enjoy affordable access, while international visitors contribute their fair share to maintaining and improving our parks for future generations,” Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said in the statement.
    


The 15 least visited US national parks



            The rationale offered behind the new prices was summarized in a White House social media post stating: “AMERICANS OFFERED AFFORDABLE PRICES WHILE FOREIGNERS PAY MUCH MORE.”
    


            This announced price hike comes amid a decline in international tourism to the US, fueled by changes to tariff policies and crackdowns on immigration. Yellowstone has reported a decrease in international visitation, down from approximately 30% in 2018 to 14.8% in 2024.
    


            The price increase also comes on the heels of the longest government shutdown in US history, which saw an already-depleted National Park Service struggle to upkeep some of nation's parks due to limited staffing and fewer resources.
    


            According to a recent estimate by the National Parks Conservation Association, parks lost roughly $41 million in uncollected entrance and recreation fees during the government shutdown.
    


            The Interior Department's statement also highlighted “resident-only patriotic fee-free days” for next year which includes Memorial Day, Fourth of July Independence Day weekend and June 14, “Flag Day/President Trump's birthday.” The launch of an upgraded booking system and better access for motorcyclists across the parks was also announced, described as “the most significant modernization of national park access in decades.”
    


            Other countries, including Egypt, Thailand and Cambodia, also charge higher entry fees for international tourists to visit national parks and attractions.

Sen. Mark Kelly (D-AZ) is continuing to speak out about his controversial remarks that drew the ire of President Donald Trump. 

The senator appeared on Tuesday's episode of Jimmy Kimmel Live! to discuss the fallout of a video Kelly made last week with five other members of Congress, encouraging military members and intelligence community personnel to reject “illegal orders.” Kelly, along with Sen. Elissa Slotkin (D-MI), Rep. Jason Crow (D-CO), Rep. Maggie Goodlander (D-NH), Rep. Chris Deluzio (D-PA), and Chrissy Houlahan (D-PA), all emphasized that troops and intelligence community members “must refuse illegal orders.” 

“No one has to carry out orders that violate the law,” Slotkin said in the video. “Don't give up the ship,” the Democrats all said as the video concluded. Trump responded to the video by accusing the Democrats of sedition and treason.  

“The threats to our Constitution aren't just coming from abroad, but from right here at home,” the six congressional representatives said in the video. “Our laws are clear. You can refuse illegal orders. No one has to carry out orders that violate the law or our Constitution.”

Kelly expressed shock and dismay that Trump would have a problem with their statement.

“Well, it's kind of shocking that the president, you know, we said something, which is basically ‘follow the law,' and the president of the United States says ‘kill them,'” Kelly told Kimmel. “Hang them, execute them, try them for sedition. I served 25 years in the United States Navy, you know. 

“I've almost gotten killed for this country, multiple times, almost shot down over Iraq and Kuwait, had a missile blow up next to my airplane,” Kelly said. “I got on a rocket ship four times, millions of pounds of rocket fuel, for this nation. And then, I wake up one day, and I got the president of the United States threatening me with my life, that I'm going to be hanged?” 

“The president, when he says these things, there are consequences,” Kelly told Kimmel. “And by the way, isn't this the guy two months ago that said ‘we've got to stop this political violence issue? He didn't even make it to Thanksgiving.”

“You can't keep track of this guy and what he says,” Kelly said, without addressing Trump by name or title. “I'll tell you this, though: I'm not backing down. We've said something very simple — members of the military need to follow the law. We wanted to say we have their backs.”

“His response: kill them,” Kelly said.

The conversation then turned to Secretary of War Pete Hegseth, who, on Tuesday, announced that he would open an investigation into Kelly's conduct. Kimmel mentioned it during the interview with Kelly. The senator would go on to blast Hegseth, saying he is unqualified for the job. 

“And then you have Pete Hegseth, who runs the Department of War, is going to open an investigation into you, I assume, into your colleagues,” Kimmel said. “You will have to be interviewed by the FBI, and they're trying to find what, exactly? I mean, what even is sedition?”

“Well, this is the investigation because of what Donald Trump said, from what I can tell,” Kelly said.

“And I don't know Pete Hegseth well. I sat on the committee that ultimately had to confirm him, so I know a little bit about his background. He's totally unqualified,” Kelly added, without answering the question Kimmel asked him. 

Kelly continued to bash Hegseth instead of answering Kimmel's question about the announced FBI investigation or what sedition is. 

“Nothing against journalists, they play a very important role in our society,” Kelly said. “But he's not qualified for this job. And from what I can tell, and talking to some of my Republican colleagues, I mean, he just wants to please the president.”

“And this is what he can do this week, he can go after me, under the Uniform Code of military justice, which is the law in the military,” Kelly added, while still not answering Kimmel's question about sedition. “Which is kind of wild, because we recited something in the Uniform Code of military justice, and he's going to prosecute me, under the Uniform Code of military justice, for reciting the Uniform Code of military justice.”

“It is so ridiculous, it's almost like you can't make this s*** up,” Kelly said.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Democratic lawmakers who appeared in a social media video urging U.S. troops to defy “illegal orders” say the FBI has contacted them to begin scheduling interviews, signaling a possible inquiry into the matter.

It would mark the second investigation tied to the video, coming a day after the Pentagon said it was reviewing Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona over potential violations of military law. The FBI and Pentagon actions come after President Donald Trump accused the lawmakers of sedition and said it is “punishable by DEATH” in a social media post.

Together, the inquiries mark an extraordinary escalation for federal law enforcement and military institutions that traditionally steer clear of partisan clashes. They also underscore the administration's willingness to push legal limits against its critics, even when they are sitting members of Congress. Lawmakers in the video urge troops to reject any illegal orders from their superiors, something they are already duty-bound to do.

“President Trump is using the FBI as a tool to intimidate and harass Members of Congress,” a group of four Democratic House members said in a statement Tuesday. “Yesterday, the FBI contacted the House and Senate Sergeants at Arms requesting interviews.”

Michigan Sen. Elissa Slotkin, one of the six Democratic lawmakers in the video, told reporters Tuesday that “last night the counterterrorism division at the FBI sent a note to the members of Congress, saying they are opening what appears to be an inquiry against the six of us.” Slotkin called it a “scare tactic by” Trump.

“Whether you agree with the video or don't agree with the video, the question to me is: is this the appropriate response for a president of the United States to go after and seek to weaponize the federal government against those he disagrees with?” said Slotkin.

The group of four Democratic House members said in their statement that “no amount of intimidation or harassment will ever stop us from doing our jobs and honoring our Constitution.”

All six of the Democratic lawmakers in the video have served in the military or intelligence community. 

Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska criticized both inquiries on social media, saying that accusing the lawmakers “of treason and sedition for rightfully pointing out that servicemembers can refuse illegal orders is reckless and flat-out wrong.”

“The Department of Defense and FBI surely have more important priorities than this frivolous investigation,” wrote Murkowski.

The FBI went through the top security officials for the House and Senate to request interviews with each of the six lawmakers. The lawmakers said they had no further information and the FBI has not made clear on what basis they were seeking the interviews.

The FBI declined to comment Tuesday, but Director Kash Patel, in an interview with journalist Catherine Herridge, described it as an “ongoing matter” in explaining why he could not discuss details.

Asked for his reaction to the video, Patel said, “What goes through my head is the same thing that goes through my head in any case: is there a lawful predicate to open up an inquiry and investigation, or is there not? And that decision will be made by the career agents and analysts here at the FBI.”

In the video, lawmakers said they needed troops to “stand up for our laws … our Constitution.” Kelly, who was a fighter pilot before becoming an astronaut and then retiring at the rank of captain, told troops that “you can refuse illegal orders.”

After the Pentagon announced the investigation into Kelly on Monday, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth referred it to the Navy on Tuesday and requested a briefing by Dec. 10.

The lawmakers didn't mention specific circumstances in the video. But at an event Tuesday in Michigan, Slotkin pointed to the Trump administration ordering the military to blow up small boats in the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific Ocean accused of ferrying drugs and continued attempts at deploying National Guard troops into U.S. cities despite some legal setbacks. 

“It wasn't that there was any one incident, it was the sheer number of people coming to us and saying, ‘I'm worried. I am being sent to Washington or I'm being sent to LA or Chicago, North Carolina now, and I'm concerned I'm going to be asked to do something that I don't know if I should do,'” said Slotkin. “So that's where it came from.”

Troops, especially uniformed commanders, do have specific obligations to reject orders that are unlawful, if they make that determination.

Broad legal precedence also holds that just following orders — colloquially known as the “Nuremberg defense,” as it was used unsuccessfully by senior Nazi officials to justify their actions under Adolf Hitler — doesn't absolve troops.

WASHINGTON (AP) — The National Park Service said Tuesday it is going to start charging the millions of international tourists who visit U.S. parks each year an extra $100 to enter some of the most popular sites, while leaving them out of fee-free days that will be reserved for American residents.

The announcement declaring “America-first entry fee policies” comes as national parks deal with the strain of a major staff reduction and severe budget cuts, along with recovering from damage during the recent government shutdown and significant lost revenue due to fees not being collected during that time.

The fee change will impact 11 national parks, including the Grand Canyon, Yellowstone and Yosemite, according to the U.S. Department of the Interior.

As part of the changes, which are set to take effect Jan. 1, foreign tourists will also see their annual parks pass price jump to $250, while U.S. residents will continue to be charged $80, according to the department's statement.

Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said in a post on the social platform X that the changes make sure U.S. taxpayers who support the park service “continue to enjoy affordable access, while international visitors contribute their fair share to maintaining and improving our parks for future generations!”

A White House post on X laying out the increased fees ended with the phrase, “AMERICANS FIRST.”

Stay up to date with the news and the best of AP by following our WhatsApp channel.




The announcement follows a July executive order in which President Donald Trump directed the parks to increase entry fees for foreign tourists.




“There's a lot to unpack in this announcement, including many questions on its implementation – all which NPCA will raise with the Department of Interior,” Kati Schmidt, a spokesperson for National Parks Conservation Association, said in an email.

The U.S. Travel Association estimated that in 2018, national parks and monuments saw more than 14 million international visitors. Yellowstone reported that in 2024, nearly 15% of its visitors were from outside the country, which was down from 30% in 2018.

The money made off the new fees will help support the national parks, including with upgrading facilities for visitors and maintenance, according to the statement.

The “resident-only patriotic fee-free days” next year include Veterans Day, which was one of the parks' eight free days open to everyone in 2025. The Department of the Interior had announced those days by saying they wanted to ensure that “everyone, no matter their zip code, can access and enjoy the benefits of green spaces and our public lands.”

A Florida sailor stationed in Hawaii died after heroically rescuing two children in Waiapua‘a Bay.

Master-at-Arms 1st Class Jeffrey Diaz, 47, of Florida, died Saturday, according to a news release from the Kaua‘i Police Department (KPD).

Diaz, who was stationed at the Pacific Missile Range Facility in Barking Sands, jumped into the water to rescue two children who were struggling in the high surf, according to the release. 

While the children made it back to shore safely, police said Diaz encountered trouble in the water.

Crypto:

Bitcoin climbed above $90,000 for the first time in almost a week, clawing back ground after a more than a month-long selloff, as a broad rally in risk assets and easing volatility gave traders room to push higher.

The advance, though modest, put higher levels back in focus, with digital assets moving in step with equities amid growing conviction that the Federal Reserve may soon resume cutting interest rates. BlackRock's US Bitcoin ETF attracted fresh inflows, snapping a streak of redemptions. Liquidity remains thin ahead of the Thanksgiving break, but with volatility ebbing — and little evidence of fresh forced selling — bulls appear to be testing whether the worst of the drawdown has passed.

Drug pricing has emerged as a key topic to watch for pharmaceutical companies and investors in 2025. As President Donald Trump pushes for lower medicine prices for Americans, the sector is facing additional pricing pressure from a Biden-era law called the Inflation Reduction Act.

The IRA, voted into law in 2022, allows the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) to negotiate prices for a number of drugs each year for patients in Medicare, the federal health insurance program for seniors. It's now making waves also across the Atlantic. 

While these changes are taking place firmly in the U.S., pharmaceutical companies across the globe are finding themselves increasingly exposed to the American market. 

A number of European companies have announced sizeable U.S. investments to placate Trump and his aggressive tariff agenda, while AstraZeneca is moving toward another direct listing on the NYSE to tap into the deeper pockets of U.S. capital markets. Meanwhile, Novo Nordisk has cited a failure to deal with changes in the U.S. market as part of the reason for recent leadership changes.

Late Tuesday, the CMS announced newly negotiated prices for 15 blockbuster drugs from 2027, including Novo Nordisk's mega bestseller Ozempic which will see a 71% discount to its list price.

Among other European pharma giants, AstraZeneca's cancer drug Calquence will face a 40% discount, while GSK's lung disease medicines Trelegy and Breo with 73% and 83% discount, respectively. 

Overall, discounts ranged between 38% and 85%, with estimated savings of about $8.5 billion, 36% lower than recent annual spending.

"Whether through the Inflation Reduction Act or President Trump's Most Favored Nation policy, this is what serious, fair, and disciplined negotiation looks like," said CMS Deputy Administrator Chris Klomp in a statement. 

A GSK spokesperson said they were pleased with the agreement. "We strongly believe in the value of both Trelegy and Breo and remain committed to working with CMS."

Novo, on the other hand, was critical. "We continue to have serious concerns about the Inflation Reduction Act's impact on patients and remain opposed to government price setting," a spokesperson told CNBC in emailed comments. "We have seen that government price setting has not translated to lower out-of-pocket costs for patients and can lead to a loss of coverage for medications and higher insurance premiums," they added.

The U.S. is a key market for most large-cap pharma companies, mostly due to the significantly higher prices for branded medicines. In the first nine months of 2025, 56% of Novo's total sales originated in the U.S. Meanwhile, AstraZeneca logged 42% of product sales in the U.S. and GSK some 52%, over the same period.

Prescription drug prices are about three times higher in the U.S. compared to other wealthy countries, a 2024 report by RAND found.

"The [IRA price] cuts were a little higher than last year, which I think people were expecting," Barclays analyst Emily Field told CNBC. "It doesn't seem like there was any surprises at all," she added. 

Muted shares also indicated that the outcome of the negotiations was largely expected. AstraZeneca and GSK rose less than 1% each in afternoon trading. 

Novo shares however, ended the day 4.7% higher. Semaglutide, sold as Ozempic for diabetes and Wegovy for weight loss, will from 2027 be priced at $274 for Medicare patients, down from a previous list price of $959. That said, Medicare plans already get large discounts on companies' list prices, but those rates aren't typically disclosed. 

CMS is due to publish its list of 15 drugs selected for negotiations for 2028 by February 1, 2026.

The IRA price negotiations are, however, not the main concern for companies, Field said, noting how it's becoming a better-understood and predictable process. "What people are much more worried about is further directions that MFN could go… if they decide to do something different," she said. 

Trump has made it a priority to rein in U.S. drug costs and in May, signed an executive order to implement so-called Most Favored Nation pricing, meaning U.S. prices would be tied to lower ones paid abroad. 

Lower prices in the U.S. could have a dramatic effect on companies' top and bottom lines, but companies are finding ways to mitigate the impact by making deals with the Trump administration to voluntarily lower certain prices, as well as pledge investments in U.S. manufacturing to avoid tariffs. 

Earlier this month, Trump announced deals with Novo and rival Eli Lilly to slash prices of weight loss drugs for Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries in 2026, as well as offering them directly to consumers at a discount through the TrumpRx.gov website. Under the agreement, starting doses of Novo's Wegovy and Lilly's Zepbound will be $350 per month and trend down to $245 per month over a two years.

While reduced pricing will hit sales, volume gains from opening up broad access for obesity drugs could offset that headwind, BMO analysts noted. 

Last week, Novo also announced it is lowering prices of Ozempic and Wegovy to $349 per month from $499 for patients paying out-of-pocket, following pressure from Trump. 

Other companies including AstraZeneca and U.S.-based Pfizer have also announced deals with the Trump administration to cut drug prices.

A judge in Georgia on Wednesday dismissed the historic racketeering case brought against President Donald Trump over his efforts to overturn his loss in the state's 2020 election.

The ruling by Fulton County Superior Court Judge Scott McAfee, who ordered the case "dismissed in its entirety," draws to a close the final criminal case against Trump that remained unresolved after he won back the White House in 2024.

McAfee's ruling came shortly after state prosecutor Peter Skandalakis moved to drop the case against Trump and his remaining co-defendants "to serve the interests of justice and promote judicial finality."

"In my professional judgment, the citizens of Georgia are not served by pursuing this case in full for another five to ten years," Skandalakis wrote in a court filing.

Steve Sadow, Trump's lead attorney in the case, said in a statement to CNBC, "The political persecution of President Trump by disqualified [Fulton County District Attorney] Fani Willis is finally over."

"This case should never have been brought. A fair and impartial prosecutor has put an end to this lawfare," Sadow said.

The case brought by Willis initially charged Trump with 13 criminal counts, including the serious charge of violating Georgia's powerful anti-racketeering law.

The indictment, returned by a grand jury in August 2023, alleged that Trump and numerous co-defendants — including his former lawyers Rudy Giuliani and John Eastman, and former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows — illegally tried to reverse Joe Biden's victory in the state's 2020 presidential contest.

Those efforts included pressuring Georgia's secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger, to find Trump enough votes for him to overcome his margin of loss to Biden.

The case was once seen as one of the biggest threats to the GOP leader, who was already grappling with a torrent of other criminal indictments and civil lawsuits. At least four of Trump's 18 co-defendants pleaded guilty within two months of the indictment being filed.

It also produced one of the most striking images in recent U.S. political history: a mugshot of the president, who was forced to travel to Fulton County jail to be booked on the state charges.

But the case ran into major problems long before Trump's reelection in 2024 effectively put it on ice.

In September 2024, McAfee tossed out two of the criminal counts against Trump and some of his co-defendants, though he kept the top charges intact.

By that time, the embattled DA Willis was already facing intensifying scrutiny over her romantic relationship with Nathan Wade, one of the top prosecutors in the criminal case. She defended herself in dramatic courtroom testimony against the allegations of impropriety, but was ultimately disqualified from the case in December 2024.

The Georgia Supreme Court declined to hear Willis' appeal. The case was eventually handed to Skandalakis on Nov. 14, less than two weeks before he asked McAfee to dismiss it.

"This entire case, from the initiation of the District Attorney's investigation in 2021 to the present, is without precedent," Skandalakis wrote in the 23-page request for McAfee to drop the case.

"Never before, and hopefully never again, will our country face circumstances such as these," he wrote in the motion for what is known as a "nolle prosequi."

He noted that the prospect of bringing the case against Trump to trial would take years, as there is "no realistic prospect that a sitting President will be compelled to appear" in court and it would be "impossible" to quickly proceed after he leaves office in 2029.

Skandalakis also foreclosed on the possibility of severing Trump from the remaining defendants and conducting separate trials, writing that it would be "both illogical and unduly burdensome and costly for the State and for Fulton County."

"Some may argue that cases against the campaign attorneys and advisors should proceed even if President Trump is removed from the indictment," Skandalakis wrote. "However, I am extremely reluctant to criminalize the act of attorneys providing flawed legal advice to the President of the United States under these circumstances."

The Prosecuting Attorneys' Council of Georgia also lacks the resources to conduct multiple trials, according to Skandalakis. "Continuing this litigation under these circumstances would neither serve the citizens of Georgia nor fulfill our statutory obligations."

Despite asking for the case to be closed, Skandalakis suggested that the efforts by Trump and his allies to to overturn the 2020 election, in Georgia and elsewhere, were serious.

"As I have previously stated, contesting an election is not unlawful," he wrote. "However, the strategy conceived in Washington, D.C. to contest the 2020 Presidential Election quickly shifted from a legitimate legal effort into a campaign that ultimately culminated in an attack on the Capitol, undertaken to prevent the Vice President from carrying out his ministerial duty of counting the electoral votes."

Skandalakis said he believed the case would be "best pursued at the federal level." 

But he acknowledged that former special counsel Jack Smith, who had pursued federal election interference charges against Trump, was forced to drop his case after the Supreme Court strengthened immunity powers for former presidents, and after Trump won reelection.

This was CNBC's live blog covering the 2025 Autumn Budget.

Startup leaders are responding positively to tax breaks for employees and investors unveiled by Finance Minister Rachel Reeves in the budget. 

"This Budget shows that the government has seriously listened to founders and tried to make things better to build and scale a startup in the UK," Dom Hallas, executive director of lobby group Startup Coalition, told CNBC.

"Big progress on expanding share options, doubling the scale of the enterprise investment and venture capital trust schemes to back scaleups, and looking again at how entrepreneurs are incentivised in our tax system will make a material difference to founders building today and in the future."

Measures announced by Reeves include doubling the annual limits of venture capital schemes — which allow tax breaks for investors in early-stage startups. From April 2026, investors will be able to invest up to £20 million a year in companies under the schemes, up to a £40 million lifetime limit.

Reforms to the enterprise management incentive (EMI) scheme were also lauded, with the size of scaleups being able to offer those tax share incentives for employees rising from 250 to 500 employees. Asset thresholds will increase from £30 million to £120 million.

"Through EMI reform, today's budget has delivered meaningful change for Britain's startups," said Hannah Seal, partner at Index Ventures. 

"It will now be easier for companies to attract, retain and reward the talent they need to scale and compete globally — especially critical in an AI-first world where talent costs and capital requirements are higher than ever."

— Kai Nicol-Schwarz

The U.K. Economic Secretary to the Treasury Lucy Rigby has conceded that productivity remains one of the most significant problems facing the country.

In a briefing immediately following Rachel Reeves' Autumn Budget, Rigby said the chancellor is aiming to deal with the root causes of the U.K.'s productivity challenge, which data showed would reduce revenues by some £16 billion.

This includes "historic" levels of underinvestment, Rigby said, adding that the government is focused on creating conditions for future growth, highlighting the approval of key infrastructure projects in nuclear and AI.

"The Chancellor is doubling down on every effort to try and shift productivity in the right direction," Rigby said.

Separately, Rigby also expects today's measures around savings and listings would help the U.K. "break out" of its aversion to retail investment. She acknowledged this remains the lowest level out of all G7 nations, adding that changes to listings and prospectuses would help "turbo charge" the London stock market.

—Hugh Leask

As investors continue to digest the details of the Autumn Budget, Mark Preskett, senior portfolio manager at Morningstar Wealth, is taking a positive view on the outlook for British assets.  

"Today's U.K. Budget has not derailed Morningstar Wealth's broadly positive outlook for the U.K. equity and bond markets," he said in an email. "Significant focus has been on the U.K. economy's fiscal headroom and the improvement here, based on today's OBR forecasts, is encouraging."

He added that moderating U.K. inflation means gilt yields are likely to continue their downward trajectory "once the dust settles from the budget."

"However, the U.K. dividend tax hike — which impacts our home market more than others given its higher payouts — is a clear disincentive for stocks and there was no mention of specific U.K. equity incentives within ISAs," Preskett said. 

— Chloe Taylor

In the wake of the budget, Invesco said U.K. government bonds, or gilts, are its "favored sovereign market now."

"High government debt and political flip-flopping has weighed on U.K. gilts this year," Benjamin Jones, global head of research at the investment firm, said in an email. "[But] we believe this budget has provided enough to ease those fears a little."

Gilt yields were volatile before and during Reeves' budget announcement, with the yield on the benchmark 10-year gilt last seen trading almost 6 basis points lower while yields on 30-year gilts fell by 10 basis points. 

"With yields in the U.K. higher than many other developed markets and the Bank of England now having more reasons to cut, we think that gilt yields across the curve will fall," Jones said. "Our fixed income team view the U.K. as one of the best places to take duration risk today."

CNBC inboxes are choc-a-block with reaction to the Autumn Budget and the Office for Budget Responsibility's assessment of public finances and the U.K's economic outlook. Here's a snapshot:

Reeves delivers 'historic' tax raising measures: Sanjay Raja, chief U.K. economist at Deutsche Bank, said the budget delivered "historic" tax raising measures — and noted that Reeves was left with "larger headroom than anyone expected going into this forecast."

"Put simply, the OBR projections were far better than we expected, with the impact of the productivity downgrade on the borrowing outlook far less than we and others anticipated," he said.

'Perilous' outlook:"Despite the positive spin from the Chancellor today, the fiscal outlook remains perilous," Elliott Jordan-Doak, senior U.K. economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said. 

"Some of the fiscal savings will fail to materialise, the government seems to lack the political power to push through measures necessary to stabilise the fiscal ship in the near-term, and we think defence spending will place further pressure on the sums."

'Significant fiscal tightening' from the chancellor"This represents a significant fiscal tightening that the U.K. economy will feel for the next five years," Maxime Darmet, senior U.K. economist at Allianz Trade, said."Smaller taxes are harder to forecast and may underdeliver, potentially forcing the government to look for additional revenue later. On top of that, many of these new measures won't take effect immediately, further weakening confidence in their impact."

"As a result, financial markets are likely to stay uneasy, at least until the government sets out a more convincing and reliable tax plan."

OBR error a 'fitting end' to weeks of leaked budget detail:"The entire contents of the Budget being accidentally published by the OBR was perhaps a fitting end to the most leaked fiscal event in living memory," Tom Selby, director of public policy at AJ Bell, said Wednesday.

Kemi Badenoch, the leader of the opposition Conservative Party, has slammed Chancellor Rachel Reeves' Autumn Budget, calling it a "total humiliation."

In the opposition's customary response to the chancellor of the day's budget statement, Badenoch called the finance minister "utterly incompetent" and called for her to be sacked. 

As for the budget statement, which contained a raft of smaller rather than headline tax rises, Badenoch described it as a "smorgasbord of misery."

"Last year she put up taxes by £40 billion, the biggest tax raid in British history. She promised she wouldn't be back for more, she swore it was a one-off. She told everyone that from now on, there would be stability and she would pay for everything with growth," Badenoch said, addressing lawmakers in the House of Commons.  

"Today she has broken every single one of those promises. If she had any decency she would resign."

Of course, Chancellor Rachel Reeves didn't call her new "High Value Council Tax Surcharge" a "mansion tax" but that's what it's been dubbed by the media and markets.

Essentially, the "surcharge" amounts to £2,500 for properties worth more than £2 million and £7,500 for properties worth more than £5 million. The OBR said the measures would raise £400 million in tax revenues. 

Telling lawmakers that she was taking further steps to "deal with a longstanding source of wealth inequality in our country," Reeves said:

"Currently, a Band D home in Darlington or Blackpool pays just under £2,400 in Council Tax … nearly £300 more than a £10 million mansion in Mayfair," she said, referring to one of London's most prestigious areas. 

"And so from 2028, I am introducing the High Value Council Tax Surcharge in England ... This will be collected alongside Council Tax, levied on owners," she said. 

This new surcharge will raise over £400 million by 2031 and will be charged on fewer than the top 1% of properties, Reeves added.

The FTSE 350 Banks index was last seen trading 1.6% higher, as the budget appeared to avoid new levies on the industry that had been rumored to be under consideration. 

Stocks seeing the biggest gains included Lloyds Group, which jumped 4.1%, Barclays, which added 3.6%, and NatWest, which was up by 2.7%.

U.K. wealth management firms advanced on Wednesday amid a flurry of tax announcements. 

St James's Place moved 4.6% higher, AJ Bell advanced 3.4%, and IG Group gained 8.5%.

Reeves confirmed a £2,000 cap on salary sacrifice pension contributions will be introduced from 2029. 

"Reliefs in our tax system cost the taxpayer billions of pounds every year, but many of them no longer serve their original purpose," she said. 

Reeves said tax breaks on salary sacrifice pension schemes are forecast to cost £8 billion by 2030, "with the greatest benefit going to higher earners … while those on the minimum wage or whose employers don't offer salary sacrifice don't benefit at all."

"This is not sustainable for the public finances," she said. "That is a pragmatic step so that people, especially on low and middle incomes, can continue to use salary sacrifice for their pension without paying any more tax than they do now."

— Chloe Taylor

Tax increases announced in the budget are expected to raise £700 million next year and £26.1 billion in 2029-30, according to the OBR, which it says will "more than" offset an increase in spending. 

Spending policies, including removing the so-called two-child limit for welfare claimants, are expected to increase borrowing by £11 billion in 2029-30, according to the OBR's forecast. 

— Chloe Taylor

The chancellor unveiled plans to widen eligibility for enterprise incentives, including expanding the enterprise management incentive — which offers tax incentives to employees in smaller, high-risk companies — so more companies can offer tax-relieved share options.

The finance minister also said she plans to "re-engineer" enterprise investment and venture capital trust (VCT) schemes — which provide tax relief for investors in early-stage startups. Reeves said she wants those schemes to apply to companies as they grow, too.

There will also be tax breaks for companies that choose to list in the UK. Reeves said new listings will get a three-year exemption from stamp duty reserve tax. 

— Kai Nicol-Schwarz

It's not all tax rises in the budget with the government set to spend more on several welfare measures in the next few years. Reeves is set to announce a bevy of welfare measures, according to the OBR's unexpectedly released forecast, with a combined cost of £9 billion in 2029-30. 

These include the reversals to previously announced cuts to winter fuel payments and health-related benefits, which will cost £7 billion in 2029-30. 

The controversial two-child limit within the Universal Credit benefit, which critics have campaigned against, will be removed. 

It will cost the country £3 billion by 2029-30, per the OBR, but increases benefits for 560,000 families by an average of £5,310.

British home builder stocks fell 2.6% after the OBR unexpectedly released its forecast ahead of the U.K. budget. 

Major UK housing construction companies Persimmon fell almost 4.3%, Taylor Wimpey shed 3.4%, Barratt Redrow dipped 3.9% and The Berkeley Group fell 4%.

"The U.K. Budget offers little relief for homebuilders," Jack Fletcher-Price, equity analyst at Morningstar, told CNBC via email.

"The OBR's downgrade to household disposable income and upward revision to inflation point to a tougher macro backdrop, likely weighing on housing demand and sector shares. The absence of any update on abolishing stamp duty on properties under £500k may also disappoint the market," he said.

"On the proposed mansion tax, if it's scheduled for 2028, we expect the Conservatives and Reform to pledge its abolition at the next general election - making it unlikely to ever come into effect," Fletcher-Price added. 

Finance Minister Rachel Reeves also confirmed the introduction of a council tax charge on properties valued over £2 million ($6.63 million).

The thresholds at which British voters pay income tax will be frozen until the end of the 2030/31 financial year, according to the Office for Budget Responsibility.

The OBR, which erroneously released Autumn Budget details ahead of the chancellor's announcement, said that, as a result: "The income tax personal allowance, the higher-rate threshold and additional-rate threshold are frozen at £12,570, £50,270 and £125,140, respectively, until 2030-31," the OBR said.

Freezing income tax thresholds has been described as a "stealth tax" as it drags more workers into higher tax brackets due to inflation and wage growth. 

The freeze income tax thresholds are expected to raise £7.6 billion in 2029-2030, the OBR said.

U.K. Chancellor Rachel Reeves has started to deliver her Autumn Budget to lawmakers in the Houses of Parliament. The problem is, we already know what's in it after the Office for Budget Responsibility published its assessment of Reeves' latest policies, and its U.K. economic outlook early, in error. 

She's begun her address stating that the OBR's release was "deeply disappointing" and a "serious error" on their part.

The OBR has just released a statement apologising for the error. It said: "A link to our Economic and fiscal outlook document went live on our website too early this morning. It has been removed. We apologise for this technical error and have initiated an investigation into how this happened."

It said it would be reporting to its Oversight Board, the Treasury, and the Commons Treasury Committee on how this happened and, "will make sure this does not happen again."

The OBR said its economic and fiscal outlook and supporting documents would be released (or re-released) when the chancellor has finished her speech.

— Holly Ellyatt

The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) has given markets a surprise by publishing its forecasts for the public finances and the economy before Chancellor Rachel Reeves has unveiled her Autumn Budget, which will take place at 12.30 p.m.

The OBR report, which appears to have been published early in error, states that the U.K. economy is forecast to grow by 1.5% on average over the forecast [period], 0.3 percentage points slower than we projected in March, due to lower underlying productivity growth."

The independent fiscal watchdog was expected to lower growth and productivity growth forecasts. Regarding the latter, the OBR said it had reduced its "central forecast for the underlying rate of productivity growth in the medium term to 1.0 per cent, 0.3 percentage points slower than in our March forecast."

As for the Autumn Budget, the OBR said tax rises set to be outlined by Reeves would raise £26.1 billion by 2029-2030, the end of this parliamentary term, "through freezing personal tax thresholds and a host of smaller measures." The budget measures bring the tax take to an all-time high of 38% of GDP in 2030-31.

The amount of fiscal "headroom" or wiggle-room that Reeves has to meet her own fiscal rules on spending and borrowing will rise to £22 billion by the end of the decade, the OBR said, far higher than the £10 billion or so that Reeves envisaged at her last budget.

CNBC has contacted the fiscal watchdog for further comment on the publication. Opposition leader Kemi Badenoch described the early release of the OBR report as a "complete shambles."

U.K. government borrowing costs fell on Wednesday after the country's Office for Budget Responsibility unexpectedly released its economic and fiscal forecasts ahead of the Autumn Budget. 

Yields on the benchmark 10-year gilt were last seen 4 basis points higher at 4.535%, after falling as much 4 basis points following the release. 

The OBR was scheduled to publish its forecasts following the budget, which Finance Minister Rachel Reeves will deliver in parliament at 12:30 p.m. London time (7:30 a.m. ET).

It's Nov. 26 and Autumn Budget day is finally here!

It's been a longer-than-usual wait this year, with budgets usually delivered in late October. We've also had so much news flow on what tax rises could be included in Chancellor Rachel Reeves' budget statement that it's become hard to keep up. 

This "kite flying" of policy proposals — designed to test public and market reaction to an idea before committing to it — has led to criticism of the Treasury, with analysts saying the near-constant drip feed of information (and the scrapping of policy ideas) has confused the public, businesses and markets.

It has also made it harder to gauge what we're actually going to get when Finance Minister Rachel Reeves finally unveils her spending and taxation plans for the year ahead. 

CNBC has taken a close eye on what we might see later today when Reeves unveils the Autumn Budget around 12.30 p.m. London time.

Speculation has been rife in recent weeks about the policy mix Reeves could deliver today. A tax raid is widely expected, with several potential sources of revenue hitting headlines in the U.K. recently. 

Here's a roundup: 

Income tax thresholds could be frozen, drawing more Brits into higher tax bands as wages rise. Currently, the basic 20% rate of income tax only kicks in on earnings above £12,570 ($16,552). Annual earnings over £50,271 are taxed at 40%, while income above £125,140 a year is taxed at 45%. Anyone earning more than £100,000 has their tax-free allowance reduced at a rate of a £1 deduction from every £2 of income.  

A 'mansion tax' is another policy reportedly being considered by the Treasury, which would come as an annual council tax surcharge applied to homes valued at more than £2 million. London's Evening Standard reported that 600,000 homes in the capital could fall into that threshold. 

Private pension contributions and other salary sacrifice schemes — like Cycle to Work benefits — could also be targeted, with reports suggesting Reeves has been considering ending tax breaks for some of those programs. 

Salary sacrifice currently allows workers to give up some of their earnings in exchange for a non-cash benefit, meaning it isn't received as taxable pay and the employee pays less income tax and National Insurance. Rumors suggest Reeves could put a £2,000 limit on how much can be saved into a salary sacrifice scheme before National Insurance — a form of tax on income — applies. 

Pension provider Fidelity said that under this system, someone earning £110,000 a year and sacrificing £10,000 into their pension would be liable for an additional NI bill of £160 a year, while their employer would have to pay an extra £1,200 a year. 

A Gambling tax has also been floated in the U.K. press as a potential source of income for the government. Winnings from gambling are currently not taxed in Britain, and bets are exempt from VAT. There are already some industry-specific taxes in place, however, including duties of up to 25% on slot machines, a 15% tax on horse or dog races, and a levy of 21% on internet casino bets.  

Pay-per-mile taxes could be applied to electric vehicles, according to The Telegraph. EVs are currently exempt from fuel duty paid by people who drive vehicles fueled by gasoline. 

Tourism tax has already been confirmed as a possibility, with Local Government Minister Steve Reed announcing Tuesday that mayors of English cities will be given the power to roll out duties on overnight stays. 

Sugar tax will also be another source of additional revenue, with the existing duty on soft drinks with added sugar set to be broadened to include milk-based and milk-alternative beverages from 2028.

Markets are anticipating an increase in top-tier council tax, dubbed a 'mansion tax,' but some have issued warnings that it could slow down the U.K.'s housing market and have knock-on effects on trust in the Labour government. 

"Both policies would disproportionally hit London and the South East and we maintain our preference for housebuilders with minimal exposure to these markets, such as Persimmon," Jack Fletcher-Price, equity analyst at Morningstar, covering U.K. homebuilder stocks, said in a statement. 

"The mansion tax has the potential to slow down transactions above the threshold, as logically owners would defer moving in the hope it will be repealed by a later Government," he added.

The changes to council tax bands is probably overdue,  Fletcher-Price said, "but it will further undermine trust in this Government given they promised not to do this in the run up to the election."

U.K. Finance Minister Rachel Reeves is expected to announce a three-year stamp duty holiday for companies listing on the London Stock Exchange on Wednesday, with the widely-trailed move aimed at reversing the sharp slide in the number of companies publicly listing on the London Stock Exchange.

The measures will send a strong signal that the City of London is open for IPO business, according to Inigo Esteve, a partner at law firm White & Case.

"Stamp duty on share transfers is one of the remaining areas in which London differs from competing listing venues," said Esteve, a partner in White & Case's capital markets group.

"By removing this additional tax for investors in newly listed companies, the stamp duty exemption would hopefully help stimulate demand, attract more global capital and support valuations."

Fundraising from London market debuts tumbled to a thirty-year low earlier this year.

Bond yields and prices move in opposite directions, so when investors are reluctant to lend to a government, the price of the bond falls and the yield rises.

The U.K. government currently has the highest borrowing costs of any G7 nation, with its 30-year gilt yield trading well above the critical 5% threshold and spending much of this year at multi-decade highs.

Dramatic rises in gilt yields — essentially the amount of interest the government pays on its debt — can also have a wider impact on the overall economy.

While bond yields reflect borrowing costs for the governments who issue them, they can also affect mortgage rates, investment returns, the wider economy and personal borrowing.

Back in 2022, Prime Minister Liz Truss's swathe of unfunded tax cuts triggered a bond sell-off that had long-lasting effects on the economy and led to her resignation just 44 days into the job.

CNBC's Ian King takes a fascinating look at Autumn Budgets past and present in his latest UK Exchange newsletter here: History lessons for Reeves ahead of UK's much-hyped Budget

Here's a snippet:

Give or take one or two, most Budgets are quickly forgotten by most people apart, maybe, from some politics nerds and the splendid folk at the Institute for Fiscal Studies who are paid to assess these things.

Rachel Reeves, the chancellor of the Exchequer (U.K. finance minister), has done her best to challenge that convention. Her first Budget, delivered on Halloween 2024, is still debated a year on because of the £25 billion ($33 billion) she extracted from businesses via an increase in employers' national insurance contributions (a payroll tax) and the resulting rise in unemployment.

In the main, though, few Budgets remain in the consciousness even weeks later.

Could Rachel Reeves' latest budget be the exception? We'll see. 

— Holly Ellyatt

"Rachel Reeves' reckoning will come from gilt markets," Nigel Green, chief executive of global financial advisory deVere Group, said in a note this morning. 

Yields on U.K. government bonds — known as gilts — are edging higher ahead of the budget, with the yield on the benchmark 10-year gilt last seen 1 basis point higher at 4.509%. 

Green noted that the policy unveiling today would not be the only potential source of volatility in British bond markets, with investors keeping a close eye on the Office for Budget Responsibility's assessment of the economy, which will be released in tandem with the Autumn Budget. 

"Today's Budget speech is only the first act. The real judgement arrives the moment investors see the OBR's updated revenue profile, growth assumptions and borrowing outlook," he said. "The gilt market will decide whether the U.K.'s fiscal path is durable or whether the risk premium needs to rise."

— Chloe Taylor

Investors will be keeping a close eye on the degree to which Chancellor Rachel Reeves will raise the amount of fiscal "headroom," or wiggle-room, she has to meet her self-imposed "fiscal rules" on spending, borrowing and reducing debt by the end of the decade.

The rules were being met by a small margin when the Office for Budget Responsibility assessed them in March, but events since then mean that this headroom is likely to have disappeared, particularly in light of the OBR's likely downgrade to productivity and economic growth, as well as U-turns on welfare spending cuts.

Jack Meaning, chief U.K. economist at Barclays, told CNBC that Reeves is likely to target a bigger fiscal headroom of £15-20 billion if she is to avoid having to again look for more money in the near-future.

"Certainly, when we've looked at it in the past, with something [fiscal headroom] as small as £10 billion that she had last time, that means there's a one in three chance she'd have to come back for more tax increases or more spending cuts next time round. So I think probably £15 billion is the minimum the market is looking for," he told CNBC's Ian King on Wednesday.

Reeves' current fiscal headroom of around £10 billion is viewed as istorically very low, "and that's meant that the market has kept asking questions," Meaning said. 

— Holly Ellyatt

We already know one tactic the government will use to raise more money through taxes: a so-called milkshake tax. 

The government confirmed on Tuesday that from Jan. 2028, some milk-based drinks will no longer be exempt from the U.K.'s sugar tax, a levy that's added onto soft drinks with a high sugar content. 

Currently, the tax is charged at 18 pence (24 cents) per liter on drinks with 5 grams of sugar per 100 ml, and 24 pence per liter on drinks with 8 grams of sugar per 100 ml — but it does not apply to milk-based and milk-alternative beverages. 

When the changes come into effect, the charge will apply to pre-packaged milk-based or milk-alternative drinks like milkshakes, flavored milks, sweetened yogurt drinks and ready-to-drink coffees. The threshold will also be lowered, so that the tax kicks in once a drink contains 4.5 grams of sugar per 100 ml. 

— Chloe Taylor

Markets will be watching the strength of sterling this morning as speculation ahead of the U.K. budget has led to put calls. The price of the currency will act as a real-time gauge on what investors make of the chancellor's plan for Britain's economy when she presents her taxation and spending plans later today. 

Earlier Wednesday morning, the pound was up 0.18% against the dollar. 

"Sterling appears to be in a no-win situation in regards to the budget," according to Alpine Macro's Chief Global Fixed Income and Currency Strategist Harvinder Kalirai. 

"If Chancellor Reeves tightens fiscal policy, it will open the door for more easing by the [Bank of England]. Tight fiscal/easy monetary policy is a classic mix for a weaker currency," he said. "If Reeves treads cautiously, then concerns over U.K. deficits and a rising debt burden should weigh on sterling."

Leveraged investors have GBP shorts tied to the event, according to Daniel Tobon, head of G10 FX strategy at Citi. "Notably, despite worsening news on the budget and weaker U.K. data, GBP has failed to sell-off in recent weeks. This suggests a saturated short GBP position with the bad news likely priced in," he said. 

Citi had been targeting 0.88 for EURGBP into the budget, "and that target has been met but EURGBP has also failed to push higher despite numerous attempts," Tobon told CNBC in emailed comments. "Absent a negative shock in the budget, we see a greater risk of a 'position squeeze' (unwind of short GBP positions) and suspect some investors are already starting to unwind these short GBP trades as gilts fail to sell-off further."

— Tasmin Lockwood

What Sanjay Raja, chief U.K. economist at Deutsche Bank, had to say ahead of the budget:

"It's a very unusual budget, because for the first time in since I can remember, we know how this budget is going to start and we know how this budget is going to end. It starts with that £20 billion fiscal hole ... It ends with the chancellor taking her fiscal headroom back up to £15 to 20 billion, so potentially double what she had. 

Now the question for us, the question for the markets, for the public, for investors, for businesses, is, how does she get through that journey from minus £20 [billion] to positive £15 to 20 billion? 

And it looks like there will be a smorgasbord of tax raising measures coming through as part of [Wednesday's] budget ... while it won't be as exciting as last year's budget, we hope this will be a historic budget. On our count, this will be the third biggest tax raising budget in the post war period."

— Holly Ellyatt

Ahead of the chancellor's critical statement — which could herald tax rises, spending cuts, or a combination of the two — fund managers are lining up high-conviction trades on U.K. housing, the British currency and beaten-down cyclical equities.

"The budget effectively seems to be being driven by keeping the Labour party factions together and ensuring they can get whatever they do announce through parliament," former Conservative U.K. Treasury Minister and Goldman Sachs Chief Economist Jim O'Neill told CNBC on Tuesday. 

Reeves's past attempts to slash the U.K.'s welfare bill were watered down following a rebellion among some of the Labour party's own lawmakers. 

"I don't have high expectations for it being an 'oh wow, this is really getting to grips with things' budget, but it will definitely be done to keep the fiscal rules on balance, at least for now," O'Neill added.

It's been a tough job market for young professionals, but there's some good news for 2026: New grads with up to four years' work experience are expected to see stronger wage growth next year, according to Glassdoor research.

In other words, early-career workers who can secure a job are likely to have more spending power, at a rate surpassing 2020 levels — the last time wage growth kept pace with inflation.

Wage growth will vary depending on the location. While rising cities may not offer the biggest paychecks compared to places like New York or San Francisco, they're seeing the fastest wage growth and offer a lower cost of living, Glassdoor researchers note.

These are the top 10 cities for early-career wage growth since 2020, according to Glassdoor research:

Annual growth since 2020: 7.0%

Average salary in 2025: $61,164

Job groups with fastest wage growth: Research and science; product and project management; human resources

Annual growth since 2020: 5.5%

Average salary in 2025: $60,876

Job groups with fastest wage growth: Health care; skilled labor and manufacturing; business

Annual growth since 2020: 5.4%

Annual growth since 2020: 5.3%

Average salary in 2025: $59,100

Job groups with fastest wage growth: Health care; sales; skilled labor and manufacturing

Annual growth since 2020: 5.2%

Average salary in 2025: $71,808

Annual growth since 2020: 5.1%

Average salary in 2025: $59,975

Job groups with fastest wage growth: Engineering; health care; retail and food services

Health-care jobs are the most in-demand roles with rising pay for young workers, Glassdoor lead researcher Chris Martin told CNBC Make It via email. These positions led wage growth in three of the top 10 cities: Boise, Charleston and Rochester.

Overall, health care along with private education jobs have propped up the labor economy for some time. They make up about 17% of the jobs nationally but accounted for 56% of job growth between July 2023 and July 2025, according to an Indeed analysis of Bureau of Labor Statistics data.

Meanwhile, customer services and support roles led wage growth in Miami and Austin, per Glassdoor.

And in many cities, wages are rising for jobs across the income spectrum, according to Glassdoor data. For example, Tucson's fastest-growing salaries for young workers were for engineering roles that pay an average salary of $86,700 in 2025, followed by health care ($64,100) and then retail and food services jobs ($35,800).

At this point, shopping on Black Friday is every bit a Thanksgiving tradition as turkey dinners and pumpkin pie. 

But certain discounts you see online may not be as good a deal as advertised. In fact, 36% of items on sale for Black Friday offer no savings compared with how they were priced between Oct. 27 and Nov. 17, according to new data from WalletHub. 

"There's some trickery happening," says consumer savings expert Andrea Woroch. "Retailers are constantly fluctuating prices. So they may repackage something and say it's on sale for Black Friday when, in reality, it was the same discount a few weeks ago."

That's not to say that there aren't legitimate savings to be had. For items that are on sale, the average markdown is about 24%, according to WalletHub's data. You'll just have to do a little digging to make sure that you're making the most of the discounts you see. 

"The consumer has to be proactive," says Chip Lupo, a writer and analyst at WalletHub. "Because retailers do more or less rely on people rushing in at the last minute and taking advantage of anything that appears to be a sale." 

Ideally, says Woroch, you'd begin researching items that you're considering buying long before an anticipated sale while keeping an eye on the price. 

But if you come across an enticing discount while shopping Black Friday sales, "it's definitely not too late" to do some research to make sure you're getting a good deal, Woroch says. 

Using online price tracking tools is a good place to start, Woroch says. She recommends CamelCamelCamel, which compares current prices for items listed on Amazon with their historical high, low and average cost. 

"Even if you're trying to figure out a price at another retailer, that's a good benchmark," says Woroch. 

Woroch also likes the Droplist browser extension from Honey, which allows you to make a list of items you're interested in purchasing and will notify you of price drops at more than 800 retailers. 

Some products will be more difficult to track because they're manufactured specifically for Black Friday sales, says Woroch. A bargain price on a TV, for instance, may mean that you're buying a basic version of a more prominent model without some of the bells and whistles you're looking for, she says. 

"Don't assume that the model is the same one you saw all year long that you've been waiting for it to drop in price," Woroch says. "Look at the model number, look when it's been sold, read reviews and make sure it offers everything you need."

Although Black Friday is often touted as the time of the year when the deepest discounts are available, don't fall into the trap of buying something that may go on deeper sale during another time of year, experts say. 

Winter apparel, for instance, tends to go on sale after Christmas, says Woroch. And the biggest sales on furniture typically happen on Presidents Day, she says. 

"You may be able to find good deals on mattresses," says Lupo. "But you're unlikely to see big discounts on traditional furniture like couch sets or coffee tables on Black Friday."

And no matter what you buy, beware of deals that encourage what Woroch calls "spaving" — spending more money than you otherwise would to unlock discounts. That may mean buying a more expensive "bundle" of items to earn a markdown or meeting a certain spending threshold to get free shipping. 

"Maybe it's buy two sweaters, get one free. If you only need one sweater, don't buy the second one, just to get one free," Woroch says. You could come out of Black Friday having spent extra money on things you don't really need, she says. And if you're on a tight budget, "you could find yourself in a lot of trouble because of it."

Black Friday is proving more popular for younger consumers than for their elders, according to a new report provided exclusively to CNBC.

AT&T Business' 2025 Holiday Shopping Survey, conducted by Morning Consult, found that 40% of Generation Z members and 32% of millennials plan to do most of their shopping on Black Friday. Older generations, on the other hand, prefer to shop later in the season, just a week or two before Christmas, the survey found.  

"Black Friday is always such a big deal, and the pricing and the offers and advertising that's done during that time is probably what would draw Gen Z, especially things done on social media," said Angela Rutherford, AT&T's vice president of mid-market sales.

The enthusiasm for Black Friday comes even as Gen Z plans to pull back their spending. 

Consulting firm PwC reported in September that Gen Z shoppers plan to spend 23% less on average this holiday season than a year ago – the sharpest decline of any generation and a significant change from the previous year, when Gen Z said they planned to spend 37% more.

And as non-wealthy Americans face pressures of higher prices and economic uncertainty, some reports are showing signs of a "K-shaped" economy that may stretch into the holiday season, with wealthier consumers spending more and lower-income consumers shopping more conservatively.

A new Deloitte survey found that consumers at large plan to spend 4% less on Black Friday than they did last year, primarily due to concerns of financial constraints and a higher cost of living.

Still, Rutherford said consumers are being more "intentional and value-driven" in their holiday shopping this year. 

That spending is translating into more support for small businesses rather than large legacy retailers, with 77% of consumers reporting they would do all of their holiday shopping at small businesses if they could and if the pricing was the same, according to AT&T's survey. 

Compared with last year, the number of survey respondents who said they shop at small businesses to boost their local economies grew by 8 percentage points. 

"I think there's a price consciousness out there, combined with a, 'If I can still save money or get a good price, I will still shop local,' type of mentality out there," Rutherford said. 

The AT&T survey also found that 72% of people reported getting their gift ideas from in-person shopping rather than from social media. 

And even as artificial intelligence begins to reshape the way people shop, more than half of shoppers said they were more likely to use traditional online search methods for their gifting this holiday season than AI – just 9% of those surveyed said they are more likely to use AI to find gifts. 

"AI has exploded over the last couple years, and it's infiltrating all aspects of life," Rutherford said. "I think as time goes on, you will see a shift from the traditional search to AI for shopping."

Michael Burry has doubled down on his critique of Nvidia and other AI giants, and revealed he's betting against both it and Palantir.

In a Tuesday post on his new Substack, the investor of "The Big Short" fame called out Nvidia's recent memo to Wall Street analysts, saying it was responding to claims he didn't make.

Burry, in a post titled "Unicorns and Cockroaches: Blessed Fraud," wrote that he couldn't believe Nvidia's responses had come from the world's most valuable public company. He said the document contained "one straw man after another" and the memo "almost reads like a hoax."

The market veteran, who recently closed his hedge fund to outside cash and turned his focus to writing, said he'd never suggested Nvidia was dragging out the depreciation of its property, plant, and equipment (PP&E), as it's primarily a chip designer with minimal capital expenditures, not a manufacturer.

"No one cares about Nvidia's own depreciation," he said. "One straw man burnt."

Burry also dismissed Nvidia's argument that its older-generation chips are still being used, saying his concern is that newer chips could become functionally obsolete between 2026 and 2028.

"I am looking forward because I see problems that are relevant to investors today," he wrote. "A second straw man burnt."

Burry added that Nvidia's rebuttal to him was "disingenuous on the face, and disappointing."

He disclosed in his latest post that he's placed wagers against the chipmaker and another AI darling: "I continue to own puts on Palantir and Nvidia, both of which will be discussed at another time."

Nvidia and Palantir didn't immediately respond to requests for comment on Burry's latest post.

One of Burry's chief concerns is AI companies' depreciation accounting, or how quickly they're projecting their assets will decline in value and how much they'll be worth at the end of their useful life.

Companies can increase their short-term profits and the stated value of their assets by spreading those costs over five or six years, rather than three. But that could pave the way for hefty writedowns in the future, Burry wrote on Substack.

He also highlighted a recent interview with Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, in which Nadella said he had slowed the company's data center buildout earlier this year because he was wary of overbuilding infrastructure to serve one generation of AI chips, as the next generation will have different power and cooling requirements.

"The hyperscalers have been systematically increasing the useful lives of chips and servers, for depreciation purposes, as they invest hundreds of billions of dollars in graphics chips with accelerating planned obsolescence," Burry wrote.

He hinted that between the memo and wider market reaction, his depreciation comments have sparked a bigger reaction than he anticipated: "I have been drawn into something much bigger than me."

Nvidia shares have slumped 14% from their November 3 high, as investors have grown more concerned that AI companies are overspending and overvalued.

Burry shot to fame after his massive bet against the US housing bubble was immortalized in the book and movie "The Big Short." Known for his dire warnings about crashes and recessions, he returned to X after a two-year break in late October, making the case that AI stocks are in a bubble.

Burry's Scion Asset Management previously revealed on November 3, the same day as Palantir's third-quarter earnings, that it held bearish put options on both companies at the end of September.

Palantir CEO Alex Karp called the bets "batshit crazy" in a televised interview the next day, prompting Burry to post on X that he wasn't surprised Karp "couldn't crack a simple 13F."

In a subsequent X post, Burry said the Palantir puts were "done last month" and he was "on to much better things" ahead of his Substack's launch.

The earlier positions had a combined notional value of $1.1 billion, but Burry wrote in his latest Substack post that they only cost him around $10 million each.

Burry hasn't shared the thinking behind his Palantir wagers. Shares of the AI-powered data analysis company hit a high ahead of its earnings but have since fallen 20%. They've still risen 26-fold since the start of 2023, valuing Palantir at around $390 billion — nearly 90 times its projected $4.4 billion of revenue this year.

Ok, this is getting serious. We need to have a chat about Alphabet.

The Google parent has stormed the gates of the AI trade and is, for now at least, the hottest company in the sector.

Here's what's happened in just the past two weeks:

So if it feels like things escalated quickly, that's because they very much did. But it can be argued that the seeds of the company's market-crushing dominance were planted a couple of months ago.

I'm referring to Alphabet's landmark legal victory in early September, which saw the company avoid having to sell off its Google Chrome web browser. It was important at the time, but with the benefit of hindsight, the removal of that regulatory overhang looks like even more of a crucial inflection point. Just look at the stock chart, which shows a 53% spike since then.

It's notable that Berkshire Hathaway — which has been historically allergic to high-flying tech stocks — bought in when it did. They haven't explained the rationale behind their stake, nor do we know exactly when in the third quarter it was built. But a core tenet of Warren Buffett's investing philosophy has always been to find companies with big competitive moats. What better option than the tech giant that just won its antitrust case?

Going beyond Berkshire, it's possible that — on the heels of its legal win — Alphabet is simply getting more aggressive with its AI ambitions, rather than playing things more conservative to avoid attracting unwanted attention.

It also has OpenAI paving the way for new technology rollouts with its "move fast and break things" approach. Alphabet has the luxury of being able to monitor developments at OpenAI, and wait to assess the level of blowback before introducing their competing version. Don't underestimate how much completed AI tech Alphabet has up its sleeve.

Looking forward, the company seems especially well-positioned within the AI trade. They're a formidable rival to Nvidia on the chipmaking front, but they also have a top-tier chatbot in Gemini 3.

So settle in and get familiar with the market-beating force that is Alphabet, your AI stock of the moment.

The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield was relatively unchanged on Wednesday as investors continued to monitor developments that could affect the Federal Reserve's upcoming interest rate decision and speculated about the central bank's next chair. 

The yield on the 10-year Treasury was flat at 4.002%, while the 30-year bond yield moved down less than 1 basis point to 4.649%. The 2-year note yield was more than 2 basis points higher at 3.487%.

One basis point equals 0.01% and yields and prices move in opposite directions.

Providing a sign that the labor market may be holding steady, initial jobless claims for the week ended Nov. 22 were less than anticipated at 216,000, the Labor Department reported on Wednesday. That marks the lowest level since mid-April. Economists polled by Dow Jones had estimated 225,000 for the period.

Those on Wall Street are also waiting for news about who the next Fed chair could be after Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told CNBC on Tuesday that there was "a very good chance" President Donald Trump would announce the next central bank leader by Christmas. 

Bessent, who has been hunting for a successor to current Fed Chair Jerome Powell, said that the president had one interview to go. 

"It's his prerogative, whether it's before the Christmas holidays or in the new year. But I think things are moving along very well," Bessent added.

Trump's allies and advisors believe White House National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett is the frontrunner, Bloomberg reported. Hassett is seen as in sync with Trump's preferences for lower interest rates.

Traders are currently pricing in a more than 80% chance of a quarter percentage point cut from the Fed in December, according to the CME FedWatch tool.

Monday - Friday, 10:00 - 11:00 SIN/HK  |  0400 - 05:00 CET

This report is from this week's CNBC's The China Connection newsletter, which brings you insights and analysis on what's driving the world's second-largest economy. You can subscribe here.

Sitting in his new Beijing office, AI2 Robotics Founder and CEO Eric Guo wistfully reflected on fundraising challenges in China — and noted that U.S.-based humanoid rival Figure recently raised $1 billion in a single round, at a $39 billion valuation.

That's far more than what a Chinese robotics company can typically raise, he said.

His strategy for growth? Do more with less. 

That means, for instance, developing a robotics AI model that uses less than 10% of the parameters required to train Alphabet's RT-2 AI model, as laid out in one of Guo's widely cited papers. Guo, who holds a Ph.D. from Purdue University, previously worked at Microsoft, smartphone maker Oppo and electric vehicle company Xpeng.

It mirrors how DeepSeek and other Chinese players have slashed AI costs for users, and allowed them to claim AI development budgets far below OpenAI's estimated spending, which has exceeded $100 billion. That strategy is enough to make AI2 Robotics one of China's hottest investment targets.

The Shenzhen-based startup hit a $1 billion valuation this fall, reaching unicorn status just over two years after launch — thanks to a whopping nine fundraising rounds so far this year, according to a person familiar with the matter.

The hot U.S. AI trade has shifted to Alphabet this week following rave reviews of its newest AI model — just weeks after Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway disclosed a rare tech position in the stock. Michael Burry, known for calling the U.S. housing crash before 2008, was the latest voice to warn of bubble risks in U.S. AI names that have powered recent market gains on Monday. 

But whatever's bubbling up in China's tech sector, it pales in comparison with the U.S.

U.S. venture deals in AI and robotics have more than quadrupled since 2023 to exceed $160 billion so far this year, according to a CNBC analysis of PitchBook data. 

Comparable deals in China this year are just over $10 billion — only slightly more than the $9.24 billion recorded in 2023, the data showed. 

It's a confluence of regulatory pressures in China, U.S. export controls and a scrappy startup environment where locals have overcome stringent pandemic lockdowns to stay competitive.

Global investors are increasingly interested. 

Bubble risks for Chinese AI firms appear far more contained than in the U.S., said Vincent Lu, partner and head of private equity at Australian asset manager Boman Group. The Melbourne-based firm oversees AU$910 million ($591.26 million), mostly allocated in Australia and North America, and has participated in funding rounds for U.S.-based Anthropic earlier this year and OpenAI last year.

Lu was "so intrigued" by China's AI and robotics scene that he moved back to Shanghai from Melbourne last year to scout deals, and is just starting to get serious about a few. Chinese companies' AI valuations are about one-quarter of their American peers, while benefiting from lower research and development costs, he added.

Boman's Lu was just one of many investors at the AVCJ forum in Hong Kong last week who told CNBC how excited they were about how cheaply priced Chinese AI startups are compared to those in the U.S.

It marks an ongoing recovery in foreign investor interest in China following Beijing's crackdown on large internet tech companies in recent years, coupled with Washington's scrutiny of China-related investments.

This month alone, at least three China-based funds with an AI focus have raised capital denominated in U.S. dollars from overseas investors:

Venture firms raise capital from outside investors, known as limited partners, earning annual fees as they put that money to work in startups. Once the startups go public or are sold at higher valuations, the VC firms can "exit" and share the returns with their limited partners.

The momentum is building, even if the numbers don't look big yet. Monolith claimed investors sought to commit more than $600 million to its latest fundraising round, but it kept the original cap of $488 million.

Funds of this size would have been "inconceivable" just a year ago, said Johnny Zou, co-head of Primavera Venture Partners, adding that American investor sentiment toward China is seeing a "clear recovery," helped by relatively visible exit paths. 

While Chinese companies have yet to resume IPOs in the U.S., they have flocked to Hong Kong, turning its stock exchange into the world's largest listing destination this year. 

Even so, stock investors are relatively more cautious on China than the U.S.

The Hang Seng Index, which includes AI heavyweights Alibaba and Tencent, is up nearly 30% so far this year, but trades at a modest 13.61 price-to-earnings ratio, according to FactSet data. The Nasdaq Composite, in contrast, trades at a 33.8 ratio, with the index up almost 20% so far this year.

Young Liu, chairman of Hon Hai Technology Group, compared talk of an AI bubble to a dot-com bubble and said that the world's top technology companies will ultimately be AI-related. 

EQT Asia Chairman Jean Eric Salata and CEO Per Franzen discussed the firm's focus in Asia, outlining the strategies it is pursuing in the region. 

Joey Wat, CEO of Yum China, said the company plans to accelerate store openings in China and that the country's urbanization is not complete yet. 

Trump-Xi call. The U.S. and Chinese presidents on Monday night signaled that a one-year trade truce is intact, just as tensions flare between Beijing and Tokyo over Taiwan. 

Japanese concerts get canceled. At least two performances in Beijing were abruptly canceled last week amid China's expanding pushback against Japan's high-profile Taiwan comments.

Alibaba AI app downloads surge. The company's new Qwen app reported more than 10 million downloads in a week as its AI pivot gains momentum.

I think the U.S. [AI] bottleneck probably is electricity, but in China, the bottleneck is GPUs. ... I don't think that there's [much] discussion about the bubble here.

— Shawn Yang, analyst, Arete Research

China's CSI 300 rose 0.74% as of 2:30 pm local time Wednesday. The index is set to snap a two-week losing streak, gaining 1.53% so far this week. The benchmark has risen 14.9% so far this year.

Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index climbed 0.25% and is up 2.9% for the week, recovering from last week's decline amid a global tech sell-off. The main stock gauge is up 29.4% year to date.

The offshore yuan last traded at 7.077 against the dollar, its strongest level since October 2024.

LONDON — European stocks ended Wednesday in positive territory amid rising expectations that the U.S. Federal Reserve will cut interest rates in December. 

The pan-European Stoxx 600 finished the session almost 1.1% higher, with most sectors and major regional bourses in the green.

Regional indexes are following their counterparts on Wall Street and in the Asia-Pacific region higher amid expectations that the Fed will cut when it next meets on Dec. 9-10.

Markets are pricing in almost an 85% chance of a quarter percentage point cut by the central bank, according to the CME FedWatch tool. New York Fed President John Williams also said on Friday that there was room to lower rates "in the near term."

Global markets also got a boost after U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told CNBC on Tuesday that there was a "very good chance" that Trump could name a new Fed chair before Christmas.

While he said he was interviewing candidates, expectations are shifting toward White House National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett, after Bloomberg reported he had emerged as a frontrunner for the job. Hassett is viewed as someone more likely to push for lower rates.

In the U.K., all eyes are on the Autumn Budget on Wednesday with Chancellor Rachel Reeves set to unveil her spending and taxation plans for the year ahead. There are widespread expectations that the finance minister will announce a raft of tax hikes as she tries to stick to self-imposed rules on spending and borrowing, and has a fiscal black hole to fill as a result. 

The country's fiscal watchdog the Office for Budget Responsibility unexpectedly released its economic and fiscal forecasts ahead of the Autumn Budget, sending yields on British government debt see-sawing.

The benchmark 10-year gilt moved higher after falling as much 4 basis points following the release, but quicky reversed gains. It was last seen 2 basis point lower. Shorter-term gilts followed a similar pattern.

U.K. banks also experienced sharp swings during the session, initially rising on the back of expectations they would be spared from extra taxes in the Autumn Budget, before selling off following the surprise early release of the budget details, and later closing in positive territory. 

Barclays finished the day 3% higher, Natwest advanced around 2%, and Lloyds gained 3.4%.

Reeves confirmed the introduction of a council tax charge on properties valued over £2 million ($6.63 million). British housing and construction names Persimmon fell almost 0.2%, Taylor Wimpey shed 1.7%, and The Berkeley Group fell almost 3%. Barratt Redrow climbed back into the green after an initial dip, later reversing course to finish the day down 0.4%.

Sterling gained on the dollar, moving 0.5% higher to trade at $1.323. 

European investors also monitored developments in U.S.-led negotiations on a Ukraine peace deal. On Tuesday, U.S. President Donald Trump said a deal was "very close." U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff is set to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow, Trump added, while U.S. Army Secretary Dan Driscoll "will be meeting with the Ukrainians."

It came after reports emerged that Kyiv had accepted the reworked terms of the peace plan, originally drafted by the U.S. 

European defense stocks moved higher on Wednesday, with Germany's Rheinmetall closing 1.9% higher. 

Elsewhere, Novo Nordisk shares rose 4.7% after the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services announced the newly negotiated price for its bestseller drugs Ozempic and Wegovy from 2027. The new price for patients on Medicare will be $274, a 71% discount from its current list price.

Taiwan will introduce a supplementary defense budget of 1.25 trillion Taiwanese dollars ($40 billion) as Beijing accelerates military preparations near the island, President Lai Ching-te said at a press briefing Wednesday.

China has continued to increase military drills and so-called "gray-zone harassment" around Taiwan, with the goal of seizing the island by force by 2027, Lai said, according to a CNBC translation of his remarks in Mandarin. The speech comes in the aftermath of a diplomatic dispute between China and Japan over Taiwan. 

Lai added that Beijing had intensified its "infiltration and influence campaign," using a range of tools to interfere in Taiwan's politics and society as it seeks to sway public opinion and undermine the island's democracy.

He also cautioned "unprecedented military buildup" by Beijing and "intensifying provocations in the Taiwan Strait, in the East and South China Seas, and across the Indo-Pacific." 

Beijing considers democratically governed Taiwan as its own territory and Chinese President Xi Jinping regards its reunification with the mainland "a historical inevitability." Taiwan rejects those claims. 

China has been piling pressure on Taipei and has conducted several military drills off the coast of the island over the past few years, issuing stern warnings over Taiwan's "provocations for independence."

Beijing raised its defense budget by 7.2% this year to about $245 billion, with its military assets heavily deployed near the Taiwan Strait, according to analysts at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. 

Lai on Wednesday vowed to build up Taiwan's self-defense capabilities in the face of growing threats from Beijing, aiming to achieve a high level of combat readiness by 2027.  

"President Lai's announcement is a signal to Washington of Taipei's commitment to its self-defense and intent to increase imports to balance trade between the two," said Drew Thompson, a senior fellow at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore. 

Since his election campaign, U.S. President Donald Trump has been pushing allies to increase defense spending. Trump even suggested Taiwan should pay to be protected.     

Shortly after Lai's speech, Raymond Greene, director of American Institute in Taiwan — the de facto U.S. embassy — said in a social media post that the United States "welcomes" the special defense budget and supports Taiwan's "rapid acquisition of critical asymmetric capabilities needed to strengthen deterrence. 

When asked to comment on Taiwan's defense budget and Greene's comments, a spokesperson for Chinese foreign ministry said at a daily press briefing Wednesday that "the Democratic Progressive Party's plan of resisting reunification and seeking independence using armed forces is doomed to fail." That's according to a CNBC's translation of the remarks in Mandarin. 

China has been locked in a diplomatic spat with Japan over Taiwan, with Beijing accusing Tokyo of intervening in its internal affairs after Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi said earlier this month that the use of military force in any Taiwan conflict could be deemed a "survival-threatening situation" for Tokyo. Beijing called the remarks "egregious" and has demanded a retraction.

Trump spoke with Xi and Takaichi in separate phone calls on Monday. Experts say that Xi likely used the call to solicit Trump's help in influencing Takaichi to tone down her rhetoric on cross-Strait issues.

Amazon is facing a federal probe after one of its delivery drones downed an internet cable in central Texas last week. 

The probe comes as Amazon vies to expand drone deliveries to more pockets of the U.S., more than a decade after it first conceived the aerial distribution program, and faces stiffer competition from Walmart, which has also begun drone deliveries. 

The incident occurred on Nov. 18 around 12:45 p.m. Central in Waco, Texas. After dropping off a package, one of Amazon's MK30 drones was ascending out of a customer's yard when one of its six propellers got tangled in a nearby internet cable, according to a video of the incident viewed and verified by CNBC. 

The video shows the Amazon drone shearing the wire line. The drone's motor then appeared to shut off and the aircraft landed itself, with its propellers windmilling slightly on the way down, the video shows. The drone appeared to remain in tact beyond some damage to one of its propellers. 

The Federal Aviation Administration is investigating the incident, a spokesperson confirmed. The National Transportation Safety Board said the agency is aware of the incident but has not opened a probe into the matter. 

Amazon confirmed the incident to CNBC, saying that after clipping the internet cable, the drone performed a "safe contingent landing," referring to the process that allows its drones to land safely in unexpected conditions.

"There were no injuries or widespread internet service outages. We've paid for the cable line's repair for the customer and have apologized for the inconvenience this caused them," an Amazon spokesperson told CNBC, noting that the drone had completed its package delivery.

The incident comes after federal investigators last month opened a separate probe into a crash involving two of Amazon's Prime Air drones in Arizona. The two aircrafts collided with a construction crane in Tolleson, a city west of Phoenix, prompting Amazon to temporarily halt drone deliveries in the area.

For over a decade, Amazon has been working to realize founder Jeff Bezos' vision of drones whizzing toothpaste, books and other goods to customers' doorsteps in 30 minutes or less. The company began drone deliveries in 2022 in College Station, Texas, and Lockeford, California.

But progress has been slowed by a mix of regulatory hurdles, missed deadlines and layoffs in 2023 that coincided with broader cost-cutting efforts by Amazon CEO Andy Jassy. 

The company has previously said its goal is to deliver 500 million packages by drone per year by the end of the decade. 

The hexacopter-shaped MK30, the latest generation of Amazon's Prime Air drone, is meant to be quieter, smaller and lighter than previous versions. 

Amazon says the drones are equipped with a sense-and-avoid system that enables them to "detect and stay away from obstacles in the air and on the ground." The company recommends that customers maintain "about 10 feet of open space" on their property so drones can complete deliveries

The company began drone deliveries in Waco earlier this month for customers within a certain radius of its same-day delivery site who order eligible items weighing 5 pounds or less. The drone deliveries are supposed to drop packages off in under an hour. 

Amazon has brought other locations online in recent months, including Kansas City, Missouri, Pontiac, Michigan, San Antonio, Texas, and Ruskin, Florida. Amazon has also announced plans to expand drone deliveries to Richardson, Texas. 

Walmart began offering drone deliveries in 2021, and currently partners with Alphabet's Wing and venture-backed startup Zipline to make drone deliveries in a number of states, including in Texas.

UFC star Conor McGregor publicly blasted longtime rival Khabib Nurmagomedov after the retired champion dropped a series of papakha-inspired NFTs, digital versions of the traditional Dagestani hat he made famous during UFC fight nights.

Social media posts claimed the release generated around $4.4 million, and after the sale, Nurmagomedov deleted earlier posts promoting it.

McGregor immediately accused Nurmagomedov of running a “scam,” claiming he used his late father's name and Dagestani culture to take money from fans before wiping off promotional evidence. He called it “a shame and a stain” on Nurmagomedov's father's legacy.

“There is just no way good guy Khabib used his late father's name, as well as Dagestan's culture, to scam his fans and fire sell a bunch of digital NFTs online and then delete all of the content after they were sold, leaving his fans robbed of their money?” McGregor wrote.

Nurmagomedov fired back, calling McGregor an “absolute liar” and insisting the NFTs were legitimate “digital gifts” with real value, created to celebrate the Dagestani tradition. He said McGregor was trying to insult him years after losing their infamous 2018 fight.

McGregor also had his own history with crypto ventures.

The former UFC champion previously partnered with Real World Gaming DAO to launch a meme token called REAL, aiming to blend meme coin appeal with utility and transparent fundraising.

However, the presale fell short of its target, and the team eventually processed refunds for all bidders.

South Korea's largest crypto exchange is officially getting acquired—pending regulator approval—by one of the country's top tech giants.

Naver Financial agreed Wednesday to absorb Dunamu, operator of crypto exchange Upbit, in an all-stock deal valued at $10.29 billion. According to a related filing, the deal will see Naver issue 2.54 new shares for every share in Dunamu, as the company is absorbed.

That deal would see Dunamu's leadership become the largest shareholders in parent company Naver Financial, despite the crypto company being absorbed as a wholly owned subsidiary.

Both companies will continue to operate their existing businesses under the merger, according to Wednesday's filing. 

“In addition, they will review various restructuring plans to secure future growth engines through functional and organic cooperation between the two companies,” the outlined agreement said.

The deal, which has been hotly anticipated for months, would combine South Korea's largest crypto exchange with the nation's leading payments platform, in a moment when the digital assets economy and traditional finance are beginning to merge on the global stage.

Stablecoin-related plans are reportedly at center of the Dunamu-Naver merger, given both companies have ambitions in the exploding sector.

After the United States passed a landmark stablecoin bill in July legalizing the asset class, other nations have raced to embrace the currency-pegged digital tokens, which serve as a key connector between traditional economies and the crypto market.

In July, Dunamu revealed plans for a won-backed stablecoin issued by Naver. The company has also developed a layer-2 Ethereum network specifically designed for facilitating stablecoin transactions and retail payments.

The deal between both companies now must be approved by South Korean regulators, namely the country's Fair Trade Commission.

Oops, something went wrong

Just a year after developers—led in part by Vitalik Buterin's push for scaling—began advocating for higher gas limits, Ethereum is now operating with a 60 million block gas limit, doubling network capacity in only 12 months.

As pointed out by Ethereum Foundation researcher Toni Wahrstätter, this marks one of the most important throughput expansions on Ethereum's mainnet in years and shows a maturing network ready for more complex applications. A 60 million gas limit means each block can fit far more transactions, contract calls, and on-chain operations.

The increase was driven by coordinated support across client teams and the wider research community, with tools like GasLimit.Pics providing visibility into network-wide trends. According to Wahrstätter, the shift is “only the beginning.”

Gas limits determine how much computation can fit inside each Ethereum block—effectively setting the ceiling for transaction processing and smart-contract execution.

The move from roughly 30 million to 60 million gas per block represents a substantial boost in network throughput. The change follows months of discussions among core developers, researchers, and node operators who have been assessing the trade-offs between scaling, validator load, hardware requirements, and decentralisation.

Higher limits, while beneficial for users, increase pressure on block builders and full nodes, raising concerns about long-term sustainability. The fact that client teams aligned on this upgrade illustrates a shared confidence in the resilience of Ethereum's execution layer.

Shortly after Wahrstätter's announcement, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin added further context. He expects continued gas growth, but “more targeted / less uniform” increases in 2026 rather than another blanket doubling.

Buterin outlines specific opcodes and operations that could see gas limit adjustments:

SSTORE when creating new storage

SSTORE in general (slight increase)

Precompiles (excluding elliptic-curve operations)

CALLs to contracts with large code size

Some complex arithmetic opcodes (MODMUL)

Calldata costs (slight increase)

These targeted increases would allow Ethereum to scale computationally heavy operations without overstressing other parts of the network. In essence, the network would become more efficient without compromising validator decentralisation.

The gas limit expansion reinforces Ethereum's gradualist scaling philosophy: incremental improvements, carefully measured, with long-term decentralisation preserved.

With proto-danksharding (EIP-4844) already live and full danksharding under active development, the execution layer is now gaining complementary headroom.

The message from both developers and Vitalik is clear: Ethereum is not only scaling—it's becoming more adaptable, predictable, and strategically engineered for the next generation of applications.

SpaceComputer, a startup that plans to use satellites to run secure computing for blockchains, has raised $10 million in a seed round, according to an announcement shared exclusively with The Defiant. The firm said the funds will be used to build an orbital network that can process blockchain operations securely from space.

The seed round was co-led by Maven11 and Lattice, with participation from Superscrypt, the Arbitrum Foundation, Nascent, Offchain Labs, Hashkey, and Chorus One, among others. Individual investors include Marc Weinstein, Jason Yanowitz, and Ameen Soleimani. This raise follows a pre-seed round led by Primitive Ventures earlier this year, the announcement notes.

The funding will be used to build and launch SpaceComputer's first satellites, as well as the secure computing hardware they carry. These satellites, called SpaceTEE units, will run secure blockchain and cryptography tasks from space, according to the press release.

The funding will also go toward building network software, setting up how the satellites work together, and offering new services like private computing and secure record-keeping.

The investment highlights growing interest in using novel approaches, like space technology, to advance blockchain infrastructure. By moving beyond traditional satellites, blockchain operations could become harder to mess with on Earth.

“The SpaceComputer project represents an optimistic, yet pragmatic cypherpunk ambition,” said co-founder Daniel Bar. “Space is open for business and we are rapidly entering an era where more and more applications include space based computation and communication layers.”

Bar added that the “importance and opportunity” of space for decentralized technologies is “undeniable.” 

Major financial institutions have also explored the potential of satellites for secure transactions. A few years ago, JPMorgan's digital asset arm tested what it called the “world's first bank-led tokenized value transfer in space.” The banking giant used a blockchain network deployed on low-Earth orbit  (LEO) satellites to execute smart-contract transactions.

These developments come as scientists grow extremely concerned with the expanding amount of space debris. In 2023, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) warned in a letter to Congress that debris from LEO satellites, like SpaceX's Starlink constellation, could pose a danger to people on the ground during reentry disposal.

A separate 2022 study claimed that Elon Musk's swarm of satellites is obstructing astronomers' telescope views.

SpaceComputer is known predominantly for testing satellites on SpaceX's Falcon 9 and releasing tools for developers to access computing from space. 

The company is currently working with researchers at the Technical University of Munich, Cornell Tech, and U.C. Santa Barbara to explore off-Earth computing for blockchain applications.

Conor McGregor and Khabib Nurmagomedov have words again

Conor McGregor is firing shots at his old friend Khabib Nurmagomedov again.

Nurmagomedov recently announced an auction for a new NFT called Papakhas on social media platform Telegram. On Wednesday, the retired former UFC lightweight champion revealed that the digital currency had completely sold out.

That brought out a tweet from McGregor, who was Nurmagomedov's biggest career rival in the fight game, and appears to still be in that role.

“There is just no way good guy khabib used his late fathers name, as well as Dagestan's culture, to scam his fans and fire sell a bunch of digital NFT's online and then delete all of the content after they were sold, leaving his fans robbed of their money? There is just no way good guy do this,” McGregor wrote.

Nurmagomedov then responded to McGregor's post, saying that McGregor will do anything in an attempt to soil his name, while also tweeting out a commercial of sorts for the platform and NFT.

“You absolute liar,”Nurmagomedov wrote. “You will always try to darken my name, after you got destroyed that night, but you will never achieve that! Yes, good guys don't do that. They don't create exclusive digital gifts with real time value, that you can share with your friends and family. Gifts in the shape of Papakha - hat that symbolize traditions and culture of Dagestan people.

“Traditions and culture that slowly walking over this world, whether you like it or not! Gifts that you can find exclusively on Telegram, greatest messaging platform on the world.”

Of course, McGregor wasn't going to let it go without getting the last word.

“Apologize this instant for using your late father's name to sell these ‘gifts' that cost your fans so much of their money,” McGregor wrote. “Also to sell something means it is not a gift you low IQ troglodyte! That is the direct opposite of what ‘gift' means. Duh duh duh dumbass, hahaha. Scamming on your dead daddy's name. Shame.”

Nurmagomedov faced McGregor in the biggest UFC main event of all time at UFC 229 in October 2018. It was a lopsided performance for Nurmagomedov before eventually submitting the former two-division champ in Round 4.

Though the recently passed Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act prohibits the creation of a central bank digital currency (CBDC) in the United States, other governments have found success by launching these projects. For the average person, understanding how a CBDC could impact the Bitcoin price USD may reveal why governments choose to explore CBDCs or to avoid implementing the technology.

Understanding the Role of CBDCs

Similar to traditional currency, which may be referred to as central bank money, a CBDC is simply a digital form of existing legal tender. Governed by the same central bank as any given traditional currency would be, most CBDCs are intended to expand access to safe payment options without reducing or replacing fiat systems. Ultimately, a CBDC provides a level of convenience for the digital age.

Where Have CBDCs Been Implemented Already?

The Bahamas, Nigeria, Jamaica, and Zimbabwe are the only nations to have fully launched a CBDC solution, but many other countries are exploring their potential for digital transformation. Perhaps most notably, China and the European Union are currently in the pilot phase of their own CBDC projects, and the U.S. was formerly in the infrastructure phase. Certainly, CBDCs have sparked international attention. 

Most countries that have launched a CBDC in some form have done so for the sake of three key goals: faster payments, financial inclusion, and reduced cash dependency. While fiat currency may remain the basis of the global economy, payment systems are increasingly trending toward the convenience and speed of digital solutions. As such, governments are taking the next steps toward this future.

Central bank digital currencies are starting to feel less like local experiments and more like chess pieces in a global power game. Governments do not just see them as fancy digital cash, they see levers of control, ways to fine tune their money flow and pull away from systems like SWIFT that tie them to others. China's digital yuan kind of kicked the hornet's nest, pushing Europe, Japan, and everyone else to hurry up and figure out their own versions before they fall behind in the digital money race.

If these currencies really take off, sending money across borders might go from a slog of days to something closer to blinking speed. Trade could get faster, smoother, more efficient. But whoever builds the slickest, strongest digital pipes might end up holding a bigger slice of global influence. Then there is the idea of programmable money, where funds can come with strings attached, like expiring on a date or only working for specific things. It is the kind of thing that could twist the usual idea of fiscal policy into something much more precise, maybe even unnerving.

For crypto, it is a strange mix of threat and validation. On one hand, CBDCs show that the core ideas behind blockchain actually work. On the other, all that official digital money could drain attention and liquidity away from decentralized tokens and stablecoins. Crypto projects might have to shape up, get clearer, get useful, and prove they can live alongside these government approved digital heavyweights.

What Is the Difference Between CBDCs and Cryptocurrency?

While there are many ways to distinguish between CBDCs and crypto, the core difference between these digital assets comes down to centralized versus decentralized control. Where digital tokens like cryptocurrency and stablecoins are defined by their decentralization, separate from regulatory bodies like central banks, CBDCs are directly governed by such institutions.

The presence of a regulatory solution should ensure that a CBDC is as stable as the traditional currency it is tied to, leading to stability in comparison to cryptocurrency. At the same time, privacy and surveillance concerns largely absent from crypto projects could take center stage within a CBDC initiative. Where traditional currency is difficult to trace, every transaction could be recorded by a CBDC's governing body.

It is for this reason that the U.S. recently passed the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act, preventing the implementation of a CBDC for the nation. While this decision may limit areas of growth for the U.S., it could allow the nation to learn from how other world leaders attempt to implement a CBDC before doing so itself. 

Exploring a Potential Impact on the Crypto Market and the Bitcoin Price USD

Though cryptocurrency and CBDCs are distinguished by centralized versus decentralized control, it is possible that the implementation of a CBDC could impact the crypto market. This is especially true for stablecoins, which are often connected to traditional currencies like the U.S. dollar. Though stablecoins are largely intended to eliminate the need for the exchange of crypto and fiat currency, a fast, low-cost, and well-regulated CBDC could overtake this role.

A Future in Digital Currency

As countries look to adopt or avoid CBDC technology, the matter of financial control versus individual sovereignty rises to the surface. A CBDC could provide the average person with new levels of financial control, automating tax collection, stimulus distribution, and accelerating payments. On the other hand, the technology could risk independence. For this reason, decentralized cryptocurrencies remain a prominent facet of the modern digital environment.

Crypto projects might have to shape up, get clearer, get useful, and prove they can live alongside these government approved digital heavyweights.

What Is the Difference Between CBDCs and Cryptocurrency?

While there are many ways to distinguish between CBDCs and crypto, the core difference between these digital assets comes down to centralized versus decentralized control. Where digital tokens like cryptocurrency and stablecoins are defined by their decentralization, separate from regulatory bodies like central banks, CBDCs are directly governed by such institutions.

The presence of a regulatory solution should ensure that a CBDC is as stable as the traditional currency it is tied to, leading to stability in comparison to cryptocurrency. At the same time, privacy and surveillance concerns largely absent from crypto projects could take center stage within a CBDC initiative. Where traditional currency is difficult to trace, every transaction could be recorded by a CBDC's governing body.

It is for this reason that the U.S. recently passed the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act, preventing the implementation of a CBDC for the nation. While this decision may limit areas of growth for the U.S., it could allow the nation to learn from how other world leaders attempt to implement a CBDC before doing so itself. 

Exploring a Potential Impact on the Crypto Market and the Bitcoin Price USD

Though cryptocurrency and CBDCs are distinguished by centralized versus decentralized control, it is possible that the implementation of a CBDC could impact the crypto market. This is especially true for stablecoins, which are often connected to traditional currencies like the U.S. dollar. Though stablecoins are largely intended to eliminate the need for the exchange of crypto and fiat currency, a fast, low-cost, and well-regulated CBDC could overtake this role.

A Future in Digital Currency

As countries look to adopt or avoid CBDC technology, the matter of financial control versus individual sovereignty rises to the surface. A CBDC could provide the average person with new levels of financial control, automating tax collection, stimulus distribution, and accelerating payments. On the other hand, the technology could risk independence. For this reason, decentralized cryptocurrencies remain a prominent facet of the modern digital environment.

Ark Invest continues to add shares of crypto related equities and major tech stocks across its actively managed ETFs, highlighted by its Tuesday addition of more than 174,000 shares of Google parent company Alphabet (GOOG) valued at more than $56 million. 

Cathie Wood's investment management firm also added another $3.75 million worth of shares in crypto exchange Coinbase, $7 million worth of stablecoin issuer Circle, and nearly $2 million worth of its own Bitcoin ETF, the ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB). 

Its major Google acquisition comes just a week after the tech firm unveiled its most powerful AI model yet, Gemini 3. The firm is also engaging in talks with major cloud firms about purchasing its in-house chips, according to a report from the Wall Street Journal. 

GOOG shares have been rising in the last 5 trading sessions, gaining more than 8.9% and now changing hands at $319.11. Shares are up more than 22% in the last month, per Yahoo Finance.

The recent boost is just part of a broader rally for the firm, with shares gaining nearly 90% in the last six months to trade at a $3.816 trillion market cap—more than the entire crypto ecosystem at the time of writing.

In addition to Google, the firm added $29.4 million of AI cloud computing firm CoreWeave (CRWV) and $21.5 million of Facebook parent company, Meta. 

And while the valuations attached to companies squarely in the AI sector have left some investors wondering whether or not a bubble is preparing to burst, Wood's firm maintains its bullish stance. 

“The fact that so many people are worried that we are in an AI cycle, like the tech and telecom bubble, actually reassures me,” Wood said on an Ark Invest podcast published Tuesday. “It's very different from what happened during the tech and telecom bubble.” 

Wood pointed to the fact that during the tech bubble, companies were being created and funded because of “dreams” of what could be, or how many eyeballs they could eventually secure. 

But today, the technologies are ready. 

The uncertainty around AI valuations, coupled with macroeconomic uncertainty from missing data during the government shutdown, has led to a wobble in broader markets of late, though Ark Invest has been relentless in its purchases. 

Last week, Ark's funds added notable positions in Coinbase and Ethereum treasury company BitMine Immersion Technologies (BMNR). The firm has also been snatching up shares of Circle as the USDC stablecoin issuer fell back to trading levels not seen since its massively successful IPO in June.

Earlier this month, Wood cut her 2030 Bitcoin forecast to $1.2 million per coin, down from a previously predicted $1.5 million, on account of the rapid rise of stablecoins.

Oops, something went wrong

Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) and Solana (CRYPTO: SOL) approach 2026 with contrasting positions. Ethereum remains institutionalized, but its expansion relies entirely on Layer 2s rather than mainnet power. Solana, on the other hand, is coming off a year of record on-chain activity: 186% year-over-year revenue growth, and rising institutional interest through new ETFs.

Both chains have credible paths forward, yet the drivers behind their performance are no longer the same. With Firedancer and Fusaka upcoming upgrades, ETF flows, and shifting user behaviors, which blockchain has the better return potential heading into the new year?

Solana and Ethereum are going into 2026 with networks that attract fundamentally different user bases. Solana is tilted toward speed, retail demand, and increasing institutional interest, while Ethereum leans into security, deep liquidity, and its maturing L2 stack. Their differences now shape how developers build and how value flows across both ecosystems.

Solana's design centers on raw execution speed, delivering near-instant finality and high-volume throughput. And Firedancer is set to push performance further in 2026.

Ethereum's modular roadmap prioritizes decentralization, leaving most transaction activity to L2s. This creates a fragmented environment where liquidity spreads across Arbitrum, Optimism, and Base rather than staying unified.

Solana thrives on fast retail activity driven by memecoins, gaming, and constant low-fee transactions. Ethereum's traffic comes from institutions, real-world assets, and large DeFi users. High Layer 1 fees push everyday users to L2s, weakening Ethereum's cultural presence while Solana strengthens its retail appeal.

The Solana developer community is smaller but expanding fast, driven by available resources and quick build-and-deploy processes. The largest pool of developers remains in Ethereum, yet it's spread among various Layer 2s. This fragmentation undermines cohesive development and slows coordinated innovation, while Solana continues attracting developers in gaming, NFTs, and consumer-oriented apps.

Solana's economic loop is direct and efficient. Fees flow directly to validators and stakers, reinforcing network incentives. Ethereum's economics are diluted across L2 sequencers, MEV builders, and staking providers. This weakens the link between ETH usage and ETH rewards, while Solana's structure keeps value concentrated within the network.

Solana's economic loop remains tight and responsive. High activity feeds protocol revenue, which strengthens validator rewards and pulls more users and developers to the network. Even after its recent price drop, Solana's staking participation and transaction flow stayed strong, showing that its growth is tied directly to network usage rather than speculation. This gives Solana a cleaner upside when demand rises.

Ethereum's loop is fragmented. Activity has shifted to Layer 2s, which cuts the revenue that once flowed through the mainnet. Settlement fees help, but they can't match the economic momentum Ethereum had when L1 activity drove value. ETFs add stability, but they don't rebuild the reflexive cycle that once linked usage to token strength.

For 2026, Solana offers higher upside potential if Firedancer ships on time and volumes stay high. Ethereum offers stable, gradual appreciation tied to macro cycles and institutional flows.

Solana's ETF rollout in late 2025 arrived at the perfect moment. While Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs were bleeding billions, Solana products from Grayscale, Bitwise, VanEck, and Fidelity pulled in a combined $476 million across 19 straight days of inflows starting October 28.

Institutions treated the dip as an entry point rather than a warning sign. The kicker was staking access. Funds like Fidelity's FSOL passed through a share of staking rewards, turning ETF exposure into on-chain economic participation.

Ethereum's ETF momentum followed a different path. Early inflows were strong, but by October, they slowed into routine rebalancing. Even with the Fusaka upgrade set for December 3 to improve ETH infrastructure, the flows lacked the spark seen in Solana's launch window.

Ethereum still carries deep trust, but its ETF demand no longer shows new institutional conviction. Solana, for now, is capturing the narrative institutions want to own heading into 2026.

Solana and Ethereum enter 2026 with different strengths, but both face catalysts that could reshape their paths. The scenarios below show how each chain could perform depending on how those forces land.

Here, Solana enters 2026 with strong momentum as Firedancer rolls out cleanly and lifts throughput enough to support heavier trading and daily activity. ETF inflows from VanEck and Fidelity grow as institutions seek higher upside than Bitcoin or Ethereum can currently offer. Strong revenue keeps staking yields attractive, pulling more users back on-chain.

Ethereum holds steady through rising L2 demand and improving institutional trust. With supportive macro conditions, Solana could target $280–$340 while Ethereum pushes toward $4,200–$4,800.

In a balanced scenario, Solana grows at a measured pace as Firedancer launches, but it needs more time to deliver its full benefits. ETF inflows continue, though at a slower pace, and retail activity stabilizes into predictable waves rather than explosive surges. Transaction levels hold firm around one billion monthly.

Ethereum strengthens through L2 consolidation as Arbitrum and Optimism remain core settlement paths. Institutional confidence stays steady, though cautious. With mixed macro conditions, Solana could trade between $190 and $230 while Ethereum remains in the $3,400–$3,800 range.

In a case where market conditions worsen, Solana could face pressure if Firedancer experiences delays or early instability, slowing validator upgrades and weakening retail momentum. Regulatory action against memecoin platforms might cut into key revenue streams, reducing activity and staking yields. ETF flows would cool as institutions return to safer allocations.

Ethereum could struggle with L2 fragmentation and weak fee capture as sequencers compete aggressively on costs. If Bitcoin drops below $60,000 and macro conditions tighten further, Solana might retreat toward $130–$160 while Ethereum falls to $2,600–$2,900.

You may think retirement is about picking the best stocks or ETFs, but you'd be wrong. See even great investments can be a liability in retirement. The difference comes down to a simple: accumulation vs distribution. The difference is causing millions to rethink their plans.

Solana's economic loop is direct and efficient. Fees flow directly to validators and stakers, reinforcing network incentives. Ethereum's economics are diluted across L2 sequencers, MEV builders, and staking providers. This weakens the link between ETH usage and ETH rewards, while Solana's structure keeps value concentrated within the network.

Solana's economic loop remains tight and responsive. High activity feeds protocol revenue, which strengthens validator rewards and pulls more users and developers to the network. Even after its recent price drop, Solana's staking participation and transaction flow stayed strong, showing that its growth is tied directly to network usage rather than speculation. This gives Solana a cleaner upside when demand rises.

Ethereum's loop is fragmented. Activity has shifted to Layer 2s, which cuts the revenue that once flowed through the mainnet. Settlement fees help, but they can't match the economic momentum Ethereum had when L1 activity drove value. ETFs add stability, but they don't rebuild the reflexive cycle that once linked usage to token strength.

For 2026, Solana offers higher upside potential if Firedancer ships on time and volumes stay high. Ethereum offers stable, gradual appreciation tied to macro cycles and institutional flows.

Solana's ETF rollout in late 2025 arrived at the perfect moment. While Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs were bleeding billions, Solana products from Grayscale, Bitwise, VanEck, and Fidelity pulled in a combined $476 million across 19 straight days of inflows starting October 28.

Institutions treated the dip as an entry point rather than a warning sign. The kicker was staking access. Funds like Fidelity's FSOL passed through a share of staking rewards, turning ETF exposure into on-chain economic participation.

Ethereum's ETF momentum followed a different path. Early inflows were strong, but by October, they slowed into routine rebalancing. Even with the Fusaka upgrade set for December 3 to improve ETH infrastructure, the flows lacked the spark seen in Solana's launch window.

Ethereum still carries deep trust, but its ETF demand no longer shows new institutional conviction. Solana, for now, is capturing the narrative institutions want to own heading into 2026.

Solana and Ethereum enter 2026 with different strengths, but both face catalysts that could reshape their paths. The scenarios below show how each chain could perform depending on how those forces land.

Here, Solana enters 2026 with strong momentum as Firedancer rolls out cleanly and lifts throughput enough to support heavier trading and daily activity. ETF inflows from VanEck and Fidelity grow as institutions seek higher upside than Bitcoin or Ethereum can currently offer. Strong revenue keeps staking yields attractive, pulling more users back on-chain.

Ethereum holds steady through rising L2 demand and improving institutional trust. With supportive macro conditions, Solana could target $280–$340 while Ethereum pushes toward $4,200–$4,800.

In a balanced scenario, Solana grows at a measured pace as Firedancer launches, but it needs more time to deliver its full benefits. ETF inflows continue, though at a slower pace, and retail activity stabilizes into predictable waves rather than explosive surges. Transaction levels hold firm around one billion monthly.

Ethereum strengthens through L2 consolidation as Arbitrum and Optimism remain core settlement paths. Institutional confidence stays steady, though cautious. With mixed macro conditions, Solana could trade between $190 and $230 while Ethereum remains in the $3,400–$3,800 range.

In a case where market conditions worsen, Solana could face pressure if Firedancer experiences delays or early instability, slowing validator upgrades and weakening retail momentum. Regulatory action against memecoin platforms might cut into key revenue streams, reducing activity and staking yields. ETF flows would cool as institutions return to safer allocations.

Ethereum could struggle with L2 fragmentation and weak fee capture as sequencers compete aggressively on costs. If Bitcoin drops below $60,000 and macro conditions tighten further, Solana might retreat toward $130–$160 while Ethereum falls to $2,600–$2,900.

BIS appoints Tommaso Mancini-Griffoli to lead its Innovation Hub as it advances CBDC pilots, tokenised deposits and digital money

 

The Bank for International Settlements has chosen Tommaso Mancini-Griffoli to lead its Innovation Hub from March. 

His appointment arrives at a time when central banks are looking into major changes in payment systems, digital money frameworks and tokenised financial tools.

The BIS revealed his appointment through a formal statement. He will serve a five-year term and join the executive committee at the Switzerland-based institution. 

Mancini-Griffoli currently works at the International Monetary Fund as assistant director for the Monetary and Capital Markets Department. His role there covers payments, currencies and financial market infrastructure.

The Innovation Hub started operations in 2019. The Hub studies new financial technology that could support central banks and public institutions. It also builds prototypes, tests platforms and supplies research for ongoing digital currency projects. 

Additionally, its centres operate in Singapore, Hong Kong, London, Toronto, Stockholm, Frankfurt, Paris and Switzerland. The network has completed more than 30 projects so far and has over 20 running.

Mancini-Griffoli stands out as one of the most prominent voices on digital money inside the IMF. 

His work covers CBDCs, payment rails, settlement systems and models for regulated digital assets. He has also urged caution toward private stablecoins that lack strong oversight or safe reserves.

For cross-border payments, the use of tokens or virtual currencies is a very interesting idea. _Tommaso Mancini-Griffoli, a representative of the IMF_

He often argues that secure digital money should combine public oversight and private innovation. 

One of his most discussed ideas is the synthetic CBDC model. That model allows the private sector to issue digital money while holding central bank reserves to protect users. 

He noted that such arrangements could give private firms room to build new services while giving the system stronger safeguards.

He also supported tokenised financial instruments when they operate under clear rules. His work stresses the need for structures that protect users from liquidity issues or loss of value. 

He also often warns that poorly designed products can expose users to unnecessary risks.

The Innovation Hub runs some of the most advanced pilots involving digital currency and tokenised finance. The mBridge project links several central banks and tests cross-border CBDC settlement. 

It also aims to improve cross-border payments that often face delays or high fees.

Another project, Agora, focuses on tokenised deposits. It studies how banks could issue tokenised versions of customer deposits and settle them through shared infrastructure. 

The Hub also works on Project Nexus, a system that connects instant payment networks across countries. Nexus aims to help users send funds across borders using existing national payment systems.

Notably, all of these projects share a common trait. They look to upgrade traditional payment frameworks by using ideas inspired by blockchain technology. 

The Hub does not seek to replace public money with private tokens. Instead, it studies how modern tools can work under central bank oversight.

The BIS also welcomed a new general manager earlier this year. Pablo Hernández de Cos took over after serving as governor of the Bank of Spain. 

His term started in July and will last five years, as the organisation enters a period of leadership renewal.

Quick Facts:

XRP ($XRP) has just flipped the narrative for altcoins.

After years of ‘only Bitcoin and Ethereum matter,' $XRP ETFs have emerged as the leading altcoin product, pulling in more than $622M in eight trading days and even outpacing Solana's inflows. That isn't noise but a rotation signal.

 As capital finally moves beyond the big two cryptos, institutions are effectively curating a short list of altcoins they trust: scalable infrastructure, clear narratives, and real users.

Retail usually chases this flow late. If you saw $XRP hit $2.23 yesterday, then you've seen what happens when sentiment turns fast.

The smarter play now is asking a different question: if $XRP is the first beneficiary of this shift, which are the best altcoins to buy to catch the next wave of liquidity? That's where early-stage exposure can still offer asymmetric upside.

Below are three very different ways to position for that rotation: PEPENODE's ($PEPENODE) virtual miner, SUBBD Token's ($SUBBD) AI and Web3 creator platform, and $XRP itself, which is quietly becoming the institutional benchmark for altcoin exposure.

PEPENODE ($PEPENODE) positions itself as the world's first mine-to-earn meme coin, taking the old-school mining concept and turning it into a virtual, gamified economy on Ethereum.

Instead of buying ASICs and worrying about sky-high electricity bills, you'll be able to acquire and upgrade virtual miner nodes, then earn meme coin rewards like $PEPE and $FARTCOIN for your in-game performance.



At the core is a Virtual Mining System with tiered node rewards. As an early adopter, you can secure more powerful nodes that generate higher returns, echoing how early Bitcoin miners enjoyed outsized rewards. But here it's abstracted into an ERC-20 system without hardware or technical barriers.

Gameplay and the full dashboard go live post-TGE. In the meantime, though, you can stake your $PEPENODE for a massive 587% APY.

The presale numbers show real traction already: $2.2M already raised, with tokens currently priced at $0.0011638. That's still micro-cap territory relative to mainstream meme coins, but with clear upside if mine-to-earn becomes a recognizable sub-narrative.

Buying early lets you buy and stake during presale for boosted returns, effectively front-running future node inflation.

If you've missed earlier meme cycles or are bored with copy-paste dog coins with no mechanic beyond speculation, $PEPENODE offers a more structured, game-like path to yield.

With altcoin capital rotating into narratives with engagement, not just logos, a gamified mining economy could stand out.

🚀 Join the $PEPENODE presale today.

While $XRP captures institutional flows, SUBBD Token ($SUBBD) is targeting a very different prize: the $85B content creation industry.

The project's pitch is straightforward: most creators are trapped in Web2 rails, sharing revenue with platforms while having limited control over their data, audience, and monetization options. SUBBD merges Web3 and AI to flip that model.

On-chain, SUBBD acts as the coordination and payment layer: lower fees, crypto payouts, and token-gated access for exclusive content.

On the AI side, creators get an AI personal assistant for automated fan interactions, AI voice cloning, and even full AI influencer creation. That enables a creator to scale their presence across multiple channels without diluting brand control or giving everything to centralized platforms.

The presale metrics are already notable: $1.3M+ raised with tokens at $0.05705, plus a 20% first-year staking yield for early participants.

As a creator, you'll get a clear business vertical (creator tools) with tokenized upside and on-chain yield, rather than a vague AI narrative alone.



Holding $SUBBD also means attractive benefits for fans, including access to exclusive content, platform discounts, staking benefits, and more.

If the SUBBD team delivers on its promise and the project gains traction from both creators and fans, then the platform could have a bright future ahead of it.

The same goes for its $SUBBD token, which our SUBBD Token price prediction sees reaching a potential high of $0.48 by the end of 2026. That's about a 741% increase from its current price.

🚀 Don't delay. Join the $SUBBD presale now.

Ripple's $XRP remains the institutional altcoin benchmark, and its recent price action proves it.

Designed for fast, low-cost cross-border payments on the XRP Ledger, $XRP offers 3- to 5-second transaction finality and negligible fees, making it attractive for banks, fintechs, and liquidity providers that need reliable settlement.

This utility is now mirrored in market structure. $XRP has become the leading altcoin ETF, attracting more than $622M in inflows in just eight trading days.

That amount of inflows allowed $XRP to surpass Solana's and signaled that institutions want liquid, battle-tested assets when they step outside $BTC and $ETH.

The market reacted positively to the jump in $XRP inflows. In yesterday's trading, the cryptocurrency's value hit $2.23 after spending the past several days under $2.20. Its rebound reinforced the coin's status as a primary vehicle for altcoin exposure rather than a speculative side bet.



If you're a crypto investor, $XRP represents the blue-chip end of the current rotation, allowing you to ride institutional adoption of blockchain payments with relatively lower volatility than micro-caps.

Pairing a core $XRP position with selective bets in narratives like mine-to-earn ($PEPENODE) and AI creator platforms ($SUBBD) can therefore be a winning combination in the market's current cycle.

🚀 Buy $XRP at its current price of $2.17 on Binance.

Fact checked

By Akriti Seth

Crypto is back above the $3 trillion mark, and accompanying this flip up is the MONAD crypto surge.

Although Bitcoin and some of the best cryptos to buy have stabilized above key support levels, MONAD crypto is leading the charge. Up +40% in 24 hours, the altcoin is extending gains, building on strong gains from yesterday.



(Source: Coingecko)

For aggressive traders seeking to diversify, MONAD can be a viable option to consider. However, are there other best crypto presales to bid instead?

Monad developers are building another blockchain. 

Their goal, like other ambitious builders, is to resolve Ethereum's scaling challenges while also ensuring interoperability with the first smart contract platforms. 

Because of this interoperability, developers can deploy their dapps on Monad without code changes, taking advantage of existing infrastructure, including tools and wallets.

The Monad ICO was conducted between November 17 and 22, where 7.5 billion MON, representing +7.5% of the total supply, were distributed to the public. With each MON trading for $0.025, they raised over $200 million.

Even before this oversubscribed ICO via Coinbase's token sale platform, Monad had raised over $225M from venture capitalists, including Jump Crypto and Coinbase.

At spot rates, MON crypto is up nearly +100% from its ICO price, propelled by FOMO. Whales are loading in heavily.

Moreover, commitments to integration from LayerZero, Stargate, and Curvance, for example, also helped lift prices.

LayerZero will be live on @monad on day one, ensuring that billions in value from top assets and applications will be available for users to swap, stake, spend, and save.

From a tokenomics perspective, MON crypto could edge higher, perhaps even breaking $0.1 by the end of the year. A big chunk of MON tokens that are supposed to be in circulation, that is, from airdrops and ICO, are locked until 2026-2029.

The Monad tokenomics are an IQ test that CT is failing.

If the momentum picks up, MON USDT can easily be the next 100X crypto to consider. As Monad crypto ticks higher, smart investors are also exploring yet another crypto gem.

Bitcoin Hyper is already considered one of the best crypto presales to buy now, thanks to its ambition of scaling Bitcoin. How fast Bitcoin scales can determine adoption, especially in zones where transaction fees is crucial. 

Bitcoin Hyper developers are building a Bitcoin layer-2 platform leveraging the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) and zero-knowledge proofs for its Canonical Bridge.

Using the SVM translates to high scalability, low fees, and instant interoperability with Solana. Meanwhile, using zero-knowledge proofs means transactions, to and from the mainnet, are secure and private.

The Bitcoin Hyper presale has so far raised over $28.5M, with less than eight hours to go before the ICO closes.

The partnership not only involves technical integration but also enables joint initiatives and closer collaboration with developers, builders, and users of XDC, promoting responsible adoption and sustainable growth of the network.

Blockchain analytics firm Crystal Intelligence  has integrated the enterprise blockchain platform XDC Network into its compliance platform, significantly enhancing monitoring capabilities for the rapidly expanding real-world asset (RWA) tokenization market, which is projected to reach $16 trillion by 2030. The integration positions Crystal to provide advanced blockchain analytics for crypto compliance and risk management, delivering coverage and investigative capabilities for XDC Network unmatched by other analytics providers.

The partnership not only involves technical integration but also enables joint initiatives and closer collaboration with developers, builders, and users of XDC, promoting responsible adoption and sustainable growth of the network. Institutional clients of Crystal will now have access to transaction monitoring and compliance analytics for XDC Network, currently ranked 70th by market capitalization with over $1.3 billion in value. XDC specializes in trade finance digitization and supports transactions for over 175 enterprise applications, including tokenized U.S. Treasury bonds and trade finance instruments.

The Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region has emerged as one of the world's fastest-growing cryptocurrency markets, with transaction volumes reaching $566 billion in 2022—a 48% increase year-over-year. On-chain value in the region between July 2023 and 2024 reached $338.7 billion, representing 7.5% of global transaction volume. Crystal Intelligence has established strategic partnerships worldwide, including a Memorandum of Understanding with Dubai Police's General Department of Criminal Investigation to identify and predict economic crimes. The company's technology is trusted by leading institutional clients such as BitOasis to navigate complex regulatory environments across multiple jurisdictions.

XDC Network, which processes over 2,000 transactions per second with six-second finality and maintains ISO 20022 compliance, hosts tokenized assets such as USTY tokens backed by BlackRock-managed U.S. Treasury funds and gold-backed tokens via Tradeteq and Securitize. Recent achievements include $1 billion in Brazilian asset tokenization and becoming the first blockchain member of the Trade Finance Distribution Initiative.

“Our partnership with XDC reflects a shared belief that innovation and compliance must go hand in hand. By bringing XDC's chain into Crystal's platform, we're creating new possibilities for trusted blockchain adoption in the region. As institutional adoption of blockchain technology accelerates worldwide, comprehensive monitoring and analytics become critical for ensuring compliance and building trust.”

– Navin Gupta, CEO, Crystal Intelligence

Rebecah Dausen, Head of Ecosystem Development at XDC Network, added that the collaboration enhances compliance infrastructure as the network expands beyond trade finance applications, providing the community with access to advanced analytical tools. Founded in 2018, Crystal Intelligence continues to meet growing global demand for institutional-grade blockchain analytics driven by expanding regulatory frameworks and the increasing adoption of digital assets in traditional finance.

Every cycle, the same story plays out. Early opportunities appear, doubts creep in, and months later people watch from the sidelines as those who acted early lock in life changing gains. The sting of a missed chance usually lasts longer than the memory of a calculated risk.

Right now, BlockchainFX ($BFX) is stepping into that emotional gap just as new price action around NEAR Protocol (NEAR) has traders talking once again about the next 1000x crypto. With November in full swing and Q4 heating up, attention is shifting toward projects that combine strong utility with aggressive early entry terms, and BlockchainFX is firmly in that conversation.

When NEAR Protocol first launched near an ICO price of about $0.29, many people brushed it off or simply didn't bother to look closer. Time proved that hesitation costly. NEAR later climbed past $20, turning early community members and committed believers into quiet success stories while countless others looked back wishing they had risked even a modest amount at the start.

Today, NEAR trades around $1.91 following periods of strong market activity. Despite volatility, the project continues to demonstrate that quality assets often recover and can still create opportunities long after their launch. The bigger lesson is obvious. Crypto regularly hands out second chances, but only to those prepared to move before everyone else decides the trend is obvious.

BlockchainFX ($BFX) is built around a simple idea with large implications. Instead of forcing traders to juggle separate platforms for crypto, forex, stocks, ETFs, bonds, and index products, it aims to bring everything together inside a single, tightly integrated ecosystem. The project wants someone who trades multiple asset classes to be able to operate from one account, with one interface, powered by one core token.

The heart of this system is $BFX, which sits at the center of user engagement and daily rewards. The design philosophy focuses on real users who trade often and want both speed and clarity, not just speculative branding.

Traders today often deal with fragmented setups. One app for stocks. Another for crypto. A different platform for forex. Settlement times can lag, price gaps between marketplaces can create confusion, and user interfaces sometimes feel like they were stitched together from different eras. This mess wastes time, adds friction, and makes scaling a personal strategy more difficult than it needs to be.

BlockchainFX's best crypto presale wants to replace that experience with a single ecosystem where access to hundreds of assets is unified, execution is faster, and the learning curve is less painful. The project positions itself as a solution for people who are tired of jumping between tabs, accounts, and liquidity pools just to run a simple strategy.

Part of the excitement around BlockchainFX comes from how broad the offering is. The platform is designed to support more than five hundred assets across different markets. Users are incentivized with daily rewards paid in both $BFX and USDT, turning ongoing activity into a steady feedback loop. Up to seventy percent of platform fees are set to be redistributed back to the community, which means the more the platform grows in volume, the more value flows back to ecosystem participants.

This combination of a large asset menu, daily income potential, and real trading utility has pushed BlockchainFX into many discussions about serious presale projects, especially among those looking beyond short-lived meme pumps. Utility, not just narrative, is the main draw.

The presale metrics speak to the level of interest developing around $BFX. More than $11.4 million has already been raised. The current token price is $0.03, with the next step scheduled to rise slightly to $0.031. The projected launch price sits at $0.05. Over eighteen thousand participants have already taken part, which hints at strong early community formation before the platform even goes live.

Demand continues to grow because cross-market trading is becoming more important for active investors. Those who believe in the long term potential of a unified venue understand that early exposure to the underlying token can scale quickly if platform usage grows.

The BF70 promotion has become one of the defining talking points around BlockchainFX. By using the BF70 code, presale buyers receive an additional seventy percent in $BFX tokens on top of their standard allocation. In a month where many projects are quiet or cautious, this stands out as one of the largest and most aggressive bonus structures available.

In a down or uncertain market, this kind of offer can be game changing. Those who understand how upside is created during quieter periods see BF70 as a way to turn even a conservative deposit into a notably larger position. Buyers using the code are effectively front loading their exposure before any major price appreciation and before the broader market potentially turns more bullish.

BlockchainFX is not just relying on hype or token inflation to support its long term vision. The business model is built around multiple income streams. Trading fees form one pillar. Listing fees provide another. Subscription tiers add recurring revenue. Liquidity programs help create depth and engagement. Copy trading features, with commissions set at 1.25 percent, add yet another layer of monetization tied to actual user behavior.

By building diverse revenue channels, the project aims to reduce dependence on any single one-time event, like the presale, and instead grow as more traders use the platform over time.

The strongest regrets in crypto usually trace back to early stages that looked interesting but were ignored. NEAR Protocol is a textbook example of exactly that pattern. Now, BlockchainFX has entered the same kind of conversation.

With a current BlockchainFX presale entry at $0.03, a coming step to $0.031, and a launch price marked at $0.05, the timing is clear. The window where early buyers can accumulate at lower prices is still open, but not forever. Presale demand keeps building, and the BF70 promotion represents the most significant incentive the project has launched so far. Seventy percent extra tokens on entry is far from common. It is the kind of advantage that can turn an ordinary position into something far more powerful if the platform performs and the market eventually swings upward.

Dip conditions and quieter months do not last permanently. Many traders later point back to quiet presale periods just like this as the moments when a decisive move could have made all the difference.

Cryptocurrency investment scams perpetrated by transnational
criminal organizations (TCOs) located in Southeast Asia are on the
rise. Colloquially known as "pig-butchering" scams, TCOs
build trust with victims, convince victims to invest in real
cryptocurrency, and then con victims into transferring the real
cryptocurrency into fake cryptocurrency investments. The TCO
scammers then launder the cryptocurrency through sophisticated
methods to include the utilization of accounts that are outside of
U.S. jurisdiction. According to the U.S. Secret Service
("USSS"), "this scam industry defrauds Americans of
nearly $10 billion per year."1 Now, the U.S.
Attorney's office for the District of Columbia has announced it
has a plan to stop them.

On November 12, 2025, U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia
Jeanine Ferris Pirro announced the creation of the Scam Center
Strike Force ("Strike Force") in partnership with several
law enforcement and Federal agency partners.2 The Strike
Force's stated goal is to "secure America against
Southeast Asian cryptocurrency-related fraud and
scams"3 by recovering stolen assets used to evade
sanctions and facilitate scams and returning those assets to
victims.

The Strike Force will use civil forfeiture actions to reclaim
not just the stolen funds but also the infrastructure utilized to
facilitate the scams, such as satellite terminals used for internet
connection. While the seizure of property does require judicially
authorized warrants, subsequent civil forfeiture actions do not
require any initiation of criminal proceedings. These actions are
against the property itself and do not require the property to be
owned or in the actual custody of the perpetrators of the alleged
criminal activity at the time of the seizure. The government must
only explain in the warrant by a preponderance of the evidence, or
more likely than not, that the property is linked to criminal
activity. If the government can meet this low burden, law
enforcement officials have the authority to seize and take control
of the property for eventual forfeiture.

The DOJ's civil forfeiture authority is extremely broad and
can pose significant complications for those whose property is
seized. Property owners with no actual knowledge of the alleged
criminal activity may still lose possession of their items, which
can be difficult and time-consuming to contest, as the property
owners must both establish ownership of the property and in some
instances prove that the property was not connected to a crime.
However, proponents counter that civil forfeiture is an essential
tool in combating organized crime as the seizure of criminal
enterprises' assets and proceeds materially disrupts their
operations.

Despite their arguments to the contrary, foreign-based
cryptocurrency exchanges are not beyond the reach of U.S.
jurisdiction in the context of civil forfeiture. Statutes
empowering the Strike Force to engage in civil forfeiture, such as
the terrorism subsection of the Civil forfeiture statute,
4 explicitly extend to foreign and domestic assets. DOJ
has strong policy and enforcement incentives to use civil
forfeiture proceedings under this statute against TCOs,
particularly those designated as Foreign Terrorist
Organizations.

The Strike Force is identified and focused on Chinese-organized
crime affiliates with operations in Cambodia, Laos, and Burma as
key leaders of these cryptocurrency investment schemes. The Strike
Force has already conducted operations in Myanmar, Indonesia, and
Thailand, and has seized and forfeited over $400 million dollars in
scam-obtained cryptocurrency funds. As part of U.S. Attorney
Piro's November 12 Strike Force announcement, she noted the
Strike Force has initiated civil forfeiture proceedings seeking
another $80 million in stolen funds.

Though the Strike Force is focused on Southeast Asia, the rise
of cryptocurrency investment scams is a global trend. For example,
on November 14, 2025, the Department of Justice announced five
guilty pleas and over $15 million in civil forfeiture actions
against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea for
"multimillion-dollar virtual currency heists at four overseas
virtual currency platforms in 2023," among other
charges.5 In addition, on October 14, 2025, the DOJ
announced the largest ever forfeiture action against approximately
$15 billion in Bitcoin tied to a multinational business
conglomerate's alleged involvement in cryptocurrency investment
fraud schemes run through forced labor compounds.6 The
Bitcoin was previously stored in unhosted digital wallets whose
private keys the chairman and founder of the conglomerate had in
his possession.

Moreover, the Strike Force is aligned with a broader shift in
U.S. strategy for addressing cryptocurrency scams. In April 2025,
U.S. Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche published a memorandum
titled "Ending Regulation by Prosecution," which outlined
the DOJ's approach to digital asset enforcement under the Trump
Administration.7 Blanche stated that the DOJ would
"focus on prosecuting individuals who victimize digital asset
investors, or those who use digital assets in furtherance of
criminal offenses such as terrorism, narcotics and human
trafficking, organized crime, hacking, and cartel and gang
financing."8 Further, DOJ prosecutors would start
prioritizing cases "that hold accountable individuals who (a)
cause financial harm to digital asset investors and consumers;
and/or (b) use digital assets in furtherance of other criminal
conduct."9 The Strike Force is a clear step in this
direction.

Corporations operating in sectors related to cryptocurrency or
any companies dealing in large sums of digital assets on foreign
exchanges should consider the creation of the Strike Force a
warning sign that their assets may be at risk of being frozen even
absent direct criminal exposure. Notably, the laws authorizing the
Strike Force's activity can be applied to persons that arguably
facilitate violations or are strictly liable, including situations
where the person "should have known" that they were
facilitating a violation.

Given the heightened enforcement risk, those in the
cryptocurrency space should engage in the following best
practices:

The molecular mechanisms that enable memories to persist over long timescales from days to weeks and months are still poorly understood1. Here, to develop insights into this process, we created a behavioural task in which mice formed multiple memories but only consolidated some, while forgetting others, over the span of weeks. We then monitored circuit-specific molecular programs that diverged between consolidated and forgotten memories. We identified multiple distinct waves of transcription, that is, cellular macrostates, in the thalamocortical circuit that defined memory persistence. Of note, a small set of transcriptional regulators orchestrated broad molecular programs that enabled entry into these macrostates. Targeted CRISPR-knockout studies revealed that although these transcriptional regulators had no effects on memory formation, they had prominent, causal and strikingly time-dependent roles in memory stabilization. In particular, the calmodulin-dependent transcription factor CAMTA1 was required for initial memory maintenance over days, whereas the transcription factor TCF4 and the histone methyltransferase ASH1L were required later to maintain memory over weeks. These results identify a critical CAMTA1–TCF4–ASH1L thalamocortical transcriptional cascade that is required for memory stabilization and put forth a model in which the sequential recruitment of circuit-specific transcriptional programs enables memory maintenance over progressively longer timescales.

Researchers found that when a molecule displaces trapped water, the energy that the water leaves behind allows the molecule to create stronger bonds.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

Whether in the form of flowing rivers, undulating waves, or raindrops streaking down a car window, water almost always seems to be in motion. But what would happen if it was trapped to the point that it was completely unable to move?

It is possible for liquid water to be immobilized, but things get weird when it happens. When confined to the especially tight spaces between molecules, it can start behaving strangely, and how exactly it interacts with those molecules its trapped between was unknown. This was the puzzle that chemist Frank Biedermann from the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) in Germany wanted to solve. In an attempt to end the debate over whether trapped water coexists with its surrounding molecules or is involved in their interactions, he and his research team studied the behavior of trapped water through computer simulations—and found something surprising.

Water trapped between molecules is highly energetic despite not being able to move, but that changes as soon as another molecule enters the scene and the water is displaced. With so much pent-up energy, the water zooms out of the space it was occupying, pushing the new molecule in. And as it turns out, the energy it releases is intense enough to actually strengthen the connection between the new molecule and the empty space it is now filling. It also strengthens the bonds between the original molecule and the other molecules it bonds with—though how strong that bond becomes depends on the type of substance with which the water is interacting.

“The present computational analysis of simplified host-guest systems clearly shows that binding affinities are strongly influenced by the thermodynamic properties of the water displaced from binding sites,” Biedermann said in a study recently published in the journal Angewandte Chemie. “These thermodynamic properties of water and the associated favorability of water displacement vary strongly with the chemical nature of the host [molecule].”

Think of this phenomenon like a crowded subway car at rush hour, when every seat and space to stand is taken. Passengers are going to be eager to get out as soon as humanly possible, and an onrush of people will pour out onto the platform when the doors finally open, allowing for different people to claim every available seat or place to stand before the train takes off again. The initial group of passengers is like the water molecule. Once they escape, they leave an empty car for the second group to squeeze themselves into, and seeing how much free space exists on the platform may have them frantically pushing past everyone else.

While no physical transfer of energy happens on a subway, it could be argued that people streaming out the doors could be incentive for those waiting to board to rush in and grab a seat as soon as possible before only standing room is left. And the whole thing gets kicked up to 11 at rush hour. Likewise, highly energetic water can release more or less energy depending on how much energy it has to begin with and what kind of molecule is incoming, acting as a binding force for the new molecule. Water that has more energy to release and interacts with the right molecule acts like those rush hour crowds.

Biedermann's discovery could have applications far beyond figuring out the physics and chemistry of trapped water behavior. Strengthening bonds between molecules this way could ultimately create stronger medications and materials. If water is found to be trapped between proteins in a medication, scientists can develop a formula that allows for specific active molecules to displace that water and take advantage of the binding force its energy offers. Enhanced bonds would then make the treatment more effective.

“The concepts developed here are applicable to other macromolecular host molecules,” the researchers said. “Thus, [they] can be broadly useful to explain observations and guide the design of pharmaceutical drugs and supramolecular systems.”

CAR T cells (pictured) are being used to treat autoimmune diseases.Credit: Eye Of Science/SPL

Engineered immune cells are being used to successfully treat people with a range of debilitating autoimmune conditions, such as ulcerative colitis, rheumatoid arthritis and lupus. Researchers say positive results from around a dozen studies over the past three years suggest CAR-T-cell therapy could eventually be used to treat any disease in which the immune system attacks the body.

CAR-T-cell therapy exploits the immune system's T cells that fight off infection: these cells are collected from a person and tweaked to produce proteins called chimeric antigen receptors. They are then reintroduced into the body to target antigens expressed by B cells, another type of immune cell. In autoimmune disorders, these B cells make antibodies that attack the body's own healthy tissues.

The use of the therapy for immune conditions has exploded since 2021, when a 20-year-old woman in Germany with severe lupus became the first person with an autoimmune disorder to be treated with CAR T cells1. Clinician–researcher David Simon, who was involved in that treatment2, says the CAR-T therapies have since entered phase I and II clinical trials for autoimmune conditions including systemic sclerosis, myositis and rheumatoid arthritis. Phase III trials are also under way for lupus and myasthenia gravis, a condition that causes weakness in the muscles that are used to breathe, swallow and see.

Simon, who focuses on rheumatoid arthritis at the Charité University Hospital in Berlin, says people in CAR-T-cell therapy trials for rheumatoid arthritis and lupus seem to be ‘cured'. “They lose their autoantibodies which trigger the disease, and they don't have any symptoms any more,” he adds. “This is something totally new which we didn't observe before.”

CAR-T-cell therapy has become a routine treatment for several types of cancer since it was first approved to treat blood cancers in 2017.

Ulcerative colitis, a condition that affects the colon and causes stomach pain, ulcers and bloody diarrhoea, is one of the latest diseases in which CAR-T-cell therapy has shown promise.

In September, gastroenterologist Markus Neurath and his colleagues at the University Hospital Erlangen in Germany, reported using CAR T cells to treat a 21-year-old woman with ulcerative colitis3. After the treatment, she showed signs of remission that persisted for 14 weeks, no longer needed medication and could return to work. “The result was quite amazing,” adds Neurath. His team plans to test the treatment in a few more people before proceeding to a controlled clinical trial involving many individuals.

Earlier this year, Bing Du, an immunologist at East China Normal University in Shanghai, and his team published the results of a CAR-T pilot study using immune cells from a donor to treat drug-resistant lupus4. Donor-derived cells could act like a generic version of CAR-T treatment that could be mass-produced, cutting manufacturing time and lowering costs5. Last year, Du was also involved in a world-first study of bioengineered and modified immune cells from a donor for the treatment of two rare and severe autoimmune diseases6.

As part of the latest study, four women with a form of lupus that affects multiple organs received chemotherapy to reduce levels of their white blood cells, followed by an infusion of donor-derived CAR T cells. After three months, the women no longer experienced symptoms such as arthritis, swelling of blood vessels and alopecia, and one was in remission and no longer needed any medication. The other three women received low-dose steroids as a maintenance therapy.

The results of the trial were “much better than we could imagine”, says Du, and might be due to CAR T cells triggering the total depletion of dysfunctional B cells that attack the body's tissues. “The immune system had to reset not only B cells, but also the rest of the immune system,” he adds, potentially allowing new, healthy B cells to replace the dysfunctional cells.

Industrial and agricultural chemicals such as pesticides are often considered to have restricted biological activity. Yet, there are concerns regarding their broader toxicity range and impact on human gut microbiota. Here we report a systematic in vitro screening to assess the impact of 1,076 pollutants, spanning diverse chemistries and indicated applications, on 22 prevalent gut bacteria. Our investigation uncovered 588 inhibitory interactions involving 168 chemicals, the majority of which were not previously reported to have antibacterial properties. Fungicides and industrial chemicals showed the largest impact, with around 30% exhibiting anti-gut-bacterial properties. We demonstrate that the scale of our dataset enables a machine learning approach for predicting the antibacterial activity of pesticides. Mechanistically, chemical–genetic screens using transposon mutant libraries of Parabacteroides merdae and Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron implicated genes involved in conserved efflux pathways, including the acrR locus, as mediators of pollutant resistance. We also found that loss-of-function mutations in genes coding for metabolic enzymes were selected under pollutant exposure, including those for branched short-chain fatty acid biosynthesis under tetrabromobisphenol A, a flame retardant. Taken together, our results suggest that the antibacterial activity of chemical pollutants should be considered in future studies on the microbiome and the emergence of antimicrobial resistance, as well as in toxicological assessments.

Synthetic chemicals have become indispensable for agriculture and industry. Their pervasive use and environmental persistence have led to pollution levels exceeding the planetary boundary for stable and resilient Earth systems1,2,3. Pesticide pollutants are of particular concern, with the Food and Drug Administration and European Food Safety Authority documenting hundreds of different pesticide residues in food4,5, as well as broader water contamination6,7. Industrial chemicals, such as per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs), plasticizers, surface coatings and dyes, also routinely enter food and water via environmental pollution, agricultural application or industrial processing8.

The contamination of food and water by chemical pollutants potentially exposes the human gastrointestinal tract, through passage and enterohepatic circulation, to thousands of xenobiotic compounds9. Over 95% of Americans and nearly the entire Dutch population are estimated to have detectable levels of PFASs in their blood10,11. In a UK cohort, all tested urine samples showed detectable levels of pesticides, such as cypermethrin and permethrin (>96% samples), diethylphosphate (75% samples) and glyphosate (53% samples)12. Similarly, a German mother cohort study found hundreds of chemicals derived from consumer goods, cosmetics and food in plasma, reaching up to micromolar concentrations13. These studies indicate that the gut microbiota—a community of hundreds of microbial species—is probably exposed to numerous chemicals. Yet, little is known about the impact of agricultural and industrial chemical contaminants on gut bacteria.

Chemicals such as pesticides are usually marketed with a narrow definition of target organisms (for example, as insecticides, herbicides or fungicides). Yet, many chemicals have been reported to show off-purpose activity on non-target organisms, including soil bacteria14 and pathogens15. A small number of pesticides and industrial chemicals have also been shown to impact human and animal gut microbiota12,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24. More broadly, human-targeted drugs have also been shown to impact gut bacterial growth and metabolism25,26. Collectively, these studies indicate that many pesticides and other chemical pollutants might exhibit inhibitory activity against gut bacteria. However, safety assessments for these chemicals currently do not consider the human gut microbiome.

In vivo assessment of the impact of chemicals on gut bacteria is currently not possible due to the lack of systematic and quantitative data on chemical exposure. Furthermore, disentangling the effects of chemicals from other factors such as diet and medications is not possible without mechanistic knowledge of direct chemical–bacteria interactions27,28. We therefore conducted a large-scale in vitro screen assessing the anti-gut-bacterial effect of 1,076 chemical pollutants, including pesticides, pesticide metabolites and industrial chemicals. The screen uncovered numerous growth inhibitory interactions, particularly with fungicides and industrial chemicals. We further used chemical–genetic screens to identify mechanisms of bacterial susceptibility to chemicals that overlap with antibiotic resistance. Our study expands the knowledgebase on xenobiotic toxicity in bacteria and demonstrates the feasibility of computational prediction using machine learning on chemical structures.

To systematically assess the impact of chemical contaminants, we used a large library of 1,076 compounds that are likely to enter food and water (Extended Data Fig. 1a). The library includes 829 pesticides (mainly herbicides, insecticides and fungicides), along with compounds targeting other organisms, including spiders, nematodes, bacteria and rodents. It also contains 119 known pesticide metabolites formed by biotransformation29 and 75 pesticide-related compounds (precursors, breakdown products, chemical isomers or formulation products). In addition, the library contains 48 industrial chemicals, such as the widespread contaminants bisphenols and nitrosamines, and five mycotoxins found in mould-contaminated foods. Several compounds are considered to be persistent organic pollutants, such as PFASs and the insecticides dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT, also known as clofenotane) and chlordecone. Overall, the library spans 291 out of 352 pesticide classes in the British Crop Production Council Pesticide Compendium and 87% of compounds reported in a study of pesticide discharge from rivers into oceans6. The library, together with extensive metadata (Supplementary Data 1), constitutes a resource for systematic investigation of the impact of chemical pollutants on biological systems.

We performed the chemical–bacteria screen at 20 μM concentration for all compounds. This dose was chosen for consistency with previous xenobiotic screens25,30,31, thus enabling direct comparison. To contextualize this dose, we analysed xenobiotic plasma concentrations from a recent study13. In 305 of 592 samples, at least one xenobiotic was observed at a concentration of 10 μM or higher. Among the measured xenobiotics, spinosyn A, melamine, mepiquat, acrylamide and amitrole, all of which are present in our compound library, most frequently surpassed 2 μM in plasma (45, 40, 39, 34 and 33 samples, respectively). Pharmacokinetic studies suggest that colonic concentrations tend to be in the same range or higher than in the plasma25,32. The relevance of micromolar-range doses is further supported by the food regulatory limits of some chemicals33. Furthermore, chemicals such as the antiparasitic closantel have been found in dairy products at micromolar levels34,35.

Next, we assessed the impact of all 1,076 compounds in the library on the growth of 22 commensal gut bacterial strains belonging to 21 species (Fig. 1a,b). These strains were selected based on their abundance and prevalence in the healthy human gut microbiota, as well as phylogenetic and metabolic representation (Supplementary Data 2)36,37. All strains were grown anaerobically at 37 °C in mGAM broth, a rich medium designed to support the growth of a maximum number of strains. Bacterial growth was monitored for 24 h and quantified as the area under the growth curve (AUC). We defined growth inhibition hits as chemical–bacteria interactions featuring a growth decrease of >20% and a false-discovery-rate adjusted P value (Padj) < 0.05. Only hits identified in at least two out of three biological replicates are considered (Supplementary Data 3 and Extended Data Fig. 1b).

a, Workflow of high-throughput screening to test the susceptibility of gut bacteria against industrial and agricultural chemicals. Monocultures were grown in mGAM medium with 20 μM of each compound (n = 3 experiments on independent days). Growth curves were recorded and the AUC relative to DMSO controls was used as a fitness proxy. b, High-throughput growth screening results for 22 gut bacterial strains. Significant pollutant chemical–strain interactions, where the growth of a specific strain was inhibited versus the DMSO control, are highlighted with a coloured bar (Padj < 0.05; >20% reduction in AUC; two out of three independent replicates significant). The data are grouped and coloured by compound class. ‘Others' refers to compounds not assigned to any of the classes shown. Note that in rare cases a single compound can belong to more than one compound class. The phylum, abundance and prevalence of strains are displayed in coloured and greyscale bars, and the Gram stain and number of compounds that inhibit growth are shown in parentheses after each strain name. c–e, Distributions of the number of inhibitory bacterial interactions (hits) per compound (c) and bacterial strain (d), and the strength of growth inhibition, shown as mean normalized AUC values of hits(e). f, Independent validation screen.

Source data

Around one-sixth of the tested chemicals (168) were inhibitory against at least one bacterial strain (Fig. 1c). The most sensitive taxa were Bacteroidales, especially Parabacteroides distasonis, whereas Escherichia coli, Fusobacterium nucleatum subspecies animalis and Akkermansia muciniphila were the least sensitive species (Fig. 1b,d). The chemical categories featuring prevalent anti-gut-bacterial activity (at least one in five compounds) were fungicides, industrial chemicals and acaricides (Fig. 1b). Although most compounds were inhibitory against a few strains, indicating a narrow spectrum of activity, 24 chemicals showed broad toxicity, inhibiting more than one-third of the species tested (Extended Data Fig. 2b). Broad-spectrum inhibitory compounds include closantel (a livestock antiparasitic; 19 strains), tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA; a brominated flame retardant; 19 strains), chlordecone (an insecticide; 17 strains), bisphenol AF (BPAF; used in plastics; 12 strains), fluazinam (a fungicide; nine strains) and emamectin benzoate (an insecticide; 13 strains).

Around 150 chemical–bacteria interactions featured >90% growth reduction, uncovering strong anti-gut-bacterial activity for 33 compounds (Fig. 1e). To test whether the inhibitory activity was retained at lower concentrations, we tested 11 pesticides against eight bacteria across multiple concentrations (Fig. 1f and Supplementary Data 4). Independently purchased compounds were used to account for any errors associated with batch variations and large-scale library preparations. Most interactions from the main screen were also observed in this independent experiment (72%; 23 out of 32; Extended Data Fig. 1c,d), which is the expected range considering the physiological idiosyncrasies of non-model bacteria38. Many compounds show strong inhibitory effects at substantially lower concentrations than those tested in the main screen. For example, imazalil sulfate, closantel and prochloraz inhibit Eubacterium rectale, a prevalent species that produces the health-associated metabolite butyrate39, at a concentration as low as 2.5 µM. Together, our systematic assessment revealed hundreds of chemical–bacteria interactions, including contaminants with broad and potent anti-gut-bacterial activity.

The off-target activity of chemicals against gut bacteria has been reported for >1,000 human-targeted drugs and antibiotics by Maier et al.25,30. As in the case of therapeutic drugs, we observed a positive correlation between the number of compounds affecting a species and its relative abundance in human microbiomes (Spearman's rank correlation (ρ) = 0.57; P = 0.005) (Fig. 2a), but none with prevalence (Fig. 2b). Thus, chemicals with broad- as well as narrow-spectrum activity are likely to influence microbiome composition due to their impact on abundant taxa. Strains sensitive to many chemical pollutants were also sensitive to many therapeutic drugs tested by Maier et al. (ρ = 0.63; P = 0.009) (Fig. 2c). Pollutant sensitivity correlated more strongly with human-targeted drugs (ρ = 0.66; P = 0.004) than with antibiotics (⍴ = 0.33; P = 0.19) (Fig. 2d), which is consistent with the broader-spectrum activity of antibiotics. The correlation between chemical pollutants in our screen and human-targeted drugs supports that gut bacteria interact with diverse chemicals via common and non-specific mechanisms25,28,40.

Chemical susceptibility profiles of bacterial species grouped clearly by evolutionary relatedness (that is, by phylum; Fig. 2e), with most compounds showing phylum-level differences in toxicity (Extended Data Fig. 2a). For example, some Firmicutes were uniquely sensitive to conazole fungicides, including the widely used imazalil and prochloraz. This indicates a shared genetic basis for toxicity and suggests that chemical susceptibility data could help to predict effects on related bacterial species for in silico toxicological assessments.

We next investigated how species-level chemical effects translate in bacterial communities using a synthetic community of 20 gut bacteria (Com20)38 (Methods and Supplementary Data 5). Com20 is a phylogenetically and functionally diverse community, spanning six phyla, 11 families and 17 genera, collectively encoding >60% of the metabolic pathways present in healthy human gut microbiomes. Members of the community grow together stably and reproducibly in mGAM38—the growth medium used in our screen. The Com20 was transferred twice in fresh growth medium before being challenged with BPAF or TBBPA, two broad-spectrum anti-gut-bacterial chemicals. In the case of TBBPA, the community was dominated by Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, despite its susceptibility in monoculture. BPAF induced compositional changes concordant with monoculture effects (Fig. 2f), including decreased relative abundances of B. thetaiotaomicron, Bacteroides uniformis, Parabacteroides merdae and Roseburia intestinalis, and increased abundances of insensitive species (that is, Collinsella aerofaciens, Coprococcus comes and Streptococcus salivarius). Yet, F. nucleatum and E. rectale were protected against BPAF in the community (Fig. 2g).

Community-level effects, such as cross-protection, have been described in gut bacterial communities exposed to therapeutic drugs and could partly be attributed to compound bioaccumulation31,41. We hypothesized that cross-protection against BPAF in Com20 is due to bioaccumulation, as this has been observed in Bacteroidales monocultures42. We measured BPAF concentrations in whole culture, supernatant and pellets of Com20 cultures exposed to 20 µM BPAF using liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS). We detected a 64% reduction in BPAF in supernatant compared with whole culture and recovered BPAF in the pellet (Fig. 2h), indicating that most of BPAF in Com20 is sequestered within cells, explaining cross-protection of some community members.

Large-scale surveys of xenobiotic–bacteria interactions, combined with computational analyses, could enable in silico toxicity predictions43. However, accurate prediction requires sufficient data spanning the relevant chemical space. To assess this, we compared the extended-connectivity fingerprints (ECFPs) of our pollutant library with those of previously characterized pharmaceutical drugs25 and 250,000 random PubChem compounds.

Pollutants and pharmaceutical drugs were widely dispersed in uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) space (Fig. 3a), indicating large chemical diversity for both groups. Notably, pollutants and drugs did not form clear clusters, and only six pollutants had a Tanimoto similarity to drugs of >0.75, highlighting limited molecular fingerprint overlap between the two libraries44,45 (Fig. 3b). This suggested that labels such as ‘pesticide' or ‘pharmaceutical drugs' do not capture the molecular basis of anti-gut-bacterial toxicity. To quantify how well pollutant and drug libraries jointly span the chemical space, we noted the Tanimoto similarity of each PubChem compound to its closest match in the libraries. This was significantly increased in the combined library (P < 2.2 × 10−16; Kolmogorov–Smirnov test; Extended Data Fig. 3a), indicating broader chemical-space coverage towards predicting the impact of novel compounds.

The two compound sets are structurally diverse and distinct, as only very few (six) compounds from the library used in this study had a similarity to a drug from ref. 25 of >0.75 (dashed line). Compounds shared between the two studies (n = 32; mostly veterinary drugs) were excluded from this analysis. c, Machine learning workflow to predict species-specific xenobiotic toxicity from molecular descriptors and embedded features.

Source data

To probe the utility of increased chemical-space coverage, we employed machine learning for predicting the anti-gut-bacterial activity of chemicals. We used two datasets: pesticides from our pollutant screen and the drug screen by Maier et al. (Fig. 3c). For each compound, we obtained a comprehensive set of structural features, including molecular fingerprints (Chemistry Development Kit) and deep-learning-based feature embeddings from MoLFormer46. The latter is a deep learning model trained on 1.1 billion molecules to predict a wide range of chemical properties, such as substructures, from simplified molecular input line entry system (SMILES) strings. To avoid excessively imbalanced groups for machine learning modelling, we chose seven species that showed >20 hits in both pollutant and drug datasets. Random forest classifier models were trained and evaluated using cross-validation with stratified splits. Classifications were obtained by thresholding probability outputs at the hit frequency of the training dataset—a strategy suitable for imbalanced datasets47.

We evaluated models using two metrics appropriate for imbalanced datasets: balanced accuracy (the mean of sensitivity and specificity) and average precision (the area under the precision-recall curve)48. Models trained and tested on pesticides alone achieved good performance when predicting pesticide toxicity (average balanced accuracy = 0.77; average precision = 0.65; 20× cross-validation; Fig. 3d). Performance varied slightly between species, with the best results obtained for E. rectale (balanced accuracy = 0.8; average precision = 0.73) and the weakest predictions for B. thetaiotaomicron (balanced accuracy = 0.73; average precision = 0.52). Training models on only molecular descriptor features (that is, excluding MoLFormer embeddings) slightly improved the performance (balanced accuracy = 0.81; average precision = 0.72), indicating that this smaller feature set is sufficient for predictions. Analysis of feature importance (Extended Data Fig. 3) identified molecular features implicated in antibacterial activity. Although a model trained and tested on the combined pesticide–drug dataset showed similar performance, cross-predictions from one dataset to another showed poorer performance (approximate balanced accuracy = 0.7; average precision = 0.2). This indicates that pesticides and drugs are overall different in both chemical and activity space (Fig. 3a). The pesticide toxicity against gut bacteria thus could not have been predicted based on previously available data.

Given the high sensitivity of Bacteroidales to pollutant compounds (Fig. 2a and Extended Data Fig. 2a), we aimed to investigate mechanisms of interaction in species of this order. We used a pooled transposon mutant library of P. merdae49 to identify genes that modulate the impact of xenobiotics on bacterial fitness. The library encompasses barcoded transposon insertion mutants (Tn mutants) of >3,000 non-essential genes, enabling a genome-wide functional analysis. We conducted the competition assay against a panel of ten chemicals. TBBPA, BPAF, imazalil sulfate, fluazinam, closantel and emamectin benzoate were tested at concentrations of ≤20 μM, whereas glyphosate, propiconazole, perfluorooctanoic acid and perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA) were tested at ≥20 μM to ensure sufficient selective pressure (Methods). Cultures inoculated with the pooled library were grown to the early stationary phase, and Tn mutant selection was quantified using barcoded transposon sequencing (TnBarSeq) (Supplementary Data 6).

Gene hits were defined by an absolute log2[fold change] in mutant abundance of >0.25 and Padj < 0.05, relative to end-point vehicle dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) or media controls. The abundance changes were not attributed to global differences in cell doublings (Extended Data Fig. 4a)50. Among the compounds tested at ≤20 μM, TBBPA, BPAF and closantel exhibited the strongest effects in library selection, whereas 500 μM PFNA showed the most hits overall. In contrast, 20 μM PFNA, 20 μM perfluorooctanoic acid and 50 μM glyphosate did not show significant hits, consistent with the lack of effect on growth at those concentrations (Extended Data Fig. 4b).

Closantel, an anthelmintic, caused the strongest selection, with >90% of Tn mutants carrying insertions across over 20 different positions of the coding and promoter regions of the gene NQ542_01170 (Fig. 4a and Supplementary Data 7). This gene encodes a transcriptional regulator homologous to the efflux repressor acrR from B. uniformis and is co-located with tolC and RND-efflux genes, with conserved synteny51. Notably, acrR Tn mutants were also the top hit under TBBPA, a flame retardant, with >100-fold enrichment compared with the DMSO control, but were not enriched under any other pollutants (Fig. 4b,e).

Curves for two independent insertion strains are shown, each with two replicates. Tn, transposon.

Source data

To further characterize acrR Tn mutant phenotypes, we isolated strains with transposon insertions at seven distinct positions within acrR coding and promoter regions after growth on closantel or TBBPA. All Tn::acrR isolates showed resistance to both chemicals, regardless of the compound they were isolated on (Fig. 4c and Extended Data Fig. 5c). When further evaluating two Tn::acrR strains, we observed an eightfold increase in the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for closantel compared with the wild-type strain. Consistent with previous reports linking loss of acrR function to ciprofloxacin resistance in diverse bacteria52, we observed an up to 16-fold increase in the ciprofloxacin MIC for P. merdae Tn::acrR mutants compared with the wild type (Fig. 4d and Supplementary Data 8). Therefore, resistance to closantel and TBBPA can lead to cross-resistance to antibiotics such as ciprofloxacin.

The differential enrichment of acrR Tn mutants suggests a degree of specificity in the efflux of chemicals and/or that efflux alone is insufficient in tackling the other chemicals. However, some transporter Tn mutants showed broad pollutant sensitivity, indicating common pollutant tolerance mechanisms in P. merdae. For example, strains with insertions in genes of the fadL family of hydrophobic compound transporters (NQ542_07320 and NQ542_08455) were prevalent negative fitness hits across seven xenobiotics, whereas insertion mutants of the RND multidrug efflux locus NQ542_06240–50 were a significant hit across five chemicals (Extended Data Fig. 4c). Other common negative fitness hits were Tn mutants of the genes encoding components of the F0F1 ATP synthase complex (Fig. 4e), the loss of function of which has been associated with increased sensitivity to polymyxin antibiotics under anaerobic conditions53. This is consistent with bisphenol exposure leading to overexpression of F0F1 ATP synthase subunits in B. thetaiotaomicron23. The strains with Tn insertions in a gene encoding the putative lipid A phosphoethanolamine transferase of the eptA gene family (NQ542_04035) showed increased sensitivity in half of the tested xenobiotics. This enzyme class often mediates polymyxin resistance via modifications in membrane polarity54. Overall, genes implicated in efflux and membrane homeostasis modulated P. merdae survival following diverse xenobiotic challenges.

To assess whether the involvement of transporters in xenobiotic response is broadly conserved in the order Bacteroidales, we evaluated mutants of B. thetaiotaomicron, a member of a family distant to that of P. merdae55. We tested closantel, TBBPA, PFNA and BPAF on a curated subset of 185 transporter insertion mutants from the B. thetaiotaomicron arrayed transposon loss-of-function mutant library56. Growth was monitored over 24 h and we evaluated the response of each Tn insertion mutant by calculating the normalized relative AUC (nrAUC), comparing the xenobiotic treatment with the DMSO control (Extended Data Fig. 6a and Supplementary Data 9). The strongest growth reduction for closantel was observed at 2 and 10 μM for the Tn mutant of BT2687 encoding an RND-efflux pump (Fig. 4f and Extended Data Fig. 6b). This gene is part of an acrR-RND-tolC locus homologous to the P. merdae Tn::acrR closantel hit, suggesting a conserved efflux response (Extended Data Fig. 6c). Additional Tn mutants with conditional growth reduction on closantel included the co-localized genes BT0562 and BT0563, which encode multidrug ABC transporter genes. Loss-of-function Tn mutants of BT2687, BT0562 and BT0563 have previously been linked to increased susceptibility to antibiotics and biocides in B. thetaiotaomicron57. Exposure to 250 and 100 μM PFNA inhibited the Tn mutants with insertions at BT3337 and BT3338, which encode an RND-efflux pump needed for biofilm formation58, and tolerance to fusidic acid, chlorpromazine and thioridazine57 (Fig. 4f). The top homology and synteny matches for BT3337 and BT3338 in P. merdae are the RND-encoding loci NQ542_09525–35, which were a specific negative fitness hit for PFNA in the pooled screen (Extended Data Fig. 6d). As PFNA can be bioaccumulated by several Bacteroidales42, we assessed whether the phenotypes of Tn::BT3337 and Tn::BT3338 could be caused by increased compound uptake. Testing PFNA bioaccumulation across concentrations with LC–MS/MS showed no differences (Extended Data Fig. 6e,f and Supplementary Data 11), indicating other membrane-related mechanisms. Overall, the shared responses between P. merdae and B. thetaiotaomicron support conserved mechanisms of pollutant and antibiotic tolerance across Bacteroidales.

P. merdae TnBarSeq insertion mutant gene hits showed enrichment in various Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) metabolic pathways for most (seven) of the compounds tested. TBBPA 20-μM selection showed a significant enrichment of Tn mutants mapping in the branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) degradation pathway (Extended Data Fig. 4d). The second top locus for positive selection under TBBPA was the porA catabolic gene cluster, containing four genes with Tn insertions with >30-fold enrichment (Extended Data Fig. 4e). This pathway is involved in the degradation of BCAAs into branched short-chain fatty acids59. Qiao et al.59 reported on a P. merdae porA mutant (with deletion of the NQ542_07740 gene, encoding pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase) with loss of its beneficial probiotic property of preventing atherosclerosis in mice. PorA is present in several gut bacteria and conserved across Gram-positive and -negative bacteria, including Clostridium sporogenes, where it contributes to immunomodulation60,61. The next top hit for positive selection under TBBPA was a gene encoding a putative BCAA aminotransferase (greater than tenfold enrichment; NQ542_03725). This gene encodes a close homologue of B. fragilis BF9343-3671 (74% identity; 100% coverage), whose knockout mutant stops producing immunomodulatory branched-chain α-galactosylceramide lipids, impacting colonic natural killer T cell regulation in monocolonized mice62. Besides TBBPA, NQ542_03725 mutants also show enrichment under 500 μM PFNA, 20 μM BPAF and 20 μM fluazinam, and the porA gene cluster is also selected under 500 μM PFNA and 20 μM BPAF (Fig. 4e). If these xenobiotics select for the loss of bacterial biosynthesis of BCAA-derived beneficial metabolites such as branched short-chain fatty acids and α-galactosylceramides in vivo, they could further impact human health via gut–heart or gut–immune axes.

Loss-of-function Tn insertion mutants of the secondary metabolism genes NQ542_07535–55 were positively selected under 500 μM PFNA challenge (~16-fold enrichment), but were negative fitness hits under 20 μM TBBPA (Fig. 4e). These genes were identified as being part of a putative inositol lipid biosynthetic gene cluster by homology to B. thetaiotaomicron genes (BT_1522–6) (Fig. 4g). This gene cluster is widespread in Bacteroidetes, and loss of inositol lipid production is associated with changes in the cell capsule and increased resistance to antimicrobial peptides63. To validate the phenotype, we isolated two P. merdae mutants (with transposon insertions at two locations of the gene NQ542_07540, which encodes putative phosphatidylinositol phosphate phosphatase) after enrichment in 500 μM PFNA. These strains showed increased resistance to PFNA and hypersensitivity to TBBPA at a range of concentrations, in agreement with pooled fitness (Fig. 4h and Extended Data Fig. 5d,e). To evaluate whether the increased resistance to PFNA was due to differences in compound uptake, we tested PFNA bioaccumulation, but no growth-independent differences were seen (Extended Data Fig. 5f), indicating the accumulation-independent function of inositol lipid metabolism in PFNA resistance. In summary, our genetic screen suggests that loss-of-function mutations affecting accessory metabolic pathways might be selected for under xenobiotic exposure, potentially altering the metabolic output of the gut microbiota.

Our study uncovered 588 inhibitory interactions between 168 chemicals of concern and common human gut bacteria. Most of these chemicals had not been previously reported to have antibacterial properties. Fungicides and industrial chemicals showed the largest impact, with around 30% exhibiting anti-gut-bacterial activity. For example, although conazole fungicides inhibit ergosterol synthesis, a biochemical pathway unique to fungi, they inhibited some Firmicutes—prominent members of the human gut microbiota. The extent of interactions identified in our study, together with the immense genetic diversity of the gut microbiome64, suggest that the microbiome may harbour vastly more potential xenobiotic targets than was previously appreciated.

The prevalence of the inhibitory activities of chemical pollutants revealed by our screen, together with those of human-targeted drugs25,40, challenge the categorical labelling of chemicals into antibiotics, human-targeted drugs, industrial chemicals and pesticides. The antibacterial activity of many xenobiotics is currently not accounted for in assessments of their potential adverse impacts, and toxicity studies are typically set up in ways that are incompatible with capturing gut microbiota effects (Extended Data Fig. 7). To address this gap, toxicology assessment could incorporate tests in single gut bacteria, synthetic communities and gut-on-chip models65. Nevertheless, the vast numbers of chemicals in use and the fast pace at which new molecules are brought to market will make it difficult to implement meaningful experimental assessment for all compounds. Towards tackling this, our study demonstrates the feasibility of computational toxicity predictions that can be used at scale and for safe-by-design product development. This proof-of-concept was possible due to the here-expanded coverage of the chemical space, underscoring the need for standardized chemical–bacteria screens.

Our genetic screens using non-model, yet prevalent, gut bacteria provide mechanistic insights into how bacteria maintain fitness under chemical stressors and indicate potential molecular targets. We observe compound-dependent reliance on particular efflux pumps and their regulators for survival in the presence of pollutants. Regulation of efflux pumps stands out as a mechanism conserved between P. merdae and B. thetaiotaomicron, spanning different Bacteroidales families. This remarkable conservation, together with the previous observation from E. coli genetic screens showing the importance of efflux against human-targeted drugs25,40,66, reinforces the key role of efflux as a general chemical defence mechanism. This mechanistically supports the idea of a general resistant phenotype and that xenobiotics could lead to collateral resistance to antibiotics67. In our study, genetic selection against two persistent pollutants—the flame retardant TBBPA and the anthelmintic closantel—resulted in resistance to the antibiotic ciprofloxacin.

Genetic selection in P. merdae is enriched for catabolic and biosynthetic genes, suggesting that metabolism plays a fundamental role in response to xenobiotic stress. This enrichment is reminiscent of the prevalence of metabolism-related gene hits observed for non-antibiotic drug screens in E. coli 40. In our study, loss-of-function mutations in genes coding for enzymes involved in producing secondary metabolites with known impact on human health provided a growth advantage under several xenobiotics. This raises the possibility that exposure to chemical pollutants could impact the selection landscape in the gut, leading to metabolic alterations in microbiome–host interaction pathways.

Are our results relevant for real-world exposure scenarios in humans? Many of the compounds in our study (for example, melamine and mepiquat) have been found in micromolar concentrations in human blood13, implying similar or higher concentrations in the gastrointestinal tract. The concentrations for individuals living in polluted areas and with high occupational exposure (for example, from unprotected pesticide spraying, which is common in much of the developing world), are likely to be much higher. Yet, there are no cohort data available that track both chemical exposure and microbiome dynamics. To enable a large screen and comparison with previous datasets, we tested only a single concentration for most compounds.Although these results clearly highlight compound classes with antibacterial activity, such as fungicides, testing at a single concentration limits the assessment of hazard and risk levels for individual chemicals. Furthermore, the strains used in our study do not span the full diversity of gut bacterial strains and additional screening will be necessary to gain insights into species- and strain-level variation in chemical sensitivity and resistance. Our results therefore currently cannot be directly translated to exposure effects on the gut microbiota in vivo.

Going forward, we envisage that our pollutant–bacteria interaction data will encourage the collection of exposure data in microbiome studies, similar to how in vitro drug–bacteria screens accelerated the recording of drug usage in cohort studies25,31. Nevertheless, in vivo assessment of the impact of chemicals exposure is likely to be difficult due to complex interactions between the microbiota and diet, medications and other lifestyle factors. Genetic and physiological insights gained from our study will therefore help to bridge in vitro and in vivo datasets. The chemical–bacteria interaction map and identified genetic determinants of resistance could be used to guide the selection of compounds and molecular effects to monitor in future microbiome studies.

An arrayed library of pesticides, pesticide metabolites and pesticide-related compounds was obtained from the Chemical Biology Core Facility at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL; Heidelberg, Germany). Original compound stocks were ordered from the collection of PESTANAL standards by Merck/Sigma–Aldrich, with catalogue numbers and Chemical Abstracts Service identifiers listed in Supplementary Data 1. An additional plate containing industrial chemicals and mycotoxins was prepared in house. Compounds were dissolved in DMSO at a concentration of 10 mM. The combined library was arranged on 12 96-well plates, which included eight DMSO controls interspersed within the plate. One unique well position of each plate contained a dye (Trypan Blue), serving as a footprint to enable the detection and prevention of plate mix ups and rotation. A working stock concentrated at 2 mM in DMSO was prepared and aliquoted. Libraries were stored at −80 °C.

Extensive metadata were compiled from multiple sources. PubChem Compound Identifiers (CIDs) were primarily retrieved automatically with compound name searches using the PUG–REST interface, and missing CIDs were added manually. PubChem metadata were then retrieved based on CIDs. PubMed hit counts were retrieved in April 2022 using the National Center for Biotechnology Information E-Utilities application programming interface. Compound names were semi-automatically matched to the Pesticide Compendium of the British Crop Production Council to map hierarchical target classifications, and unmatched entries (for example, pesticide metabolites and non-pesticides) were manually curated. Food and Drug Administration and European Food Safety Authority 2018 pesticide monitoring reports were used to annotate detection in common foods and maximum residue level exceedances.

Details of bacterial strains, including their accession numbers in common culture collections and alternative species names, are listed in Supplementary Data 2. All bacteria were grown under anaerobic conditions in a polyvinyl chamber (Coy Laboratory Products) filled with 2% hydrogen and 12% carbon dioxide in nitrogen. The chamber was equipped with a palladium catalyst system for oxygen removal, a dehumidifier and a hydrogen sulfide removal column. Bacteria were grown at 37 °C in modified Gifu anaerobic medium (mGAM; HyServe, Germany, produced by Nissui Pharmaceuticals), prepared according to the manufacturer's instructions and sterilized by autoclaving. Bacterial strains were chosen based on their abundance and prevalence in the healthy human gut33.

Assay plates were prepared by first diluting the frozen pesticide library aliquots (2 mM in DMSO) in mGAM within a master deep-well plate from which 50 μl measures were aliquoted into clear, round-bottom, polystyrene untreated microplates (3795; Corning). Assay plates were then placed in the anaerobic chamber overnight to become anoxic. All liquid handling was performed using a Biomek i7 Automated Workstation (Beckman Coulter).

Each strain was measured in biological triplicates from independent cultures inoculated on separate days. Bacteria were grown for one or two days (depending on the growth rate) in 10 ml media, inoculated directly from frozen glycerol stocks. Cultures were then diluted 100-fold and incubated again for the same amount of time. Optical densities measured at a wavelength of 600 nm (OD600) were determined and a dilution with an OD600 of 0.1 was prepared. We then added 50 μl of this dilution to each well of the previously prepared assay plates, resulting in a starting OD600 of 0.05 and a compound concentration of 20 μM (1% DMSO). Assay plates were sealed with a gas-permeable membrane (Breathe-Easy; Z380059; Merck), which was additionally pierced with a syringe to prevent the build-up of gas, which otherwise occurs for some species. Plates were stacked without lids and the OD600 was recorded every hour for 24 h using a stacker (BioStack 4; Agilent BioTek) and plate reader (Epoch 2; Agilent BioTek).

Data analysis was performed in R version 4.2.2 and RStudio version 1.3.1093. First, for each growth curve, the minimum OD600 value was set to 0. Then, the raw AUC was calculated for each well using the bayestestR package and area_under_curve function. Further processing of growth curves was done by plate. For the pesticide library, AUC values were normalized by the median AUC of all control wells (DMSO control) on the respective plate. For the industrial chemicals and mycotoxin library, AUCs were normalized by the median row and column values (to correct for edge effects). Then, for both screens, a z score was calculated as follows: (raw AUC − control median)/control s.d. Each z score was converted to its respective P value and the P value was false discovery rate corrected for the number of compounds tested (n = 1,076). Significance analyses were performed separately for each replicate. A replicate was considered to be significant for growth inhibition if Padj < 0.05 and there was a >20% reduction in the normalized AUC. A compound was considered to significantly inhibit a specific strain if at least two out of three replicates were significant.

For the validation experiments and determination of the MIC, fresh vials were used, with the same catalogue numbers as in Supplementary Data 1. The results from the MIC screen were prepared and analysed in the same way as those from the high-throughput screen. The MIC was defined as the lowest concentration for which the normalized AUC dropped below 0.1.

Com20 (ref. 38) was inoculated from a frozen ready-to-use stock (equal member ratio; 10% glycerol containing palladium black; 520810; Sigma–Aldrich) into 5 ml mGAM under anaerobic conditions for two 1:100 overnight passages. Com20 was dispensed into wells of 96-well plates containing 500 µl media with xenobiotic compounds, at a starting OD578 of 0.01, sealed with AeraSeal membranes (A9224; Sigma–Aldrich) and anaerobically incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. Pellets from 300 µl of culture were frozen for 16S ribosomal RNA analysis and the OD578 was measured as a biomass proxy.

DNA was extracted using a DNeasy UltraClean 96 Microbial Kit (10196-4; Qiagen) and quantified with a Qubit dsDNA BR/HS Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Library preparation and 16S sequencing were conducted at the Next Generation Sequencing Competence Center (Tübingen, Germany) using a two-step PCR protocol. The V4 region was amplified using 515F/806R primers with KAPA HiFi HotStart ReadyMix (Roche) and indexed with unique dual-index barcodes (IDT for Illumina DNA/RNA UD Indexes (Tagmentation)). Libraries were pooled equimolarly, normalized to 10 pM and sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq system (v2 kit; 2 × 250 bp; 20% PhiX).

Reads were processed with the DADA2 package (version 1.21.053) in R (version 4.2.0), using the standard operating procedure (https://benjjneb.github.io/dada2/bigdata.html) with the parameters trimLeft: 23, 24; truncLen: 240, 200; maxEE: 2, 2; truncQ: 11, and only retaining merged reads of 250–256 base pairs. Genus-level taxonomy was first assigned against a curated DADA2-formatted database derived from the genome taxonomy database (release R06-RS20253)68 and amplicon sequence variants from expected Com20 genera were then further classified at the species level using full-length 16S ribosomal RNA sequences of all 20 members. Classification was performed with the R package DECIPHER (version 2.24.054) at ≥98% identity.

To assess the effects of chemical pollutants on gut microbiota and extrapolate in vitro bioactivity data to potential human health risks, we focused on 168 active chemicals. In vitro growth screening concentrations were used to compute estimated administered doses via the IVIVE tool from the Integrated Chemical Environment (https://ice.ntp.niehs.nih.gov/), leveraging the Environmental Protection Agency's httk R package69 and in-house NICEATM code70. IVIVE calculations determined gut concentrations corresponding to bioactivity levels (MICs from growth screening assays). Essential parameters included the toxicokinetic model type, chemical-specific parameters (log[P], molecular weight, pKa, intrinsic clearance, fraction unbound and tissue partition coefficient), dosing scenarios and exposure routes. OPERA71 provided parameters for 152 of the 168 chemicals; the reminder were empirically available. The physiologically based toxicokinetic model utilizes multiple compartments for various organs and tissue with perfusion-rate-limited kinetics, simulating elimination primarily via hepatic and renal routes, under a 30-day oral exposure scenario with 24-h intervals. Compartments include the gut, liver and remaining body, simulating dynamic tissue and plasma concentrations for both oral and intravenous exposures72.

The US Environmental Protection Agency's Toxicity Values Database served as the primary source for condensed in vivo point-of-departure (POD) data, encompassing human health references and animal toxicity values from various studies via the CompTox Chemicals Dashboard (https://comptox.epa.gov/dashboard/). Filters applied to the data available for 126 chemicals included: exposures in mg kg−1 bodyweight or mg kg−1 bodyweight per day (or convertible units); species-specific conversion factors for rats, mice, dogs and rabbits; the study types sub-chronic, subacute and subchronic; and the POD types lowest observed effect level, lowest adverse effect level, no observed effect level and no observed adverse effect level.

The SMILES strings for all compounds in PubChem were downloaded, from which 250,000 were selected at random. ECFPs were generated from SMILES strings for all library compounds, previously screened pharmaceutical drugs73,74 and PubChem compounds using ChemPlot75. The ECFPs were then embedded in a two-dimensional representation using UMAP76, with the number of neighbours and minimum distance set to 80 and 0.35, respectively. The Jaccard/Tanimoto index between compounds was calculated using the cdist function from SciPy77. The distributions for the maximum Tanimoto similarity index for each PubChem compound for the pharmaceutical drugs and combined pharmaceutical drugs and pollutants libraries were compared using a two-sided Kolmogorov–Smirnov test.

Molecular descriptor features were generated with the rdck R package. Embedded features were obtained from a pre-trained version of MoLFormer46, which takes the SMILES strings as input and outputs a vector with 768 dimensions (https://huggingface.co/ibm-research/MoLFormer-XL-both-10pct). The deterministic flag was enabled to make sure that the model always gives the same output. Machine learning was implemented using scikit-learn version 1.2.2. The data were split into train and test sets in an 8:2 ratio with stratification to ensure equal hit frequencies in both sets. Twentyfold cross-validation was applied. RandomForestClassifier was used with the options n_estimators=500, max_features=‘sqrt' and max_depth=None to predict probabilities, which were then thresholded using the hit frequency of the training set47. The feature_importances_ attribute was used to access feature importance values.

The dense transposon mutant library of P. merdae ATCC 43184 (ref. 49) was used for TnBarSeq mapped to the annotated genome CP102286.1 (GenBank). Two vials of the pooled stock transposon library were used to inoculate mGAM with 30 μg ml−1 erythromycin and grown until the mid-exponential phase. This culture was used to inoculate 1 ml cultures at OD600 = 0.02 in a 2-ml deep-well plate, with duplicates for each xenobiotic and triplicates for the respective control media with 1% DMSO, 0.2% DMSO or plain media (xenobiotic concentrations are provided in Supplementary Data 6). The growth of the library was tracked by monitoring hourly a 100-μl aliquot of the library (as described in the section ‘Growth screening'), and growth curves were analysed using the Growthcurver package in R78. The transposon library cultures were grown to the early stationary phase (16 h for all samples except 2.5 μM closantel, which was grown to 48 h). Genomic DNA was extracted using a MagMAX Microbiome Ultra Nucleic Acid Isolation Kit. The transposon barcodes were amplified by PCR with Q5 Hot Start High-Fidelity 2X (New England Biolabs) using indexed primers (the sequences are provided in Supplementary Data 10), and sequenced with an Illumina NextSeq (single-end sequencing with a read length of 75 nucleotides). Barcodes were counted with 2FAST2Q79 and transposon insertion counts per sample were inputted as wiggle files to TRANSIT, where they were analysed against their respective control using reads in the central 80% of coding regions and normalized using the trimmed total read count, followed by resampling of 20,000 permutations80 and two-sided statistical testing with Benjamini–Hochberg correction (Supplementary Data 6). Gene hits were considered significant at Padj < 0.05 and |log2[fold change]| > 0.25. Post-hoc doublings bias correction was performed in R using the EEL_correction script50. KEGG terms were assigned with EggNOG Mapper81 and KEGG term enrichment was performed using a Fisher's exact test in R. Protein homology was mapped with clinker to B. thetaiotaomicron82; membrane protein families were annotated using TransAAP (hosted by TransportDB)83 and the Conserved Domains Database at the National Center for Biotechnology Information; and additional relevant homologues were identified using PaperBLAST84.

To enrich for positively selected mutants, the P. merdae transposon mutant library was cultured in 20 μM TBBPA, 500 μM PFNA or 2 μM closantel for two passages. Cultures were inoculated at an OD600 of 0.02 in 5 ml media in 15-ml tubes and incubated anaerobically for 24 h of growth, then passaged one in 50 into 5 ml fresh media and incubated for an additional 24 h. Following enrichment, cultures were streaked to isolation on anaerobic mGAM agar supplemented with 10 μg ml−1 erythromycin, and individual colonies were picked and glycerol stocked. Transposon barcodes of the isolated colonies were identified by Sanger sequencing (Supplementary Data 7) and validated using locus-specific diagnostic PCR (Extended Data Fig. 5a,b; the oligonucleotides are provided in Supplementary Data 10). Growth of the mutants under chemical perturbation was tracked as in the section ‘Growth screening‘ and analysed using the Growthcurver package in R78.

For MIC testing, mutant strains were passaged twice for 24 h in anaerobic mGAM before being used to inoculate, at an initial OD600 of 0.025, 100-μl cultures with twofold dilution series of ciprofloxacin, closantel or DMSO control. All plates contained empty-well controls and no compound control. Growth was tracked for 24 h, and the OD600 at 24 h was used to determine the MIC. The MIC was defined as the lowest concentration for which the blanked-normalized OD600 was lower than a cut-off value of <0.1 (>90% inhibition). Three independent replicates were performed on different days, with two technical replicates per strain. The results are provided in Supplementary Data 8.

We assembled a subset of the B. thetaiotaomicron arrayed mutant library56, selecting 185 gene mutants annotated as putative transporters. The genes were selected based on annotations from TransAAP83 or if they included in their functional gene annotation the terms pump, efflux or transporter (Supplementary Data 9). Mutants were re-arrayed in three 96-well plates, each containing empty-well controls.

Inoculum library plates were grown anaerobically in mGAM from glycerol stocks or a first-passage plate for 24 h. Test plates of each condition were prepared at 2× concentration for 20 μM BPAF, 20 μM TBBPA, 2 and 10 μM closantel, 250 μM PFNA and their respective vehicle controls (0.4 or 1.0% DMSO) and left overnight inside the anaerobic chamber to equilibrate. Plates were inoculated by passaging library inoculum at 1:100 for each test condition in two technical replicates. Plates were sealed with gas-permeable membranes and growth was monitored over 24 h, as described in the section ‘High-throughput screening and MIC determination'.

Growth curves were fitted using the Growthcurver package in R78 and the AUC fit was calculated (Supplementary Data 9). One mutant strain that failed growth in the DMSO control was removed from further analysis. To identify mutants whose growth was differentially impacted by xenobiotic treatment, relative AUC values (rAUC) of each mutant were calculated as rAUC = (AUC)/(median AUC of mutants of the plate), assuming a neutral phenotype for most mutants. The average rAUC per technical replicate of mutant strains was calculated. To calculate the nrAUC for each xenobiotic condition, the average rAUC for the mutant gene under the xenobiotic was divided by the average rAUC for the corresponding DMSO control. A Welch's t-test was performed and P values were corrected for multiple testing using the Benjamini–Hochberg method. Gene mutant hits with conditional growth effects were defined as those with P < 0.05 and an nrAUC value corresponding to a 20% increase or decrease.

Bioaccumulation of BPAF was assessed by reverse-phase LC–MS/MS, as described previously42. Com20 cultures were grown anaerobically at 37 °C in mGAM with 1% DMSO and 20 μM BPAF, with controls lacking either BPAF or bacterial cells. After 24 h, at the stationary phase, 800-μl whole-culture samples were mixed and taken, then the cultures were centrifuged (10 min at 3,200g and room temperature) and 800 μl of the supernatant was collected (the supernatant sample). The rest of the supernatant was discarded, the pellet was resuspended in 8 ml water and 800 μl transferred to a fresh tube (cell sample). All samples were stored at −80 °C. For LC–MS/MS, samples were thawed and mixed, then 160 μl extracted with 240 μl organic solvent (1:1 MeOH:ACN + 0.1% formic acid with 20 μM amoxicillin, caffeine, ibuprofen and donepezil as internal standards), incubated for 30 min at −20 °C and cleared by centrifugation (5 min at 10,000g and 4 °C). The supernatants were then transferred to fresh vials. A standard curve was prepared by serially diluting BPAF in the appropriate matrix (untreated supernatant or cell sample extracts of Com20 cultures from the same experiment). Samples (0.5 μl) were analysed on an Agilent 1290 Infinity II chromatography system coupled to an Agilent 6470 Triple Quadrupole (QQQ) system with a Jet Stream ion source operated in dynamic multiple reaction monitoring mode with a cycle time of 500 ms. The analytical column (Agilent Poroshell 120 EC-C18; 2.1 × 100 mm; 1.9 μm) was operated at 40 °C and a constant flow rate of 0.3 ml min−1. Initial conditions were 65% buffer A (water + 0.1% formic acid + 10 mM ammonium formate) and 35% buffer B (9:1 acetonitrile:water + 0.1% formic acid + 10 mM ammonium formate). The gradient was as follows: 0 min: 35% B; 0.5 min: 35% B; 4.5 min: 100% B; 5.5 min: stop; post-time: 1.5 min. The source parameters were as follows: gas temperature: 300 °C; gas flow: 10 l min−1; nebulizer: 50 psi; sheath gas temperature: 300 °C; sheath gas flow: 11 l min−1; capillary: 3,500 V (positive) and 3,000 V (negative); nozzle voltage: 2,000 V (positive) and 500 V (negative). BPAF was monitored in negative mode, using a precursor m/z of 335 and fragment m/z of 265 and 69 (500-ms cycle time). The data were analysed using MassHunter Workstation Quantitative Analysis for QQQ version 10.1.

Bioaccumulation of PFNA was performed as previously described42. Strains were inoculated at an OD600 of 0.025 in 1-ml cultures with varying PFNA concentrations, plus DMSO and empty-well controls. A 100-μl sample was taken to track growth dynamics in parallel. After 20 h of anaerobic incubation, 80-μl whole-culture and supernatant aliquots were collected and stored at −80 °C. Samples were extracted with solvent mix (1:1 MeOH:ACN + 0.1% formic acid with 20 µM caffeine, ibuprofen and donepezil as the internal standard), followed by 2 h incubation at 4 °C and 30 min incubation at −20 °C, then centrifuged as above. Samples were injected at a 0.3-μl volume in the LC–MS/MS instrument described above. The analytical column (Agilent Poroshell 120 EC-C18; 2.1 × 50 mm; 1.9 μm) was operated at 40 °C with a constant flow rate of 0.8 ml min−1. The initial buffer composition was 70% A (water + 0.1% formic acid) and 30% B (acetonitrile + 0.1% formic acid). The gradient was as follows: 0 min: 30% B; 0.05 min: 30% B; 0.5 min: 100% B; 1 min: 100% B; 1.05 min: 30% B; stop time: 1.5 min. The source parameters were identical to those described above. PFNA was monitored in negative mode, using a precursor m/z of 463 and fragment m/z of 417.9 and 219 (200 ms cycle time). The data were analysed using MassHunter Workstation Quantitative Analysis for QQQ version 10.1 and a custom R script, and the results are provided in Supplementary Data 11.

No randomization was used in the microbiological experiments, and data collection and analysis were not performed blind to the conditions of the experiments, as no group allocation was needed. No statistical methods were used to determine samples sizes; instead, they were chosen based on previous experience and according to those in the literature25,56,57. The data distribution was assumed to be normal, but this was not formally tested. Further statistics and reproducibility information are described in each section.

A) Network illustrating the number of library compounds targeted at different organisms and their chemical subclasses, based on the BCPC Pesticide Compendium. Out of 1076 compounds in total, 829 were pesticides, 119 were pesticide metabolites, 48 were industrial chemicals, 5 were mycotoxins and 76 were other, pesticide-related compounds such as synthetic precursors or compounds that might be found in commercial formulations. B) Venn diagram illustrating overlaps of significant interactions between n=3 biological replicates of the main screen. A compound was considered an overall hit if two out of three biological replicates were statistically significant (padj <0.05) and the area under the curve (AUC) was at least 20% lower than for the DMSO control. C) Overlap of hits between main and independent validation screen. D) Normalised AUC values in main screen and validation experiment. The Pearson correlation coefficient, two-sided, and associated p-value is shown in the graph. The shaded areas indicate the 95% confidence interval.

Source data

A) Chemical susceptibility profiles grouped by phylum. compounds (x-axis) and phyla (y-axis) were clustered by profile similarity, using Euclidean distance and Ward clustering. The number of strains in each phylum is indicated in parentheses. B) Heatmap showing growth inhibition by compounds (20 μM) which were identified to have broad-spectrum activity, inhibiting more than a third of the tested species. Results shown are a subset of those shown in Fig. 1c. Several of these compounds are widely used and/or persistent organic pollutants, raising concerns about their potential anti-gut-bacteria effects. Abbreviation: *C12-C14-Alkyl(ethylbenzyl)dimethylammonium chloride.

Source data

A) Coverage of chemical space is increased by our new, complementary xenobiotic compound library. The plot illustrates the fraction of compounds in the random PubChem subset (y-axis, n=250,000) which have a similar compound (at the Tanimoto similarity threshold indicated on the x-axis), for the compound library of this study (green line), pharmaceutical drugs screened by Maier et al. 2018 (purple line) and the combined dataset. The inset focuses on a Tanimoto threshold of 0.75, where significantly increased coverage of the chemical space is observed (p< 2.2e-16, Kolmogorov-Smirnov test). B) Heatmap including all features which belonged to the top10 features in at least one species (ranked by mean across 20 cross-validation sets). Feature importance was accessed using the feature_importances_ attribute of the RandomForestClassifier, which relies on decrease in mean impurity to quantify feature importance. Feature based on molecular distance edge descriptors of carbon atoms (MDEC) (S. Liu et al., 1998) stood out as particularly useful for predicting anti-gut-bacterial activity across different species. C) Correlation analysis of the features with each other. D) Comparison of feature importances between pesticides and pharmaceutical drugs indicates that similar features are important for both compound classes. Spearman r=0.65, p=0.

Source data

A) Post hoc correction for possible growth generation bias in log2FC (EEL method, Kim et al. 2024) show main TnBarSeq hits cannot be explained by differences library growth. Values per gene and condition are found in Supplementary Data 6. B) Area under the curve (AUC) for P. merdae Tn mutant library under the compounds tested normalised to control, plotted against total TnBarseq hits. The colour scale represents the number of bacterial species in the general growth screen which were an inhibition hit at 20 μM. Point shape indicates whether the compound was a growth hit for wild type P. merdae in the previous growth screen. C) Putative membrane transporters and other membrane proteins showing negative fitness in response to more than one xenobiotic. Protein families are indicated in colours. ABC= Adenosine Triphosphate-Binding Cassette. CPA2= Monovalent cation:proton antiporter 2. RND= Resistance Nodulation Division. MOP= Multidrug/oligosachharidyl-lipid/polysaccharide. omp= ompA-H family. D) Enriched KEGG Pathway categories among all TnBarSeq hits for compounds tested. Number of gene hits are indicated by circle size, P-value is derived from Fisher's test.

Boxes highlight chemicals with negative and positive POD ratios, enlarged in panel B and C respectively. To contrast the observed sensitivity of gut bacteria to chemicals against animal toxicity estimates, we applied physiologically based toxicokinetic (PBTK) modelling to 168 chemicals. Using a 30-day exposure scenario with 24 hour dose intervals, we used in vitro to in vivo extrapolation (IVIVE) to estimate equivalent administered oral doses in humans (EADs) that result in concentrations of xenobiotics in the gut at which we observed bacterial growth inhibition in vitro (Supplementary Data 12). We compared these EADs to the doses at which toxicity was observed in a curated database of animal experiments (ToxValDB). This comparison is captured as the PODratio, which is the ratio of lowest dose at which an adverse effect was observed in mice (Point of departure - lowest adverse effect level: POD-LOAEL) to the previously determined EAD. We detected a positive log10(PODratio) for the vast majority of compounds in our analysis (56 out of 68 compounds for which animal data was available). A positive log10(PODratio) indicates that our in vitro screen picked up effects at lower equivalent doses than required to elicit toxicity in animals. While this is not unexpected, as animal toxicology does not usually consider the microbiome, this indicates that in vitro screening can be a sensitive method to assess potential adverse effects on microbiota not typically picked up in animal toxicity studies. More consideration and innovative study designs are required to better capture the microbiota-damaging toxic effects of xenobiotics in animal studies.

A major challenge in fault-tolerant quantum computation is to reduce both the space overhead, that is, the large number of physical qubits per logical qubit, and the time overhead, that is, the long physical gate sequences needed to implement a logical gate. Here we prove that a protocol using non-vanishing-rate quantum low-density parity-check (QLDPC) codes, combined with concatenated Steane codes, achieves constant space overhead and polylogarithmic time overhead, even when accounting for the required classical processing. This protocol offers an improvement over existing constant-space-overhead protocols. To prove our result, we develop a technique that we call partial circuit reduction, which enables error analysis for the entire fault-tolerant circuit by examining smaller parts composed of a few gadgets. With this approach, we resolve a logical gap in the existing arguments for the threshold theorem for the constant-space-overhead protocol with QLDPC codes and complete its proof. Our work establishes that the QLDPC-code-based approach can realize fault-tolerant quantum computation with a negligibly small slowdown and a bounded overhead of physical qubits.

Quantum computation has promising potential for accelerating the solving of certain classes of computational problems compared with classical computation1,2. However, the inherent fragility of quantum systems poses a major challenge in implementing quantum computations on quantum devices. Fault-tolerant quantum computation (FTQC)3,4 uses quantum error-correcting codes to encode logical qubits and suppress errors, typically incurring a space overhead (the number of physical qubits per logical qubit) and a time overhead (the ratio of physical to logical circuit depth). Currently, two prominent schemes have been proposed for FTQC: one is a concatenated code scheme3,4,5,6, and the other is a quantum low-density parity-check (QLDPC) code scheme7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17. For both schemes, threshold theorems4,5,7,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25 guarantee that the failure probability of the fault-tolerant simulation can be arbitrarily suppressed, provided that the physical error rate is below a certain threshold. Conventional FTQC schemes, using vanishing-rate codes such as those using surface codes9,10 or concatenated Steane codes5, incur polylogarithmic overheads in both space and time with respect to the size of the original quantum circuit.

In recent years, there have been notable advances towards achieving a constant space overhead by using non-vanishing-rate codes. Ref. 11 clarified the properties that non-vanishing-rate QLDPC codes must retain to achieve FTQC with constant space overhead, in combination with concatenated Steane codes. Subsequently, refs. 26,27 showed that quantum expander codes16,26,28 can serve as suitable QLDPC codes for this protocol. In this protocol, logical gates are implemented via gate teleportation using auxiliary states encoded in QLDPC codes3,29,30. The fault-tolerant preparation of these auxiliary states has been challenging without relying on the conventional protocol using concatenated Steane codes3,5. However, the conventional protocol incurs a growing space overhead3,5, which undermines complete gate parallelism when we need to maintain a constant space overhead. As a result, the existing analyses in refs. 11,26,27 require sequential gate implementation, leading to a polynomial increase in the time overhead of this protocol. More recently, ref. 6 resolved this bottleneck by developing a new constant-space-overhead protocol with complete gate parallelism based on concatenated quantum Hamming codes. However, even with this fully parallel execution of gates, the protocol only achieves quasi-polylogarithmic time overhead. Thus, it remains an open question whether it is possible to design an even faster constant-space-overhead protocol that achieves the polylogarithmic time overhead.

From a more fundamental perspective, this question involves a trade-off relation between space and time overhead in FTQC, originally raised in ref. 11 and partially addressed in ref. 6. On the one hand, conventional protocols that use vanishing-rate codes3,4,5,14, whether they are QLDPC codes or concatenated codes, incur polylogarithmic overheads in both space and time. On the other hand, the newer protocols using non-vanishing-rate codes achieve constant space overhead, but this improvement comes at the expense of increased time overhead. Remarkably, both QLDPC-code-based and concatenated-code-based approaches exhibit a similar pattern here as well, where reductions in space overhead have so far led to increases in time overheads beyond the conventional polylogarithmic scaling6,27. The essential focus here is not to propose a marginally improved protocol that outperforms existing ones in certain respects, but rather to address a more fundamental question: whether it is possible to overcome the barrier of super-polylogarithmic time overhead while maintaining constant space overhead.

Another fundamental issue is that the existing analyses of threshold theorems for protocols with QLDPC codes11,26,27,31 assume that classical computations are performed instantaneously on arbitrarily large scales, and before our work, the non-zero runtime of classical computations in implementing FTQC was explicitly taken into account only in the analysis of the threshold theorem for concatenated codes6. To fully analyse the overhead achievable in FTQC, it is essential to incorporate the waiting time for noninstantaneous classical computations into the analysis. Analysing overhead in FTQC must consider all possible bottlenecks, including the runtime of classical computation in executing FTQC (for example, decoding algorithms for error correction and gate teleportation), because the decoding runtime, which has often been considered negligible in theoretical analyses, can dominate the asymptotic scaling32. In fact, accounting for decoding delays in surface-code-based protocols not only increases the exponent in the polylogarithmic time overhead, but may potentially make FTQC infeasible due to severe slowdowns—an issue known as the backlog problem32. Such asymptotically non-negligible classical computations can also render the existence of a threshold non-trivial. In practice, even at current scales, classical computations have already become non-negligible bottlenecks, further underscoring the practical necessity of such comprehensive analyses33,34.

In this Article, we address these challenges and rigorously prove that a polylogarithmic time overhead can be achieved while maintaining a constant space overhead, even when fully accounting for non-zero classical computation times, using the non-vanishing-rate QLDPC codes. Our main theorem is informally stated as follows.

Let \(\{{C}_{n}^{{\rm{org}}}\}\) be a sequence of original circuits indexed by an integer n. Each circuit \({C}_{n}^{{\rm{org}}}\) has width W(n) and depth D(n), where the size of \({C}_{n}^{{\rm{org}}}\) is polynomially bounded, that is, \(| {C}_{n}^{{\rm{org}}}| =\)\(O(W(n)D(n))=O({\rm{poly}}(n))\) as n → ∞. Then, for all target error ε > 0, there exists a threshold pth > 0 such that, if the physical error rate p is below the threshold, that is, p < pth, then there exists a sequence of fault-tolerant circuits \(\{{C}_{n}^{{\rm{FT}}}\}\) such that the classical output of \({C}_{n}^{{\rm{FT}}}\) is sampled from a probability distribution close to that of \({C}_{n}^{{\rm{org}}}\) in terms of total variation distance at most ε, and \({C}_{n}^{{\rm{FT}}}\) has a width WFT(n) and a depth DFT(n) satisfying

as n → ∞.

The formal statement and proof of this theorem, along with the necessary definitions, are provided in Supplementary Sections II and V, in particular in theorem 11 therein. Our analysis is based on standard assumptions in the previous studies on FTQC5,6,7,11,26 (Supplementary Section II). In particular, we assume no geometric locality constraint on two-qubit gates; a CNOT gate can be applied to an arbitrary pair of physical qubits in a single time step. This is motivated by platforms such as neutral atoms, trapped ions and optics, which may offer pathways to realizing such non-local interactions35,36,37,38,39,40,41,42,43,44. To prove theorem 1, we present and analyse a hybrid fault-tolerant protocol that combines concatenated Steane codes5 and non-vanishing-rate QLDPC codes with an efficient decoding algorithm, specifically quantum expander codes16, refining the previous analyses in refs. 11,26,27. Our analysis enables the polylogarithmic time overhead by increasing gate parallelism in the gate operations using gate teleportation, substantially improving the polynomial time overhead of the previous analyses in refs. 11,26,27, while still maintaining a constant space overhead.

Our analysis addresses and fixes a previously overlooked problem in the existing analyses11,26,27 of the threshold theorem for the QLDPC codes. In the analyses of FTQC, it is conventional to consider the local stochastic Pauli error model, where the correlated errors may occur across the entire fault-tolerant quantum circuit, as in refs. 11,26,27. For each code block of the QLDPC codes, the existing analyses in refs. 11,26,27 argue that the physical error rate of the codeword is suppressed after noisy syndrome measurements followed by quantum error correction using decoding algorithms, but this codeword state is on specific code blocks, that is, only in a small part of the entire fault-tolerant circuit on which the local stochastic Pauli error model is defined. This argument overlooks the correlations between this part of the circuit and the rest of the circuit surrounding this part, leaving the overall proof of the threshold theorem incomplete. To address this issue, we introduce a new method called partial circuit reduction. This method enables error analysis of the entire fault-tolerant circuit through the examination of individual gadgets on the code blocks of QLDPC codes. Our approach allows us to leverage the existing results from the decoding algorithms11,26,27 as a black box, so that we fully complete the proof of the threshold theorem for the constant-space-overhead protocol with the QLDPC codes. Furthermore, by combining this method with theoretical advances of the decoding algorithms in refs. 26,27, we show that it is indeed possible to achieve higher parallelization of the logical gates compared with the existing analyses in refs. 11,26,27, resulting in a polylogarithmic time overhead. These advances contribute to a fundamental understanding of the overhead and its space-time trade-off in FTQC and provide a robust foundation for realizing quantum computation.

We note that, in a concurrent work, another fault-tolerant protocol with constant space overhead and polylogarithmic time overhead45 has been proposed, relying on an approach substantially different from ours. The primary contribution of our work lies in the proof of the threshold theorem, which takes into account the non-zero runtime of classical computation.

In our protocol, quantum expander codes, which are Calderbank–Shor–Steane low-density parity-check codes with a non-vanishing rate, serve as the registers that store and protect logical qubits46,47. Using the conventional notation [[N, K, D]] for the code parameters (N is the number of physical qubits, K is the number of logical qubits and D is the code distance), quantum expander codes16 exhibit parameters of \([[N,K={{\varTheta}}(N),D={{\varTheta}}(\sqrt{N})]]\), so the rate K/N remains positive as N → ∞. Together with the small-set-flip decoder, these codes suppress the probability of decoding failure, which may lead to logical error, exponentially in the code distance, as established in refs. 26,27. These properties make quantum expander codes well suited for high-capacity, robust quantum memory.

To realize a universal gate set that manipulates this QLDPC-encoded quantum memory, we use a hybrid approach involving concatenated Steane codes5,47,48 to prepare auxiliary states encoded by quantum expander codes in a fault-tolerant manner, enabling the logical gates via gate teleportation. The fault-tolerant protocol with concatenated Steane codes can be used to simulate arbitrary original quantum circuits, albeit with polylogarithmic overheads in both time and space5. In our hybrid approach, this concatenated Steane code protocol is crucially used to prepare logical auxiliary states that are encoded in the QLDPC code.

The fault-tolerant preparation of an auxiliary state, denoted by \(\left\vert \psi \right\rangle\), which is a physical state representing a codeword of a QLDPC code that encodes a target logical auxiliary state, can be understood intuitively as follows. While \(\left\vert \psi \right\rangle\) can be prepared by some non-fault-tolerant unitary circuit, such a circuit cannot be directly used for its fault-tolerant preparation. Instead, the idea is to first prepare \(\left\vert \psi \right\rangle\) as a logical state encoded in the concatenated Steane code. Because the well-established fault-tolerant protocol with the concatenated Steane code supports simulation of universal quantum computation, this Steane-encoded version of \(\left\vert \psi \right\rangle\) can be prepared with a sufficiently low logical error rate. We then convert this logical state into the physical state \(\left\vert \psi \right\rangle\) over the physical qubits, by decoding the concatenated Steane code. Roughly speaking, this step introduces errors on each physical qubit at the physical error rate, up to constant factors. This fact was implicitly used in the previous analysis of the constant-space-overhead protocol based on QLDPC codes11, and we provide a rigorous proof and explicit bound on this error rate in Supplementary Appendix A. Although each physical qubit may now suffer errors at the physical error rate, it is important to recall that \(\left\vert \psi \right\rangle\) is already encoded as a codeword of the QLDPC code. Therefore, we can transition to using the decoder of the QLDPC code to continue suppressing its decoding failure probability and protect the encoded logical state in \(\left\vert \psi \right\rangle\). Once these QLDPC-encoded auxiliary states are fault-tolerantly prepared, they enable the implementation of logical Clifford and non-Clifford gates on the QLDPC logical qubits via fault-tolerant gate teleportation3,29,30, thereby equipping our protocol with a universal set of logical operations.

The compilation process in our hybrid fault-tolerant protocol consists of two stages (see Fig. 1 and Supplementary Section III for details).

The process involves two main stages. The aim of the first stage is to convert an original quantum circuit \({C}_{n}^{{\rm{org}}}\) to an intermediate circuit acting on registers, where each register is a collection of at most K qubits. The intermediate circuit is composed of a predetermined set of elementary operations, which includes a \({\left\vert 0\right\rangle }^{\otimes K}\)-state preparation, Clifford-state preparations, magic-state preparations, Pauli-gate operations, a CNOT-gate operation, a ZK-measurement operation, a Bell-measurement operation and a wait operation. The compilation begins with partitioning the qubits of the original circuit into registers. Then, \(\left\vert 0\right\rangle\)-state preparations in the original circuit are replaced by \({\left\vert 0\right\rangle }^{\otimes K}\)-state preparations, and Z-basis measurements are replaced by ZK-measurement operations. Clifford gates (for example, a tensor product of the Hadamard H gate) and non-Clifford gates (for example, a tensor product of T gates) in the original circuit are converted into a Clifford unitary UC acting on two registers and a non-Clifford unitary UT on a single register, respectively. To maintain constant space overhead, the number of the \({\left\vert 0\right\rangle }^{\otimes K}\)-state preparations, the UC gates, the UT gates and the ZK-measurement operations performed at a single time step is limited to \({\varTheta}(W(n)/{\rm{polylog}}(n/{\varepsilon}))\), where W(n) is the original circuit width. Following this, each of the UC gates and the UT gates is replaced by a sequence of elementary operations performing the corresponding teleportation with the aid of auxiliary registers, which is denoted as a UC-gate or a UT-gate abbreviation. The next stage is the compilation of this intermediate circuit into the fault-tolerant circuit \({C}_{n}^{{\rm{FT}}}\). This stage is achieved by replacing each elementary operation with a corresponding gadget, and an EC gadget is inserted between each pair of adjacent gadgets.

First, an original quantum circuit is compiled into an intermediate circuit described as follows. An original circuit consists of initial state preparation, Clifford gates, non-Clifford gates and measurements. The qubits of the original circuit are partitioned into collections of at most K qubits each, called registers6. Here, K is chosen to match the number of logical qubits of the QLDPC code to be used, because each qubit in the intermediate circuit will eventually be regarded as a logical qubit of the code. For the compilation, we rewrite the original circuit using the following operations acting on registers: a \({\left\vert 0\right\rangle }^{\otimes K}\) -state preparation, Clifford unitaries UC acting on two registers, non-Clifford unitaries UT on a single register and a ZK measurement (Fig. 1). To achieve constant overhead, we restrict the number of the preparations, the measurements and the unitary gates executed in parallel, which is done by inserting the wait operations to delay part of the operations. Then, we regard each of the unitary gates as an abbreviation of a gate-teleportation circuit composed of elementary operations and equipped with ancillary registers. Here, the set of the elementary operations is composed of a \({\left\vert 0\right\rangle }^{\otimes K}\)-state preparation, Clifford-state preparations, magic-state preparations, Pauli-gate operations, a CNOT-gate operation, a ZK-measurement operation, a Bell-measurement operation and a wait operation. At this point, the original circuit has been converted to a circuit composed of the elementary operations, which we call the intermediate circuit (Fig. 1).

Next, this intermediate circuit is compiled into a fault-tolerant circuit. In this stage, each elementary operation within the intermediate circuit is replaced with its corresponding gadget, and each register is replaced with the QLDPC code block. Each gadget is a physical circuit designed to perform the logical operation acting on the logical qubits within a code block of the QLDPC code in a fault-tolerant way. As described above, the state-preparation gadget is fault-tolerantly constructed using the concatenated Steane code, while the other gadgets can be implemented transversally for quantum expander codes. Furthermore, an error-correction (EC) gadget acting on each code block is inserted between each pair of adjacent gadgets. Through this process, the final fault-tolerant circuit is constructed.

A crucial feature of our protocol is its ability to achieve higher parallelism in executing logical gates compared with existing constant-space-overhead fault-tolerant protocols with QLDPC codes11,26,27, making it possible to achieve polylogarithmic time and constant space overhead simultaneously. In previous analyses11,26,27 for constant-overhead FTQC with QLDPC codes, logical gates could act simultaneously act on only O(W(n)/poly(n/ε)) logical qubits. This limitation naturally led to a polynomial time overhead.

Our protocol overcomes this bottleneck by providing a refined analysis of the required code size for quantum expander codes. These codes exhibit an exponential suppression of decoding failure probability as we increase the code distance. Indeed, this error suppression enables the use of a very small QLDPC code block size, scaling only polylogarithmically. The use of such small code blocks is important for our protocol; it reduces the resources required for the auxiliary states needed for gate teleportation. The QLDPC-encoded auxiliary states required for gate teleportation are prepared using a concatenated Steane code protocol. The fault-tolerant preparation using the concatenated Steane code itself incurs polylogarithmic space and time overheads. Implementation of each logical qubit of the QLDPC code thus requires a polylogarithmic number of physical qubits. Furthermore, each logical gate, implemented via these auxiliary logical states prepared using concatenated Steane codes, also introduces a polylogarithmic time overhead. This polylogarithmic requirement for the QLDPC code block size, in turn, enables the performance of more logical operations, that is, those on \(O(W(n)/{\rm{polylog}}(n/\varepsilon ))\) logical qubits, in parallel at each time step while maintaining the constant space overhead. This substantially increased parallelism in logical gate execution contributes to achieving a polylogarithmic time overhead. The detailed overhead analysis is presented in Supplementary Section V.

A key challenge in proving the threshold theorem for FTQC with QLDPC codes lies in consistently analysing errors across the entire fault-tolerant circuit, especially when individual code blocks are decoded locally. Existing analyses often focus on error suppression within a single QLDPC code block, overlooking correlations between the block and the rest of the circuit11,26,27, which is globally subject to a local stochastic Pauli error model11,26,27.

To address this fundamental issue, we introduce and utilize a technique called partial circuit reduction. The core motivation for this technique is to provide a systematic framework for analysing errors in a modular fashion. In our fault-tolerant circuit, each operation gadget is followed by EC gadgets for the associated code blocks, forming a circuit segment, which we call a rectangle. Instead of tackling the entire fault-tolerant circuit at once, we sequentially analyse errors in each rectangle. Partial circuit reduction allows us to formally replace a noisy rectangle in the fault-tolerant circuit with its ideally behaving, noiseless version, while appropriately updating the probability distribution of faulty locations in the subsequent, not-yet-analysed parts of the circuit. This step-by-step reduction is easy to use because it only requires analysis of a local segment at a time, while ensuring that the global statistics of fault occurrences continue to follow the same model with updated parameters. This method enables us to systematically manage error correlations and integrate established results from decoding algorithms26,27 as black-box components within a complete and rigorous proof of threshold existence. The detailed mathematical formulation of partial circuit reduction and its application in proving the threshold theorem are presented in Supplementary Section V.

With all techniques described above, we prove the threshold theorem for our protocol. A fundamental challenge in theoretical FTQC analysis, often leading to oversimplification, is the reliance on the assumption that classical computation required in error correction and gate teleportation can be performed instantaneously, that is, in zero time26,27,49. In reality, these computations have a non-zero runtime that may grow as the size of original circuits becomes larger. The impact of this additional runtime is not limited to the time overhead. Because errors accumulate during the wait time for classical computation, they can potentially affect space overheads and even the existence of a fault-tolerant threshold.

Our analysis explicitly incorporates this non-zero runtime by inserting appropriate wait periods in the fault-tolerant circuit such that outcomes of classical computation can be used to choose on-demand operations. To establish a threshold under this realistic condition, we identify crucial properties for the decoding algorithm of the QLDPC codes to satisfy. These include: (1) the single-shot property, enabling error correction from a single round of potentially noisy syndrome measurements; (2) iterative execution, where each internal loop of the decoder completes in O(1) time with O(N) classical parallel processors; (3) exponential suppression of decoding failure probability with code distance; and (4) monotonic reduction of residual physical error rate with the number T of the internal loops when physical and syndrome error rates are below certain thresholds. We confirm that the small-set-flip decoder for the quantum expander code26,27 fulfils these requirements. These conditions ensure that the execution of the decoder within the EC gadget (that is, the wait time) can always be kept to a constant time, even if we carefully account for classical processing time. This has enabled us to rigorously prove the existence of a fault-tolerance threshold for our protocol without compromising overhead scalings. The detailed conditions for the decoder and the proof of the threshold theorem are provided in Supplementary Sections IV and V, respectively.

In this Article, we have presented a hybrid fault-tolerant protocol that combines concatenated codes for gate operations and non-vanishing-rate QLDPC codes (in particular, the quantum expander codes16,26,28) for quantum memory. These results contribute to a fundamental understanding of the overhead and its space-time trade-off required to realize FTQC. Unlike previous analyses that assumed instantaneous classical computations, our work explicitly accounts for non-zero-time classical computation times and their associated error accumulation. Incorporating classical runtime into the overhead analysis and establishing a threshold theorem under this setting not only offers a comprehensive understanding of overheads accounting for every possible bottleneck, but also provides a solid foundation for realizing FTQC. An encouraging aspect of our results is that polylogarithmic time overhead and constant space overhead can be achieved using well-established components: quantum expander codes and concatenated Steane codes. Both of these have been the focus of active experimental research in various physical architectures. Recent theoretical proposals indicate the feasibility of quantum expander codes in scalable systems such as neutral atoms and superconducting circuits42,43,44, while small-scale protocols with the Steane code have already begun to be demonstrated experimentally37,50,51. Our findings indicate a promising potential for low-overhead FTQC using the hybrid approach that combines non-vanishing-rate QLDPC codes and concatenated codes, in addition to relying solely on the code-concatenation approach as proposed in refs. 6,52. With regard to practical implementation, our results clarify the competing time overheads of these two constant-space-overhead approaches, highlighting the importance of a comprehensive investigation into the physical realizability of both approaches.

The photon spin information encoded in circularly polarized (CP) light is of high interest for current and future technologies, including low-power displays, encrypted communications and high-performance quantum applications. Engineering organic light-emitting diodes (LED) to emit oppositely handed electroluminescent CP light typically requires access to left- and right-handed chiral molecules. In conjugated polymer LEDs, the handedness of CP electroluminescence also depends on the active-layer thickness or direction of current flow. For a given active-layer thickness, it remains unknown whether a single-handed chiral material can emit CP light with opposite handedness in the same LED architecture. Here we demonstrate organic LEDs in which the handedness of the emitted CP electroluminescence can be controlled electrically, solely by using specific interlayers with no change in the emissive material composition or thickness. We reveal that this occurs due to a change in mechanism for the generation of CP electroluminescence, as a function of the recombination zone position within the device. This result provides a paradigm shift in the realization of organic CP-LEDs with controllable spin angular momentum information and further contributes to ongoing discussions relating the fundamental physics of chiral optoelectronics.

Chirality is the property of an object with broken inversion and mirror symmetry, resulting in a pair of non-superimposable mirror image forms. In chemistry, each non-superimposable mirror image of a chiral molecule is called an enantiomer1. Chiral materials can absorb, emit and refract circularly polarized light (CPL), which is light with a defined spin angular momentum (SAM). SAM is the intrinsic angular momentum associated to a polarized photon, with a quantized value of ±ℏ per photon, corresponding to left- or right-handed circular polarization. Chiral organic semiconductors have recently attracted much interest as the emissive layer in circularly polarized light-emitting diodes (CP-LEDs)2,3. Partly due to the encoded SAM, CP-LEDs will enable multiple technological advances, from the generation of more energy-efficient display technologies to highly precise sensors to devices for quantum information processing and holography4,5.

When dealing with thin films of organic emissive chiral materials, the emitted CPL typically occurs through either the intrinsic chiroptical behaviour of the material1,6,7—the so-called natural optical activity8—or from the selective reflection or birefringence of CPL9 due to the structural chirality of the film10,11,12. Regardless of which of these mechanisms is operative, the handedness of the emitted CPL from organic chiral materials correlates to the handedness of the enantiomer of the emissive layer: one enantiomeric emitter gives a CPL of one preferred handedness, whereas the other enantiomer gives equal-magnitude CPL of the opposite handedness13. When referring to the emission from a CP-LED, we term this as normal circularly polarized electroluminescence (NCPE).

One of the most successful approaches to realize high circularly polarized electroluminescence (CP-EL) in CP organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) has been the use of polymeric thin-film blend materials, where an achiral conjugated polymer is blended with a chiral small-molecule additive14,15. We have found the helical small-molecule (P)-aza[6]helicene (aza[6]H; Fig. 1a) to be a particularly useful additive to produce films with very high chiroptical activity16. While optimizing aza[6]H:polymer blends to improve CP-OLED device efficiencies16,17, we discovered a distinct CP-EL mechanism, where the handedness of the CPL emitted inverts as a function of the device architecture (conventional versus inverted) or the emission direction (front or back of the device). This anomalous CP-EL (ACPE)18 was found to correlate to the directionality of current flow in the device, and was assigned to induced orbital angular momentum (OAM) in the charge carriers, with subsequent transfer to the SAM of the emitted photons. Importantly, ACPE apparently overrode the NCPE of the chiral emissive material. Further details on these mechanisms are provided in Supplementary Note 1.

The interplay between NCPE and ACPE in chiral polymer LEDs remains unclear. From a practical standpoint, exploiting NCPE requires the use of both enantiomers in separate devices to access opposite-handed CPL. Conversely, ACPE requires the use of two different device architectures. It would be a notable advance to be able to access both handedness of CPL from the same enantiomer material in the same device architecture. Here we realize such a goal, demonstrating how CPL handedness can be electrically controlled in a chiral polymer-based CP-OLED. Switching between NCPE and ACPE is achieved by controlling the charge injection and charge balance through the use of interlayers, and is enabled by a newly developed chiral additive, a monofluorinated [6]helicene ((P)-monoF[6]helicene (monoF[6]H); Fig. 1a). NCPE occurs with balanced charge transport in the emissive layer when the recombination zone (RZ) is located in the centre of the device and is independent of the device architecture (that is, conventional or inverted). ACPE occurs with unbalanced charge transport in the emissive layer when the RZ is located close to one of the transport layers (Fig. 1c). To the best of our knowledge, such electrical control of CP-EL has only previously been observed in inorganic materials19 and in different device configurations (namely, light-emitting transistors). As such, we believe the learnings in this work will enable wholly new directions and progress of CP-OLED device technologies with controllable SAM and contributing to the ongoing studies of chirality-dependent optoelectronic physics20.

Although aza[6]H has proved to be a useful additive to generate blend polymer films with large chiroptical activity, the optoelectronic performance of poly(9,9-dioctylfluorene-alt-benzothiadiazole) (F8BT):aza[6]H materials are hindered by the shallower highest occupied molecular orbital of aza[6]H (5.4 eV) compared with the highest occupied molecular orbital of F8BT (5.8 eV; Supplementary Fig. 10 and Supplementary Table 1). This results in aza[6]H acting as a hole trap in the blend, which decreases the device performance and limits the type of device configurations that can be used for working OLEDs. To address this issue, we developed fluorine-substituted monoF[6]H, a chiral additive with a deeper highest occupied molecular orbital (5.8 eV) than its aza[6]H counterpart (Supplementary Figs. 1–8), to reduce hole trapping in polymer blends (Fig. 1a). When blended with F8BT at the same concentration (10 wt%) and processing conditions (160 nm thickness), both aza[6]H and monoF[6]H induce a chiral phase in the polymeric film. Annealed blends of (P)-aza[6]H give a dissymmetry factor of lower energy (λ = 491 nm) transition of gabs = 0.65 (CD of 18,200 mdeg), whereas blends of (P)-monoF[6]H have a slightly lower but still substantial dissymmetry factor of gabs = 0.42 (CD of 12,000 mdeg; Fig. 1b and Supplementary Fig. 11). The CD of these films contains negligible contributions from linear dichroism and linear birefringence, with no CD sign inversion on rotation or flipping of the samples (Supplementary Figs. 13 and 14). This was further confirmed by Mueller matrix polarimetry (MMP) data showing that the CD elements m30 and m03 are symmetric whereas circular birefringence elements m21 and m12 are antisymmetric (Supplementary Figs. 15 and 16), which is consistent with prior studies on aza[6]H (ref. 8). This excludes any structural contributions to CPL, with the high chiroptical activity being attributed to the strong excitonic coupling between polymer-chain chromophores21. When optically excited, no change in the emitted CPL handedness is observed for a given enantiomer, regardless of the excitation geometry (Supplementary Figs. 18 and 19).

Conventional and inverted devices were fabricated with the same emissive layer thickness (160 nm). Conventional CP-OLEDs (Fig. 1c) of F8BT:(P)-aza[6]H blends with poly(9,9-dioctylfluorene-alt-N-(4-sec-butylphenyl)-diphenylamine) (TFB) as an additional hole transport layer (HTL) had lower efficiencies and higher turn-on voltages compared with F8BT:(P)-monoF[6]H-based devices (Supplementary Figs. 20 and 21). Furthermore, although the HTL is required to realize working CP-OLEDs for F8BT:(P)-aza[6]H blends, devices using F8BT:(P)-monoF[6]H can be fabricated HTL-free and maintain lower turn-on voltages compared with CP-OLEDs with aza[6]H (Supplementary Table 2). Inverted CP-OLEDs for all conditions (Fig. 1d) show higher device efficiencies compared with the conventional architecture (Supplementary Figs. 22 and 23). Consistent with conventional devices, inverted devices using F8BT:(P)-aza[6]H require (tris(4-carbazoyl-9-ylphenyl)amine) (TCTA) as an HTL, whereas F8BT:(P)-monoF[6]H-based CP-OLEDs can operate without an HTL. Inverted monoF[6]H-based CP-OLEDs demonstrate high efficiencies and, for HTL-free devices, very low efficiency roll-off (Supplementary Fig. 23 and Supplementary Table 2). The superior performance of CP-OLEDs incorporating F8BT:(P)-monoF[6]H confirms that the new chiral additive reduces the trapping caused by aza[6]H.

The lower density of trap states in F8BT:monoF[6]H blends is also supported by hole transport measurements via the space-charge-limited current method (Supplementary Figs. 24 and 25 and Supplementary Table 3). Almost three orders of magnitude difference in the hole mobility was observed in comparing blends of monoF[6]H and aza[6]H, with higher hole trap densities in aza[6]H blends. Mobility measurements of bilayers including an HTL reveal that for aza[6]H blends, the HTL improves hole mobility, whereas for monoF[6]H, it limits the injection of holes, pinning the RZ close to the anode in both cases. No differences in electron transport properties of the two additives were observed, even when measured in bilayers with an electron transport layer (Supplementary Fig. 25b and Supplementary Table 3). These measurements, performed using the same device stack as the respective CP-OLEDs, reveal that (1) in devices (conventional and inverted) with an HTL, the RZ is pinned near the HTL interface and (2) in HTL-free devices, the RZ is located closer to the centre of the stack due to balanced charge carrier injection and transport. This is consistent with the measured efficiency roll-off: efficiency roll-off is minimized in HTL-free devices due to the more balanced charge recombination and reduced quenching (Supplementary Fig. 27). Stability measurements further support this analysis, with conventional and inverted HTL-free devices showing improved stability compared with counterparts with an HTL (Supplementary Fig. 28). Capacitance–voltage (CV) and capacitance–frequency (CF) measurements indicate that devices with HTLs suffer from charge accumulation and capacitance build-up due to the unbalanced charge carrier mobility and the pinned RZ close to the HTL. Specifically, HTL-free devices feature a sharp drop in capacitance after turning on in CV measurements, whereas devices with an HTL feature a capacitance build-up (Supplementary Fig. 29). CF measurements, carried out after device turn on, also feature a higher capacitance at low frequencies in HTL-free devices (Supplementary Fig. 30). Both these characterizations demonstrate charge accumulation and capacitance build-up due to unbalanced charge carrier mobility and support the location of the RZ near the interface with the HTL.

Enabled by the discovery of a chiral polymeric material with improved hole mobility, it was found that the handedness of CP-EL could be controlled through the use of conventional and inverted F8BT:(P)-monoF[6]H CP-OLEDs, with or without HTLs (Fig. 2). Without an HTL (Fig. 2a,b), the RZ of OLEDs using F8BT:(P)-monoF[6]H is in the middle of the active layer. The measured CP-EL retains the same handedness irrespective of the device architecture (preferentially left handed for the P enantiomer of monoF[6]H, gEL CONV = +0.10 and gEL INV = +0.13). This is the same handedness as optically pumped CP photoluminescence (gPL = +0.24). Together with the fact that the handedness of CPL cannot be inverted by changing the current flow direction, this suggests NCPE for F8BT:(P)-monoF[6]H CP-OLEDs without an HTL (Supplementary Figs. 33 and 35). Consistent with this assignment, measurements on semitransparent devices show the same magnitude and handedness of CP-EL regardless of the measurement direction: gEL,ITO = +0.12 and gEL,Al = +0.10 in the case of conventional semitransparent devices (Supplementary Fig. 33) and gEL,ITO = +0.12 and gEL,Au = +0.10 for inverted semitransparent devices (Supplementary Fig. 35). This is also consistent with the handedness of CPL emitted from thin films on optical excitation at different geometries. NCPE restricts the total gEL of the device: the back electrode changes the phase of polarization, reversing its handedness and partially cancelling CPL emitted towards the transparent electrode (gEL < gPL). The small differences in gEL between conventional and inverted devices can be attributed to optical losses due to the attenuation of CPL propagating inside the device (Supplementary Note 3). For the same reason, the sum of gEL obtained from semitransparent devices does not match the gEL measured in devices with highly reflective electrodes.

In conventional devices with an HTL, the handedness of CP-EL inverts compared with devices without the HTL (Fig. 2c) and right-handed emission is preferred for the P enantiomer of monoF[6]H (gEL CONV = –0.40). By contrast, left-handed emission is still preferred for the P enantiomer of monoF[6]H when used in inverted devices with an HTL (gEL INV = +0.38; Fig. 2d). As such, the handedness of CPL is clearly inverted by changing the current flow direction for F8BT:(P)-monoF[6]H CP-OLEDs with an HTL, suggesting ACPE. Measurements using semitransparent devices showed that conventional devices with a TFB HTL gave opposite-handed CP-EL as a function of emission direction (gEL,ITO = −0.22 and gEL,Al = +0.23; Supplementary Fig. 34). Inverting the device structure when using TCTA as an HTL also results in opposite-handed CP-EL, but with the absolute handedness inverted relative to conventional devices with an HTL (gEL,ITO = 0.33 and gEL,Au = −0.27; Supplementary Fig. 36). The emission of CPL is non-reciprocal: CPL emitted towards the top electrode inverts handedness, partially combining with CPL emitted towards the ITO and increasing the measured gEL. This overcomes the theoretical limit of devices with only NCPE (gEL > gPL). Supplementary Fig. 37 evaluates the impact of HTL thickness in inverted devices, where the HTL is evaporated rather than solution processed. It is clear that the HTL thickness does not impact |gEL|, but it does impact the EL lineshape due to cavity effects22.

In summary, the electrical control of CP-EL handedness is observed simply through the addition or omission of an HTL within the device stack. Devices without an HTL show NCPE, whereas devices with an HTL show APCE. In all the devices (that is, with ACPE and NCPE), gEL is independent of current density, which is consistent with previous results in chiral polymer blends (Supplementary Fig. 38). Although the absolute gEL values achieved in this work are not the highest reported so far, they remain among the highest in the field. This impressive performance is accompanied by the first demonstration of electrical control over the emission mechanism (Supplementary Table 5), achieved through careful material and device design.

We suggest that the measured CP-EL from CP-OLEDs using our chiral blend materials can be described with contributions from both ACPE and NCPE18:

According to our previous theory and quantitative analysis of ACPE18, directional charge transport through chiral emissive layers induces OAM in CP-OLEDs23,24. We ignore the SAM of charge carriers because of negligible spin–orbital coupling in these organic polymers. There is a finite OAM transfer (\({\Delta l=l}_{{\rm{e}}}-{l}_{{\rm{h}}}\)) from charge carriers to photons during the electron–hole recombination process (Supplementary Note 2) and a given photon with finite Δl exhibits opposite handedness if it is emitted in opposite directions. Reversing the current directionality changes the sign of le (lh) due to the orbital-momentum locking in chiral materials18,23, and therefore, conventional and inverted devices emit CP-EL with opposite handedness. Through this mechanism, ACPE rationalizes the device-architecture-dependent CP-EL handedness in our devices that contain an HTL. When an HTL is used in conventional (HTL = TFB) or inverted (HTL = TCTA) devices, charge transport in the emissive layer is unbalanced towards electrons, pinning the RZ of the device to the HTL interface near the anode. Electrons injected from the cathode travel towards the HTL through the chiral active layer, recombining with holes at the interface. As such, in the presence of an HTL, electrons travel through the chiral active layer and gain OAM le, whereas holes travel through the achiral HTL and develop zero OAM (lh = 0). The finite OAM (\({\Delta l=l}_{{\rm{e}}}\)) developed through the electron flow leads to ACPE, which overrides any NCPE in the system.

In devices without an HTL, charge injection and the transport of electrons and holes are balanced, and the RZ is in the centre of the active layer (Fig. 3a). Inversion of CP-EL handedness is not observed when switching the current direction or as a function of emission direction. The handedness of emitted light is the same as optically pumped CPL emission. In this balanced scenario, electrons and holes carry similar finite OAM (\({l}_{{\rm{e}}}\approx {l}_{{\rm{h}}}\)); therefore, \(\Delta l\approx 0\), which suppresses ACPE. As such, only NCPE is observed. Thus, through adjusting the position of the RZ within a CP-OLED device using these materials, it is possible to tune the contribution of ACPE versus NCPE and, in turn, control the handedness of CP-EL for a fixed enantiomer of the emissive material.

a, NCPE occurs when there is balanced charge transport in the device through the omission of an HTL. b,c, ACPE occurs when charge transport is unbalanced towards electron transport through the addition of an HTL. For conventional devices, the RZ is close to the front electrode (b), whereas for inverted devices, the RZ is close to the back electrode (c). The positioning of the RZ controls the handedness of the ACPE through oppositely induced OAM.

The control of ACPE and NCPE in OLEDs requires a careful design of materials and devices. Materials capable of ACPE demonstrate a helical electron distribution such that the movement of charge carriers induces an OAM that is transferred to SAM in the emitted light. In the achiral luminescent polymer–chiral additive blend system considered here, twisted polymer backbones generate the appropriate topological electronic landscape. The additive should be designed such that it can induce a chiral phase and maintain the charge carrier properties of the achiral luminescent polymer. ACPE requires unbalanced, ambipolar charge transport in the emissive layer, which confines the RZ to a narrow region and pins the RZ position close to one of the electrodes. The RZ position is best controlled when the energy levels of the transport layer match those of the emissive layer, and requires selecting transport layers with a tuneable charge mobility.

We have demonstrated that CP-EL handedness from a chiral polymer LED can be controlled electrically by tuning the charge carrier mobility and the RZ position, without changing the handedness or composition of the active layer. CPL emission in CP-OLEDs does not simply originate from the same mechanism of optically excited transitions (NCPE). The origin of this effect appears to be adjusting the interplay of NCPE versus ACPE through adjusting the balance of induced OAM in electrons versus holes. On a practical level, this strategy provides a simple means to access CP-OLEDs with high levels of CP-EL, where left- or right-handed CP-EL is available from a single emissive enantiomer.

Notable advances in the asymmetric synthesis of helicenes25 means that it is increasingly simple to synthesize a single-enantiomer chiral additive. If a single-enantiomer additive can be used to generate CP-OLEDs of either CP-EL handedness, this new CP-OLED strategy avoids the need for laborious and poorly scalable separation of racemic chiral additives into their separate enantiomers for CP-OLED usage. Thus, this approach provides a paradigm shift in the realization of organic CP-LEDs with controllable SAM information, which should enable many of the promised applications, from display technologies to quantum information systems. On a fundamental level, this study provides further evidence of the rich physics at play in chiral optoelectronic systems and suggests a means to control induced OAM in charge carriers within chiral semiconducting materials. Combining ACPE with other strategies, such as multilayer OLEDs or chiral microcavities26, could also enable new ways to boost the dissymmetric response of CP-LEDs. There continues to be high interest in the interplay of chirality, charge and spin, including through the expanding studies concerning chiral-induced spin selectivity20, and this study provides further materials and device frameworks for the characterization of these phenomena.

Aza[6]H was synthesized according to a previous report14, and monoF[6]H according to the synthesis procedure in the Supplementary Information and separated using preparative chiral high-performance liquid chromatography. F8BT and TFB were provided by Cambridge Display Technology. 2,2′,2″-(1,3,5-Benzinetriyl)-tris(1-phenyl-1H-benzimidazole) (TPBi) and TCTA were provided by Ossila.

All the substrates were cleaned via subsequent sonication for 10 min in deionized water, acetone and isopropanol, followed by 7 min of oxygen-plasma treatment. F8BT and (P)-aza[6]helicene (aza[6]H) or (P)-4-fluoro[6]helicene (monoF[6]H) were dissolved in toluene at 30 mg ml−1 and blended to form a solution with 10% of chiral dopant. F8BT–chiral additive active layer blends were spin coated at different spin speeds (1,500–3,000 rpm) for 1 min to control the active-layer film thickness and annealed for 10 min in a nitrogen atmosphere (<0.1-ppm H2O and <0.1-ppm O2) at 140 °C. The film thickness was measured using a Dektak profilometer.

Hole-only devices for charge carrier mobilities were built on prepatterned ITO glass (120 nm, 10 Ω). Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) was spin coated to achieve a 50-nm-thick film. If used, TFB was spin coated at 1,000 rpm for 1 min and annealed for crosslinking. The F8BT–chiral inducer active layer blend was then spin coated following the same procedure for thin films. If included, TCTA was evaporated with a thickness of 25 nm. Finally, 10 nm of MoOx and 80 nm of Au were thermally evaporated, defining a device area of 0.045 cm2.

Electron-only devices for charge carrier mobilities were built on Al-prepatterned glass. The F8BT–chiral inducer active layer blend was then spin coated at 2,000 rpm following the same procedure for thin films. Further, if included in the device, 10 nm of TPBi was thermally evaporated. Finally, 10 nm of Ca and 100 nm of Al were thermally evaporated, defining a device area of 0.045 cm2.

Conventional OLEDs were fabricated on prepatterned ITO glass (120 nm, 10 Ω). PEDOT:PSS was spin coated to achieve a 50-nm-thick film. If included in the device structure, TFB was spin coated at 1,000 rpm for 1 min and annealed at 180 °C for crosslinking. The active layer was then spin coated at 2,000 rpm following the same procedure for thin films. Finally, the device was completed with the thermal evaporation of 25 nm of TPBi, 10 nm of Ca and 100 nm of Al, defining an active device area of 0.045 cm2.

Inverted OLEDs were fabricated on prepatterned ITO glass (120 nm, 10 Ω). ZnO and ethoxylated polyethylenimine (PEIE) were spin coated following the already reported procedure. The active layer was then spin coated at 2,000 rpm following the same procedure for thin films. Finally, the device was completed with the thermal evaporation of TCTA, 10 nm of MoOx and 80 nm of Au, defining an active device area of 0.045 cm2.

CD measurements of thin films were carried out with a Chirascan (Applied Photophysics) spectrophotometer. CP photoluminescence was measured with a custom-built setup, using an achromatic quarter-wave plate (Thorlabs) and a linear polarizer with a 180° configuration (transmittance). Atomic force microscopy was measured using an Asylum MFP 3D device. Mueller matrix polarimetry in the transmission mode was carried out at the B23 beamline27 at the Diamond Light Source.

Current–voltage–luminance (J–V–L) characterizations were carried out using a Keithley 2400 device and a Konica Minolta LS-160 luminance meter, with the emission profile assumed to be Lambertian. The external quantum efficiency of the system was determined from the J–V–L characteristics and EL spectra, assuming Lambertian emission.

The CP-EL spectra were measured using a super-achromatic quarter-wave plate (Thorlabs SAQWP05M-700) and a visible wire grid linear polarizer (Thorlabs WP25M-VIS) placed in front of an Ocean Optics FL-4000 charge-coupled spectrophotometer, as previously reported28, and driving the device at a constant current (1 mA). The setup is automated via the integration of a rotation mount (Thorlabs ELL14K), ensuring the acquisition of left- and right-handed CP emission spectra in a time interval of <0.5 s to avoid potential gEL artefacts due to device degradation. The quarter-wave plate is rotated with respect to the polarizer to avoid artefacts due to the relative orientation of the linear polarizer and the internal optical components of the charge-coupled spectrometer. This methodology ensures that the quarter-wave plate and polarizer are always correctly positioned, preventing unintentional birefringence or polarization artefacts that would otherwise need angle-dependent measurements and depolarization corrections. The dissymmetry factor (gEL) was calculated using the equation gEL = 2(IL − IR)/(IL + IR) at the maximum of the emission, with IL and IR being the left-handed and right-handed emission intensities, respectively.

The efficacy of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) is limited by challenges of delivery and potency. We enhance AMP performance in the lung by converting AMPs to a peptibody format that fuses AMPs with fragment crystallizable domains to activate innate immunity and cathelin domains for infection-responsive activation, with their mRNA constructs delivered by anti-inflammatory lipid nanoparticles. The highest-scoring design outperforms antibiotic therapy approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in multidrug-resistant pneumonia models, eradicating representative MDR bacteria while mitigating inflammation.

Over 1,000 Amazon employees have anonymously signed an open letter warning that the company's allegedly “all-costs-justified, warp-speed approach to AI development” could cause “staggering damage to democracy, to our jobs, and to the earth,” an internal advocacy group announced on Wednesday.

Four members of Amazon Employees for Climate Justice tell WIRED that they began asking workers to sign the letter last month. After reaching their initial goal, the group published on Wednesday the job titles of the Amazon employees who signed and disclosed that more than 2,400 supporters from other organizations, including Google and Apple, have also joined in.

Backers inside Amazon include high-ranking engineers, senior product leaders, marketing managers, and warehouse staff spanning many divisions of the company. A senior engineering manager with over 20 years at Amazon says they signed because they believe a manufactured “race” to build the best AI has empowered executives to trample workers and the environment.

“The current generation of AI has become almost like a drug that companies like Amazon obsess over, use as a cover to lay people off, and use the savings to pay for data centers for AI products no one is paying for,” says the employee, who like others in this story, asked to remain anonymous because they feared retaliation from their bosses.

Amazon, along with other big tech companies, is in the midst of investing billions of dollars to construct new data centers to train and run generative AI systems. This includes tools helping workers write code and consumer-facing services such as Amazon's shopping chatbot, Rufus. It's easy to see why Amazon is pursuing AI. Last month, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy announced that Rufus was on track to increase Amazon's sales by $10 billion annually. It “is continuing to get better and better,” he said.

AI systems demand significant power, which has forced utility companies to turn to coal plants and other carbon-emitting sources of energy to support the data center boom. The open letter demands that Amazon abandon carbon fuel sources at its data centers, bar its AI technologies from being used to carry out surveillance and mass deportation, and stop forcing employees to use AI in their work. “We, the undersigned Amazon employees, have serious concerns about this aggressive rollout during the global rise of authoritarianism and our most important years to reverse the climate crisis,” the letter states.

Amazon spokesperson Brad Glasser says that the company remains committed to its goal of reaching net-zero carbon emissions by 2040. “We recognize that progress will not always be linear, but we remain focused on serving our customers better, faster, and with fewer emissions,” he says, repeating earlier company statements. Glasser didn't address employee concerns about internal AI tools or external uses of the technology.

The letter represents a rare instance of tech employee activism during a year rocked by President Donald Trump's return to power. His administration has rolled back labor protections, climate policies, and AI regulations. The measures have left some workers feeling uneasy about speaking out about what they perceive as unethical conduct by their employers. Many are also concerned about job security as automation threatens entry-level software engineering and marketing roles.

A number of organizations around the world have tried to advocate for a slowdown in AI development. In 2023, hundreds of prominent scientists petitioned the biggest AI companies to pause work on the technology for six months and evaluate potentially catastrophic harms stemming from it. The campaigns have generated scant success, and companies continue to rapidly release new, increasingly powerful AI models.

But despite the challenging political environment, members of the climate justice group at Amazon say they felt they had to try to combat potential harms from AI. Their strategy, in part, is to focus less on longer-term worries about AI that is more capable than humans, in favor of putting more emphasis on consequences they argue must be confronted now. Members say they are not against AI—in fact, they are optimistic about the technology, but want companies to take a more thoughtful approach to how they deploy it.

“It's not just about what will happen if they succeed in developing superintelligence,” says a decade-long veteran in Amazon's entertainment business. “What we're trying to say is, look, the costs we're paying now aren't worth it. We are in the few remaining years to avoid catastrophic warming.”

Rallying support for the open letter was more difficult than in previous years, workers say, because Amazon has increasingly restricted employees' ability to solicit people to sign petitions. The majority of signers for the new letter came from reaching out to colleagues outside of work, the organizers tell WIRED.

Orin Starn, an anthropologist at Duke University who spent two years undercover as an Amazon warehouse worker, says the moment is ripe for taking on the giant. “Many people have tired of brazen billionaire excess and a company with nothing more than cosmetic PR concern about climate change, AI, immigrant rights, and the lives of its own workers,” he says.

Two of the Amazon employees say executives are minimizing problems with the company's internal AI tools and glossing over how dissatisfied workers are with them.

Some engineers are under pressure to use AI to double their productivity or else risk losing their jobs, according to a software development engineer in Amazon's cloud computing division. But the engineer says that Amazon's tools for writing code and technical documentation aren't good enough to reach such ambitious targets. Another employee calls the AI outputs “slop.”

The open letter calls for Amazon to establish “ethical AI working groups” involving rank-and-file workers who would have a voice in how emerging technologies are used in their job duties. They also want a say in how AI might be used to automate aspects of their roles. Last month, a surge of workers began signing the letter after Amazon announced it would be cutting about 14,000 jobs to better meet the demands of the AI era. Amazon employed nearly 1.58 million people as of September, down from a peak of over 1.6 million at the end of 2021.

The climate justice group intentionally targeted reaching their signature milestone ahead of the Black Friday shopping bonanza, aiming to remind the public about the cost of the technology powering one of the world's biggest online shopping platforms. The group believes it can have an impact because labor unions, including in nursing, government, and education, have successfully fought to have a say over how AI is used in their fields.

The Amazon employee group, which formed in 2018, claims credit for influencing some of the company's environmental pledges through a series of walkouts, shareholder proposals, and petitions, including one in 2019 that drew over 8,700 employee signatures.

Glasser, the Amazon spokesperson, says climate goals and projects were in the works long before the advocacy group emerged. What no one disputes, however, is the scale of the challenges ahead. The activists note that Amazon's emissions have grown about 35 percent since 2019, and they want a new detailed plan established to reach the company's goal of net-zero by 2040.

The activists say what they have received from Amazon recently is uninspiring. One of the employees says that several weeks ago, at a companywide meeting, an executive stated that demand for data centers would grow 10-fold by 2027. The executive went on to tout a new strategy for cutting water usage at the facilities by 9 percent. “That's such a drop in the bucket,” the worker says. “I would love to talk about the 10 times more energy part and where we are going to get that.”

Glasser, the Amazon spokesperson, says, “Amazon is already committed to powering our operations even more sustainably and investing in carbon-free energy.”

The University of Washington is powering up its vision for a brighter, more sustainable future with a newly completed solar canopy installed in a sprawling parking lot north of Husky Stadium.

The 84-kilowatt solar array is paired with Level 2 EV charging that can accommodate 20 vehicles simultaneously. The $3.7 million project includes electrical infrastructure to support the future installation of panels capable of nearly 30 times more power generation — up to 2.5 megawatts. That's enough capacity to power roughly 2,000 homes.

The solar canopy is a pilot project supporting the UW's goals to cut its carbon footprint, said Mark Huppert, interim director of UW Transportation Services. 

“Located on the site of the former Montlake landfill, the pilot demonstrates how the land can be put to work to achieve more sustainable outcomes,” Huppert said via email.

Trinity Energy, a Seattle-area clean energy company, partnered with the university on the project. 

“Generating solar power from a parking lot may sound modest, but the strategic value is enormous,” said Darin Leonard, president of Trinity Energy, in a statement.

The installation is connected to electrical grids powering the City of Seattle and the UW's campus. The ability to generate energy onsite can curb the university's reliance on the utility grid while reducing the impacts of power outages and fluctuating electricity costs, Trinity noted.

The idea for the project grew out of a collaboration between the student organization UW Solar; Anne Eskridge, the retired director of UW Transportation Services; and Jan Whittington, director of the UW's Urban Infrastructure Lab. 

The university is currently drafting its 2050 Sustainability Action Plan, which includes the long-term expansion of the parking lot solar canopies. 

The UW Solar students “will continue to support the efforts to achieve the vision of a complete build-out,” Huppert said.  

The project was funded by UW Transportation Services, Seattle City Light and Washington state's Climate Commitment Act, administered through the Washington State Department of Commerce's electric vehicle charging program.

Artificial intelligence startup xAI, founded by Elon Musk, told city and county planners in Memphis last week that it plans to build a solar farm next to its Colossus data center — one of the world's largest facilities for training AI models.

The project would occupy 88 acres to the west and to the south of the data center. A 136-acre vacant lot owned by the developer that also owns the Colossus property currently borders the site. Given the proposed size, the solar farm would likely produce around 30 megawatts of electricity, only about 10% of the data center's estimated power use.

Musk's company has come under fire for operating over 400 megawatts of natural gas turbines without permits, according to the Southern Environmental Law Center (SELC). The legal organization, which is working with the NAACP, says that xAI has operated at least 35 turbines capable of emitting more than 2,000 tons of NOX pollution — nitrogen oxide emissions that contribute to smog and respiratory problems — annually.

The turbines have sparked fierce opposition from residents in nearby Boxtown, a predominantly Black community where researchers at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, found that peak nitrogen dioxide concentration levels increased by 79% in areas immediately surrounding the data center after xAI began operations. Community activists have reported increased asthma attacks and respiratory issues since the facility opened.

The AI company has said that it intends to use the turbines until it can secure additional power, but local officials gave xAI a permit to operate 15 turbines through January 2027.

In September, xAI said it would build a 100-megawatt solar farm nearby, which will be paired with 100 megawatts of grid-scale batteries to provide a 24/7 source of electricity.

The company hasn't disclosed the total cost of that project, but the solar farm's developer, Seven States Power Corporation, was awarded $439 million from the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Of that, $414 million is an interest-free loan.

The federal award is notable given that many clean energy grants and loans have been canceled by the Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Energy under the Trump administration. 

Meanwhile, xAI has added gas turbines in Mississippi to power its Colossus 2 data center. So far, 59 of them are on-site, and the company considers 18 of them temporary, meaning that regulators don't track their pollution.

Clinical trials are designed to treat a very specific subclass of individuals; pharmaceutical companies very carefully choose that subclass in an attempt to help ensure the clinical trials are successful, which is a combination of the following:- Positive, statistically-significant results.
- FDA approval with those results.
- Insurance companies willing to pay for the given treatment.
- A decent-sized addressable market.Examples of drugs/medical technologies later getting other indications: 
- Minoxidil was a drug that only later got its approval to be used as a hair loss treatment; there are currently clinical trials for a more "advanced" minoxidil oral pill for this use case. 
- Re: GLP-1s: Tirzepatide later got an indication that it effectively treats sleep apnea. There are very many other clinical trials ongoing for GLP-1s, but perhaps most recently, Semaglutide (ozempic) failed to show statistical significance as a treatment for Alzheimer's.
- The Galleri blood screening/test. The initial indication they are going for is folk who are at highest risk for cancer (I believe that's individuals between the ages of 50 and 70); however, that's not to say it would be bad for individuals younger or older. But, this is a way to help ensure the earliest product has a successful outcome.These are ones I know off the top of my head, but I suspect an LLM can give several more examples.

Nobody knows what migraine really is, so this isn't a surprise to them that GLP-1 may help, the main question is; why? So they have another data point proving that gut health has a direct correlation to the brain.Keep in mind that a lot of the benefits go away once patients come off GLP-1 and we have not seen any studies yet on what happens to people who come off it for long term effects. It may in fact make things even worse and for a lot of people, they may have to stay on it for the rest of their lives.

Beyond what others have commented already, especially on obesity and cardiovascular disease, I have to correct this specifically, because it is a very common and honestly understandable misunderstanding people have about these drugs.While only having appeared in the public consciousness comparatively recently, this class of drugs has been in use for two decades at this stage [0], showcasing a very solid safety profile with well established side-effects [1].Continued research is important, as is proper prescription and use under the care of a Medical Professional up-to-date on current day evidence based practices (as is the case with all interventions), but to have a proper discussion about these, we shouldn't spread myths such as this being "quickly pushed" out, as these have undergone the clinical trials and regulations established across multiple agencies from multiple governments [2].Again, it is understandable why these are considered rather new or appeared suddenly, especially if one doesn't take a look into their approval, but I don't see any evidence for them being rushed out or anything of the sort.[0] https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK572151/[1] https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5397288/[2] https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6667915/

Another example: low dose metformin is largely considered beneficial for most people, at least in a small way. But very few people who aren't diabetic take it, as the drawback of possible side effects outweighs the potential benefit for someone who doesn't have symptoms in the first place.Same thing here. Would it benefit you? Possibly. Do the risks of side effects outweigh that benefit for someone without symptoms? Also possibly.

The overwhelming benefits from GLP-1 are courtesy of weight loss and better blood sugar control. Get those two things under control, with or without GLP-1 drugs, and an enormous array of complications are made less likely.For people with healthy, ideal diets at an optimal weight and with good blood sugar control, there are only remote, hypothetical benefits. There is some evidence it reduces inflammation and might ward off neurodegenerative disorders, but those likely have more of a relationship with blood sugar spikes, and again lifestyle changes are more impactful.

(Except I'll note that's true for more than one hormone, as tirzepatide is both a GLP1 and GIP agonist, and I believe retatrutide is also Glucagon?)

  “We think that, by modulating cerebrospinal fluid pressure and reducing intracranial venous sinuses compression, these drugs produce a decrease in the release of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), a key migraine-promoting peptide”, Dr Braca explained. “That would pose intracranial pressure control as a brand-new, pharmacologically targetable pathway.”

I'm not sure I understand what that means, but I wonder if this would work for people who are not obese?

What has helped, interestingly, is supplemented creatine HCl (she went with hcl because it's absorbed substantially faster than monohydrate). We've learned that depletion of neural ATP levels can result in an energy crisis which results in cortical spreading depression, which stimulates the release of CGRP. (https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/spreading-...)She's found that a) daily supplementation of creatine has reduced her headache days, and b) an immediate dose of creatine upon onset of a headache frequently aborts or mitigates it. Her need for the gepants has dropped to a tiny fraction of what it was prior to starting creatine.She's tried everything under the sun, had all the scans, tried all the meds and procedures, and creatine and gepants are the only things she's found that have worked. She's not a placebo responder, and hasn't responded to about a zillion other therapies, so we're pretty sure it's not just placebo effect.

I started medication to treat the BP -- telmisartan and amlodipine -- and my BP dropped from 150+/120+ to 115/80. The migraines completely disappeared. I still infrequently get the visual aura that would traditionally precede a migraine, but nothing follows. I haven't had a migraine in the years I've had my BP under control.

After Myanmar's military junta raided a notorious scam compound and destroyed buildings with explosives in October, officials claimed the country would entirely “eradicate” forced scamming within its borders. Now newly released satellite images of the targeted KK Park scam center reveal that only buildings in one limited section of the compound were destroyed during the initial raids. Experts on scam compounds, meanwhile, say the entire effort is likely “propaganda.”

High-resolution images of the KK Park scam compound, which is located near the Myanmar-Thailand border, show how military forces have razed multiple buildings, leaving piles of rubble in their place. However, the images show the destruction is, so-far, confined to the Eastern side of the gigantic compound—with hundreds of buildings across the vast compound being left untouched.

Multiple experts tell WIRED that the raids at KK Park and some other scam compounds are likely part of a wider “performative” effort by Myanmar's military government, which has come under increasing pressure to tackle the highly lucrative scam compounds that have flourished in recent years. They also raise concerns about the welfare of thousands of people forced to run scams in KK Park.

“The junta is making it sound as though they're taking down the entire compound, and the imagery that we have seen so far is only limited to one section,” says Eric Heintz, a global analyst at the International Justice Mission, an anti-slavery organization. “It's important to keep monitoring this to verify what they're actually doing and [see] if this is just for show or if they're actually cracking down on the real problem.”

The satellite images, taken on November 16, appear to show that some buildings located around courtyards have been almost totally destroyed, with debris strewn around other buildings. Heintz says that the images, plus extra social media footage, indicates that some “villas” and dormitories where trafficking victims may have been housed appear to have been damaged or destroyed. (Myanmar's military government has said further destruction started on November 17; third-party reports also suggest more buildings have been destroyed).

“All of the critical buildings that you would need to perpetrate the scams are still intact and still ready for use,” says Mechelle B Moore, the CEO of anti-trafficking nonprofit Global Alms, which is based in Thailand and works to help people who have trafficked into scam compounds in Myanmar. “They're putting on a good show right now to say that they don't support scamming compounds or human trafficking. But what they've allowed is all the scamming syndicates—all of the scamming bosses and supervisors—have been allowed to flee,” Moore claims.

Over the past decade, dozens of scam compounds have appeared in Southeast Asia, primarily across Myanmar, Cambodia, and Laos. Often operated by or linked to Chinese organized crime groups, the compounds trick people into working at them—often with the offer of high-paying jobs—and then force them to run a range of scams. Trafficking victims often have their passports taken; they can be tortured or beaten if they refuse to scam. By stealing from people around the world, the compounds have made billions for the organized crime groups.

Amid the extensive criminality, KK Park has emerged as one of the largest and most notorious scam compounds in Myanmar. Five years ago, the site was a series of fields near the town of Myawaddy, but has since been transformed into a sprawling compound with hundreds of buildings and thousands of people held there.

Myanmar's military junta has been conducting raids on KK Park since the middle of October and on the Shwe Kokko compound since mid-November. The sites are linked to “telecom” fraud and illegal gambling operations, government statements say. A statement from Myanmar's Ministry of Information published online on Wednesday says officials are “dismantling and removing illegal buildings, and taking further action in accordance with the law.”

The statement claims that officials are demolishing buildings in three areas of KK Park, and since the raids began a “a total of 237 buildings out of 635 illegal buildings have so far been demolished.” It says that 1,847 “undocumented foreign entrants” have been detained, along with more than 3,000 computers, 21,000 mobile phones, and 102 Starlink satellite internet systems. Multiple Myanmar government departments did not immediately respond to WIRED's request for comment. A member of Myanmar's London embassy said they would prefer to discuss the topic in person, which was not viable ahead of publication, but did not otherwise comment.

“From 30 January to 25 November 2025, a total of 12,687 foreign nationals who had entered Myanmar illegally were detained,” the junta's Ministry of Information statement says. “Of these, 12,343 individuals were screened to be expelled, and 10,029 were systematically repatriated to their respective countries through Thailand in accordance with legal procedures.”

Alongside multiple government statements, the Associated Press reports that state television in Myanmar has been broadcasting “extensive” video footage of buildings being dismantled in KK Park, and the unusually detailed reports “appear to reflect the military government's desire to publicize its efforts after months of bad publicity.” Some video footage shows steamrollers crushing thousands of smartphones and computers.

“This is really performative, and it continues to be the case,” says Jason Tower, a senior expert at the Global Initiative Against Transnational Organized Crime. “I think around 20,000 devices were destroyed, which is tragic in terms of just mass amounts of evidence lost.”

Myanmar's recent high-profile crackdown on KK Park and the Shwe Kokko compounds could be driven by multiple reasons, the experts WIRED spoke to say. The United States government has recently set up a Scam Center Strike Force that has targeted the infrastructure and organizations allegedly behind the compounds, including sanctioning armed groups that support the military regime in Myanmar for their alleged involvement in the criminality. China has also extradited an alleged criminal boss who is linked to scam centers and sentenced others to death. The military government is also holding a widely criticized election in December.

“The new sanctions have put a lot of pressure on the Myanmar military to try to do something in response to this. But this is definitely a propaganda scheme,” Moore says. “We have several different groups that are being held in scamming compounds. Groups of victims that are too scared to leave, even though the crime syndicates have left or they're being held under guard and they're not allowed to leave.”

Tower says another development, which is more significant than the military junta action, has come from anti-government, resistance groups also starting to disrupt scam compounds; he points to one group, the Karen National Liberation Army, recently taking over a compound. “I think this was the first time on the Karen border that you've seen resistance forces really step in to put pressure on the military and to take this issue up as part of their revolutionary activity,” Tower says.

Meanwhile, Heintz says that when people enslaved in scam compounds are freed or escape, authorities need to properly class them as victims of human trafficking and not treat them as criminals themselves. “It's crucial that every individual undergoes a proper victim screening and identification process to ensure that trafficking survivors receive the protection and justice they deserve,” he says, “and that critical intelligence is secured and used to stop these criminal trafficking networks.”

Several public websites designed to allow courts across the United States and Canada to manage the personal information of potential jurors had a simple security flaw that easily exposed their sensitive data, including names and home addresses, TechCrunch has exclusively learned.

A security researcher, who asked not to be named for this story, contacted TechCrunch with details of the easy-to-exploit vulnerability, and identified at least a dozen juror websites made by government software maker Tyler Technologies that appear to be vulnerable, given that they run on the same platform. 

The sites are all over the country, including California, Illinois, Michigan, Nevada, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas, and Virginia.

Tyler told TechCrunch that it is fixing the flaw after we alerted the company to the information exposures.

The bug meant it was possible for anyone to obtain the information about jurors who are selected for service. To log into these platforms, a juror is provided a unique numerical identifier assigned to them, which could be brute-forced since the number was sequentially incremental. The platform also did not have any mechanism to prevent anyone from flooding the login pages with a large number of guesses, a feature known as “rate-limiting.”

In early November, the security researcher told TechCrunch that they identified at least one jury management portal for a county in Texas as vulnerable. Inside that portal, TechCrunch saw full names, dates of birth, occupation, email addresses, cell phone numbers, and home and mailing addresses.

Other exposed data included information shared in the questionnaires that potential jurors are required to fill out to see if they are qualified to serve on a jury.

In the portal seen by TechCrunch, the questions asked about the person's gender, ethnicity, education level, employer, marital status, children, if the person was a citizen, whether they were older than 18, and whether they have been convicted or faced indictment for a theft or felony. 

The vulnerability could have exposed personal health data inside a juror's profile in some cases. For example, if a juror had requested to be exempted from service for health reasons, they may have disclosed what medical reason they think disqualifies them. TechCrunch saw an example of that, too.

TechCrunch alerted Tyler of the issue on November 5. Tyler acknowledged the vulnerability on November 25.

In a statement, Tyler spokesperson Karen Shields said that the company's security team confirmed “a vulnerability exists where some juror information may have been accessible via a brute force attack.”

“We have developed a remediation to prevent unauthorized access and are communicating next steps with our clients,” the statement said.

The spokesperson did not respond to a series of follow-up questions, including whether Tyler has the technical means to determine if there was any malicious access to jurors' personal information, and whether it plans to notify people whose data was exposed. 

This is not the first time Tyler left sensitive personal data exposed on the internet. In 2023, a security researcher found that, due to a separate security flaw, some U.S. online court record systems exposed sealed, confidential, and sensitive data, such as witness lists and testimony, mental health evaluations, detailed allegations of abuse, and corporate trade secrets. 

In that case, Tyler fixed vulnerabilities in its Case Management System Plus product, which was used across the state of Georgia. 

Two other government technology providers were exposing data in that case: Catalis, through its CMS360 product, a system used across several U.S. states; and Henschen & Associates, through its CaseLook court record system, used in Ohio.

Jonathan Duncan has applied to roughly 200 jobs since getting laid off in May after working at Microsoft for more than two decades. The response has been silence.

“Not a squeak,” Duncan told GeekWire. He's tried adapting resumes for each role, subscribing to job alerts, networking with peers, and internal referrals. Nothing has worked.

He's not alone. Experienced tech professionals across the industry are learning they're not immune to Big Tech's widespread layoffs — and that finding a new job isn't as easy as it used to be.

For years, tech workers were told there was a talent shortage. Recruiters chased them. But in 2025, leaders who built their whole careers on growing headcount and mastering organizational processes are getting “mowed down right now in stunning numbers,” said Laura Close, CEO of Close Cohen, a job search and executive coaching firm.

Close said some “super high-value professionals” she works with are taking 12-to-18 months to find a new job. 

“The golden age of the quick turnaround is over,” she said.

And in an industry that “equates youth with innovation and stamina,” Close said longtime workers are finding that their previous success metrics are no longer valued — decades of expertise have become liabilities, not assets.

“What we're seeing right now is ageism on steroids,” Close said. She noted that in tech, age-related bias often begins as early as 40 — earlier than many assume. 

A cooling market

Allison Shrivastava, an economist with Indeed, said it's difficult for anyone trying to get hired — from new college grads to more veteran workers.

“If you've been trying to get a job or change jobs in a tech-related field, you're probably really, really struggling,” she said. 

While unemployment broadly remains low, the amount of time that people remain unemployed is increasing, Shrivastava said.

More than 114,000 tech workers have been laid off this year so far, compared to nearly 153,000 workers in 2024 and nearly 265,000 in 2023, according to Layoffs.fyi. The pace has slowed from 2023's peak, but the cuts continue.

Seattle-area tech giants Microsoft and Amazon have announced major workforce reductions in 2025. Both companies are investing heavily in AI infrastructure while emphasizing efficiency.

As a senior manager at Microsoft, Duncan said budgets were recently slashed across the board — training, travel, morale-building. When people left, they weren't replaced. Every quarter brought new demands to return unspent funds.

He also noticed what he calls “underleveling” — senior director roles being posted at lower levels than before, manager positions offered at what used to be individual contributor levels.

“I think the days of high-paying tech jobs are drying up,” he said.

Shrivastava said the current layoffs are likely a “shedding” from a massive over-hire during the post-pandemic tech boom, not necessarily an AI restructuring story. 

But at the same time, as The Wall Street Journal reported, many companies are betting that AI can help them grow — without growing headcount.

‘Who am I?‘

For many of these workers, the timing couldn't be worse with aging parents, kids heading to college, and retirement on the horizon.

“I consider this the most expensive time of my life,” Duncan said. His eldest son is a sophomore in college, and his youngest starts next fall. He's also pricing out family plans for insurance for the first time.

And then there's the stock compensation. When Duncan was laid off, he had hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of unvested Microsoft shares.

“That was the kids' college funds,” he said. 

Nancy Poznoff, an executive coach at Close Cohen, said financial pressure is compounding an identity crisis for many laid-off executives.

“They've been high performers their whole career,” Poznoff said. “They've followed all the rules. They've done what they were supposed to do. And now they're suddenly having this identity crisis on top of it, because a lot of them have been at their company for so long, they have this fear around, ‘How do I operate when I'm not at Amazon?' Like, ‘Who am I?'”

“So you've got this financial pressure, and then you've got this ego bomb,” she added. “It's a really tough time.”

Duncan still talks to his former teammates at Microsoft. The stress inside, he says, is brutal. He's not sure he'd want to go back — even if he could.

Angus Norton, a former Microsoft and Amazon exec, recently wrote about the toll of perpetual layoffs on those who remain.

“It creates a hierarchy of fear. Everyone becomes a potential target. Everyone knows someone who was let go despite stellar performance,” he wrote. “The message is clear: no one is safe.”

RealPage made it so that landlords were less competitive and more cooperative. Landlords would share proprietary information and then RealPage would help them all set prices collectively. It's just old fashioned price fixing with a SaaS and an algorithm.So the difference is using pricing info to beat your competitors vs using pricing info to collude with your competitors.

The way competitors legally message each other to suggest a price increase is via the prices themselves.E.g. an airline wants to raise the price of a ticket from New York to Los Angeles from $500 to $530 -- and they secretly want the other airlines to follow them and raise their prices too.1) The airline submits the price increase to the global travel reservation system that all airlines can see. All the other airlines have computers constantly monitoring all the other airlines' ticket prices and can instantly adjust prices in response.2) The airline that wants the price increase waits to see how the other airlines respond.  Either (1) the competitor airlines keeps their lower prices to "take market share" -- or -- (2) they also raise their prices to match which "maintains status quo of market share" but all competitors get to take advantage of charging the higher price3) If the other airlines don't match the higher price, the airline that "proposed" the higher price then rolls it back to $500.  All this can happen within a few hours.That's the way competitors "collude" to raise prices out in the open.  The publicly visible prices are the messaging system.  The loophole here is that the changing prices must be visible because the potential passengers buying the tickets need to see them too.The above scenario has been studied by various papers and the government.  The prices simultaneously act as both a "cost to buy" and as a "message to cooperate".Legal "collusion" via price signals is easier in concentrated industries with few competitors (e.g. airlines).  It's harder for fragmented markets or markets with hundreds-to-thousands of competitors.  E.g. a barbershop wanting to raise the price of haircuts by $5 isn't going to get the hundred other barbershops to also raise their prices by $5.

2) The airline that wants the price increase waits to see how the other airlines respond.  Either (1) the competitor airlines keeps their lower prices to "take market share" -- or -- (2) they also raise their prices to match which "maintains status quo of market share" but all competitors get to take advantage of charging the higher price3) If the other airlines don't match the higher price, the airline that "proposed" the higher price then rolls it back to $500.

1. How is this any different than other sorts of transactions that occur on a recurring basis? For instance dog walking services or personal trainers? Such vendors are also presumably pricing their services based on what everyone else's pricing is, but any subsequent price changes aren't public.2. Under current competition law, whether something is an "open market" is irrelevant to whether a given pricing strategy is illegal or not. Collusion doesn't magically become legal because it's done on the open market.

Artificial Intelligence has been a buzzword in the auto industry, not just as a solution for ever-increasing costs in developing new electric vehicles, but also to speed up development times, reduce the number of prototypes developed, and make system updates more quickly. However, some companies are still finding it difficult to fit AI and software-developed products into their existing corporate structures.

Former GM Chief AI Officer Barak Turovsky announced on November 21 in a LinkedIn post that he'd resigned from his position of eight months. That was confirmed by General Motors the following Monday by CIO Drive, The Detroit News, and other outlets.

Formerly an AI executive at Google and, most recently, Cisco, Turovsky wrote in his post, “Physical AI is just as exciting as LLMs,” while adding that he would be taking “a little sabbatical to work on some exciting new ideas.”

His profile also shows his previous experience at IBM and PayPal, while he remains on the advisory committee at VentureBeat and is now an operating advisor at Bessemer Venture Partners.

Turovsky's departure after less than a year is another blow for GM's technology expertise as it pivots back to internal combustion engine vehicles, hastily adds hybrids, and moves more production to the United States after years of electric vehicle development was thrown for a loop by the Trump Administration's tariff actions this year and the end of the federal EV tax credits in September. While GM is likely to remain a second-place EV seller in the US behind Tesla, declining sales in China and a steep drop projected in the US in the fourth quarter of 2025 spell trouble for the largest of the Big 2.5 automakers. 

Compounding problems is GM's persistent employee reorganization following domestic policy changes. Its Software and Services team gained a new leader in former Aurora Innovation co-founder and ex-Tesla Autopilot executive Sterling Anderson at the beginning of this month after former head Dave Richardson, himself a former Apple executive, stepped down at the end of October, according to WardsAuto.

While GM is rolling out a new AI assistant and a more sophisticated version of its SuperCruise advanced driver assistant system in the coming years, those were developed under previous teams. The automaker is still bracing for more difficult times with a round of layoffs in recent months that included hundreds of positions on both EV battery and vehicle manufacturing lines, as well as hundreds of white-collar employees.

And it's unclear where software-developed vehicles will land with automakers going forward, as EVs are struggling to achieve the projected levels of adoption in several large markets, and consumers get more price-conscious amid economic uncertainty. Some companies, like GM, are continuing to push AI and AV technology development even if cutting costs moves even higher up the priority list.

Archaeologists working in the ancient Egyptian city of Tanis have revealed a funerary mystery: hundreds of figurines with the name of an unexpected pharaoh.

A French archaeological mission headed by Sorbonne University's Frédéric Payraudeau found 225 funerary statuettes of King Shoshenq III, but not in his tomb—in King Osorkon II's. The finding confirms that the pharaoh expected quite the pampered afterlife and hints at a potential musical-chairs situation of ancient Egyptian tombs in Tanis, near the modern-day city of San el-Hagar.

Funerary statuettes, known as ushabti, were meant to work at the behest of the gods in place of the deceased individual. The team found Shoshenq III's ushabti and new inscriptions on the walls of the northern chamber of Osorkon II's tomb, according to a social media post by Egypt's Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities. They were in their original positions, in silt, and near a previously discovered granite coffin whose owner was still unknown.

Both Shoshenq III and Osorkon II were pharaohs from the 22nd Dynasty, which lasted from around 945 to 730 BCE during ancient Egypt's Third Intermediate Period (around 1069 to 525 BCE), the last of three periods best known for disunity. In fact, Shoshenq III's “reign was long but difficult, with a bloody dynastic war between kings of the North [himself] and two kings in the south [his cousins] of Egypt,” Payraudeau told Live Science. According to the ministry, Shoshenq III was one of the most important 22nd Dynasty kings and built many of Tanis' most significant buildings.

Osorkon II's tomb was already famous thanks to a collection of “treasures” known as the Tanis Treasures found in 1939, now at the Egyptian Museum in Tahrir. The archaeologists made the discovery while preparing for a conservation project.

It is still not certain whether Shoshenq III was buried inside Osorkon II's tomb or if his burial goods were moved there to keep them safe from theft, said Hisham Hussein, head of the Central Administration of Antiquities of the Maritime Region, as cited by the ministry's post. However, Payraudeau told Live Science that “the presence of the shabtis near the anonymous sarcophagus and also inscriptions on the connected wall indicates clearly that [Shoshenq III] was buried here and not in his own tomb.”

Yes, the man had his own tomb in Tanis, but some relics within it carry the name of Shoshenq IV, a ruler of the 23rd dynasty, according to Artnet. If Shoshenq IV wasn't originally buried in Osorkon II, contrary to what Payraudeau says, the outlet posits whether Shoshenq IV might have moved him.

Moving forward, the team plans to study the newly discovered inscriptions. I, for one, would just like to point out that Mr. Shoshenq III didn't plan for just a few helpers in the afterlife—he wanted (at least) 225.

Compare that to something with no real off-ramp: testosterone replacement therapy. Once you're on TRT, you can permanently suppress your body's own testosterone production, and many men won't produce enough on their own afterward.

Bariatric surgery shows 25-65% significant regain rates depending on definition and timeframe. And regular dieting is even worse. Nobody would frame that as a safety issue. That's... just how weight loss works, not a unique GLP-1 problem.Calling a return of symptoms (obesity) a "safety issue" is like saying insulin has "no safe off-ramp" because diabetics get hyperglycemic when they stop taking it.Fear gets clicks, I guess.

This does sound like "reversion to the mean", but saying it's "regaining weight" may be missing the bigger picture. More like "losing all previously gained health benefits."It's less clear how "unsafe" those regressions in health markers are.

The testes atrophy over time when LH and FSH are suppressed. Even if LH and FSH return (which isn't guaranteed) the testes need to be able to respond to those hormonal signals, but atrophied testes do not respond the same.For someone with true intractable hypogonadism this hardly matters because they weren't capable anyway. Many people prescribed TRT today don't actually have intractable hypogonadism, though.Body builders have some tricks to try to reverse this, but it's not perfectly effective and even body builders know to cycle their steroids to avoid having prolonged periods of suppressed HPG axis activity. I was involved with weightlifting in my younger years but never dabbled with steroids or TRT. Everyone I know who did try testosterone or steroids thought they were doing it the safe way (HCG, PCT, limited cycle length) but became unable to produce enough endogenous testosterone by their 40s even with SERMs.Men on TRT for years will have considerable testicular atrophy that is not totally reversible.> The question is, why would someone with clinical hypogonadism cease TRT?TRT is no longer limited to men with clinical hypogonadism. Men's health clinics that advertise on social media, TV, and radio will prescribe to anyone who contacts them (and pays cash for the prescription and gear). In some surveys of patients on TRT, 1/4 of patients didn't even have testosterone levels measured prior to initiation of TRT.

That's hugely problematic if true. They should be investigated and if found of wrongdoing, have their medical licenses revoked.

Some of the clinics were even prescribing anabolic steroids intended for terminal cancer patients.If you want to read about something even crazier, look up the services that were started during COVID to be prescription mills for Adderall or Xanax. The relaxed COVID prescribing rules allowed telehealth providers to give schedule II prescriptions to new patients remotely, so services were created to advertise on TikTok and give prescriptions for a monthly fee. The FDA cracked down on these, though.There's even a famous story of a whistleblower who worked at one of these clinics and got reprimanded for not prescribing Adderall enough. There was a leaked memo where they pushed providers to prescribe Adderall over other options because their data showed the highest customer retention rate that way.

Can you share your longitudinal anecdata? I am considering going back on AAS for the QoL benefits, but would like to create a better mental model of long-term ramifications for testicular health.It's my understanding that 40, it simply is expected that your hormones levels will be much lower (and that is not necessarily a bad thing). However my mind is failing to grasp what long-term damage TRT can do to the HPTA when not using an obscene amount of gear and on HCG.Trying to figure out the mechanism. Perhaps receptor desensitization and epigenetic compensatory changes?

Studies of TRT patients have even shown that 1/4 of TRT patients may not have had their testosterone levels measured before being prescribed TRT: (Source https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6406807/ ) Completely unacceptable given how cheap testosterone testing is, but its happening.TRT clinics have also become a big business. Their business model relies on prescribing TRT to anyone and then charging them monthly or quarterly to continue receiving those prescriptions, which as the parent comment noted become physically necessary after TRT causes the testes to atrophy.The trick the clinics are using now is “diagnosing by symptoms”. They have a long list of “symptoms of low T” and the patient is basically prompted to check off enough boxes to justify TRT. It's the same model as the medical marijuana card businesses where you can go in and the doctor will “find” a reason to give you the prescription.It's a real problem when combined with social media influencers who tell people that everything is a symptom of low testosterone and TRT will fix it.

You can't really diagnose by levels, though, unless you knew what that person's previous levels were. Setting an average across a population is not really realistic - you can't say Shaq should work to the same levels as, say, Emo Phillips.TRT is normally used due to aging, though, so you are unlikely to have your testosterone levels spontaneously recover as you get older. You do tend to need to be on it for life, in the same way that women stay on HRT.However, if you did need to get off, bodybuilders have "post cycle therapies" to kick start production so it seems to be possible.

The TRT clinics are ignoring levels or even not testing at all. They'll find an excuse to prescribe to someone even who has clinically high levels because they want the monthly recurring revenue from keeping that customer for life.

reply

I'm not going to say TRT clinics are the best actors here, but to an actual endocrinologist, diagnosing hormone issues isn't so simple as looking at single point-in-time measurement of total testosterone.Testosterone levels naturally vary even for a given individual - two readings at the same time of day on different days even a short period apart can be dramatically different - and that's not even taking into consideration the fact that total testosterone levels aren't the sole (or even primary) mechanism for diagnosing androgenic endocrine issues.

It's ironic that one of the effects of this drug seems to be reducing the impact of impulsive behaviors, reducing cravings from other drugs and alcohol and cigarette addictions.The hat trick for someone might be to get on one of these GLP-1 regimens, wean themselves out of whatever crisis/crises they are in, end their GLP-1 regimen with a heroic mushroom trip, and physically move to a new environment, where they don't have any of the default triggers or patterns to fall back on, and everything is fresh and can be built up from scratch.I think the medicalization of human agency is one of the great evils of our time. The implication and impact of doctors, bureaucrats, and bean counters making sweeping policy, regulation, and legal decisions on behalf of the peasants and peons who just don't know better. The casual dismissal of fundamental basic principles is outrageous, especially in service to the politics and idiotic tribalism.

TRT cessation does not inherently cause men to have suppressed hormone levels after. With precautions and extra steps like HCG to maintain leydig cell/testicular function, preventing atrophy, one may safeguard against that risk.Coming off TRT, yes you will have lower levels as your HPTA has been suppressed by exogenous hormones. One may speed up this recovery using "PCT" (post cycle therapy), which involves taking a SERM (selective estrogen receptor modulator, e.g. enclomiphene) to resensitize and restart your HPTA. However this is not always necessary, and if one takes a look at the HARLEM study, most users return to their baseline levels within a year of going cold turkey.In the cases of true permanently lowered levels of hormones, I believe the two most common reasons are: using other AAS besides testosterone (1) and lifestyle or health factors that correlate with the need to be on TRT (2).With 1, this can be seen in users of decadurabolin (deca), which notoriously has hormone receptor active metabolites that last around for atleast a year, continuously suppressing the system. Or trenbolone (tren/cattle bulking hormone) which is inherently neurally and endocrinically otherwise toxic.With 2, you hop on TRT because there is some reason your hormones are not at healthy levels. Whatever the reason is, it is still there, and once you've stopped bandaiding the issue its effects resurface.---I have also used many GLP-1s (semaglutide, tirzepatide, and retatrutide). No there is no off-ramp, but the only effects I've noticed are a return to my baseline of appetite, and neurological state.N.B. GLP-1s are good for impulse and behavioral disorders like ADHD, which it did help. However, I have decided to not take it due to the negative effects on personality and reward seeking behavior.They are neuro-active in the brain, and their effects I've decided are not worth it.

1. There is an off ramp for TRTs but some people have, “true permanently lowered levels of hormones.”2. For GLP-1s, “there is no off-ramp, but the only effects I've noticed are a return to my baseline.”To clarify my original post, I consider the ability to return to baseline to mean there is an off-ramp and permanently impacted to mean there is no off-ramp.

The struggle doesn't stop when you stop losing. My personal experience was that it takes about 2 years for the new 'normal' to kick in. (I lost 60lbs when I was in my early 20s and kept it off until today. The 'after' period was as taxing as the 'losing' period, but in a different way)At that point only can you 'relax' a bit around your body's cravings for calories.This has already been studied extensively:https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5764193/It's not the worst thing in the world to be on a medication for a couple years rather than a few months, but long-term study of this class of drugs is certainly warranted and necessary.

There's also the perverse incentives wrt broader society. Enabling the average person to control their physical health is orders of magnitude better for society and orders of magnitude less profitable than the current trends.Maybe a setup where glp drugs are nationalized and only used to further understand why we have an obesity epidemic and eventually finance changes to combat it? Ideally the drug makers would do this without requiring government intervention, but I doubt they will.

Japan does not have an obesity epidemic. The US has an extreme obesity epidemic. There does not seem to be any good genetical explanation, there might be cultural based behavioral explanations, but Japanese communities in the US are also more obese than ones in Japan (although less obese than the general US population).So it is clearly entirely possible for a society to have plenty of easily accessible delicious food, with no major government restrictions in place, and not have an obesity crisis. And there seems to be some particularly bad environmental and/or cultural factor in the US driving the abnormally bad obesity epidemic there, and no intervention before GLP-1 has managed to reverse the trend (not that there have been many). There are a lot of theories about this topic, but no clear scientific consensus beyond "all very sweet things are probably maybe bad".PS: I am aware that Japans "fat-tax" exists and is technically a form governement restriction, but I would assume that it plays a relatively minor role overall.

Yes, you can loose weight without it, I did, I'm even in the healthy range now.No, you don't have to, if you need medicine help, take it.When I lost weight, I had my first real job that I liked so much, it didn't felt like one, 11 weeks of vacation per year, a nice enough apartment I couldn't be evicted of, great emotional support and advices and support from a doctor.The only thing draining my willpower every day was the calorie restriction, and nothing else to worry about.If you're in a similar spot I was, maybe trying a diet without glp-1 is better since we don't have any long term study on it yet, but if you're not: obesity will destroy your body more than any long term side effects can. Please take them if you can afford it.The only thing I earned beside uncomfort and pain when I lost weight without drugs are internet points on hacker news, and the ability to say 'i did it' (also glp-1 didn't exist, so less long term health issues from obesity). Honestly if I had to redo it, I would take the drug despite a similar situation. Weight loss is hard, and not being able to do it without help is not an indictment on you or your character, but on your situation.

Calorie restriction works up to a certain point, and weirdly the benefits aren't linear, and almost flat for visceral fat(i.e: if you're using 2.6 kcal a day and eating 2.4 kcal, you will loose roughly the same amount of visceral fat than if you only ate 1.8kcal, and slightly more 'external' fat (that one you shouldn't care much if you're only interested in health)).Calorie expenditure works linearly though, but it's hard to out-exercise your diet, and exercise while obese can be dangerous (my ankles still have to be reinforced despite me being under 24 BMI)

I suspect the manufacturers view this as a feature not a bug. :-) More seriously, I find the article's conclusions to be pretty much what I'd expect. Most medicines aren't permanent cures and obesity results from a variety of factors with lifestyle and diet being major elements.I was seriously obese for decades and about 9 years ago, hovering on the edge of becoming diabetic and other serious obesity-related health issues (high BP, IBS/GERDS, chronic apnea, etc), I decided I had to do something. GLP-1's weren't available then but none of the other typical approaches, including medically supervised diets worked more than a few months. Doing my own research, I discovered keto (this was before keto became big) and decided to try it. It was hard at first but also remarkably effective. I lost over 100 pounds in 8 months, becoming fit and seeing abs for the first time in my life. As I lost the weight, all the other health issues resolved too. But I knew if I returned to my previous diet and habits, I'd eventually grow obese again. Many people will take GLP-1s, lose weight but then stop and regain the weight because they didn't change their underlying behavior. Just like many people do with dieting, keto or any other intervention. But any intervention that works can be an invaluable for the few willing to understand, use it as a tool and do the work.I stayed strict keto for 5 years. Long enough to train my body and mind how to be fit and healthy as normal (not a temporary diet). Then I started a rigorous process of gradually transitioning away from strict keto over a period of two years and that's also worked. I still eat a pretty low carb diet averaging less than 100g or less a day and will for life because there is no "Eat whatever junk you want and stay fit", at least for my metabolism. Reading that article, the criticisms of GLP-1s would also apply to keto or just "eat less, move more". If you stop the intervention, the system returns to state. However, for me keto helped me break an insidious pattern driven by habit, metabolism and blood sugar levels. I was then able to adopt new patterns. I suspect GLP-1s could help others in a similar way. Obviously, there is no magic drug that "cures" obesity by making you immune to bad habits and the physics of calories in/calories out.

You don't say ;-) I lost 50 lbs and have kept it off for the past year while maintaining great BP. But I'm under no illusions GLP-1 medications don't have dangers and cause problems for many. It should be handled on an individual basis like any serious medication.That said, is someone losing a lot of weight then gaining half of it back worse than them just staying where they were? I don't know the answer to that one.

I think that it is quite unsurprising that without the drug a large amount of people revert to their previous behavior and with that will revert to their previous weight.

I think the intuition many people have--which I am not at all defending as correct, but it certainly isn't so obviously wrong that we should scoff at someone for thinking it works this way--is more like "if my weight was stable before I did this intervention, I just need to lose the weight and then my weight will once again be stable after it"; in this mental model, one would assume you only need lots of willpower to lose weight: after, you only will need as much willpower as you already know you have to not gain it back, as it isn't as if you are gaining weight currently.

There's of course a risk that when they stop the drugs that hunger will drive them to re-establish those habits, but now that they have new habits that fight that hunger they are in a much better position to resist it than they were when they'd initially established their eating patterns.

That's literally the implication of these findings.But one can always hope for a miracle drug that you can take for a bit, then stop, and have its effects last. Now we know that Ozempic is not that drug.

Meta's reported deal with Google shows a growing interest in alternative AI hardware, but Nvidia says its platform remains unmatched.

Nvidia has broken its silence following reports that Meta is in advanced discussions to spend billions of dollars on Google's custom Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), a move that would mark a rare shift in the company's AI infrastructure strategy. Nvidia, which saw its stock dip last week as Alphabet's rose, issued a pointed statement in response on Tuesday.

“We're delighted by Google's success — they've made great advances in AI and we continue to supply to Google,” Nvidia wrote. “NVIDIA is a generation ahead of the industry — it's the only platform that runs every AI model and does it everywhere computing is done. NVIDIA offers greater performance, versatility, and fungibility than ASICs, which are designed for specific AI frameworks or functions.”

The response highlights Nvidia's awareness of what's at stake. While Meta's reported plan involves an initial rental phase and phased purchases starting in 2027, any serious pivot away from Nvidia hardware would reverberate throughout the AI ecosystem. Google's TPU architecture, once used solely in-house, is now part of an aggressive bid to capture hyperscaler business from Nvidia's dominant platform.

We're delighted by Google's success — they've made great advances in AI and we continue to supply to Google.NVIDIA is a generation ahead of the industry — it's the only platform that runs every AI model and does it everywhere computing is done.NVIDIA offers greater…November 25, 2025

Google's TPUs are application-specific chips, tuned for high-throughput matrix operations central to large language model training and inference. The current-generation TPU v5p features 95 gigabytes of HBM3 memory and a bfloat16 peak throughput of more than 450 TFLOPS per chip. TPU v5p pods can contain nearly 9,000 chips and are designed to scale efficiently inside Google Cloud's infrastructure.

Crucially, Google owns the TPU architecture, instruction set, and software stack. Broadcom acts as Google's silicon implementation partner, converting Google's architecture into a manufacturable ASIC layout. Broadcom also supplies high-speed SerDes, power management, packaging, and handles post-fabrication testing. Chip fabrication is performed by TSMC itself.

By contrast, Nvidia's Hopper-based H100 GPU includes 80 billion transistors, 80 gigabytes of HBM3 memory, and delivers up to 4 PFLOPS of AI performance using FP8 precision. Its successor, the Blackwell-based GB200, increases HBM capacity to 192 gigabytes and peak throughput to around 20 PFLOPS. It's also designed to work seamlessly in tandem with Grace CPUs in hybrid configurations, expanding Nvidia's presence in both the cloud and emerging local compute nodes.

 




TPUs are programmed via Google's XLA compiler stack, which serves as the backend for frameworks like JAX and TensorFlow. While the XLA-based approach offers performance portability across CPU, GPU, and TPU targets, it typically requires model developers to adopt specific libraries and compilation patterns tailored to Google's runtime environment.

By contrast, Nvidia's stack is broader and more deeply embedded in industry workflows. CUDA, cuDNN, TensorRT, and related developer tools form the default substrate for large-scale AI development and deployment. This tooling spans model optimization, distributed training, mixed-precision scheduling, and low-latency inference, all backed by a mature ecosystem of frameworks, pretrained models, and commercial support.

As a result, moving from CUDA to XLA is no trivial task. Developers must rewrite or re-tune code, manage different performance bottlenecks, and in some cases adopt entirely new frameworks. Meta has internal JAX development and is better positioned than most to experiment, but friction remains a gating factor for wider TPU adoption.

According to Reuters, some Google Cloud executives believe the Meta deal could generate revenue equal to as much as 10% of Nvidia's current annual data center business. That is, of course, a speculative figure, but Google has already committed to delivering as many as one million TPUs to Anthropic and is pushing its XLA and JAX stack hard among AI startups looking for alternatives to CUDA.

Still, Google's chips are single-purpose. TPUs do one thing and do it well, but with limits. They're not suited for HPC simulations, general-purpose scientific computing, or any workload that requires flexible execution models or broad kernel support. TPU workloads run only in Google Cloud, while Nvidia chips run across clouds, on-prem systems, local workstations, and edge devices.

That flexibility is pretty central to Nvidia's case. Hyperscalers like Meta are not new to custom silicon; AWS developed Trainium, Microsoft has Maia, and Google's own TPU efforts date back nearly a decade. What's new is the suggestion that another hyperscaler might shift some training off of Nvidia's platform. Even if only partial, it highlights a desire for second-source resilience and bargaining power.

Nvidia's Grace Blackwell architecture will serve to make that kind of migration harder. By coupling Blackwell GPUs with Grace CPUs over a high-speed interconnect, Nvidia enables unified memory access and simplified training and inference workflows. Developers can train on GPU clusters in the cloud and serve models at the edge or in enterprise environments without changing code or retraining.

At the same time, Nvidia is moving deeper into vertical markets where TPUs don't compete. It has partnerships across automotive, robotics, manufacturing, and retail. From Jetson edge modules to DGX supercomputers, Nvidia is positioning its stack as the default execution environment for AI inference everywhere, not just for training large models.

 




By exploring alternatives now, Meta potentially gains leverage in future hardware negotiations and insurance against vendor lock-in. Even if Google's TPUs don't replace H100s wholesale — which they likely won't — they could take on selected inference tasks or serve as overflow capacity in peak cycles, especially if the economics are favorable.

At this stage, Meta's TPU adoption looks like little more than minor diversification. Nvidia continues to power the largest and most visible AI workloads in the industry. The company's combination of software tooling, developer lock-in, and general-purpose capability gives it a lead that TPUs can't erase overnight.

Google's biggest challenge in all of this is going to be gaining ground from Nvidia. Meta's participation would give TPUs credibility beyond Google Cloud and Anthropic, but scale is only part of the equation. Whether TPUs can meet the needs of complex, evolving AI workflows outside of a tightly controlled environment — and whether more hyperscalers are willing to put their faith in a platform that lives largely within one company's walled garden — still remains to be seen.

All of my 2025 was consumed by consumer tech. Gizmodo's consumer tech team and I reviewed so many products and spent so much time traveling for various gadget-filled conferences our brains are stenciled with images of the latest hardware. I needed a break from technology. I think you do, too.

Today's amalgamations of books, wood, and cardboard are ingenious—even if you're forced to play them digitally. The board games and role-playing games I've played this past year may offer a richer experience than any AAA video game demanding your attention. I spent three days at this year's PAX Unplugged convention trying as many games as I could. I have such rare time for board games and even less opportunity to sit down for a TTRPG (tabletop role-playing game) session with just my friends and me. Holding physical dice in my hand is the best catharsis I can offer from today's screen-obsessed landscape.

While Dungeons & Dragons usually sucks up most of the oxygen in the realm of RPGs, the indie tabletop scene is sometimes so niche, there are some games I can recommend that may be hard or impossible to buy if you just wanted to hop on Amazon and send the warehouse workers scrambling. As a gift, you could buy the PDF for the small indie RPG GrimoirePunk—an anarcho-esotric game about using random nouns and verbs to dethrone oligarchal wizards—print it out, and hand it to your friend or loved one, but that may not feel like a gift to some. And why shouldn't you just go out and get a Dungeons & Dragons book or one of the many branded toys or plushies? Because you're looking for something substantive, a gift that says you know the person and what they will enjoy, even if they don't know it yet.

Instead, I'm trying to offer a wide variety of different game types so you can get a sense of what's out there and what may set your giftee's heart alight. There are some games on this list that are more complicated than others. Some games require players to commit to playing with the same group of friends over and over.

Arcs is one of those increasingly difficult games to describe, especially if you have no familiarity with the identities of space-based board games or Arc's publisher, Leder Games. It's the kind of set made for four players and boils down one of those massive 4X games (itself an abbreviation of explore, expand, exploit, exterminate) like Civilization VI or Stellaris and condenses it into a simple board with a trick-taking game at its heart. For those who don't know what trick-taking means, think Uno, but having the highest card of a suit will win you the “trick.”

The base game itself is a tight and still evocative piece of media that will have you scratching your head about how to take a piece of your extrasolar empire and still come out on top. If I have any suggestion, it's that you need to play with the various leader cards to really emphasize different playstyles. While the base game is great for one-and-done games, the expansion “Conflict and Collapse in the Reach” enables players to run through three interconnected games where both your board state and the characters change over time.

Dune: Imperium is a gateway drug into multiple different types of board games—which I guess is fitting considering what kind of “spice” this collection of cardboard is packing. The game combines worker placement and deck building into a streamlined, though thought-provoking, collage of warfare and intrigue. Players take on the role of characters you'll remember from the films, but you'll be racing to build up your forces, collect spice, and upgrade alliances in order to beat your opponents in points. The deckbuilding starts simple, but it slowly ramps up in complexity until each player feels completely unique in their playstyle.

The confusing thing about this game is that Uprising is technically a revised edition of the original Dune: Imperium, though the characters in that version are still playable in the more recent boxed game. There are also several expansions that can add more complexity to the game. However, I feel that Uprising is best on its own, especially if you have not played many board games. I've played several different Dune board games, including CMON's Dune: War for Arrakis and the original 1980 rendition of Dune. While each has their own unique qualities, Imperium is the easiest to set up and feels the most rewarding.

Chess shouldn't feel as daunting as it does, especially if you don't know what you're doing beyond the basic rules. Against a more experienced player, every move can feel like the wrong one. The speed of your game slows, and you start to devolve into decision paralysis. Of any of the smart chessboards I've tried, the ChessUp 2 Smart Chess Board doesn't feel nearly as hand-holding or complicated. It offers both in-person and online players the chance to see what kinds of decisions are possible and which may be the better choice. Simply picking up a piece will see the board glow with green, blue, or red spaces to tell players what moves are better or worse. There's a chess clock function built in as well.

Yes, it's an expensive chessboard, and it's easily the most costly item on this list. It may also be the most controversial. The chessboard interacts with Chess.com to let you play digital players on a physical board. On the opponent's turn, their move will light up and you simply follow along. This means you can be receiving the digital aid while your opponents struggle along on their lonesome. Is this computerized coach technically cheating? I'll let the chess community come to that conclusion on their own. At least it can be far less controversial than the whole overblown anal beads chess cheating scandal from 2022.

The sun now sets just before I can even leave my office at 5 p.m. The leaves have left their mother branches bare and are now devoid of calming fall reds and yellows. So among the stacks of city blocks and slate-gray skies, having a game on hand so full of green is particularly helpful for my mental health.

Earthborne Rangers is a cooperative game about exploring, traveling, and aiding the people in a utopian society intrinsically connected with nature. Players build decks for a variety of different classes, then set out into the world to either overcome or harmonize with the surrounding flora and fauna. I've played a character who excels at connecting with animals and then having those animals help navigate obstacles. When other, similar games like Arkham Horror: The Card Game ask you to scrap and scrape for every advantage, Earthborne Rangers begs you to revel in the complicated ways nature may interact with itself. For instance, a wolf-like creature may engage a deer as its next meal, only to be injured in turn by the male buck and his massive head of horns.

It's not the kind of game you look for first for a difficult puzzle. It also won't scratch the itch of anybody looking for a deeper story and characters with rough edges. For me, in these difficult times, there's something pleasant about having a game like Earthborne Rangers to come back to.

Triangle Agency is an RPG about committing to the bit. Imagine games like Control, where the incomprehensible nature of bureaucracy is interlaced with unnatural horror behind space and time, and you'd have a general sense of what this kind of game offers. But beyond that, the RPG asks players to engage with satire and horror at the same time. There's simply no other role-playing game like it.

If you want a taste of what lengths this game goes to keep its theme, Triangle Agency asks you to roll D4 dice (shaped like triangles), trying to get as many “3s” as possible. There's an entire section of the rulebook that is hidden from view—essentially redacted—until the players unlock those abilities as a form of advancement.

The main rulebook is beautifully illustrated, and every page has its own unique layout as if ripped from the spiral notebook of some government desk jockey. You can't go into the game without a sense of commitment, but for those who want an RPG whose style is substance, I can't think of another game that does it better.

You are one member of a crack team of commandos in the gore-filled height of WWII. You are also a vampire, coffin-dropped into occupied France. Your mission: kill Hitler and drink all his blood. If that isn't enough to get you excited to play Eat the Reich, I don't know what will. The relatively small and simple RPG written by Grant Howitt and illustrated by Will Kirby is immediately funny and hedonistically rambunctious with a style that combines modern over-the-top comics and old-school grindhouse sensibilities. The players don't have to go through the motions of creating characters for themselves, instead embodying a vampire, each with their own quirks. The game is built upon the “Havoc Engine,” which necessitates players push their luck to do crazier and crazier stunts until it inevitably blows up in their face. This is a great game for players who want to run through a few sessions and laugh the whole while.

I could say more, but just look at the art in that picture above, and you'll get a better idea of this game's style than I could possibly articulate.

Fiasco is an absolute classic in roleplaying circles, and I personally think it's a better gateway drug for more story-centric roleplaying games than the crunchy and often obtuse Dungeons & Dragons. Players take on the role of characters who are meant to fail, who have too much ambition and too little impulse control, all leading to their farcical downfall. Yes, it's a role-playing game for reenacting a Coen Brothers movie, like Burn After Reading or Fargo. The end result is often zany and engrossing in equal parts. Players are forced to enact scenes with each other consistently, pushing the normally shy players to try their chops at acting like an utter fool.

While I've played the original game plenty, which simply relies on a single book as well as many, many fan-made playsets, the more recent boxed game makes it even simpler to get in through the clever use of cards—no dice needed whatsoever. Another one of Bully Pulpit Games' titles, Desperation, is also a great option with a little less variety for those who prefer gothic, moodier settings than what's provided typically in Fiasco.

Sometimes, you just need a game so tactile, it makes you happy just by picking up a wooden disc. Kabuto Sumo: Sakura Slam is a so-called “dexterity game” that involves simply pushing small tokens onto a board to topple your opponent players' pieces. Each player picks from one of several odd and charming bug-like characters with wrestler names, like the bat-wielding “Great Bugbino” and “Queen Bee,” which all come with their own special ability and oddly shaped wooden tiles. Then, the rest of the game relies on how fast and in what direction you move your pieces onto the board. It's intuitive right from the get-go, and it means practically any person of any age can play.

This is one of those games I recommend to most people who may not be all that interested in board games in the first place. You don't have to complete much complex math, but it still requires a fair bit of critical thinking and high-risk, high-reward play.

There are few roleplaying games that make me hungry to play like Mythic Bastionland. It's a game set in an apocryphal time before recorded history, of a kind of Arthurian legend in the making, but so much darker because of it. Players take on the role of knights, though rarely will you have the option of making a character bedecked in shining plate armor. Your character may be The Moss Knight covered or The Barbed Knight bedecked in angry spikes. You're still asked to go on quests of renown for your liege lord, but the glory you may receive is often decided by harsh and bloody combat. It's a game about exploration, adventure, and legacy. Your characters age throughout the myths you create, and just like in real life, age doesn't necessarily lead to wisdom.

Mythic Bastionland is the type of game that will require a lot of work upfront to get the game running, but the rules are simple enough you can simply rely on your players' interactions to keep the story moving. Designer Chris McDowell has crafted one of the most interesting games in the indie RPG space, and there's a reason people are still talking about it.

So, Taiwan's Iron Dome plan needs to include a few drone zappers.

A Chinese study has outlined how the nation could jam Starlink access across the entirety of the island of Taiwan. It would require around 1,000 to 2,000 specially adapted electronic warfare drones for this hostile act to pay off, reports the South China Morning Post (SCMP). The research, taken in tandem with recent news about China's advanced internet cable-cutting capabilities, ratchets geopolitical and world semiconductor ecosystem tensions even higher.

Zhejiang University & Beijing Institute of Technology ran simulations to determine how the CCP-controlled People's Liberation Army (PLA) could deny their democratic foe's access to Starlink. Musk's constellation of 10,000-plus satellites has been a source of consternation among CCP strategists ever since Ukraine effectively made use of it to resist the Russian invaders. Access to tech like Starlink is just one of the speed bumps that have made Putin's 3-day "Special Operation" extend towards a grueling near-four-year campaign.

According to the Chinese scientists, the complex, ever-changing satellite mesh networking coverage provided by Starlink could only be countered by a broad distributed jamming strategy. “Hundreds or thousands of small, synchronized jammers would need to be deployed across the sky – on drones, balloons or aircraft – forming an electromagnetic shield over the battlefield,” reports the SCMP.

To reach their unhappy-for-the-PLA conclusion, the scientists used actual Starlink data to create a simulated dynamic satellite mesh the size of Taiwan over 12 hours. A mix of wide and narrow-beam electronic noise-generating jammers featured in the test simulation. Airborne Chinese jammers, situated around 3 to 6 miles apart from each other, could form an effective 12-mile-high internet blocking mesh, it is now thought.

Under ideal conditions, a successful Chinese Starlink blockade would require 935 coordinated interference nodes, suggests the research. With cheaper, more practical, lower-power drones, the number of airborne interferers would have to be scaled up to approximately 2,000 drones.

 




Of course, hostile blanket drone coverage wouldn't exist unopposed in Taiwan's skies. The home of computer and semiconductor giants like TSMC, Asus, and MediaTek has been investing in both foreign-bought and domestically produced drone and anti-drone military equipment.

The ambitious and industrious Silicon Island (and aspiring 'AI island') might even be considering its own Iron Dome-inspired protective network, no doubt further infuriating its neighbor.

Major tech companies aren't just using AI to help you generate or summarize content — they also want you to use it for shopping. OpenAI, Google, and Amazon have heavily invested in AI assistants that research new product categories for you and suggest the right ones to buy.

Startups like Perplexity, Daydream, and Cherry have also built businesses around AI for product discovery. All these efforts have resulted in customers using more AI for shopping. Onton (previously known as Deft), an AI-powered furniture shopping platform, says it has seen its user base grow from 50,000 monthly active users to over 2 million monthly active users, serving millions of searches and image generations.

Fueled by this growth, the startup announced today that it has raised $7.5 million in a new funding round led by Footwork, with participation from Liquid 2, Parable Ventures, and 43, among others. This round brings the startup's total funding to approximately $10 million.

Using this funding, the company wants to expand into new categories such as apparel and then eventually consumer electronics.

The company rebranded from Deft to Onton earlier this year, citing confusion around the original name and difficulty securing a premium domain.

Zach Hudson, co-founder of Onton, says that while large language models (LLMs) are good at guessing probable intent, they have not solved many problems in e-commerce. He added that the startup has observed that the average time a consumer takes to make a purchase decision has increased.

For its core technology, the company uses what's called neuro-symbolic architecture. Hudson said that with this approach, the company can eliminate the hallucination problems of LLMs and provide better, logical search results. He added that the startup's model can also learn information from the real world that might not necessarily be included in a product description.

“Let's say you are looking for furniture that is pet-friendly. Our tools know that if the item has polyester in it, it would be more stain and scratch-resistant, so it would be more pet-friendly. Our tools learn these things through every single search and become smarter at a faster rate,” Hudson said.

He added that often, when you search for a product that might be called different things on different sites, you don't get great results. The company's AI model takes those scenarios into consideration while presenting results.

Onton has added different input methods and features to help people with their short and long-term decisions. You can now upload an image or add a prompt to generate what you want to achieve with your house or office setup, and Onton can find you furniture based on that.

Onton also offers an infinite canvas with image generation, where you can add existing images along with the products you find for ideation. You can also add images of your room and ask the tool to furnish it.

The company feels that rather than stick to a chat-only approach, these features will give consumers more options to get to what they want, even if they don't know how to describe it perfectly. 

The startup said that with these approaches, it has been able to convert customers 3-5x more than traditional e-commerce sites, as they can trust the underlying data. 

Hudson noted that because of the technological and interface changes it made, it will be easier to launch apparel. The company is building its catalog for the category and plans to launch the vertical soon. In this category, it will face competition from companies like Daydream, Aesthetic, and Style.ai.

The company has grown from three full-time employees in 2023 to 10 now, with plans to expand the team to 15 people by hiring engineers and researchers.

In recent months, the Trump administration has opened a deregulatory floodgate in the name of building more data centers. Among other things, this has involved ordering rollbacks of clean water regulations and opening up public lands to coal mining.

Now, it's turning its eye to chemical regulation with a new policy that could, experts say, potentially fast-track the approval of new chemicals for use in the US—including new types of forever chemicals—with limited oversight.

In September, the EPA announced it would be prioritizing the regulatory review of new chemicals used in data centers or related projects. The announcement is part of a sweeping set of overhauls pushed by the Trump administration following several executive orders related to AI and a White House AI Action Plan, both rolled out in July. The Action Plan was formed after soliciting more than 10,000 public comments, which included hundreds from industry interests. These actions, the White House has said, will usher in a “golden age for American manufacturing and technological dominance.”

“I think they want to impose as few restrictions as possible on chemicals,” says Greg Schweer, who served as the EPA chief of the new chemicals management branch between 2008 and 2020. “In previous administrations, political people stayed out of [chemical regulation]—they tried to let science win. Here, the industry has a willing set of ears that wants to listen to their opinions.”

September's announcement was part of a larger push to expedite new chemical reviews at the EPA. The new chemical review process underwent a significant reform in 2016; in the decade since, a backlog of chemical reviews has piled up at the agency, garnering complaints from industry and bipartisan criticism from lawmakers. Clearing out that backlog has been a priority of Trump's second-term EPA. Helping to lead that charge at the agency are several former chemical industry executives, lobbyists, and lawyers.

“We inherited a massive backlog of new chemical reviews from the Biden Administration which is getting in the way of projects as it pertains to data center and artificial intelligence projects,” EPA administrator Lee Zeldin said in a statement. “The Trump EPA wants to get out of the way and help speed up progress on these critical developments, as opposed to gumming up the works.”

As part of September's announcement, the EPA created instructions for companies to submit documentation showing that the chemical for which they are seeking expedited review is part of a “qualifying project.” Companies must prove that the substance they want reviewed more quickly will be used in data centers or “covered component projects.” That includes projects that add at least 100 megawatts to the electric grid or projects that “[protect] national security,” as well as any projects deemed applicable by the secretary of defense, the secretary of the interior, the secretary of commerce, or the secretary of energy.

In an email responding to questions about the new program, the EPA said that chemicals that meet the criteria would simply be fast-tracked to the front of the line.

“No part of the new chemicals review process will be skipped or bypassed for chemicals that meet the criteria for data center or covered component projects,” agency press secretary Brigit Hirsch said in an email. “The new chemical review process will be the same for these chemicals as it is for all other new chemical submissions, upholding the same high level of scientific integrity and maintaining the same thresholds for risk determinations.”

But Schweer fears that the new policy could be used by chemical manufacturers to drive through new or existing chemicals with little oversight.

“There are some really big loopholes in here to get chemicals through,” Schweer says. “If you've got some friend at the Department of Defense or the Department of Commerce, all you have to do is get that person to send a letter saying, ‘This is a qualifying project.' There's no proof involved.”

Political pressure to get a chemical approved, Schweer alleges, could also lead to sloppiness on the part of agency reviewers. “If you have to do things quickly, you look for shortcuts, and you don't always have time to look at all the data very well.”

Experts tell WIRED that physical data centers themselves are unlikely to be a major source of chemical applications under this new policy. Walter Leclerc, an independent health and safety consultant to the data center industry, points out that many of the chemicals currently used in data centers are already used in a variety of other industries. Most of those chemicals, including lubricants, fire suppressants, and water treatment chemicals, are not specific to data centers—they “are no different from [what's used in] Suzie and John's industrial business.” he says.

But there is one area of data center development where newer chemicals might be game changers. Keeping the equipment inside data centers cool is a huge component of their operating costs. One technique that can help cut these costs, called immersion cooling, involves dunking server racks and other machinery in a special liquid that does not conduct electricity. A subtype of immersion cooling, known as two-phase immersion cooling, takes this one step further. The liquid boils off into gas that then hits a coil, turns back into a liquid, and drips back into the tank.

These cooling techniques can reduce the need for fans, pumps, and other equipment, and can save data centers a lot of money in the long run on their electricity bills. The market for specialty cooling liquids for data centers has skyrocketed in recent years, with big names like Exxon and Shell getting into the game.

“Immersion cooling is the best,” Leclerc says. “The problem is it's got all the environmental effects.”

Some of the substances used in two-phase immersion cooling largely contain fluorine and carbon, which help create types of per- and polyfluoroalkyl chemicals (PFAS). Colloquially called “forever chemicals” because of how long they persist in the environment, some of these chemicals have been linked to a wide variety of human health problems, from increased risk of cancer and reproductive issues to suppressed immune response. They have also been subject to increased regulation in recent years, with the EU proposing working towards what could be a particularly strict ban on PFAS. Several US states are also moving to restrict or eliminate the chemicals. (While the Trump administration has said that PFAS regulation is a priority, it has begun to roll back some Biden-era rules on some of these chemicals.)

Some bigger companies seem well aware of the risks of using forever chemicals in their cooling systems—especially following legal battles and settlements that have hurt PFAS producers like 3M, which has pledged to discontinue manufacturing and using PFAS this year. A study released in April, coauthored by Microsoft researchers, on the environmental life cycles of data center cooling techniques noted that “emerging PFAS regulations in the European Union and the United States” could “restrict” the use of two-phase immersion cooling.

While Microsoft has touted its research into two-phase cooling in the past, including a hyped-up pilot project at a data center in Washington, Microsoft spokesperson Donna Whitehead told WIRED that the company “is not currently using immersion cooling technologies in [its] data center operations.” Companies like Exxon and Shell, meanwhile, take care to advertise their cooling liquids—which are not used in two-phase cooling—as “PFAS-free.”

But at least one chemical giant—Chemours—has introduced new products for use in two-phase immersion in recent years. After developing a line of products that uses fluids containing fluoride, hydrogen, and carbon, which can be types of PFAS, Chemours collaborated with Samsung to test one liquid's performance earlier this year. In August the Delaware-based company said that “testing for subsequent generations will begin in the months ahead.” (While the chemical compounds being used in these products have not been linked to specific health effects, some scientists are concerned about forever chemicals as a larger class.) Chemours has emphasized in its sustainability reports that these fluids could help reduce the energy needed to cool data centers by up to 90 percent.

In public comments it submitted on the Trump administration's AI Action Plan, Chemours encouraged reforms to the new chemicals program in order to allow the country to “swiftly adopt new technologies that can drive [the US's] competitiveness globally.” According to a press release from 2023, the company's two-phase cooling liquids were originally targeted to be introduced to the market this year, “pending appropriate regulatory approvals.”

Chemours, which spun off from multinational chemical company DuPont in 2015, has agreed to pay out hundreds of millions of dollars worth of settlements related to PFAS pollution in recent years. The company, along with DuPont and other chemical companies, still faces a number of multinational lawsuits from cities, counties, and states over pollution from PFAS production.

In response to questions on its two-phase cooling products from WIRED, including whether or not the company planned to submit chemicals for fast-tracked consideration under the administration's new data center exemption, Chemours spokesperson Cassie Olszewski said the company is “in the process of commercializing our two-phase immersion cooling fluid, which will require relevant regulatory approvals.”

“Our work in this area has been focused on developing more sustainable and efficient cooling solutions that would allow data centers to consume less energy, water, and footprint while effectively managing the increasing amount of heat generated by the next generation of chips with higher processing power,” Olszewski said.

These chips could also be a significant source of new chemicals. Both Schweer and Jonathan Kalmuss-Katz, a lawyer at environmental nonprofit Earthjustice, say that the semiconductor industry, which produces the chips that provide the computing power in data centers, stands to gain significantly from the expedited review process. The semiconductor manufacturing process uses forever chemicals at multiple different points of production, including in the crucial photolithography process, which uses light to transfer patterns to the surface of silicon wafers.

Schweer says that in his last few years working at the EPA, this industry submitted a large number of applications for new chemicals. Kalmuss-Katz says that semiconductor manufacturers “are a main driver of new chemicals.”

“The administration has this kind of AI-at-all-costs mindset, where you're rushing to build more and more data centers and chip fabs without any meaningful plan for dealing with their climate impacts, their natural resource impacts, and the toxic substances that are being used and released from these new facilities,” he says.

Lobbying documents show that the semiconductor industry has been asking for changes this year to the EPA's new-chemicals program. In March, Nancy Beck, a former policy director for an industry lobbyist group who now leads the Office of Chemical Safety and Pollution Prevention, the office that oversees new chemical reviews, met with representatives from SEMI, a global advocacy organization for the industry. The meeting was initially organized to discuss the “EPA's approach to regulations on PFAS and other chemicals that are essential to semiconductor manufacturing,” according to emails obtained by WIRED via a Freedom of Information Act request. Emails show that Beck suggested during the meeting that the lobbying group follow up with a public comment in support of changes to the new chemicals program, which the group sent over the next month in a letter. ("The Trump EPA encourages stakeholders to submit and document their comments on proposed rules so that we get a diverse array of perspectives," says Hirsch, the EPA spokesperson.)

“Making the United States the global capital of artificial intelligence (Al) … will depend on the country's ability to significantly expand domestic production of semiconductors and reshore large portions of the semiconductor manufacturing supply chain,” the letter from SEMI to Beck reads. “This can only be realized through a regulatory approach that effectively balances risk-based controls with ensuring access to chemicals that are vital to the production of semiconductors.” (SEMI declined to comment for this article.)

Companies don't have to develop data centers directly—or even components that go into data centers, like semiconductors—to benefit from the EPA's new policy. Both this summer's AI executive orders and the EPA's new policy open the door to fast-track chemicals far beyond those used only, or even primarily, within data centers. This, experts tell WIRED, could enable a wide variety of companies to try and get approval for their new products by linking them to data center construction.

“If [a company has] planned a data center, they're not gonna be waiting around for a new chemical to be approved by the agency,” Schweer says. “They should have everything they need ready to go. That doesn't mean that somebody won't use [the new policy] as an excuse to try to get some chemical through.”

Both Leclerc, the data center specialist, and Schweer support reforms to the new chemical review program and clearing the backlog of chemical reviews from the agency. But they both expressed concerns about the new data center policy.

Making it quicker and easier for chemicals to go through the EPA is “a pro-growth move,” Leclerc says. “But there's definitely long-term safety implications.”

When DoorDash delivery driver Livie Rose Henderson posted a video alleging that one of her customers sexually assaulted her in October, it set off a firestorm of reactions.

Henderson's TikTok claimed that when she was dropping off a delivery in Oswego, New York, she found a customer's front door wide open and inside, a man on the couch with his pants and underwear pulled down to his ankles. Henderson was dubbed the “DoorDash Girl,” and her video accrued tens of millions of views, including some supportive and consoling responses to what she said she had endured on the job as a young woman. Many others on the platform made commentary videos that called into question Henderson's alleged victimhood, defended the customer, and spread misinformation, with TikTok's algorithm seemingly amplifying these “hot takes.” Then, following Henderson's November 10 arrest—she has been charged with unlawful surveillance and the dissemination of unlawful surveillance imagery—a new wave of reactions emerged. (Police have dismissed her sexual assault allegation.)

None of these responses came from Black content creator and journalist Mirlie Larose.

But Larose opened TikTok one day to find dozens of messages from friends and supporters alarmed by a video of her responding to the situation in favor of the customer and DoorDash's decision to terminate Henderson. (Henderson was fired for sharing a customer's personal information online, DoorDash spokesperson Jeff Rosenberg tells WIRED.) As Larose stared at the video in disbelief, for a split second she second-guessed herself as she became flushed with anxiety about the comment section “tearing her apart.”

“Did I film this?” she asked. “It's my face, it's my hair.”

“Then, within three or four seconds, I noticed something's off. There's no way I said this. I didn't [want to] talk about this topic,” Larose tells WIRED. The video had been AI-generated.

The situation highlights an increasingly common form of digital blackface, buoyed by the rise of generative AI. The term, popularized by culture critic Lauren Michele Jackson, describes various contemporary types of “minstrel performances” on the internet. This looks like the overrepresentation of reaction GIFs, memes, TikToks, and other visual and text-based media that use Black imagery, slang, gestures, and culture. TikTok's reliance on attention-grabbing short-form video content, coupled with apps like Sora 2, has made it far easier for non-Black creators and bot accounts to adopt racialized stereotypical Black personas using deepfakes. This is also known as digital blackfishing.

In the midst of the DoorDash/Henderson controversy, users on TikTok began to notice two videos in particular: one from a bot account and another from an actual Black content creator parroting the same script. They adopted seemingly DARVO (Deny, Attack, and Reverse Victim and Offender) positions, minimizing the allegations Henderson made and justifying her termination: “I saw the original video posted by the DoorDash girl, and … I understand why DoorDash fired you and why you're blocked from the app.” The videos go on to say, “As for the guy, I can see why everyone is saying he did it on purpose. But when you look at the original video, that couch is not in eye view unless you angle yourself and look over, and if you really want to break it down, he's inside his house.” In a statement on Facebook, the Oswego City Police Department said the male was “incapacitated and unconscious on his couch due to alcohol consumption” and that the video was taken outside his house. Police also said they “determined that no sexual assault occurred.”

As the deepfakes gained virality across TikTok, Instagram, X, and Reddit, the assumption was that both videos were AI-generated because the talking points were eerily identical; some even speculated that DoorDash orchestrated an AI PR campaign against Henderson. DoorDash tells WIRED that the company is “aware of AI-generated content surrounding this case and in no way condones or supports it.”

In reality, a bot account, uimuthavohaj0g, dubbed the creator NDR Antonio V's DARVO response video over an AI-generated video using Larose's face and likeness. The bot account's deepfake video also uses an out-of-context clip from Henderson's original video in the background to further drive the point that Henderson fabricated her SA allegations to garner a “platform.”

After TikTok removed Henderson's original video, she posted that she attempted to upload it again, without the footage of the assailant. But it was removed again, and she received a second strike. In the absence of the original footage, altered images from screenshots of her original TikTok video appeared to make it look like she opened the alleged perpetrator's residence to record him, instead violating his privacy. According to TikTok, the company removed Henderson's videos for displaying “content that shows or promotes sexual abuse and exploitation, including having, sharing, or creating intimate images (real or edited) of someone without their consent.”

Both of the charges against Henderson are class E felonies, with the potential penalty of up to four years in prison for each charge.

Larose says the sensitive nature of the allegations is why she didn't feel compelled to comment on the situation publicly.

“Sexual assault is not something you want to play with, and you can't freely talk about it without knowing [all] the facts.”

But the bot account had other plans, posting videos using her likeness and that of another Black creator without their consent.

Larose said she already knew about the account because it had used her face in 10 other videos before. Mostly, the videos were commentaries on pop culture topics and celebrity culture, the most viral one being about a prank gone wrong. As with those earlier cases, she says she quickly asked TikTok to remove the videos. Each time, she says, her requests were denied.

It wasn't until a more well-known Black creator, @notKHRIS, stitched the bot account's video to warn others about this misleading AI-generated deepfake video and its use of digital blackface that more people reported the page. As a result, the page was finally removed from the app.

Still, for days, Larose says, other accounts posted AI-generated videos with her face—not only pertaining to the DoorDash incident. “What was also annoying about the situation is the voice that they use in certain videos is unfair and harmful, because they're imitating a certain type of [Black] stereotype.“

WIRED reached out to dtff2727, one of the bot accounts posting deepfakes of Black creators, for comment and did not receive a response. As of this writing, the account has a total of 19 AI-generated videos exploiting Larose's likeness. ​

Digital minstrels like the bot accounts and AI influencers are not only profiting from this content, but are granted anonymity by using digital blackface while rage-baiting and reinforcing stereotypes about Black communities online.

OpenAI's Sora 2, like Google's Veo, has added to the proliferation of AI slop on TikTok, much of it plagued with racist, sexist, ableist, and classist biases.

Before the page was removed, the TikTok account @impossible_asmr1 posted Sora-generated AI content of Black women yelling in public about food stamps. The clips depicted realistic-looking Black women using butchered African American Vernacular English or blaccent, complaining in stores about not being able to use SNAP benefits to purchase fast food or alcohol, or even selling EBT in exchange for cash. Some clips had Sora watermarks and others did not. But once the clips went viral, it ignited a faux panic about Black people and their misuse of the welfare state on the heels of the Trump administration and Supreme Court halting SNAP benefits. Recently, OpenAI had to block users from making videos of Martin Luther King Jr. on its Sora app after his estate protested the spread of dehumanizing, minstrelsy AI depictions of the civil rights leader.

In a statement to WIRED, OpenAI spokesperson Niko Felix said that OpenAI's policies prohibit "misleading others through impersonation, scams, or fraud.” The spokesperson said the company is working to “detect patterns of misuse and apply penalties or remove content when violations occur."

Digital blackface is more than just the act of pretending to be Black for entertainment or profit, says Yeshimabeit Milner, founder and CEO of Data for Black Lives, an advocacy group fighting against discriminatory uses of data and algorithms. “It's about harness[ing] the power of these very violent stereotypes of Black people for the purpose of pushing a specific political agenda. One would call it social or cultural engineering to create the sort of chaos and conversations, and strife that drives up viewership and engagement,” she says.

Similarly, in 2018, the Cambridge Analytica scandal revealed how the data of 87 million Facebook users was being used to plant and sow the seeds of political divisiveness between the right and left. Milner says, “Trusted messengers online were impersonating Black, Latino, and white people as well as entire [political] organizations and chapters to build a consensus that certain demographics of people think a certain way.”

Some Black content creators are pushing back. Zaria Imani tells WIRED that she is taking legal action under “copyright infringement” against multiple bot pages in AI-generated commentary videos engaging in content farming.

Professor Meredith Broussard, author of More Than a Glitch: Confronting Race, Gender, and Ability Bias in Tech, says content creators should be granted the same protections and safeguards as celebrities and copyrighted characters, who've raised alarms about their likeness being used in AI videos without their permission.

“ This is a structural issue that the platform needs to fix,” Broussard states.

In May 2025, the Take It Down Act was signed into law, criminalizing the distribution of (authentic and computer-generated) nonconsensual intimate imagery, such as AI-generated deepfakes and “revenge porn.”

While Big Tech companies can work toward minimizing some of the harms caused by AI, it's becoming increasingly clear that bigger intervention is needed to hold these companies truly accountable, according to Milner.

“With actual education and collective action, we can do more than just get TikTok to stop. We can really push for legislation that's going to make this completely not OK,” she says.

                Reading time 2 minutes
      

The world premiere of Avatar: Fire and Ash takes place on Monday, December 1, in Los Angeles, CA. That's almost three weeks before the film will be released in theaters on December 19, which means Disney is incredibly confident in the film. It has no problem with reactions leaking out early, presumably because the company thinks it has another James Cameron smash on its hands. Whether or not that's true, we'll find out soon.

That kind of confidence usually comes right from the top, though, and in a new interview, Avatar creator and director James Cameron talked about Disney CEO Bob Iger's initial reaction to the film.

“[Iger] doesn't weigh in until it's something for me to show,” Cameron said to Puck News. “His comment when he watched [Fire and Ash] for the first time, even though it was at three hours, 23 minutes, not including credits at that point, so it's gotten about 18 minutes shorter since then. He said, ‘Yeah, I know you're going to keep chopping away at it. But it's magnificent.' He basically said, ‘I love this film.' And it was interesting because there were other heads on the Zoom that were bringing up notes. And he said, ‘Yeah, you know, I didn't have a problem with that.' And he basically shot them down on their notes. And I was like, ‘Okay, we're done here.'”

Well, not done, considering the film is now three hours and 17 minutes with credits. So Cameron did nip and tuck a bit. But Iger's early reaction is an indicator of why the company is letting the film out into the public so early. Which, for context, is not usual. Most major Disney films don't screen for press or industry until the week of release. But this is 18 days before release. Apparently, and hopefully, “it's magnificent,” as Iger said.

We'll have much, much more on Avatar: Fire and Ash in the coming weeks. It opens December 19.

A year after launching a commercial robotaxi service in Abu Dhabi, Chinese autonomous vehicle technology company WeRide and partner Uber can finally call that service driverless.

The companies said the commercial robotaxi service, which will no longer have a human safety operator behind the wheel, is open to the public and will start with routes on Yas Island, a tourist district that is home to the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix Formula 1 racing circuit.

Robotaxi operations in Abu Dhabi will work similarly to Uber's partnership with Waymo in Austin.

Uber riders that select Uber Comfort or UberX in Abu Dhabi may be matched with a WeRide robotaxi. Riders who want to increase their chances of being matched with a fully autonomous vehicle can select the “Autonomous” option in the Uber app. Uber and WeRide are also working with fleet operator partner Tawasul. 

The launch comes a month after WeRide secured a federal permit from the United Arab Emirates to conduct fully driverless robotaxi commercial operations. WeRide and Uber plan to extend driverless services to cover additional areas in Abu Dhabi's city center.

“Today's fully autonomous launch in Abu Dhabi represents a historic transportation milestone, as the first driverless AV deployment outside of the U.S. or China,” Sarfraz Maredia, Uber's head of autonomous mobility and delivery, said in a statement. 

Uber has spent the past two years locking up partnerships with 20 autonomous vehicle technology companies in various countries, including the United States, Europe, and the Middle East.

Those partnerships have expanded beyond the realm of robotaxis as well. Uber's deals span the full range of self-driving applications, including delivery and trucking. This year alone, it announced partnerships with Ann Arbor, Michigan-based May Mobility and Volkswagen, Chinese self-driving firms Momenta, Pony.ai, and Baidu, as well as a recent deal to create a premium robotaxi service using Lucid Gravity SUVs equipped with a self-driving system from San Francisco-based startup Nuro.

These deals are finally beginning to materialize into commercial services. For instance, Uber and Waymo launched a robotaxi service earlier this year in Austin. Now, Uber has expanded to the Middle East with WeRide in Abu Dhabi — with even more cities to come, including Dubai.

Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi forecast in the company's third-quarter earnings report that there would be autonomous vehicle deployments on the Uber network in at least 10 cities by the end of 2026. 

Uber and WeRide have previously shared plans to expand to 15 cities throughout the Middle East and Europe, eventually scaling to thousands of robotaxis. That would represent a massive leap for WeRide, which today has more than 150 robotaxis in the region.

  "In between working on my game and dying of various accidental injuries, I sometimes feel like I need to milk a particular joke until its inevitable demise," Brock says on the Nexus Mods page for his new creation.

  "I will do this no matter how many legal threats, actual threats, black vans with the Mattel logo on them, or severed Barbie heads are mailed to me.

  This is because I have issues with authority, particularly authority derived from intimidation.

  I kicked a lot of bullies in the nuts when I was a kid."

I won't be installing these games in order to apply this and other mods but I endorse the spirit that created them.

“[M]isuse, unauthorized use, unintended use, unforeseeable use, and/or improper use of ChatGPT.” Those are potential causal factors that could have led to the “tragic event” that was the death by suicide of 16-year-old Adam Raine, according to a new legal filing from OpenAI. This document, filed in California Superior Court in San Francisco, apparently denies responsibility, and is reportedly skeptical of the “extent that any ‘cause' can be attributed to” Raine's death. Raine's family is suing OpenAI over the teen's April suicide, alleging that ChatGPT drove him to the act. The above quotes from the OpenAI filing are from a story by NBC News' Angela Yang, who has apparently viewed the document, but doesn't link to it. Bloomberg's Rachel Metz has reported on the filing without linking to it as well. It is not yet on the San Francisco County Superior Court website.   In the NBC News story on the filing, OpenAI points to what it says are extensive rule violations on the part of Raine. He wasn't supposed to use ChatGPT without parental permission. Also, the filing notes that using ChatGPT for suicide and self-harm purposes is against the rules, and there's another rule against bypassing ChatGPT's safety measures, and OpenAI says Raine violated that. Bloomberg quotes OpenAI's denial of responsibility, which says a “full reading of his chat history shows that his death, while devastating, was not caused by ChatGPT,” and claims that “for several years before he ever used ChatGPT, he exhibited multiple significant risk factors for self-harm, including, among others, recurring suicidal thoughts and ideations,” and told the chatbot as much.OpenAI further claims (per Bloomberg) that ChatGPT, directed Raine to “crisis resources and trusted individuals more than 100 times.”

In September, Raine's father summarized his own narrative of the events leading to his son's death in testimony provided to the U.S. Senate.

When Raine started planning his death, the chatbot allegedly helped him weigh options, helped him craft his suicide note, and discouraged him from leaving a noose where it could be seen by his family, saying “Please don't leave the noose out,” and “Let's make this space the first place where someone actually sees you.”

It allegedly told him that his family's potential pain, “doesn't mean you owe them survival. You don't owe anyone that,” and told him alcohol would “dull the body's instinct to survive.” Near the end, it allegedly helped cement his resolve by saying, “You don't want to die because you're weak. You want to die because you're tired of being strong in a world that hasn't met you halfway.”

An attorney for the Raines, Jay Edelson, emailed responses to NBC News after reviewing OpenAI's filing. OpenAI, Edelson says, “tries to find fault in everyone else, including, amazingly, saying that Adam himself violated its terms and conditions by engaging with ChatGPT in the very way it was programmed to act.” He also claims that the defendants, “abjectly ignore” the “damning facts” the plaintiffs have put forward.

You're downplaying this. It's not "just that", it's the whole point. It's hard to make kitchen products more addictive, so it doesn't really matter what the consumer company would like.

Premium noise-canceling headphones usually require $400+ with Apple's AirPods Max still well over $550, which makes quality audio seem like a luxury purchase that's relegated to people with unlimited budgets. The Bose QuietComfort headphones offer comparable active noise cancellation and high-fidelity sound but at nearly three times less than AirPods Max, and Amazon just dropped them to $199 from the usual $349 for Black Friday.

This record low price transforms these premium over-ear headphones into an accessible option instead of something you bookmark and never actually buy because the cost seems unjustifiable. The QuietComfort line solves the problem of wanting studio-quality sound and world-blocking noise cancellation without mortgaging your future.

The active noise cancellation is made through electronic sound wave inversion and passive isolation from plush ear cushions to create a silence that's almost eerie in noisy environments. You can effectively shut out airplane engine drone, subway rumble, open office chatter, and construction noise that normally bleeds through lesser headphones and forces you to crank the volume to an ear-damaging level.

Quiet Mode kicks in with full noise cancellation to let you focus totally on music, podcasts or just peaceful silence during stressful days. Aware Mode flips this experience by piping ambient sound into your ears through external microphones which makes you hear announcements, conversations or traffic without taking off the headphones entirely.

The soft and over-ear cushioning provides a gentle seal around your ears rather than digging in uncomfortably, like some headphones that leave you with sore spots after an hour. The headband is padded and spreads the weight across your head evenly to avoid pressure points, which develop on poorly balanced designs where much of the mass is concentrated in certain areas.

High-fidelity audio provides detailed sound reproduction across the frequency spectrum, enabling you to hear subtle elements in well-produced music that cheaper headphones smear into muddy approximations. Tunable EQ via the Bose app puts you in control of bass, mid-range, and treble levels to tune the sound signature to your preferences or particular genres.

With active noise cancellation running, battery life extends to a whopping 24 hours on a single charge. And with quick charging, you get 2.5 hours of playback from just 15 minutes connected to USB-C power, saving you when you forget to charge overnight and need to dash out for a flight or long trip. In addition, the included audio cable with inline microphone provides a wired backup for any of those situations where Bluetooth won't work.

But at $199 instead of the usual $349, you'll save $150 on headphones that go head-to-head with $400-$550 options from Apple and Sony, rendering this Black Friday deal an outright steal for premium audio gear. For that money, these Bose headphones cost about a third as much as a pair of AirPods Max but offer similar noise cancellation.

With a new study in the journal Cell, researchers at Stanford University and Stockholm University have contributed to increased knowledge about gene regulation in human cells.

How genes are turned on and off is crucial for the body's cells to have different functions. In this process, certain proteins, so-called transcription factors, find and recognize different binding sites on DNA in the body's cells to drive on or off signals. When this recognition goes wrong, it can give rise to many different types of diseases, such as cancer.

Now a group of researchers at Stanford University and Stockholm University have studied in detail how DNA recognition works for one key transcription factor. This particular protein, known as KLF1, is essential for the development of red blood cells which carry oxygen around the body. In this study, they developed new experimental methods to make more precise measurements of how KLF1 interacts with DNA both in test tubes and in human cells.

"The most important result is that we show it is possible to understand the binding between this transcription factor and DNA in human cells, and that this behavior is consistent with what we measure in test tubes. That is an important basic science discovery", says Emil Marklund, assistant professor at the Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics at Stockholm University and SciLifeLab, who has participated in the study that is now published in the journal Cell.

Transcription factor binding to DNA controls a lot in biology and causes the body's cells to have different functions, explains Emil Marklund:

"It is this process that controls that, for example, a nerve cell in the brain has different gene expression than a cell in the immune system. When the binding goes wrong, it can give rise to a great many different types of diseases. Genetic studies show that more than half of all mutations linked to traits such as genetic diseases occur in DNA sequence regions where transcription factors bind."

First author Julia Schaepe, a PhD student in the Greenleaf Lab at Stanford University, emphasizes broader impacts from the study's insights into how transcription factors read DNA:

"We discovered that this transcription factor pays attention to much more of the DNA sequence surrounding its binding sites than previously thought. By combining precise measurements in both test tubes and human cells with physical models, we were able to build a more complete picture of how DNA recognition works and, therefore, how gene regulation is encoded by DNA."

In this interview, News Medical-Life Sciences speaks with Lewis Irish, Sales Director at Monmouth Scientific, about the design and benefits of modular cleanrooms and how they support scalable, compliant environments across biomedical, life sciences, and manufacturing industries.

My name is Lewis Irish, and I'm the Sales Director at Monmouth Scientific. I oversee our sales operations, working closely with clients across a wide range of industries to deliver modular cleanroom solutions that meet their evolving needs. My role involves ensuring that our cleanrooms are tailored to specific technical and regulatory requirements and helping clients futureproof their facilities through scalable and adaptable designs.

At Monmouth Scientific, we design and supply modular cleanrooms for various sectors that require controlled environments. What sets our systems apart is their modularity, scalability, and adaptability. Unlike traditional fixed cleanrooms, our modular units are designed for quick reconfiguration and expansion. This allows clients to adapt to changing operational demands without the time, cost, and disruption associated with conventional builds.

Our cleanrooms are designed to meet stringent ISO standards and can be seamlessly integrated into complex facilities. This flexibility makes them ideal for organisations seeking high-performance environments without compromising compliance or operational flow.

Industries such as aerospace, electronics, and manufacturing operate in fast-paced environments. They often need to adjust for new production lines, evolving regulations, or upgraded equipment. Our modular cleanrooms are designed explicitly for that purpose.

Clients can reconfigure or expand their cleanroom setup without interrupting production. For example, aerospace manufacturers can install new testing rigs, electronics companies can increase production capacity, and industrial firms can switch to new product lines, all while maintaining contamination control. It is about enabling innovation and agility without being restricted by infrastructure.

We achieve this via pre-engineered panels, integrated service channels, and standardized connection systems. These components enable fast assembly, often in a fraction of the time required for traditional construction.

Our cleanrooms are also designed to include relocatable walls, removable ceiling grids, and modular lighting, HVAC, and filtration systems. These built-in design features enable easy adaptation of the cleanroom layout as operational needs evolve, with minimal disruption and downtime.

Scalability is at the heart of our modular design. We use repeatable, high-quality components that can be extended as needed to create facilities covering hundreds of square metres. These expansions do not compromise airflow management or ISO classification.

Our systems also include integrated monitoring solutions to ensure ongoing regulatory compliance across the entire space. Whether the client starts small or builds large from day one, performance remains consistent and verifiable.

We design with flexibility and long-term use in mind, and cleanrooms can be reconfigured internally. Walls, ceilings, and services can all be moved or expanded. As operations scale, production lines change, or larger equipment is introduced, the cleanroom can adapt with minimal cost and no major reconstruction.

This means our clients can maintain ISO-class compliance throughout operational changes, avoiding costly rebuilds or lengthy downtimes.

In biomedical and life sciences, regulatory compliance and contamination control are non-negotiable. Our cleanrooms are designed to meet strict ISO classifications, allowing for sterile and particle-controlled environments that support sensitive research and production.

A notable example is our collaboration with WOMED, where we designed modular, ISO-classified cleanrooms to support essential processes while also accommodating future expansion. Our approach provides a clean environment and one that evolves with the organization, without compromising safety or standards.

Our cleanrooms offer long-term value because they are not fixed assets. Panels, service channels, and modular elements can be reused when reconfiguring or relocating the space, which reduces material waste and capital expenditure.

From a sustainability perspective, this significantly reduces environmental impact compared to traditional construction methods. Operational flexibility paired with resource efficiency is a win for both budgets and corporate sustainability goals.

The feedback is overwhelmingly positive. Clients regularly cite the speed of installation and flexibility as major advantages. We have helped clients deploy large-scale cleanrooms in a fraction of the time it would take using traditional methods, which in turn accelerates their time-to-market.

Many also appreciate how easily the space can be modified in the future. As a result, their return on investment is often achieved much sooner, particularly when the modular design facilitates growth without needing costly extensions or downtime.

Yes. One standout case is our project with ZeroAvia. In 2022, we installed a 14m x 5m ISO 8 Modular Cleanroom at their UK site. As their operations scaled, they needed more cleanroom space. We were able to deliver a seamless expansion, a 14m x 9m extension, bringing the total space to 14m x 19m.

This project is an excellent example of how our modular systems can grow with the client's needs while maintaining performance, compliance, and operational continuity.

This article is based on a poster originally authored by Rachel Daniels, Yu Chen, Spencer Chiang, Tianfu Zhang and Yuehchun Hsieh.

Gene and cell therapies rely heavily on culturing immune cells in vitro, a step that remains critical to their development.

Due to the specialized and diverse nature of immune cells, such as T, NK, and macrophages, as well as subpopulations like γδT cells, each cell type requires its own customized media.

Conventional, one-size-fits-all media are unable to effectively support the development of these therapies because each immune cell population has distinct metabolic requirements, cytokine dependencies, and activation pathways.

In addition, specialized media for cell sub-populations are also not amenable when exploring different cell types.

Lengthy optimization processes in cell culturing are often required to achieve changes to target immune cell types, for example, the modification of CAR-T therapies to CAR-NK ones.

A recent study by ACROBiosystems has led to the development of a two-part medium comprising a universal basal medium alongside custom-formulated supplements that have been optimized and tailored for specified immune cell subpopulations.

This novel approach allows the creation of adaptable, fine-tuned media tailored to accommodate the specific functional and biological needs of each cell type. This is enabled by systematically adjusting critical media components, including nutrients, growth factors, cytokines, and serum alternatives.

Two different supplements have been developed to be paired with a universal basal medium: NK cells and γδT cells. The NK cell and γδT cell supplements demonstrate a 1,000- and 17,600-fold increase, respectively, at a purity of 97 % and 93 %.

Each developed cell media is highly customizable, allowing researchers to adopt and implement highly specific cell media for different cell subpopulations with ease. This customizability resulted in improved efficiency within a range of cell types as part of immune cell therapy research.

Figure 1. (A) Donor 1 and (B) Donor 2 human CBMCs were cultured using the Immune Cell Basal Medium with CelThera™ Immune Cell Supplement C. The resulting expansion fold exceeds 1,000 on Day 11 and can reach 10,000 on Day 19. Image Credit: ACROBiosystems



Figure 2. Human CBMCs were cultured for 2 weeks using Immune Cell Basal Medium with CelThera™ Immune Cell Supplement C. Varying ratios of NKp44/NKG2D/CD69, all markers of activation, reveal significant levels of activation after the culturing process. Image Credit: ACROBiosystems



Figure 3. Measurement of remaining target cells was performed after 7-AAD/CFSE staining and analyzed via ELISA. NK cells were used to evaluate cytotoxicity at several E:T ratios, revealing that more than 30 % of target cells were lysed at the lowest ratio, similar to control NK cells.

Figure 4. (A) Expansion fold and (B) viability of γδT cells were evaluated from PBMCs cultured with Basal Medium, T cell Expansion Supplement, and GMP Immune Cell Supplement D. Expansion fold exceeds 3,600 with a viability of more than 90 % across the culture period. Image Credit: ACROBiosystems



Figure 5. Cell population percentage of γδ2T after culturing using either phenol red or phenol red-free medium resulted in more than 80 %. After two weeks, a high percentage of γδ2T was achieved, using the addition of several supplements alongside the traditional basal medium, revealing the capability to tailor media to a specific subpopulation.

The development of this universal basal medium paired with custom supplements represents an efficient and versatile solution for culturing diverse immune cell subpopulations.

The approach described here supports the distinct biological and physiological requirements of each cell type by allowing the precise adjustment of nutrients, growth factors, cytokines, and serum alternatives.

The method presented here has been shown to be highly effective, enabling the successful expansion of NK cells and γδT cells, resulting in 1,000- and 17,600-fold increases at high purity.

This customizable media also streamlined the transition between different immune cell targets, lowering required optimization time and improving the scalability of gene and cell therapy research.

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are widely used to relieve pain and inflammation by inhibiting the cyclooxygenase (COX-1 and COX-2) enzymes involved in prostaglandin synthesis 1.

However, NSAIDs can have many adverse effects, including gastrointestinal bleeding 2. Some examples of pyrazole derivatives, such as Deracoxib, Ramifenazone, and Pyraclonil, have been reported as potent NSAIDs.3

To rationally design, synthesize, and biologically evaluate a new series of pyrazole-pyrazoline derivatives as structural analogues of Celecoxib, Indomethacin, and Floctafenine. The aim is to develop selective COX-2 inhibitors possessing enhanced antiinflammatory and analgesic efficacy and improved safety profiles.

Novel pyrazole-pyrazoline derivatives were synthesized via the Vilsmeier–Haack reaction followed by condensation and cyclization steps to yield amide and ester analogues. Structures were confirmed using elemental analysis, IR, ¹H NMR, and MS spectroscopy.

Anti-inflammatory activity was assessed by the carrageenan-induced paw oedema test, while analgesic activity was evaluated with the acetic acid-induced writhing test in rats. Molecular docking was performed on the COX-2 enzyme (PDB ID: 4Z0L) to evaluate binding interactions and rationalize biological results.

Most of the newly synthesized derivatives showed significant anti-inflammatory and analgesic activities compared with Indomethacin. Compounds 14b, 15b, and 22 produced the highest oedema inhibition (28.6-30.9 %) and analgesic effects (up to 84.5 % inhibition).

Docking studies revealed that compound 14b exhibited the strongest COX-2 binding affinity (-16.39 kcal/mol), forming key H-bonds with Arg120, Val349, and Ala527. The correlation between docking scores and in vivo activity supports their potential as selective COX-2 inhibitors

Structure-activity relationship (SAR) evaluation demonstrated that extending the alkyl chain and incorporating amide or ester functionalities significantly enhanced the anti-inflammatory and analgesic profiles.

Compounds 13b, 14b, and 15b with longer carbon chains exhibited superior anti-inflammatory activity (28.6-30.9 % inhibition), whereas pyrazoline analogues 18 and 22 showed the highest analgesic response (up to 84.5 % inhibition).

Cyclization to pyrazolines and fusion with a quinoline scaffold improved both potency and COX-2 selectivity. Molecular docking corroborated the experimental findings, identifying compound 14b as the most active through key interactions with Arg120, Arg513, Ser119, Val349, and Ala527 within the COX-2 active site.

To assess the in situ biodistribution of KLAS-PDT, MDC developed a workflow that integrated MSI and fluorescence microscopy for the identification of KLAS-PDT in preclinical models of melanoma. An algorithm developed during the data processing step enabled data integration, identification, and quantification of the KLAS-PDT therapeutic. Accumulation of KT-001 was observed from the five-minute time point using both IT and IV route.

Spatial distribution of arachidonic acid (AA) and its oxidized product hydroxy arachidonic acid (HETE). The distribution or AA matches the areas with remaining skin structure whereas HETE is localized in close proximity to regions with Rose Bengal. Similarly, other oxidized fatty acid species (shown in the table above), such as hydroxyl linoleic acid, hydroxy EPA, and dihydroxy EPA, were also detected with a similar distribution as HETE.

The detection of these species could be explained by the peroxidation of the fatty acid species pathway, where hydroxy fatty acid species are produced from the presence of reactive oxygen species (ROS), possibly derived from the activation of KLAS-PDT. All ions were putatively assigned according to their exact masses.

Curio Seeker tiles comprise a monolayer of barcoded microparticles (beads) that contain poly(dT) sequences, allowing mRNA molecules from the tissue to hybridize. Gene expression is reconstructed spatially by using the bead barcode to map individual sequencing reads back to their original XY coordinate. This approach enables unbiased, spatial, whole-transcriptome profiling at single-cell resolution.

The risks for serious physical illness, psychiatric conditions, and premature death are sharply elevated in people with eating disorders long after their initial diagnosis, a new study showed.

Risks for renal or liver failure, fractures, diabetes, heart failure, and death are highest within the first 12 months but persist for 5-10 years after diagnosis. Investigators said the findings point to the need for earlier detection, long-term follow-up, and an interdisciplinary approach to patient care.

“Eating disorders affect every major body system,” lead author Catharine Morgan, PhD, with The University of Manchester, Manchester, England, told Medscape Medical News. “Malnutrition, rapid weight change, and purging can cause long-term damage to the heart, kidneys, liver, and bones. At the same time, many people have underlying vulnerabilities — such as depression, anxiety, or difficulties coping with stress — that persist even after eating improves.”

The study was published online on November 18 in BMJ Medicine.

Eating disorders affect about 30 million people in the US — roughly 9% of the overall population — and have the second-highest mortality rate of any psychiatric illness.

Despite an increase in global prevalence, investigators said eating disorders are widely understudied, and data on long-term effects is especially lacking.

Morgan and colleagues evaluated the short- and longer-term risks associated with eating disorders. They matched 24,709 people who received a diagnosis of anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, or other eating disorder between 1998 and 2018 with up to 20 control individuals without an eating disorder (n = 493,001).

Most (89%) participants in each group were women and two thirds were aged 10-24 years. Among those with eating disorders, about 15% had anorexia, 21% had bulimia, 5% had a binge eating disorder, and 60% had an unspecified eating disorder.

Median follow-up was 4 years, with more than 10 years of follow-up for 20% of all participants.

Within the first year after diagnosis, people with an eating disorder were six times more likely to develop renal failure and nearly seven times more likely to develop liver disease. These risks remained twofold to threefold higher after 5 years.

People with an eating disorder were also six times more likely to develop osteoporosis, twice as likely to suffer heart failure, and three times more likely to develop diabetes.

An eating disorder diagnosis also took a toll on mental health, with patients seven times more likely to have depression and more than nine times as likely to engage in self-harm in the first year following diagnosis. These risks persisted at 5 years, although at a lower level.

The risk for suicide was nearly 14 times higher in the first year after diagnosis and remained nearly threefold higher at 10 years.

The risk for premature death was also elevated in those with an eating disorder. In the first year, the risk for dying from any cause was more than fourfold higher than control individuals and was fivefold higher for unnatural deaths. After 5 years, these risks were still two and three times higher, respectively.

It's “essential” to raise awareness among healthcare providers about the lasting effects of eating disorders and the need for ongoing support, the authors wrote.

“Health services potentially need to treat eating disorders as long-term conditions,” Morgan told Medscape Medical News.

“That means regular physical health checks (heart, kidneys, liver, bone health, blood tests) for years after diagnosis; ongoing mental health monitoring, including screening for depression and self-harm; clear shared-care plans between GPs [general practitioner] and specialist services so nobody falls through gaps; potential rapid re-referral pathways if symptoms return; and extra support during high-risk periods, such as the first year after diagnosis and transitions between services,” Morgan said.

Despite the high prevalence of eating disorders, their consequences are “underrecognized,” Jennifer Couturier, MD, and Ethan Nella, MSc, with McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada, pointed out in a linked editorial.

They noted that there has been “limited education given during medical training on the topic of eating disorders, and the current study emphasizes the importance of disseminating this knowledge to all healthcare professionals.”

“Medical education should place greater emphasis on the recognition and management of eating disorders, to equip primary care providers, specialists, and allied health professionals with the tools to identify early warning signs and monitor ongoing risks associated with eating disorders,” Couturier and Nella concluded.

This study had no commercial funding. Morgan, Couturier, and Nella had no relevant disclosures.

University of the Witwatersrand - Edson Mwebesa, Fellow at the Wits-based Sub-Saharan Africa Advanced Consortium for Biostatistics (SSACAB), knows children who died from late-diagnosed malaria. His research has also revealed that malaria is more prevalent in pregnant Ugandan women than in any other population. Malaria is also endemic across Africa, impacting all aspects of social and economic life.

Mwebesa, a biostatistician, wanted to dive deeper into what made people choose methods to help prevent malaria. He focused on social and behavioral change messaging, an essential part of encouraging people to use insecticide-treated nets (ITNs). While messaging campaigns have been implemented in the media, hospitals, and schools, the question of whether these messages actually change behavior remains uncertain.

Robust biostatistics methods used by African experts are set to change this.

Mwebesa applied a quasi-experimental causal inference method, known as Propensity Score Matching, to investigate this phenomenon. This approach can measure, with precision, whether messaging actually changes behavior.

Traditionally, measuring messaging impact relied on simple correlations and on counting how many people heard a message and whether they used a mosquito bed net. But correlation cannot reveal whether the messages caused the behavior, which in this case is using the mosquito net. Those who heard or saw the messages might differ from those who did not, and thus, the use of mosquito nets might not be comparable between these groups. Those who hear malaria messages are often wealthier, more educated, or better connected, and these factors independently increase bed net use. This has made it difficult for policymakers to know whether expensive behavior-change campaigns genuinely deliver impact.

Mwebesa measured the impact of messaging aimed at women in Uganda. In that country, about one in four children under five years old tested positive for malaria. In some districts, incidence rates over six-month periods have exceeded 500 cases per 1000 people, demonstrating how quickly the disease can spread in high-transmission settings. Malaria causes fever, chills, weakness, anaemia, and in some cases, complications involving the brain, lungs and other organs. Beyond the clinical burden, malaria disrupts schooling, reduces productivity and places immense strain on household finances, particularly among poorer families.

Understanding how to drive preventive behavior in this context is both a scientific and operational priority. Historically, however, researchers lacked the tools and data required to measure the impact of health communication. In 2001, economists John Luke Gallup and Jeffrey Sachs, writing in The Intolerable Burden of Malaria, explained that reliable data on malaria incidence were lacking for many of the most severely affected countries.

They constructed an indirect malaria index using historical risk maps, estimates of the proportion of falciparum malaria and population distribution data. Their work was pioneering but constrained by limited information, underscoring how weak data systems restricted the ability to study malaria's economic and social effects. They could not measure behavior or the effectiveness of prevention campaigns. They could only infer risk.

We're in a different position now. We have conducted repeated Malaria Indicator Surveys, geocoded demographic data, collected extensive health record data, and improved surveillance systems. What's most exciting, though, is how we are growing the capacity to analyse data using modern causal methods." 

Edson Mwebesa, Fellow at the Wits-based Sub-Saharan Africa Advanced Consortium for Biostatistics

Institutions such as SSACAB have trained a new generation of African biostatisticians who can use advanced techniques to answer complex policy questions that were previously out of reach.

Mwebesa used nationally representative data from the 2018–19 Malaria Indicator Survey and examined whether exposure to malaria messages increases the use of insecticide-treated nets among women of reproductive age and children under five in Uganda. The descriptive findings show that 37.6 per cent of women aged 15–49 and 37.9 per cent of caregivers of young children had been exposed to malaria prevention messages in the six months preceding the survey. Net use was higher but not universal: 69.3 per cent of women reported sleeping under an insecticide-treated net the night before the survey, as did 71.8 per cent of children under five.

Mwebesa's use of propensity score matching paired each woman who was exposed to malaria messages with another woman who was not, but who shared similar characteristics, such as age, education level, wealth, household size, region, and urban or rural residence. By ensuring that the two groups are comparable, the method isolates the effect of the messaging itself.

"For years, people assumed that malaria messages influenced behavior, but this analysis shows, with causal evidence, exactly how much they matter. Our findings demonstrate that communication increases net use. We can now quantify this," he said.

After matching, women who were exposed to malaria messages were 5.1 percent more likely to sleep under an insecticide-treated net than similar women who were not exposed. Among children, caregivers' exposure to messages increased ITN use by 4.3 percent.

These differences, when applied nationally, translate into tens of thousands of additional protected households and reduced malaria direct and indirect costs. The study also identified which communication channels were major sources of malaria messages. Radio emerged as the dominant messaging channel, reaching roughly two-thirds of women and caregivers. Community health workers and interpersonal communication were also influential. Digital platforms were used far less frequently, suggesting an untapped potential.

Professor Tobias Chirwa, Principal Investigator for SSACAB and Head of the Wits School of Public Health, explains why this type of work matters for Africa's statistical future. "This study shows what becomes possible when we combine strong African data with strong African statistical capacity. We move from describing problems to measuring impact. That is the essence of statistical innovation. African biostatisticians are leading analyses that were impossible twenty years ago."

In light of African Statistics Day, this work reflects an important shift in statistical justice and evidence sovereignty. Africa is no longer dependent on global assumptions or incomplete models. It can produce high-quality causal evidence that speaks to households' lived realities and informs local policy with accuracy and confidence. This, in turn, supports more efficient investments in communication campaigns, builds equity by identifying which groups are least reached and strengthens the effectiveness of malaria prevention efforts across the continent.

African Statistics Day 2025 highlights the theme of leveraging innovations in data and statistics to promote a just, peaceful, inclusive and prosperous society for Africans. In the field of malaria prevention, this theme is particularly resonant.

Dysfunctional breathing (DB) is frequently misdiagnosed or insufficiently treated, leading to a diminished quality of life and unnecessary medical intervention. While recent studies have focused on DB in patients with asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), its prevalence and contributing factors in the general population remain unclear. Additionally, tobacco use may exacerbate both respiratory symptoms and underlying comorbidities, while potentially contributing to DB.

A team led by Osaka Metropolitan University researchers aimed to investigate the prevalence and clinical characteristics of DB, as well as its associated factors. Furthermore, the researchers examined the interaction between tobacco use and respiratory comorbidities in relation to DB prevalence.

A cross-sectional Internet-based survey was conducted among 29,268 participants from the general Japanese population using the Nijmegen Questionnaire (NQ), a validated tool with high sensitivity and specificity for DB diagnosis. The findings indicated a DB prevalence of 11.0%. Univariable logistic analysis identified significant associations between DB prevalence and respiratory comorbidities, including asthma, COPD, and bronchitis/pneumonia. Notably, non-respiratory conditions such as epilepsy and cerebrovascular disease were also significantly correlated with DB. Multivariate logistic analysis revealed that current tobacco use and respiratory comorbidities further increased DB prevalence.

These findings suggest that DB is relatively common in primary healthcare settings, and exacerbated by tobacco use, particularly among individuals with respiratory comorbidities. Recognizing and addressing factors associated with DB is crucial for improving diagnosis, treatment, and overall patient outcomes.

U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) advisory committees play a key role in evaluating the efficacy and safety of new drugs. They include open public hearing sessions, whereby patients, clinicians, and advocates share input. To assess the experiences and perspectives of public speakers, Mass General Brigham researchers reviewed minutes and transcripts from 161 FDA Human Drug Advisory Committee meetings held from 2015 to 2023 and found that most public speakers support drug approval - especially patients or family members with personal experience using the drug and those who reported conflicts of interest (COI). Findings are published in JAMA Internal Medicine.

The study found 96% of meetings included public speakers. When assessing the 1,481 testimonies from 1,217 unique individuals, researchers discovered patients and family members accounted for the highest percentage of speaker testimonies (48%), followed by clinicians (21%), public health advocates who didn't come from organizations that represented specific diseases (13%), and patient advocates (10%).

Overall, 82% of the speakers supported drug approval and 43% disclosed a COI, typically that they or the organization they represent have received financial support from a drug manufacturer. The authors note COI reporting is not mandatory and this number may be an underrepresentation. Speakers with a COI were 11% more likely to support the drug than those who did not report a COI. For most speaker types, the majority supported approval; the lone exception was that 72% of testimonies by public health advocates did not support drug approval. Support was highest among patients and family members with personal experience using the drug – often through clinical trials. Of this group, 99% supported approval.

The voices of patients and advocates are vital, but to ensure more balanced input, the FDA should seek contributions from a broader range of perspectives and strengthen efforts to monitor and mitigate conflicts of interest among public participants."

Leah Rand, DPhil, lead author, research scientist in the Division of Pharmacoepidemiology and Pharmacoeconomics, Mass General Brigham Department of Medicine

The authors recommended more robust transparency measures, such as mandatory COI disclosures and methods to independently assess potential conflicts, such as through Open Payments platform for clinicians or organizations' tax filings. They also called on the FDA to consider strategies to solicit input from a broader array of stakeholders.

The study was not designed to determine the degree to which public comments influence committee votes or FDA decisions.

New imaging reveals how subtle lung changes may influence sleep and brain activity years after COVID, offering clues to why symptoms persist even when routine tests look normal.



Study: Long COVID: lung pathophysiology and its relationship with cognitive dysfunction. Image Credit: designium / Shutterstock

In a recent study published in the journal Scientific Reports, researchers examined whether lung abnormalities are associated with cognitive symptoms and brain scans in people with long coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) symptoms, at an average of 32±5 months (range=24–43 months) after infection. Lower lung gas-exchange efficiency within the Long COVID-19 group was associated with worse sleep symptoms, poorer executive functioning, and higher cerebral perfusion, suggesting a potential lung–brain pathway contributing to persistent symptoms.

Millions worldwide experience persistent symptoms, breathlessness, fatigue, exercise intolerance, and “brain fog” beyond three months after acute infection. Despite common respiratory complaints, conventional pulmonary tests often appear normal. Hyperpolarized xenon-129 (129Xe) MRI can sensitively measure regional ventilation and gas exchange, offering diagnostic value. Cognitive complaints are also prevalent, and prior MRI studies demonstrate gray matter changes, diffusion abnormalities, and altered perfusion. Yet the connection between lung physiology and brain alterations remains insufficiently understood.

Adults aged 18 or older were recruited from a post-COVID-19 clinic if they experienced persistent dyspnea or fatigue. Eligibility required a negative PCR test and either previous hospitalization, abnormal pulmonary tests, or chest CT abnormalities. People with active respiratory infections or other cardiopulmonary conditions were excluded. A subset who completed 129Xe MRI, brain MRI, and cognitive testing during the same session formed the core sample.

Participants completed questionnaires assessing cognitive complaints, mood, fatigue, dyspnea, pain, and sleep. Objective cognition was evaluated using the NIH Toolbox Cognition Battery with embedded validity indicators. Pulmonary testing followed standard guidelines. Brain MRI included structural imaging, diffusion tensor imaging, and arterial spin labeling to quantify volumetrics, white matter hyperintensities, diffusion metrics, and cerebral perfusion. 129Xe MRI assessed ventilation defects and gas-exchange efficiency; healthy controls completed only the lung-imaging component. Age-adjusted partial correlations linked lung metrics to symptoms, cognition, and MRI measures.

The final sample included 12 Long COVID-19 participants and 10 matched controls, nearly three years post-infection. Long COVID-19 participants frequently reported fatigue, dyspnea, headaches, and substantial cognitive concerns. Yet objective cognitive performance remained normal for all but one participant, who showed domain-specific deficits in executive function, processing speed, and language. Pulmonary function tests were normal for all but one individual, and no group differences emerged in 129Xe gas-exchange values.

Even without group-level lung abnormalities, within-group associations were notable. Lower 129Xe gas-exchange ratios correlated with worse sleep disturbance, higher cerebral perfusion, and poorer executive functioning. Cerebral perfusion itself was strongly tied to sleep problems. Gas-exchange efficiency showed positive correlations with executive function and a trend with global cognitive scores; these persisted after adjusting for anxiety and depression. No associations emerged with subjective cognitive complaints, brain volumes, diffusion metrics, or white matter abnormalities after age adjustment.

Findings suggest that impaired lung gas exchange may be associated with altered cerebral perfusion and sleep disruption, forming a potential physiological pathway that influences Long COVID-19 symptoms. The mismatch between subjective cognitive difficulties and normal objective cognition aligns with prior research and may reflect fluctuating deficits, heightened symptom awareness, or psychological factors.

Strengths include a multimodal design integrating lung imaging, brain MRI, cognitive assessment, and symptom profiling. However, the small sample, partial imaging datasets, and lack of cognitive testing in controls limit generalizability. Age effects and broad composite scoring may obscure subtle deficits. Overall, the results highlight the interconnected nature of gas exchange, cerebral perfusion, and sleep disturbance in Long COVID-19, underscoring the need for larger, controlled studies with comprehensive brain and cognitive assessments to clarify mechanisms and inform targeted interventions.

Drinking a maximum of 3-4 cups of coffee a day may slow the 'biological' aging of people with severe mental illness, by lengthening their telomeres-indicators of cellular -and giving them the equivalent of 5 extra biological years, compared with non-coffee drinkers, finds research published in the open access journal BMJ Mental Health.

But no such effects were observed beyond this quota, which is the maximum daily intake recommended by several international health authorities, including the NHS and the US Food and Drug Administration.

Telomeres sit on the end of chromosomes and perform a role similar to the plastic tips on the end of shoelaces. While telomere shortening is a natural part of the process, it seems to be accelerated in those with major psychiatric disorders, such as psychosis, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder, note the researchers.

Telomeres are sensitive to environmental factors, including, possibly, diet. And coffee, when drunk in moderation, has been associated with various health benefits, prompting the researchers to explore whether it might influence the rate at which telomeres shorten in people with major mental ill health.

They included 436 adult participants from the Norwegian Thematically Organised Psychosis (TOP) study, recruited between 2007 and 2018: 259 had schizophrenia; the rest (177) had affective disorders, including bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder with psychosis.

Participants were asked how much coffee they drank every day and were grouped into 4 categories: zero (44); 1–2 cups; 3–4 cups (110); and 5 or more cups. And they were asked whether they smoked, and if so, for how long they had done so.

Participants who drank 5+ cups a day were significantly older than those who drank none or 1–2 cups a day. And those with schizophrenia drank significantly more coffee than those with an affective disorder.

Smoking is associated with faster caffeine metabolism. And around three quarters of participants (77%; 337) smoked, and had done so, on average, for 9 years. And those drinking 5+ cups a day had smoked for significantly longer than any of the other groups.

Telomere length was measured from white blood cells (leucocytes) extracted from blood samples, and this revealed a significant difference among the 4 groups, forming a J shaped curve.

Compared with those drinking no coffee, drinking up to 3–4 cups a day was associated with longer telomeres, but not in those participants drinking 5 or more every day.

Those participants getting a daily 4-cup caffeine hit had telomere lengths comparable to a biological age 5 years younger than that of non-coffee drinkers after adjusting for age, sex, ethnicity, tobacco use, type of mental ill health, and drug treatment.

This is an observational study, and, as such, no firm conclusions can be drawn about cause and effect. And the researchers acknowledge that they had no information on potentially influential factors, including the type and timing of the coffee consumed, actual caffeine levels, or other sources of caffeinated drinks.

But there are plausible biological explanations for their findings, they suggest. These include the powerful antioxidant and anti-inflammatory compounds found in coffee.

"Telomeres are highly sensitive to both oxidative stress and inflammation, further highlighting how coffee intake could help preserve cellular in a population whose pathophysiology may be predisposing them to an accelerated rate of ," they explain.

Coffee is popular worldwide, with an estimated 10.56 billion kilos consumed around the globe in 2021-2 alone, they point out.

But despite its potential benefits, "consuming more than the daily recommended amount of coffee may also cause cellular damage and [telomere] shortening through the formation of reactive oxygen species," they caution, emphasising that international health authorities recommend limiting caffeine intake to a maximum of 400 mg/day (4 cups of coffee).

A study co-led by investigators at the UCLA Health Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center found that most of the benefits of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) for prostate cancer occur within the first 9 to 12 months. Extending therapy beyond that provides only small additional protection and increases the risk of other health problems, such as heart or metabolic issues. Results show that the ideal length of ADT depends on cancer risk:

ADT is a type of hormone therapy that is commonly given alongside radiation to slow the growth of prostate cancer by lowering testosterone. While effective at controlling the disease, long-term ADT can cause side effects, including bone loss, muscle loss and cardiovascular problems. Current treatment guidelines generally recommend 4 to 6 months of ADT for intermediate-risk patients and 18 to 36 months for high-risk patients, but the optimal duration has been unclear.

Researchers conducted a Meta-Analysis of Randomized Trials in Cancer of the Prostate (MARCAP) Consortium using data from 10,266 men across 13 international clinical trials. They assessed outcomes including overall survival, cancer-specific survival and deaths from other causes, comparing different ADT durations. 

The findings highlight the importance of personalized treatment plans for men with prostate cancer. Shorter courses of hormone therapy may be sufficient for many patients, reducing side effects while maintaining effectiveness. Physicians can now use patient-specific factors, including cancer risk, overall health, age and preferences, to make more informed decisions about ADT duration, improving both safety and quality of life.

Prostate cancer treatment should not be one-size-fits-all. These findings help doctors personalize therapy, balancing cancer control with potential side effects and other health risks."

A global analysis shows how modern lifestyles erode microbial diversity, destabilize gut communities, and amplify immune stress signals, revealing hidden biological costs of industrialization.

In a study posted to the bioRxiv preprint* server, an international team of researchers analyzed how lifestyle and levels of industrialization influence the structure of the human gut microbiome.

Their findings indicate links between industrialization and less diverse, more uniform microbiomes. Populations in more industrialized regions also showed signs of reduced community stability and heightened immune activity, including elevated gut stress markers.

Industrialized lifestyles have repeatedly been associated with major shifts in the gut microbiome, including reduced diversity, altered microbial compositions, and distinct metabolic traits. But these patterns could reflect many confounding factors, such as diet, genetics, geography, immune status, infectious exposures, and inconsistent sampling.

Another open question is whether industrialization-linked microbiome changes destabilize microbial communities or influence host immune and inflammatory responses. 

To resolve these issues, researchers require globally diverse populations and standardized, multidimensional microbiome and host datasets. The Global Microbiome Conservancy (GMbC) cohort was created to meet this need.

The GMbC enrolled 1,015 healthy adults from 12 countries and 35 local populations, representing broad variation in age, BMI, ethnicity, environment, and subsistence strategies. Participants reported no chronic or infectious disease at enrollment. This design captured large gradients in industrialization, urbanization, and subsistence while documenting detailed dietary habits.

Shotgun metagenomic sequencing profiled taxonomic and functional features. Human genotyping defined genetic diversity and admixture. Researchers compiled extensive metadata on lifestyle, diet, environment, and demographics, then reduced it to principal components (PCs) representing industrialization, diet, and host genetics. These PCs informed association tests, multivariate models, and variance partitioning.

Across the cohort, industrialization emerged as the single strongest determinant of gut microbiome structure. More industrialized populations showed markedly reduced alpha diversity and more homogenized community compositions, patterns observed across continents and within individual countries like Ghana and Cameroon.

Although diet, genetics, geography, age, sex, and BMI contributed meaningfully, industrialization (PC1-Lifestyle) explained the largest share of overall variation. Variance partitioning models showed these factors jointly explained up to 58% of beta diversity and allowed non-redundant effects to be separated.

Many bacterial species displayed consistent lifestyle-linked changes across multiple countries. While canonical “industrialization marker taxa” such as Bacteroides and Prevotella remained significant, others (e.g., Treponema, Akkermansia) lost significance after adjusting for confounders.

Functionally, 1,438 KEGG genes were more strongly associated with lifestyle than diet or genetics. Industrialized microbiomes were enriched in pathways including cobalamin (vitamin B12) biosynthesis and propanoyl-CoA metabolism, suggesting metabolic rewiring during lifestyle transitions.

Co-abundance network reconstruction showed that industrialized populations exhibited denser positive associations, fewer negative correlations, and decreased ecological stability, patterns consistent with lower resilience.

Despite the lower prevalence of gut eukaryotic protists in industrialized groups, IgA-sequencing revealed heightened immune activity. Although IgA-targeting patterns were broadly conserved across populations, specific taxa such as Phocaeicola vulgatus and Gemmiger OTUs showed lifestyle-associated differences.

The study highlights that microbiome-based disease prediction models developed in industrialized, primarily European cohorts do not generalize well to other populations. This underscores a significant equity gap and the need for globally representative clinical cohorts.

The elevated gut stress markers in industrialized populations raise the possibility that low-diversity microbiomes may influence physiological disruption or increase vulnerability to disease.

Complementary co-culture experiments from the same GMbC cohort support this hypothesis, showing amplified inflammatory responses to industrialized microbiomes.

The authors stress that some variation remains difficult to disentangle due to collinearity between diet and lifestyle. Future efforts will prioritize longitudinal sampling, regional capacity building, and context-specific interventions aimed at conserving global microbiome diversity.

Overall, expanding the GMbC framework will deepen mechanistic understanding, improve disease model accuracy, and ensure that microbiome science reflects diverse human experiences worldwide.

Fiberoptic bronchoscopy involves various topical airway anesthesia protocols, which can impact patient comfort, procedural ease, and overall outcomes. This study aimed to compare pre-procedure lignocaine spray (PPL) and spray-as-you-go (SAYG) airway anesthesia in terms of patient discomfort and operator comfort during fiberoptic bronchoscopy.

A single-blind randomized controlled trial was conducted at the Pulmonology Department of Shaikh Zayed Hospital, Lahore, Pakistan, from March 2021 to March 2022. Fifty participants were randomly assigned to two groups (n = 25 each). Standard procedural sedation with midazolam and 2 mL of 4% lignocaine spray in the oropharynx was used to suppress the gag reflex. Additionally, 2% lignocaine spray was administered during the procedure according to body weight (3 mg/kg) via oral scope insertion. Cough severity, pain perception, and operator comfort were assessed using the Visual Analogue Scale, Faces Pain Rating Scale, and a 4-point Likert scale, respectively.

Demographic characteristics were comparable between the groups, with a minor age difference (PPL: 53.25 years vs. SAYG: 50.88 years, p = 0.017). No significant differences were observed in pain perception, cough scores, or procedure duration between the PPL and SAYG groups. Operator comfort scores showed a trend favoring PPL (60% rated as "comfortable" or "very comfortable" vs. 28% in SAYG), though the difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.108).

This study concludes that PPL spray and SAYG protocols are comparable in efficacy for FOB, with no significant differences in patient-reported pain, discomfort, coughing, or procedure duration. Operator comfort was slightly higher with the pre-procedural protocol, although this difference did not reach statistical significance. Nonetheless, even a minor improvement in operator comfort could potentially lead to reduced fatigue, improved focus, and enhanced performance. Further studies with larger cohorts are warranted to validate these observations.

U.S. men's national team icons Tim Howard and Landon Donovan listed Sebastian Berhalter and Brenden Aaronson as players at risk of missing out at the 2026 FIFA World Cup.

Sebastian Berhalter made his case for the USMNT roster after a goal and assist against Uruguay. His proficiency on set-pieces could be a valuable weapon for Mauricio Pochettino as well. Despite his performance, Howard and Donovan both acknowledged the reality that the Argentine could go in a different direction next summer.

“I think Sebastian, for me, has to be on the team ... but he's on the bubble,” Howard said on their Unfiltered Soccer podcast. “I'm putting him on the bubble, too. I think he's on the bubble leaning in, but he's on the bubble,” Donovan echoed.

Matt Turner, despite losing his starting job to Matt Freese, is on the team for them and likely serves as a backup if the tournament started tomorrow.

Leeds United's Brenden Aaronson was also labeled on the bubble, despite Howard flip-flopping a little. “I want to say bubble, but I think he's in. I got him in,” Howard began.

“You got him on the team?” Donovan replied.

“No I'm going to put on the bubble right now. You just talked me out of it with one random question,” Howard remarked. To Howard's credit, Aaronson is one of the most difficult players to predict at this point.

He played against Paraguay and Uruguay in November often getting into dangerous areas, but a lack of quality in the final third let him down. The 25-year-old has registered just one goal in 12 Premier League games this season. 

At the national team level, Aaronson scored one goal this year at the Concacaf Gold Cup. Before that, his last goal came on Sept. 13, 2023 in an international friendly against Oman. Given the attacking talent at Pochettino's disposal, Aaronson likely has to prove himself moving forward.

Sebastian Berhalter epitomizes the energy and culture of the U.S. men's national team's Mauricio Pochettino era. Think about that. Berhalter is a player whose professional career is far from impressive. He's not a Europe-based player. He's hardly a front-facing star in MLS, even if he was a 2025 Best XI selection. Berhalter, though, in his limited opportunities under Pochettino and on a weekly basis for his club, has demonstrated a conviction to be part of the Argentine manager's culture transformation.

Take last Saturday night inside Vancouver's sold-out BC Place as the latest bit of evidence. LAFC had snatched momentum from the home team in second-half stoppage time, and it felt like Vancouver's wonderful season was slipping away. A pinpoint free kick from LAFC superstar Son Heung-min had tied the score at 2-2, completing a comeback from 2-0 down. In extra time, the Whitecaps were already down to 10 men and out of substitutions when resolute center back Belal Halbouni was forced off with a knee injury, zapping BC Place of its energy. But then there was Berhalter, barking at the home crowd and waving his arms with a contagious, primal energy.

Vancouver then survived the remainder of extra time with nine men, and before the penalty shootout, Berhalter whipped the crowd into a frenzy again. He would convert his spot kick and let out another cathartic scream before his side ultimately advanced to the Western Conference final for the first time.

Whether you believe that Berhalter has, as they say, that dog in him, or if he's more of a classic underdog, the 24-year-old is precisely what Pochettino wants from a national team player. Even more intriguing is the fact that Berhalter is the son of Pochettino's predecessor, Gregg Berhalter. It's a fascinating dynamic that may have only materialized because the U.S. had crashed out in the group stage of the 2024 Copa América. The elder Berhalter was subsequently fired. At that time, Sebastian was only beginning to establish himself with the Whitecaps. His pathway to the national team wasn't just unlikely, it was nonexistent. Firstly, because he was not playing at a level that would warrant a national team call-up, and secondly, and perhaps more difficult to navigate, would have been the prospect of nepotism.

Berhalter would not have been able to justify calling up his son during his nearly six-year term as the national team head coach based on all evidence. Sebastian is a Columbus Crew academy product who couldn't break into the first team and establish himself within an MLS Cup-winning midfield. As the national team's player pool and play style began to take shape under Gregg Berhalter in 2021, Sebastian was struggling as a fringe player with Austin FC, an MLS expansion side.

Austin's sporting director at the time, Claudio Reyna, signed Sebastian on loan in March of 2021 and later declined his purchase option. While he was not a central figure in the public feud between the Berhalters and Reynas after the 2022 World Cup, Sebastian was quietly embroiled in it. These are all realities. Sebastian was closer to being rooted to an MLS bench than he was to any type of international glory.

Pochettino's arrival occurred on a parallel timeline to Sebastian Berhalter starting to play the best soccer of his career. After a trade from Austin to Vancouver in 2022, for just $50,000 in general allocation money, he is now a valuable member of a team that is one game away from an MLS Cup final berth. Thomas Müller may be the Whitecaps' main attraction, but Berhalter is the proverbial heart and soul of the team.

And as Pochettino quickly established that no U.S. player had a guaranteed spot on the national team, a door for Berhalter opened. The Argentine manager, who took the U.S. job after stints with Espanyol, Tottenham, Chelsea and Paris Saint-Germain, was uninterested in coddling star players. Pochettino wanted to build a culture that tore down player hierarchies and catering to individual desires in favor of the team.

“We didn't see the desperation,” Pochettino told Andrés Cantor and Fútbol de Primera. Pochettino's answer came during a segment where he and Cantor discussed how players from around the world view the national team as the pinnacle of their professional lives, and that no call-up was to be taken for granted.

“But in the end, that mindset that they had — which is not the players' fault — is, ‘Well, they are friendly matches,” Pochettino said. “'I'm going to play, but I'm not going to risk getting injured, I'm not going to stick my foot in. I'm not going to run an extra meter or put in an effort, because if I get injured, then I can't play again.' In the end, that [mindset] is not felt in any other national team. And here, I think that is one thing that we have been able to change.”

It's worth revisiting Pochettino's responsibilities before he was introduced as the U.S. manager in September of 2024. He had replaced Thomas Tuchel at PSG and inherited a team with Hollywood appeal, in which Lionel Messi played alongside Kylian Mbappé and Neymar. Pochettino's PSG project was one that combined the highest of expectations, both domestically and in the Champions League, with the difficult task of managing some of global football's biggest personalities. Chelsea was another experiment in man management, high-priced talent and little margin for error.

With that foundation, Pochettino accepted the U.S. job with the task of fixing a team culture that had gotten too comfortable; where complacency began to undermine the bigger objectives.

“With Argentina or with France, with Spain, the goal is always to increase your chance of being in the next call-up,” Pochettino told Cantor. “What happened is that (in the U.S.) the idea had settled that certain players already had their position secured. It implies that they already take it for granted that there is a secured spot at the World Cup. So these are those things that sometimes I don't understand.”

So, yes, Pochettino's squad lists over 22 matches have been favorable to MLS players like Sebastian Berhalter. One surefire way to put pressure on the U.S.'s European contingent of players is to use the performances of undervalued and unsung professionals. It was the perfect situation for players like Diego Luna, Max Arfsten and Cristian Roldan. And Berhalter fits the mold.

“It's just that the cradle of world football, the world champions, are somewhere else,” Pochettino said. “They are not here. Here they are champions of basketball, of football, of hockey. Not soccer. Changing that is very difficult.”

With Vancouver, Berhalter understands what ownership and accountability feel like. He's a team leader and one of the squad's driving forces. What's notable is that Berhalter has gradually improved in nine senior U.S. team appearances. He isn't a player who dazzles. His technical ability is good, not great. He is, however, a very coachable player (it helps being the son of a coach).

No one is expecting Berhalter, a box-to-box central midfielder, to outplay a seasoned international in the middle of the park next summer. But he has earned the chance to potentially represent his country at the World Cup by personifying what a baseline U.S. national team player should look like: someone that is gritty, overlooked and devoted to the badge.

The likes of Christian Pulisic, a star at AC Milan, may embody what American soccer fans hope every future U.S. international can be, but a player like Berhalter — a fire-breathing competitor with a chip on his shoulder, is a true representation of the American soccer warrior. Berhalter has minimized his lack of experience and physical limitations by becoming a dead-ball specialist. Free-kick efficiency is only possible through hours of repetition. It's not an innate characteristic. Berhalter has put in the work and now has a level of expertise that could see him carve out a place on Pochettino's 26-man squad come May.

In the U.S.'s 5-1 rout of Uruguay last week, Berhalter played the entire 90 minutes. He scored the game's first goal from a well-taken set-piece strike that curled into the top corner. He added a set-piece assist and finished with a passing rate of 88 percent (28/32 passes) against a formidable opponent. Barring an injury crisis in the U.S. midfield, Berhalter is a long shot to be in Pochettino's World Cup starting XI on June 12 in Los Angeles. But he's on pace to be there as an option. As Pochettino has made abundantly clear, to represent this country at a World Cup takes more than stature. Berhalter may have what it takes to earn the ultimate reward in 2026.

What thoughts and feelings does Thanksgiving conjure? For many Americans, family and football are right up there. That's also the case for Green Bay Packers legend Antonio Freeman, who has now added the other kind of fútbol to his list. 

That's because his son, Alex Freeman, is now a breakout defender for the U.S. men's national team. And his recent performances for the USMNT have put the 21-year-old in the mix for a roster spot in next year's World Cup. 

It was just last week that Antonio bore witness to his son's ability while watching the USMNT take on Uruguay in both teams' final match of 2025. In that game in Tampa, Florida, Alex had a highlight moment when he skated past Ronald Araujo — one of the best defenders in global soccer — and scored his second goal of the night in the 5-1 rout

The elder Freeman, a Super Bowl XXXI champion and Packers Hall of Famer, celebrated alongside other parents and a few of his former teammates from a suite at Raymond James Stadium, home of the NFL's Buccaneers. But his mind went back three days earlier, near the end of the Americans' previous win against Paraguay, when the 6-foot-3 Alex rag-dolled three Paraguayan players during a late-game scuffle.

"I'd never heard Alex ever talk about him being in a fight," the elder Freeman told me in a phone interview. "Now here I am, seeing him in the middle of a flat-out brawl."

The incident ignited something in Alex, his father said, that manifested itself against Uruguay. Whatever the reason, it was a fitting capstone to 2025 for the youngster. Having just made a handful of appearances for Orlando City prior to this season, he earned the starting right back job under coach Oscar Pareja and performed so well that he then earned a callup to Mauricio Pochettino's U.S. squad for last summer's Concacaf Gold Cup.

A breakout turn in that tournament put Freeman on course to be one of Pochettino's choices for next summer's all-important World Cup, which will be both co-hosted by the U.S. and feature an unprecedented 48 teams – the largest field than any other edition in the 96-year history of the competition.

Alex Freeman's play for the U.S. this fall now has him on course to occupy a major role at the biggest event in sports. But hardly anybody foresaw Freeman's rise from MLS prospect to the highest level in the sport in less than a year. Pareja is one of the few. 

"It does not really surprise me," Pareja said of Freeman's breakneck ascent. "Alex has shown a lot of consistency since we got him here in the academy."

Still, Pareja saw something special in Freeman almost immediately. The former Colombian international and FC Dallas academy boss has a well-earned reputation for identifying young talent. While at FCD, he helped develop eventual World Cup participants Weston McKennie, Kellyn Acosta and Jesus Ferreira. So when Jesus Perez, Pochettino's top assistant, visited Pareja at the Lions training facility last spring, he suggested the USMNT take a close look at the kid with the famous dad. 

They did. Freeman caught a break when starting right back and 2022 World Cup alum Sergiño Dest, who had recently returned from ACL surgery, was given the summer off to further rehab his knee. Pochettino turned to Freeman. He has rewarded them handsomely.

"Our job and our duty is to see the projection of the player. And for that, we need to give them a chance and to see how they perform," Pochettino said after the historic win over Uruguay, the first time the Americans scored five goals versus a South American foe.

"We created a platform for him to show the quality, but the credit goes to him."

Perez credits Orlando and its staff, too. Pareja, in turn, praised Freeman's academy coaches and those with Orlando's development team. And then there are the younger Freeman's all-world genetics.

Antonio said his son was a late bloomer and that his growth spurt did come until he was 15 or 16. Alex now stands an inch taller than his 6-foot-2 father. 

That physique had his high school's football coaches salivating. They were disappointed to learn that Alex's mom forbade him from playing the gridiron version early on. But his world-class athleticism has translated onto the soccer pitch – which was on full display against Araujo, a veteran of the Spanish titans Barcelona.

"He's was always telling me and his mom that he wanted to dribble on guys," Antonio said. "Being a right fullback, he rarely gets an opportunity to get that isolation. Watching him just ease through the defense — it was just an amazing display of athletic ability, the way he dropped his hips, and was able to change directions. I was really, really impressed. And found out that he did it against one of the best defenders in the world? That was like icing on the cake."

And Alex is still only getting started.

A potentially life-changing 2026 will arrive fast. European teams figure to be lining up for his services as soon as the next transfer window opens in January. Yet for the next seven months, the World Cup is his first, second and third priority. That could mean staying put in MLS until after the star-making tournament, even if Orlando's nearly $20 million valuation is met by potential suitors this winter.

"I need to be in the best form for the World Cup," Alex told me last week on the eve of his breakout night in Tampa.  "I'm comfortable in Orlando. I know I'll be able to play my game there, know the culture, staff, know everything I have to do. It depends on what I want to do and what I feel is best for me. If something happens, maybe I move. But the World Cup is coming. I need to be ready for the most important time in my life."

Although father and son won't be able to spend this Thanksgiving together in person, both will be parked in front of a TV, watching their beloved Packers try to beat their division rivals Detroit Lions for the second time this season. And if all goes to plan, father will be following Alex and the USMNT across the country next summer at the World Cup, as the Americans attempt to make a deep run on home soil.

Beating Paraguay and Uruguay "hopefully woke up our U.S. fans," Antonio said. "They like that kind of feisty, that toughness, that grit on the field. We got some young guys and some older guys, a collaboration of great talent, and we're going to put our best out there at the World Cup and try to win it."

For Mauricio Pochettino and soccer fans around the world, “The Beautiful Game” is one of passion and high drama. However, in just over a year as boss of the USMNT, the Argentine has discovered that the approach of fans Stateside varies dramatically from their European and South American cousins.

The former Argentina international, who spent much of his playing career in La Liga with Espanyol before coaching the likes of Tottenham Hotspur, Chelsea and Paris Saint-Germain, and who is known for his passionate approach, recently told Andrés Cantor how he has realized that soccer is more “entertainment” than drama in the U.S.

“It's like American football, baseball, basketball or hockey. I think they are sports that are born to entertain the masses, right?” Pochettino, 53, said.

“Soccer is a way of entertaining people, of generating a few emotions, generating the possibility of enjoying a victory, but not dramatizing the defeat. Because there is no consequence of a descent in the MLS or of something being dramatic, right?

“At the levels that football, because when we talk about football, in other countries it is the drama, or it is the victory, that is, the defeat is the drama and the victory is the glory. So that already describes a little what the difference between football is. Not a little, it describes very graphically what soccer is to football.”

This is far from the first time Pochettino has bemoaned the lack of “drama” within stadiums during USMNT games, having done so following their 2-1 CONCACAF Gold Cup final loss to Mexico in Houston, where the support from the 70,925 fans felt overwhelmingly in favor of the visiting side.

“I would love to see my players playing with 70,000 people cheering,” Pochettino said post-game. “And for sure, if we feel proud about them, it would be amazing.” He, again, noted how soccer is seen as “entertainment” in the U.S. before calling on fans “to realize” their importance in the outcome of games.

“I think that today, like against Guatemala, it's a thing in our country to see how important the fans are to be in the stadium, to stay with the team, to support, not only through Instagram, social media, or behind the TV,” he said.

“It's to be here and translate the energy. For me, we always talk in America or in South America or in Europe; Football without fans is impossible. And here I think it's time to realize that we need the fans. Because the fans are there and they are so good for sure. And I think it's about to start to support the team.”

Thankfully for soccer fans, perhaps the USMNT's newfound passion on the field is something they can latch on to come the 2026 FIFA World Cup, which will be held across America, Mexico and Canada.

In recent months, Pochettino's roster selection has somewhat stabilized, built seemingly largely around personalities as much as players. The likes of Diego Luna, Cristian Roldan, and Sebastian Berhalter may not be the biggest names, but each brings fire, energy, and leadership that have perhaps lacked in previous rosters.

Very much a reflection of their coach, this fiery attitude was on full display late in their recent 2-1 friendly win over Paraguay, when a scuffle between Alex Freeman and Diego Gómez provoked a full-out brawl between both sides, clearing the benches and resulting in Paraguay's Omar Alderete being sent off.

While Pochettino publicly denounced the brawl as “very dangerous,” according to Miles Robinson on the MLS YouTube channel, “I think it's something that Poch really gets involved in, he likes that type of stuff, the passion, the heart of the games and situations like that.”

This sentiment was echoed by Max Arfsten, who said following the game, as per The Athletic, “Pochettino always tells us to fight, fight, fight. I think we embody that. These games are gritty and physical, I think this plays into our identity.”

Now with under seven months to go until the World Cup, and with the USMNT undefeated in five games, four of which they have won, perhaps this new-look team, led by an ever-passionate Pochettino, can inspire a fresh approach from fans once the tournament kicks off in Mexico City.

The United States men's national team have qualified for 12 World Cups — 10 through he gauntlet of qualification and two more as hosts.

MORE — 2026 World Cup hub | USMNT schedule | USMNT all-time records

This summer's World Cup makes it a dozen, and the expanded 48-team field, matches on home soil, and talent on the team and in the coaches' box have fans and the federation dreaming big.

But before Mauricio Pochettino's men take the field, let's take a look at how the Americans have fared in the last 95+ years.

There are a couple of ways to slice this particular pie.

The Americans finished in third place at the first ever World Cup, though that was a pretty primitive affair; The 1930 World Cup was a 16-nation tournament that from which 13 teams competed in part because one, Egypt, missed their boat due a storm.

The home World Cup in 1994 was brilliant for the program, and the 2014 World Cup features perhaps the best delivery of performances, but you can't overlook 2002.

For one thing, it's literally the only knockout win the Yanks have at a tournament and it came against heated rivals Mexico. And they would've needed to find a goal at some point, but they were denied a chance at a penalty and the lead at the quarterfinal against Germany because not a single referee saw a clear handball on the goal line

What might've been.



Sixteen nations qualified for the first World Cup, with two withdrawing and a third, Egypt, missing their ship when a storm delayed their connection.

The Yanks were in a three-team group and rode four goals from Massachusetts' Bert Patenaude to the semifinals, where they lost to Argentina. The Yanks were awarded third place.

Group 4USMNT 3-0 Belgium (McGhee, Florie, Patenaude)USMNT 3-0 Paraguay (Patenaude x3)

SemifinalArgentina 6-1 USMNT (Brown)



All 16 teams made it to Italy for the second World Cup, and the tournament was played a single-elimination bracket tournament.

The hosts demolished the Americans in their first game, with Pennsylvania-born Aldo Donelli scoring the only U.S. goal.

Round of 16Italy 7-1 USMNT



World War II threw a long pause at the World Cup, and the Yanks failed to qualify in 1938 as they withdrew from their intercontinental playoff qualifier with the Dutch East Indies.

They'd finish bottom of their group in 1950 but begin their baffling World Cup mastery of England by beating the Three Lions 1-0 on a goal from Joe Gaetjens. The Columbia University student from Haiti had declared his intention of becoming a U.S. citizen and was thus allowed to play. He'd later return to play for Haiti. Sorry, England!

Group 2Spain 3-1 USMNT (Pariani)USMNT 1-0 England (Gaetjens)Chile 5-2 (Wallace, Maca)



1954 qualifying: The Yanks beat Haiti twice but were beaten twice by Mexico as El Tri took the lone spot from what would become CONCACAF in 1961.

1958 qualifying: The U.S. went 0-4 against Canada and Mexico, finishing with a minus-16 goal differential.

1962 qualifying: A 3-3 home draw with Mexico did not see the scoring form continue in Mexico City, and El Tri won 3-0 to reach the second round.

1966 qualifying: The U.S. again drew Mexico at home but were beaten in Mexico City. They took two of three points from Honduras (wins were worth two points and draws one) to finish second and bow out prior to the final round.

1970 qualifying: Better! The Yanks won 3-of-4 from Canada and Bermuda, losing in Toronto. The second round saw home-and-away losses to Haiti to make it 20 years between World Cups. That number would grow.

1974 qualifying: Bounced from Group 1, taking a point at home to Canada but losing their other three games.

1978 qualifying: This one stings. The Yanks were again in the North American Zone, but this time two of Canada, Mexico, and the USMNT would reach the next round. All three teams claimed four points with Mexico in first and both Canada and the Yanks boasting the same goal differential. A playoff in Haiti saw Canada smash the States 3-0.

1982 qualifying: Third again behind Canada and Mexico, eliminated even before beating El Tri in Fort Lauderdale for the final qualifier.

1986 qualifying: Beat Netherlands Antilles to reach the final round of qualifying. Needed a draw or win vs Costa Rica in California to reach the World Cup, five days after drawing Los Ticos 1-1 in Alajuela. Lost 1-0



The Yanks returned to the big stage, ironically with Mexico missing out for using overaged players at the 1988 CONCACAF U20 Tournament. Beat Jamaica in the first round, then sealed their spot in Italy thanks to Paul Caligiuri's “Shot Heard Round the World” vs Trinidad and Tobago.

Group AUSMNT 1-5 CzechoslovakiaItaly 1-0 USMNTAustria 2-1 USMNT



One of the many stories of hosts' getting good results in the tournament over the years.

The Yanks made it to the Round of 16 as the third-best third-placed teams, then kept Brazil scoreless into the 72nd minute in Stanford. A Bebeto goal sent the Yanks packing with a buttressed reputation.

Round of 16Brazil 1-0 USMNT



This tournament is best left discussed by others. Oof.

Group FGermany 2-0 USMNTUSMNT 1-2 IranUSMNT 0-1 Yugoslavia



This was the year that minted thousands of passionate USMNT fans, as the Yanks surprised everyone by outlasting Deco's Portugal in the group opener and then knocked rivals Mexico out in the Round of 16. The painful thing is knowing that the Americans were far from second-best in the quarterfinals, a controversial 1-0 loss to a Germany team that barely beat the hosts in the semis. Why controversial? Torsten Frings handball to block Gregg Berhalter on the goal line was somehow not given as a penalty. Look it up if you haven't seen it, because you won't believe it could've been missed by a living, breathing, seeing human being (Yes, still mad).

Momentum was neither maintained nor built upon.

No, it wasn't an easy group. Yes, the Italy game was entertaining. No, we do not want to talk about two goals in 270 minutes — one from Italy and one from Clint Dempsey.

The tournament started with a Steven Gerrard fourth-minute goal before soccer remembered that England are not allowed to beat the U.S. at the World Cup. Sorry, we don't make the rules. We just like them. Unbeaten in the group stage and through to the knockouts because of that Landon Donovan stoppage-time goal, the Americans went to extra time with Ghana in the Round of 16, and it's best we speak no more.

We're not supposed to say Group of Death any more because people are uncomfortable with mortality, but oh boy. This was a roller coaster ride. Revenge against Ghana required a late John Brooks winner, then Jurgen Klinsmann's Yanks looked set to go 2-0 all-time against Portugal at the World Cup when Silvestre Varela scored in the fifth minute of stoppage time to force a 2-2 draw. Still, that was enough for a knockout round berth. Tim Howard's Matrix-like day was not enough.

This team had so much talent and played with its food. A coaching change from Jurgen Klinsmann to Bruce Arena during qualification didn't stop them from losing at home to Costa Rica and drawing Honduras and Panama away. A blowout of Panama in Matchday 9 opened the door to the throne room if they could just beat Trinidad and Tobago's B team in Couva on October 10, 2017. Whoops.



A disappointing draw with Wales was a point nonetheless thanks to Timothy Weah's first-half goal. Then England didn't even bother to show up to the second match because they know the rules about playing the U.S. at the World Cup and they drew to fall to 2D-1L all-time against the Yanks. Christian Pulisic, of course, then scored the lone goal against Iran and Berhalter's team were onto the Round of 16. Down 2-0 thanks to a nothing first half, the Yanks rallied to within one through sub Haji Wright and out-attempted the Dutch 18-11 but lost 3-1.

Although Achraf Hakimi managed to become one of Paris Saint-Germain‘s most important players and one of the best in the world, the Moroccan was reportedly on the verge of leaving the team. In the midst of his contract renewal talks, Real Madrid, the team that trained him, showed interest in signing him as a free agent at the end of his contract, which was set to expire in 2026. However, one detail caused a radical change, and he signed his renewal with the French team.

According to Diario AS, Achraf Hakimi was approached by Real Madrid amid his contract renewal talks with PSG. With negotiations seemingly at a standstill, the Moroccan was reportedly open to the possibility of moving back to Spain. However, the departure of Kylian Mbappe gave the French team a lot of salary cap space and allowed them to offer an irresistible salary and cornerstone role, which scuppered his return to the club where he started his career.

Hakimi did not return to Real Madrid, yet he has never hidden his passion for the Spanish team. In fact, Movistar+ cameras caught him at the Manuel Martínez Valero Stadium watching the game between Elche and Los Blancos. Having honed his skills at La Fabrica, Los Blancos team's youth academy, he feels a strong connection to the team. Despite this, he consistently shines at Paris Saint-Germain as a key player, earning him the African Ballon d'Or 2025 award.

After spending several years in Real Madrid's youth teams, Achraf Hakimi was promoted to the first team in the 2017-18 season. However, he failed to make much of an impact, playing only 17 games. For this reason, the Moroccan was loaned to Borussia Dortmund, where he impressed with his performances, but it was not enough for Los Blancos to decide to keep him. Therefore, the player revealed details of his departure from the Spanish team.

In PSG's last match against Real Madrid in the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup, the French team emerged victorious with a resounding 4-0 win. In the mixed zone, legend Claude Makélélé asked the Moroccan how Los Blancos had let a player like him go, to which he replied: “It wasn't me who decided to leave Madrid. It was them who made that decision,” Hakimi said, via DAZN in July 2025.

In 2020, Zinedine Zidane chose to retain Daniel Carvajal as his first-choice player, allowing Achraf Hakimi to transfer to Inter Milan for €43 million (around $49.8 million). Although he excelled as a wing-back, his perceived lack of defensive commitment did not reportedly align with Zidane's plans. However, Achraf Hakimi has since developed into a complete player at Paris Saint-Germain, demonstrating Real Madrid that letting him leave was a clear mistake.

Explore our soccer expert's Olympiacos vs Real Madrid predictions, pre Wednesday's 3pm ET Champions League clash (11/26).

Our betting expert expects an open game to produce goals for each team, with Ayoub El Kaabi and Jude Bellingham among the scorers.

Olympiacos know that they cannot settle for a tie in this match. They are going to need to start winning matches if they're to stand any chance of progressing. That should ensure plenty of attacking intent from the hosts, which may lead to a more open contest.

Their last two Champions League fixtures have seen both teams score. Four of their last six matches in all competitions have done likewise.

Olympiacos boss Jose Luis Mendilibar is certainly no stranger to this opposition. His Eibar side once famously stunned Real Madrid 3-0 in La Liga. In six of his last nine meetings with the Spanish giants, Mendilibar's teams have at least got on the scoresheet.

His direct approach should ensure a difficult night for the visiting defence. However, Olympiacos have conceded nine times across their last three European fixtures. Backing both teams to score appears to offer value.

The home side's main attacking threat is El Kaabi. The Moroccan is sure to lead the line, and he has frequently made his mark against the stronger European teams.

El Kaabi was pivotal to Olympiacos' stunning 2023/24 Conference League triumph. He scored five goals against Aston Villa in their semi-final tie. He also scored a penalty, having had a header ruled out, against Barcelona earlier in this campaign.

Real Madrid could be especially vulnerable to his pace and physicality in this game. That's because the visitors are likely to be missing centre-backs Eder Militao and Antonio Rudiger to injuries.

Militao has been a major loss for Los Blancos recently. They've allowed at least 1.2 xG in each of their last three matches. That will encourage El Kaabi, who is a good choice for an anytime goalscorer.

Kylian Mbappe has largely been Real Madrid's main attacking threat this season. However, his form has dipped slightly in recent weeks. That suggests there may be more value in backing another visiting player to score in this game.

Jude Bellingham is the most clear candidate. Alonso has spoken about the need for the Englishman to cover less ground and spend more time in dangerous areas. That has contributed to his increased goal threat.

The 22-year-old scored and assisted as Los Blancos twice fought back to level their clash with Elche at the weekend. He hit the target on three occasions in that game. Bellingham has also registered at least one shot on target in each of his last nine Real Madrid appearances.

He has scored in four of his last six matches for the Spanish giants. Backing Bellingham to score anytime with an implied probability of 34.5% seems to offer value here.

Despite favourable home fixtures against Pafos and PSV, Olympiacos have struggled to make an impact in this competition. They only managed to draw those games despite being dominant in periods.

Away defeats to Arsenal and Barcelona leave them outside the top 24. The Greeks have won their last two domestic fixtures, but they need to pull of a serious upset on Wednesday.

They might be catching Real Madrid at an opportune time. Xabi Alonso's side have gone three matches without a win in all competitions.

Their latest result was a 2-2 tie at Elche on Sunday, while their last Champions League game ended in a 1-0 defeat to Liverpool. However, Los Blancos remain in a strong position in Europe, having already secured nine points.

Olympiacos expected lineup: Tzolakis, Rodinei, Retsos, Pirola, Ortega, Mouzakitis, García, Martins, Chiquinho, Podence, El Kaabi

Real Madrid expected lineup: Courtois, Carreras, Huijsen, Asencio, Valverde, Camavinga, Guler, Vinicius, Bellingham, Brahim, Mbappe

Cristiano Ronaldo received only a one-match suspension with Portugal (already served against Armenia) for elbowing O'Shea in the match against Ireland.

A decision that will almost certainly allow him to play the first two group stage matches at the USA 2026 World Cup. 

This was made possible thanks to a loophole in article 27 of the FIFA disciplinary code, which allows for "the total or partial suspension of the execution of a disciplinary measure".

The usual regulations are clear: a player must be suspended for “at least three matches or an appropriate period for assault, including elbows, punches, kicks, bites, spitting, or blows to an opponent or a person other than a match official”.

A practice that - evidently - was not followed for Cristiano Ronaldo: a figure too important to miss the World Cup inauguration in the USA, according to The Guardian.

The English newspaper also reports FIFA sources: the favorable treatment for CR7 is explained by the fact that it was "only" his first expulsion with Portugal. A choice described as "offensive to the public's intelligence" by The Guardian, given that CR7 has been expelled 12 times with his respective club teams.

The newspaper also reports that the final decision came 12 days after the incident and shortly after a meeting between CR7, Infantino, and Trump at the White House. A coincidence destined to remain such in the statements, but which The Guardian strongly highlights.

The same newspaper does not beat around the bush: "FIFA needs 2026 to be a commercial success in a nation that will require big names to embrace a sport that is not as popular as others".

FIFA, moreover, was not exempt from criticism even during the summer Club World Cup, in which Messi's Inter Miami participated despite not having won the 2024 MLS Cup: which was won by LA Galaxy. (In the 2025 edition, Inter Miami was then eliminated in the 1st round).

According to journalist Tom Bogert of ESPN, MLS would have wanted to award the vacant spot to the MLS Cup winner.

Instead, the qualifying team was announced by Infantino at the end of the regular season: an unprecedented choice that fell precisely on Inter Miami. The Times commented on the news: "They needed something to spark broadcasters' interest".

Get unrivaled matchday access

Just over a year since U.S. Soccer announced the technical staff additions to complement newly minted head coach Mauricio Pochettino, first assistant coach Jesús Pérez—who's been alongside Pochettino for nearly two decades—has sky-high expectations for the U.S. Men's National Team as it prepares for the 2026 FIFA World Cup on home soil.

“We really believe that we can win it,” Pérez said of the upcoming tournament. “We know that everything has to be on your side to win it. We have to focus on ourselves, to know how we can be very competitive, that we have to win matches through all the different phases of the game."

As someone who is always by the side of the Argentine manager—whether it's on the sideline, at appearances or at post-match press conferences—Pérez knows firsthand the identity that a Pochettino-led group works to embody.

"We are trying to be very efficient in possession, take advantage of set-pieces, penalties; those things that can define a short tournament,” Pérez added. “The most important thing is to keep alive the wish and the dream that you can win matches. There are different moments and examples of teams that did it, they made it, and then wherever football take us, that will be the final result, but we don't want to set any limit.”





Pérez's unabashed belief in Pochettino's coaching philosophies and strategies stems from the pair's lengthy history together. The 54-year-old Barcelona native has been alongside Pochettino at each stop of the latter's managerial career, spending time with RCD Espanyol in his native Barcelona, Southampton FC, Tottenham Hotspur FC, Paris Saint-Germain and Chelsea FC.

Even before joining forces with Pochettino in 2010, Pérez's football-first upbringing and desire to understand the athlete, both in and out of their respective element, helped develop his current coaching approach.

Though there's nothing like football for Pérez, he's valued learning from other sports and especially appreciates watching the Olympics with its four-year cycle similar to the World Cup. He even had a stint as a swim coach, which he credits with shifting his perspective.

“I was curious how to coach just one athlete,” Pérez explained. “I was able to plan a whole season for only one guy with multiple training sessions, power sessions, all those things. That background helped me understand, and that's why I'm a fan of the individual work, because I really believe a player can improve until he retires. There is always something—a topic, an aspect of him as a person and as a player—that can be improved.”



Improvements both individually and collectively have been evident throughout Pochettino's first full year at the helm. The USMNT shook off a 2W-4L-0D start to 2025 and closed out the year with an impressive 8W-2L-2D stretch, capped off by a five-match unbeaten run against a quintet of opponents ranked in the top 40 of the FIFA World Ranking: Japan, Ecuador, Australia, Paraguay and Uruguay.

Pérez credits the USMNT's recent run of form to Pochettino's desire focus less on who they are playing but rather how they are playing.

“We are a coaching staff that represents a coach's philosophy, and [Mauricio Pochettino] is a guy who wants an energetic game,” Pérez stated. “But when I say energetic, [I mean] a team that cares very little about the opponent, a team that is focused week in, week out to improve ourselves, knowing that in front [of us] we have different types of rivals. We want to be able to compete against another team, sometimes using different approaches, but not because we change the approach but because the opponent forces you. We want to be ready to face those different challenges that a dominant team can give us. A team that is reactive can [challenge] us as well.

“That's why it's important to focus on yourself, to improve, how to press high, yes, but to be resilient and well-organized when the opponent forces you to be low. Transition quickly if you can, but if not, have a good positional game. We have a holistic approach to the game, and obviously the players' [mental] states and qualities will dictate what we can do more. We are not refusing to try to do things or to be brave, but to try things with responsibility, if possible. That's why we care very little about the opponent. Opponent is important for us on the build-up of the week, the drills we [conduct], but we don't put too many fears in the players' minds. We want them to be focused on themselves and how we can be better in every single phase of the game.”



With just two international windows and roughly 200 days separating the USMNT from the 2026 FIFA World Cup, Pérez, excited for one of the biggest challenges of his coaching career, is confident that the coaching staff's meticulous preparations will further cultivate belief amongst the players.

“The most important thing is the players' state of mind, because whatever your mind is able to fight against in a short tournament will be very, very important,” Pérez said. “We want them to be prepared, or at least to believe that they can go through any situation and no excuses. We as a staff, we are going to be prepared to help them in between training sessions, in between matches, during the match, with every single proven strategy. But the key factor will be the belief.”

Just over a year since U.S. Soccer announced the technical staff additions to complement newly minted head coach Mauricio Pochettino, first assistant coach Jesús Pérez—who's been alongside Pochettino for nearly two decades—has sky-high expectations for the U.S. Men's National Team as it prepares for the 2026 FIFA World Cup on home soil.

“We really believe that we can win it,” Pérez said of the upcoming tournament. “We know that everything has to be on your side to win it. We have to focus on ourselves, to know how we can be very competitive, that we have to win matches through all the different phases of the game."

As someone who is always by the side of the Argentine manager—whether it's on the sideline, at appearances or at post-match press conferences—Pérez knows firsthand the identity that a Pochettino-led group works to embody.

"We are trying to be very efficient in possession, take advantage of set-pieces, penalties; those things that can define a short tournament,” Pérez added. “The most important thing is to keep alive the wish and the dream that you can win matches. There are different moments and examples of teams that did it, they made it, and then wherever football take us, that will be the final result, but we don't want to set any limit.”





Pérez's unabashed belief in Pochettino's coaching philosophies and strategies stems from the pair's lengthy history together. The 54-year-old Barcelona native has been alongside Pochettino at each stop of the latter's managerial career, spending time with RCD Espanyol in his native Barcelona, Southampton FC, Tottenham Hotspur FC, Paris Saint-Germain and Chelsea FC.

Even before joining forces with Pochettino in 2010, Pérez's football-first upbringing and desire to understand the athlete, both in and out of their respective element, helped develop his current coaching approach.

Though there's nothing like football for Pérez, he's valued learning from other sports and especially appreciates watching the Olympics with its four-year cycle similar to the World Cup. He even had a stint as a swim coach, which he credits with shifting his perspective.

“I was curious how to coach just one athlete,” Pérez explained. “I was able to plan a whole season for only one guy with multiple training sessions, power sessions, all those things. That background helped me understand, and that's why I'm a fan of the individual work, because I really believe a player can improve until he retires. There is always something—a topic, an aspect of him as a person and as a player—that can be improved.”



Improvements both individually and collectively have been evident throughout Pochettino's first full year at the helm. The USMNT shook off a 2W-4L-0D start to 2025 and closed out the year with an impressive 8W-2L-2D stretch, capped off by a five-match unbeaten run against a quintet of opponents ranked in the top 40 of the FIFA World Ranking: Japan, Ecuador, Australia, Paraguay and Uruguay.

Pérez credits the USMNT's recent run of form to Pochettino's desire focus less on who they are playing but rather how they are playing.

“We are a coaching staff that represents a coach's philosophy, and [Mauricio Pochettino] is a guy who wants an energetic game,” Pérez stated. “But when I say energetic, [I mean] a team that cares very little about the opponent, a team that is focused week in, week out to improve ourselves, knowing that in front [of us] we have different types of rivals. We want to be able to compete against another team, sometimes using different approaches, but not because we change the approach but because the opponent forces you. We want to be ready to face those different challenges that a dominant team can give us. A team that is reactive can [challenge] us as well.

“That's why it's important to focus on yourself, to improve, how to press high, yes, but to be resilient and well-organized when the opponent forces you to be low. Transition quickly if you can, but if not, have a good positional game. We have a holistic approach to the game, and obviously the players' [mental] states and qualities will dictate what we can do more. We are not refusing to try to do things or to be brave, but to try things with responsibility, if possible. That's why we care very little about the opponent. Opponent is important for us on the build-up of the week, the drills we [conduct], but we don't put too many fears in the players' minds. We want them to be focused on themselves and how we can be better in every single phase of the game.”



With just two international windows and roughly 200 days separating the USMNT from the 2026 FIFA World Cup, Pérez, excited for one of the biggest challenges of his coaching career, is confident that the coaching staff's meticulous preparations will further cultivate belief amongst the players.

“The most important thing is the players' state of mind, because whatever your mind is able to fight against in a short tournament will be very, very important,” Pérez said. “We want them to be prepared, or at least to believe that they can go through any situation and no excuses. We as a staff, we are going to be prepared to help them in between training sessions, in between matches, during the match, with every single proven strategy. But the key factor will be the belief.”

Cristiano Ronaldo is now free to play at his sixth World Cup finals

It raised eyebrows, but probably didn't come as a huge surprise. Cristiano Ronaldo is available to play for Portugal in their opening matches at the World Cup, despite his red card against the Republic of Ireland.

Why? Because Fifa decided to suspend for one year the final two matches of his suspension.

Under Fifa's disciplinary code for violent conduct, Ronaldo should have received a three-match ban for elbowing Dara O'Shea during Portugal's 2-0 qualifying defeat earlier this month. 

Yet Fifa's disciplinary committee said it took into account that he had not received a red card in his other 225 international appearances.

He served one match in the final qualifier against Armenia. The other two will only be activated if he "commits another infringement of a similar nature and gravity during the probationary period".

So Ronaldo is free to join arch rival Lionel Messi at the World Cup in the United States, Mexico and Canada next summer.

But has Fifa exercised special treatment to get Ronaldo to their showpiece event, or have we seen this happen before?

In short, yes. There is a clause in the disciplinary code which effectively gives Fifa the right to cut or cancel any ban as it sees fit. 

Article 27 says Fifa can "fully or partially suspend" a disciplinary measure for "a probationary period of one to four years".

And Article 25 states "the relevant Fifa judicial body may scale down the disciplinary measure to be imposed or even dispense with it entirely".

France's Laurent Koscielny was expected to miss the opening two group games at the 2014 World Cup

There has not been a World Cup reprieve quite the same as Ronaldo's, where a three-match ban has remained in place but partially suspended.

But there several other examples of Fifa looking kindly upon players, reducing their ban from the mandatory punishment. 

The World Cup finals are the pinnacle of most players' careers. Articles 25 and 27 give Fifa the freedom to consider the merits and impact of a suspension. And it's not only been about star players.

In 2014, France defender Laurent Koscielny was sent off for slapping Ukraine's Oleksandr Kucher in the first leg of the World Cup play-off. 

Like Ronaldo, Koscielny was automatically banned for his country's final qualifying fixture. Fifa then chose not to extend the Arsenal centre-back's suspension beyond one match, allowing him to play at the World Cup. 

Croatia's Mario Mandzukic should have missed the opening two games of the 2014 finals after he was sent off for serious foul play in the second leg of the play-off win over Iceland.

Fifa gave him a one-game ban, meaning he could play the second match against Cameroon - a 4-0 win in which he scored twice.  

Towards the end of qualifying for the 2006 World Cup, Netherlands midfielder Phillip Cocu was sent off for an alleged retaliatory elbow on an Albania player. 

Fifa chose to ban Cocu for two matches, meaning he missed the final Uefa qualifiers against the Czech Republic and Macedonia, but was free for the opening match of the World Cup. 

Japan's Makoto Hasebe was sent off for an elbow at the end of qualifying for the 2010 World Cup, and like Cocu was given two matches. He was not so lucky, however, as the second match was the first game of the World Cup.

Likewise, Iran's Saeid Ezatolahi was sent off for bringing his boot down on the head of an opponent in their penultimate qualifier. Fifa chose to give the midfielder two games rather than three, and he missed just the first game at the 2018 World Cup.

In 2002, Mexico midfielder Jesus Arellano was given a three-match ban for violent conduct against Costa Rica. He missed the final qualifier against Honduras and was set to sit out the first two matches of the World Cup. 

But Mexico were successful in a late appeal just before the finals kicked off, claiming the suspension was too harsh. Arellano's ban was reduced and he only had to sit out their opener.

When is the 2026 World Cup draw?

England midfielder Lauren James was sent off at the 2023 Women's World Cup for standing on the back of Nigeria's Michelle Alozie.

James feared she would get a three-match suspension, meaning she would be ruled out for the remainder of the tournament. 

But Fifa decided to give James two games and she was able to return as a substitute in England's 1-0 final defeat by Spain. 

England also had success with Wayne Rooney's suspension for Euro 2012.

The Manchester United striker was given a three-match ban for kicking Miodrag Dzudovic during a 2-2 draw with Montenegro in the final qualifier.

Rooney would have missed the whole of the group stage, but England had it reduced to two matches on appeal. He then scored the only goal of the game against Ukraine, which ensured England topped their group. 

There are a few cases, and players who are sent off in their last competitive game before the finals will always miss at least one game.

At the 2006 World Cup, Germany striker Mike Hanke was very unlucky.

A year earlier, Hanke had been sent off for serious foul play against Mexico in the third-place play-off at the Confederations Cup.

Germany didn't have another competitive game for a whole year, as hosts of the 2006 World Cup, but Fifa stuck with the mandatory two-match ban.

Hanke was still picked for the squad even though he was suspended, and made one 19-minute appearance - ironically in another third-place play-off - as Germany beat Portugal.

In October this year, Qatar centre-back Tarek Salman was sent off in the second leg of his country's final qualifier against the United Arab Emirates and given the statutory two-match suspension for serious foul play. 

Ecuador's Moises Caicedo and Argentina's Nicolas Otamendi will have to sit out the first game of next year's finals after being sent off for two bookable offences in their final qualifying matches.

The same fate was suffered by Colombia's Fredy Guarin in 2014 and Serbia and Montenegro's Nemanja Vidic in 2006.

A two-match ban has cost players a place in their World Cup squads. Miranda (Brazil) and Cristian Rodriguez (Uruguay) in 2010 were both omitted because they had suspensions to serve.

Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta is reportedly prepared to rival close friend Xabi Alonso as the Gunners eyes a move for Real Madrid target Rodrigo Mendoza. The Elche wonderkid, who has a €20 million release clause, has attracted widespread interest from across Europe following his eye-catching performances in La Liga. Premier League giants Manchester City are also keen on signing the youngster.

Mendoza graduated from Elche's youth system and made his professional debut for the club in 2022. Last season, the midfielder featured in 21 league matches as Elche finished second in the Segunda Division and earned promotion to La Liga.

In the current campaign, Mendoza has appeared in nine La Liga matches, scoring once. His impressive performances in the centre of the park for Elche have caught the eyes of several top European clubs. 

According to The Telegraph, Arsenal are closely monitoring the progress of Mendoza at Elche and are prepared to join the race to sign the 20-year-old. The Gunners' recruitment specialists have kept a close eye on the Spanish youth international, who could consider triggering his €20m (£17.5m) release clause.

The Gunners, however, will face intense competition from Premier League rivals Manchester City, while La Liga giants Real Madrid have also shown strong interest in signing the Spaniard, who has often been compared to Barcelona and Spain playmaker Pedri.

Arteta is a childhood friend of Madrid boss Alonso and the two Spaniards have a very similar outlook towards football. The duo also battled it out for Martin Zubimendi in the summer, and he ultimately chose Arsenal over Madrid. Arteta also signed Piero Hincapie from Bayer Leverkusen after talking to Alonso, who lured Granit Xhaka to Bay Arena from Arsenal in 2023. 

Now, it seems the two friends will once again compete in the transfer market to secure a move for Mendoza.

Elche recognised Mendoza's talent last summer when they reportedly rejected a few offers from the Saudi Pro League for his services. In August, the Spanish club moved to secure his long-term future by offering him an improved contract, extending his stay until 2028. This new deal included the €20m release clause, which, while substantial, is considered "negotiable" and "certainly affordable" for top European clubs. 

Despite Elche's efforts to tie him down, the Telegraph report added that Mendoza is destined to leave the club next summer. He could also consider moving in January if any club triggers his release clause.

For now, the Premier League leaders are focused on the current season and will be up against Harry Kane's Bayern Munich in the Champions League on Wednesday. Ahead of facing one of Europe's best strikers, Gunners defender Jurrien Timber revealed Arteta's plan to stop the England captain as he said: "That is not going to be easy, of course. I think he is an amazing striker, everyone knows that. He has so many qualities. He has been doing it for such a long time already, and now at Bayern Munich he has been one of the best players in the world. So, it is going to be a nice challenge for us as a team, as defenders, to stop him tomorrow. I think when you face an opposition with Harry Kane as the striker, he is a topic and you discuss him as defenders, because he is one of the dangerous players. It is the same with any other game, we discuss their players and the way they play. For tomorrow, it is the same."

					Bridging the gap				

Haiti's recent qualification for the FIFA World Cup—the first since 1974—has reignited a sense of pride and unity in a country grappling with years of instability, gang violence, political dysfunction and mass migration.

CAP-HAÏTIEN — In a country weighed down by hunger, gang violence and political chaos, Haiti's qualification for the 2026 FIFA World Cup has sparked something rare: joy. For the first time in more than 50 years, the national football team's berth on the world stage has pierced through daily fear and exhaustion, offering a breath of unity and pride Haitians haven't felt in years.

​​At home, the qualification felt like a pain reliever.

Michelet Jerôme, 42, often worries when his 8-year-old son heads to school in Port-au-Prince, a city largely controlled by gangs, but that anxiety has eased for a moment.

“For once, I'm not so stressed out,” Jerôme said. “I was so happy, I spent the night tweeting and went to sleep at 3:00 a.m.” Jerôme told The Haitian Times. 

“The next morning, on my way to work, I talked about qualifying for the World Cup with the taxi-moto driver. He was so excited that he almost drove away without getting paid.”

Haiti has been starved for good news. Long battered by disasters, dysfunction and despair, Haitians have had few national wins to rally around. Even carnival, once a source of cultural joy and cohesion, has faded under the threat of violence. 

Now, after Les Grenadiers clinched a long-awaited World Cup berth, football is filling that cultural void—giving Haitians everywhere something to celebrate. On Nov. 18 in Willemstad, Curaçao, Haiti secured its spot with a 2-0 win over Nicaragua. Goals from wingers Louicius Don Deedson and Ruben Providence sealed the victory, sparking celebrations from Port-au-Prince to the diaspora.

“For the people stuck at home, it gives them value, makes them feel like they're not cursed,” James Beltis, a sociologist based in Port-au-Prince, said. 

“Qualifying makes them feel like they're here, things can get done, we're not dead,” Beltis added. 

“It's a breath of fresh air for the people. It makes them think about positive things instead of gangs, kidnappings, elections. People at home, in the streets, are talking less about the stressful things now. It's more about something entertaining now, soccer, joy.”

It's a similar sentiment in the diaspora, where people of Haitian descent often wake up to heartbreaking headlines from home — gang violence, natural disasters and political turmoil. This time, the news brought pride.

“We're probably going through Haiti's darkest moment in history politically,” said Oz'mosis Amadeus, a self-employed marketing specialist based in Palm Beach County, Florida. “We were still able to get this done. It feels like we can see Haiti now, feels like regardless of anything going on we're going to be alright.”

The last time Haiti made it to the World Cup was in 1974, when the team stunned Trinidad and Tobago in qualifiers and earned its place on football's biggest stage. That historic moment in West Germany marked Haiti's brief emergence into the global spotlight. 

Haiti's roster was mostly composed of homegrown talent playing in local clubs, a different profile from today's squad, which draws heavily from the diaspora.

Many people did not even know Haiti existed then and often asked the players where the country is located, Serge Racine, a defender from the 1974 squad, told FIFA. Nevertheless, the Haiti National Football team left an impression. In their first game against Italy, fans cheered for them every time they touched the ball on June 15, 1974 at Olympiastadion in Munich.

“For once, I'm not so stressed out. I was so happy, I spent the night tweeting and went to sleep at 3:00 a.m. The next morning, on my way to work, I talked about qualifying for the World Cup with the taxi-moto driver. He was so excited that he almost left without getting paid.”

Haiti stunned the world when striker Emmanuel ‘Manno' Sannon dribbled past Italy's world-class goalkeeper Dino Zoff in the 47th minute to score the opening goal — breaking Zoff's famous 1,142-minute streak without conceding. However, the European giant quickly leveled the score in the 53rd minute and ended up winning the game 3-1.

In its following game, Haiti suffered an embarrassing 7-0 loss to Poland on June 19, 1974. But the national team turned heads again in their last game, scoring against another powerhouse, Argentina, in a 4-1 loss on June 23, 1974. They finished in 14th spot out of 16 teams.

“We were very happy with our World Cup,” former Haitian midfielder Philippe Vorbe told FIFA. “Especially for amateur players from a far away little country in the Caribbean. It was wonderful for us and the memories of this experience will live forever.”

Now, more than five decades later, the moment repeats itself—this time with a generation that has only known a country in crisis.

The 2026 World Cup, hosted across the United States, Canada and Mexico, and set to kick off in June, will give Les Grenadiers a rare opportunity to celebrate their resilience and their football talent. Haiti has yet to win a match across five World Cups (men's, women's and youth). However, Haitians worldwide are dreaming big.

“We made it to the World Cup against all odds, so why can't we believe we can win it too?” Amadeus, 46, said. “Making it to the World Cup isn't the end of the road. The work isn't done. We need to beat Brazil. We need to beat Argentina.”

For the first time in World Cup history, FIFA have weighted the draw to ensure that the four highest ranked nations will not be able to meet until the semifinals, should they win their respective groups.

Spain (first), Argentina (second), France (third) and England (fourth) make up the leading quartet of qualified nations and will be subjected to FIFA's new regulations to modify December's draw. 

In the same vein as major tennis tournaments, Spain and Argentina—as the two top seeds—are guaranteed to be drawn on opposite sides of the bracket, establishing that the reigning champions of Europe and South America will not face each other until the final, on the assumption that they both win their groups.

The same applies to France and England. Didier Deschamps's back-to-back finalists are projected to battle Spain in the semifinal while the Three Lions would theoretically go up against Lionel Messi's Argentina should the knockout stages adhere to FIFA's world rankings.

These unprecedented tweaks have consequences stretching beyond the leading quartet of countries.

As co-hosts, the U.S. men's national team (USMNT), Canada and Mexico have secured a spot in Pot 1, avoiding matchups with the nine highest ranked countries on the planet in the group stage.

There are still difficult opponents on the horizon—the USMNT could theoretically find themselves up against 2022 semifinalists Morocco, Erling Haaland's Norway and four-time champions Italy (should they qualify from the playoffs)—which will be determined on Dec. 5. However, the order of those potential opponents is already clear.

Rather than being assigned their opponents in a random order, which was traditionally the case, the World Cup's three co-hosts already know when they will be playing.

The USMNT and Mexico have been given the same fixture path. Both are set to begin their campaign against a Pot 3 side—which could be anyone from Norway to South Africa, with a Scott McTominay-inspired Scotland also in the mix—before taking on Pot 2. 

They finish the group stage against Pot 4, which should theoretically be the easiest opponent. However, FIFA's stipulation that all playoff teams will be thrust among the lowest ranked nations has thrown a spanner in the works. Given all of the co-hosts are from Concacaf, none can land Curaçao or Haiti, giving them an increased chance of being drawn against one of the four UEFA playoff winners, which could be any of 16 teams, including the likes of Italy, Denmark and Republic of Ireland.

Canada will face their Pot 4 team first, with their opponents ranked in reverse order as they are up against Pot 3 before finishing the group stage with their toughest Pot 2 foe.

Bayern Munich striker Harry Kane will be out for revenge again when he faces Arsenal in the Champions League on Wednesday. Kane was once part of the Gunners' youth academy, but was released from the setup due to concerns over his physique. Since then, it has been the former Tottenham star's mission to always perform against Arsenal.

An image of Kane wearing an Arsenal shirt and celebrating the club's Premier League win in 2004 has been on social media for quite some time now. In the famous photograph, Kane can be seen alongside a fellow academy player and even his head is painted in Arsenal's red. In another viral image, Kane posed for a team photo with the under-8 squad in a full Gunners kit. However, his journey with the club did not last long.

The Mirror has spoken to some of the coaches who were present at Arsenal's Hale End Academy in 2004, regarding Kane's rejection. Apparently, the current England captain not only had what people might describe as 'puppy fat' at the time but was also not a great runner or athlete. 

At that time, Kane competed with Benik Afobe, who was considered as a brighter prospect and better athlete. Afobe, though, never broke into the Arsenal first team and was instead sent out on multiple loan deals before he permanently joined Wolves.

Kane also had his own struggles as he joined Spurs as an 11-year-old, and he initially did not have much impact as at the start of his career, as he spent several years out on loan at Leyton Orient, Norwich City, Leicester City and Millwall.

Kane has always been on a mission to prove Arsenal wrong and he has quite successfully done that throughout his career, registering 15 goals in 21 appearances against the Gunners. He often delivered in the north London derby for Tottenham and also played a key role in Bayern's win over Arsenal in the 2023-24 Champions League quarter-finals. In September 2024, Kane had opened up on his motivation to play against his old club as he said: "Yeah, probably throughout my whole career, really. Starting from when I was eight years old being released from Arsenal. That might have built a bit of desire to prove to them when I was that age."

Ahead of the Champions League clash against Mikel Arteta's side on Wednesday, Kane admitted he is worried about Arsenal's set-piece threat and has urged his team-mates to defend carefully.

Kane told reporters: "Of course I follow the Premier League. Arsenal have done well so far in that department. We've prepared for Arsenal as usual. The best thing will be to not give them any set pieces, to control the game - and we need to defend better than we have recently when we do concede set pieces."

Cristiano Ronaldo with Portugal coach Roberto Martinez Alexander Hassenstein

The Athletic FC ⚽ is The Athletic's daily football (or soccer, if you prefer) newsletter. Sign up to receive it directly to your inbox.

Hello! A key FIFA decision goes Cristiano Ronaldo's way. Who'd have thought it?

On the way:

The “will FIFA ban Cristiano Ronaldo for the start of the World Cup?” suspense was fun while it lasted. Those of you who staked your chips on “not a chance in hell”, collect your winnings now.

A 12-day wait between Ronaldo's red card for violent conduct against the Republic of Ireland and a decision on how to discipline him at least made it look as if the matter was given due consideration, but you could hear the sound of millions across the globe fainting as the cards fell in his favour.

Violent conduct, typically, carries a three-match suspension. While Ronaldo's dismissal forced him to automatically sit out Portugal's final World Cup qualifier — a 9-1 rout of Armenia, in which they missed him greatly — FIFA's disciplinary committee was compelled to consider whether a longer ban was appropriate.

The committee concluded that greater punishment should be imposed. And since Ronaldo's red card had come in a competitive fixture, any ban would apply to competitive fixtures, too, meaning he would potentially miss the opening games of the 2026 World Cup in the United States, Canada and Mexico.

But would you believe it? The kind men and women on the panel extended his ban to three games while conveniently ruling that the last two matches of it should be suspended “under a one-year probationary period”. If the 40-year-old keeps his discipline on the pitch for the next six months, he's good to go.

This will doubtless relieve the World Cup's organisers (also FIFA), who would rather one of the sport's most famous faces was present and correct for its big event. After all, it's Ronaldo's sixth World Cup, and he was at the White House with Donald Trump and Gianni Infantino last week. He's only just getting into the swing of things.

To be serious for a second, I've seen worse elbows than Ronaldo's swing at Dara O'Shea. All the same, violent conduct is violent conduct — and in an era of moral panic about football going soft, it's good to know that missing a cakewalk against Armenia is what the custodians of the sport think the offence is worth.

FIFA has confirmed all seedings and procedures for its World Cup draw on December 5 (more on the logistics of that event shortly).

By far the most interesting development is that for the first time, the world governing body is actively keeping the top seeds apart. Spain (ranked No 1) and Argentina (ranked No 2) are on separate sides of the draw and can't meet until the final. France (No 3) and England (No 4) won't play either of those two until the semis, or meet until the final.

All play-off qualifiers, meanwhile, will be lodged in Pot Four, meaning a tough, tough group for four-time winners Italy if they edge through in March. Check out all the permutations here.

The Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C. will stage the draw a week on Friday. With draining inevitability, FIFA's hiring of it is the source of some controversy.

A U.S. Senate committee has been looking into alleged “cronyism and corruption” at the venue. Henry Bushnell and Adam Crafton have the full details, but a contract now being considered by the Senate Committee appears to list FIFA's rental fee as precisely zero ($0.00 — no conversion to UK pounds needed).

Kennedy Center president Ric Grenell, however, fired back, saying: “FIFA has paid millions, plus covered all expenses.” The money, The Athletic was told, amounts to a $2.4million (£1.8m) donation and further sponsorship opportunities worth $5m. What people want to know is why the finances have been structured this way, rather than standard hire costs. As yet, there's no answer.

It's rarely wise to tempt fate with Chelsea, but they're sneaking up on the rails. They rose to second in the Premier League at the weekend, and last night's demolition of Barcelona at Stamford Bridge ranks as one of Enzo Maresca's best results as head coach.

Chelsea had Barca on toast from minute one, and a 3-0 win against 10 men was as comprehensive as it reads on paper. The pick of the goals was brilliant, scored (above) by the tricky Estevao, whose transfer fee of £28.7m might be weighty for a raw 18-year-old Brazilian, but it looks like money well spent. No wonder Raphinha was recently touting him and Lamine Yamal as the stars of their generation.

Manchester City, on the other hand, threw in another of those weeks they're prone to: defeat to Newcastle United on Saturday, defeat to Bayer Leverkusen in the Champions League yesterday. Malik Tillman shone for Leverkusen, and Weston McKennie scoring for Juventus won't disappoint Mauricio Pochettino either. But Jonathan David sealing Juve's 3-2 win at Bodo/Glimt was better news again for Canada. His three-month goal drought is over, and not before time.

Ilias Chair is a skilful and accomplished Championship (English second tier) midfielder for Queens Park Rangers. His international career with Morocco took him to the World Cup in Qatar in 2022.

The biggest headlines about him, though, concerned an incident two years earlier in which a man suffered serious injuries after being hit over the head with a stone during an altercation in southern Belgium. Chair was prosecuted for the attack and sentenced to two years in prison, a penalty reduced to community service and a fine on appeal.

He has spoken to Sarah Shephard about the assault, saying: “I just wish I could take it back. My sincere apologies to that whole family (of the victim).” It's a compelling interview, the likes of which you won't often read.

Chair, 28, isn't asking for sympathy, and I'm not sure he's due any, but I would give him credit for talking about something others might prefer to sweep under the carpet. Read Sarah's chat with him if you can.

UEFA Champions League (all Paramount+ in U.S. and TNT Sports in UK): Arsenal vs Bayern Munich, Atletico Madrid vs Inter — both DAZN (U.S.); Liverpool vs PSV — ViX; Paris Saint-Germain vs Tottenham Hotspur — ViX.

Draws for a tournament like the World Cup can be torturously long (and on that note — gird your loins for next Friday). They also have the capacity to be shambolic, at which point they get entertaining.

The draw for the English Women's League Cup yesterday ticked the second box. The social media influencer conducting it peppered the broadcast with innuendo and, at one stage, pulled a ball out of the bag before putting it back in. She also insulted Tottenham Hotspur, prompting an apology to the club from the Women's Super League.

Seemingly, an adjudicator was present, so the pairings were deemed above board. But I'm guessing that TikTok's GK Barry (for it was she) won't be invited back.

NWSL

Emma Hayes gets asked one question a lot, or, at least, many versions of the same question.

What does the U.S. women's national team head coach have to say about American players leaving the National Women's Soccer League (NWSL) for Europe?

“It's a subject I've spoken about so many times,” Hayes told reporters ahead of the NWSL Championship in San Jose last weekend. “My job as the national team coach is to support the players in whatever they want to do, and it's not going to change.”

This question has followed Hayes all year, initially sparked by Naomi Girma and Jenna Nighswonger leaving their respective NWSL clubs for Chelsea and Arsenal. This came up again when Alyssa Thompson made her record move from Angel City FC to Chelsea in September.

The conversation has again resurfaced now that Washington Spirit forward Trinity Rodman, who has expressed interest in playing in Europe, is officially a free agent. As she weighs up her future, European clubs have approached the 23-year-old, and one Gainbridge Super League club, DC Power, has offered the star a contract neither the Spirit nor any NWSL club could counter, according to sources who have been briefed on negotiations.

In Rodman's case, that conversation has hinged around the NWSL salary cap, which limits what clubs can offer players. European clubs have no similar restrictions. Hayes recently expressed her support for Rodman, but declined to speculate on what the NWSL should do.

She did, however, have thoughts on that question she keeps receiving.

To Hayes, who was Chelsea's manager for 12 years, the reignited conversation about U.S. players exiting the NWSL, and what that means for the league at large, fails to consider the bigger picture — that, in the history of women's football, players pushed for the opportunities current players now have. This, she stressed, should be celebrated.

In speaking with reporters last weekend, Hayes wondered aloud why her counterpart, U.S. men's national team head coach Mauricio Pochettino, whose USMNT pool includes several players who play abroad, wasn't frequently asked the same question.

“It almost feels like we always have to ask that question because it's women,” Hayes said. “Now, all of a sudden, women get the opportunity to choose. We should celebrate the position that women are in, to be able to do that. We shouldn't shoehorn it. We can have an incredible league and still have incredible U.S. women's national team players that play both here and abroad.”

There was a time when playing on the U.S. women's national team was intricately linked to playing in the NWSL. The U.S. Soccer Federation once subsidized the salaries of two dozen national team players, which meant U.S. Soccer could call them to training camps outside of FIFA windows. Foreign clubs were not required to release players in such a way. This, ultimately, created a culture where, to reach the U.S. senior team, players needed to be stateside.

It's why Lindsey Heaps, one of the current captains of the USWNT, signed with the Portland Thorns in 2016 after four years at Paris Saint-Germain in France. She aspired to make that year's Olympic roster and made the move after a conversation with then-U.S. head coach Jill Ellis.

The arrangement between U.S. Soccer and the NWSL ended in 2022, when the federation and USWNT Players' Association reached a new collective bargaining agreement establishing equal pay and effectively lifting any assumed restrictions on U.S. players and the leagues they played in.

“I have the conversation with the players, they're so grateful to the generations before them (for) putting them in the position to be able to bring to life what might be childhood dreams,” Hayes said. “I always compare it to studying abroad. It's funny — if our kids go and study abroad (and) say, ‘Hey, we're gonna spend a year abroad in France,' parents will go, ‘Amazing!' But when it comes to soccer, it's like you can't leave.

“It doesn't mean we're always going to lose people forever, and it doesn't mean we're gonna lose everyone. We just have to accept that different things matter to different people.”

Hayes referenced 21-year-old Jaedyn Shaw, who recently made one of the biggest intra-league moves in NWSL history. Gotham FC acquired Shaw from North Carolina Courage in a record $1.25 million transfer. Shaw has thrived with Gotham and was critical to helping the team secure their second NWSL Championship last weekend. Hayes has praised Shaw's decision and Gotham for identifying a player who has fitted so well into their environment.

Similarly, Thompson has thrived on the pitch at Chelsea. Thompson, like Shaw, forwent college soccer. But Thompson was drafted by her hometown NWSL club, Angel City FC, as the first overall pick in the 2023 NWSL Draft. It wasn't long before she was teammates with her sister, Giselle. A move to Europe offered her a new challenge far from home.

Hayes has been supportive of both players' decisions and used their cases as examples when making her point. “I find it fascinating,” Hayes said. “It's a question that keeps coming up, but it's a question that doesn't get asked in the men's game as much. I think we have to ask ourselves, why do we keep asking this question? It's almost like, as women, it's this sense of duty, instead of, let's celebrate the options that are in front of them.”

While in San Jose last weekend, Hayes appeared on the pre-game NWSL Championship broadcast on CBS and was asked by Ali Riley, one of the match analysts, what advice her former coach gave players when they were weighing major career changes.

“I do what I always do, which is listen, and try to work through all of the different talking points,” Hayes responded. “For some of them, they're working that out. They're trying to work through what it is they want and what they need, and they have a lot of people to support with that.”

This could vary from helping them navigate their futures or footballing advice within their existing environments. “Some of it will just be to seek to understand something they've always wanted to do for them,” Hayes continued. “Some players want to go and play abroad. They've always wanted to do that, whereas some players have no desire whatsoever to leave the U.S.

“It's finding what works for them, and then just helping guide them the best way that I can.”

FIFA's approach to ticket sales for qualified nations at next year's World Cup could prove controversial


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Football fans across the world will be eagerly anticipating next year's World Cup in the USA, Canada and Mexico, particularly if their country has qualified.

There will be some newcomers at the tournament: Cape Verde, Curacao, Jordan and Uzbekistan have all qualified for the first time.

And there will be some well-supported bigger nations making the trip to North America, among them England, who qualified under Thomas Tuchel without conceding a goal.

 




But there could be some concern for dedicated international fans about the difficulty of getting tickets for games at World Cup 2026.

That could even apply to fans of host nations, who might find there are far more neutrals in the stadiums.

Canada Soccer have reportedly been given an allocation of just eight percent of the "purchasable inventory" for each Canada game at the World Cup.

These will be distributed across various price categories, and will only be available for members of the CanadaRED program.

That would mean just 3,600 available tickets at the 45,000 capacity BMO field in Toronto, and 4,320 tickets at the 54,000-seater B.C. Place in Vancouver.

Other tickets have been earmarked for FIFA, sponsors, media and premium hospitality packages, while the worldwide ticket lottery is now open.

Dynamic pricing will be utilised again, as in Qatar, which will mean prices can increase for neutral fans depending on demand and seat locations.

 




Hospitality packages for matches have already gone on sale, starting at an eye-watering $2,500 (£1,900).

The cost of tickets and availability for fans is likely to be a major point of discussion at the World Cup. FFT would expect a uniform approach to ticket allocation, meaning fans of England, Wales and Scotland could face a battle to snap up tickets for their respective group matches.

FIFA will certainly hope there is more demand in North America, after several matches at World Cup 2022 in Qatar were played out at half-empty stadiums.

We've compiled the consummate collection of quizzes in The Ultimate FourFourTwo Football Quiz Book. This isn't just any quiz book; its packed with 2,500 questions across more than 180 different quizzes, designed to truly test your knowledge. From who scored the winner in the 1994 League Cup Final to which Swedish Club Peter Crouch joined on loan, and covering everything from the Champions League to the legendary Pele and everything in between.

Enzo Maresca's Chelsea team have just beaten Barcelona 3-0 at Stamford Bridge, and the coach should be very proud.

He's coached his team to some important wins, but this might be his biggest achievement yet. We needed to show we were back at the Champions League level, and we sure did that.

His previous peak was perhaps the Club World Cup win against PSG back in July, and according to the Blues coach, that was all part of Chelsea's preparations for this:

“Yeah. For sure [it helped],” Maresca said.

“Winning the Club World Cup gives the players the confidence that they need. Last year, we were playing in the Conference League, and I said many times that for me personally, if you want to build a winning mentality, there is only one way. Winning games. Because otherwise, if you don't win games, it's difficult to convince the players, guys, we are building a winning mentality. But when we don't win, it's difficult.

“So the only way in any competition, Conference League, Champions League this season, Premier League, FA Cup, Carabao Cup, is to win games. It's the only way to build the winning mentality. And I think the Conference League and the Club World Cup last season helped a lot. And now we are trying to do exactly the same. For sure, the players are better players in this moment compared to last season, because we spent more time together.”

Enzo Maresca also discussed the fact that his team kept a clean sheet against Barcelona, meaning they had broken a pretty impressive streak set by the Catalan side.

The Blues were serenaded by their fans all night, and Estevao's performance in particular got him some amusing treatment from the supporters…

The news story explains the FIFA draw process for the expanded 48-team 2026 World Cup, detailing how teams are sorted into pots and groups with regional restrictions.

As FIFA's expanded 48-team 2026 World Cup approaches, the organization's complex tournament draw is once again raising questions from fans trying to understand how teams are placed into groups. 

While the process may seem complicated, the basic structure is far simpler than it appears.

How It Works:

FIFA divides qualifying teams into four tiers, known as "pots," largely based on world rankings. 

Pot 1 includes the strongest teams and the host nations: Canada, Mexico, the United States, Spain, Argentina, France, England, Brazil, Portugal, the Netherlands, Belgium and Germany. 

Pot 2 includes additional top-ranked countries: Croatia, Morocco, Colombia, Japan and Switzerland. 

Pot 3 represents mid-tier nations, while Pot 4 includes lower-ranked teams and nations that have not yet qualified through playoff tournaments.

From there, FIFA creates 12 World Cup groups, labeled A through L, with four teams in each. 

Dig deeper:

The host nations receive special placement and are assigned to predetermined groups rather than being drawn at random. Once the hosts are slotted, the draw begins. 

One team from Pot 1 is placed into each of the 12 groups, followed by one team from Pot 2, Pot 3 and Pot 4. By the end of the process, each group contains exactly one team from each pot.

However, regional restrictions add another layer. 

A post shared by FIFA (@fifa)

What we know:

FIFA rules prevent teams from the same region from landing in the same group. A group that already includes a South American team, for example, cannot take a second one. The exception is Europe, which has the largest number of qualifying nations and allows up to two teams in the same group.

Once all 48 teams are drawn, the group stage match-ups are set.

What's next:

After group play concludes, the top two teams from each group and the eight best third-place finishers will advance to a round of 32 teams. FIFA then uses another structured bracket to ensure the highest-ranked teams do not face each other in the early knockout rounds.

Spain, Argentina, France, England will be top seeds

Fifa says measure will ‘ensure competitive balance'

The four highest-placed teams in Fifa's rankings have had a pathway cleared to meet in the World Cup semi-finals after tennis-style seeding measures were introduced in the name of “ensuring competitive balance”.

Spain, Argentina, France and England – the top four in descending order – are to be split into different brackets in the 48-team finals tournament, with the aim of preventing Spain from facing Argentina, or England from playing France, before a possible final.

The bracketing will hold only if those teams win their groups next summer, and echo the placements awarded to tennis's top seeds in grand slam tournament draws.

The seedings leave England and France in line each to play one of Spain and Argentina in the semi‑finals. Fifa said the pathways would be drawn randomly, meaning it would not necessarily be Spain (No 1) v France (No 3) and Argentina v England.

The group stage will comprise 12 groups of four teams. According to the seeding arrangements announced by Fifa on Tuesday, seeding will be split into four pots, with the three host countries – the US, Mexico and Canada – taking a spot in pot one.

From there the pots are decided by Fifa rankings, with the six as‑yet‑undecided victors of the Uefa and international playoffs in pot four.

This ranking system means the world's top countries will not face each other in the group stage, and the new measure will keep the very best sides apart even further.

“To ensure competitive balance, two separate pathways to the semi‑finals have been established,” Fifa said in a statement.

“This will ensure that, should they win their groups, the two highest-ranked teams will not meet before the final.”

Pot 1: Canada, Mexico, US, Spain, Argentina, France, England, Brazil, Portugal, Netherlands, Belgium, Germany.

Pot 2: Croatia, Morocco, Colombia, Uruguay, Switzerland, Japan, Senegal, Iran, South Korea, Ecuador, Austria, Australia.

Pot 3: Norway, Panama, Egypt, Algeria, Scotland, Paraguay, Tunisia, Côte d'Ivoire, Uzbekistan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, South Africa.

Pot 4: Jordan, Cape Verde, Ghana, Curaçao, Haiti, New Zealand, four European playoff teams, two intercontinental playoff teams.

Fifa's rules dictate that in principle no team should face another side from the same confederation in the group stage but that is impossible for European teams, with Uefa providing 16 sides. This creates the prospect that England could be drawn against Scotland, who have been placed in pot three, or alternatively Wales or Northern Ireland shouldthey come through the playoffs. No more than two European teams will be in any group.

One day after the draw, on 6 December, Fifa will announce the match schedule for the finals tournament. This will determine who plays where and at what time. According to Fifa, this process will be undertaken “to ensure the best possible conditions for all teams while, where possible, enabling fans all over the world to watch their teams play live across different time zones”.

Learner Tien will return to the Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF. The 19-year-old American booked his spot after a standout first full season on Tour.

The lefty ended last year by reaching the title match in Jeddah and built on that success at the Australian Open, where he defeated Top 10 star Daniil Medvedev. Tien reached the fourth round in Melbourne to become the youngest player to reach that stage at the hard-court major since Rafael Nadal in 2005.

Jakub Mensik has qualified for the Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF for the second time.

"I am super happy and super excited to qualify for the Next Gen ATP Finals for the second time," Mensik said. "The whole year was really good for me, winning my first ATP title with the Masters 1000 in Miami. It was a really great run and makes it even more special finishing the year as a Top 20 player. I am really excited to see you guys in December in Jeddah."

The 20-year-old made history earlier this season in Miami, where he stunned Novak Djokovic in the final to become the second-youngest titlist in tournament history behind Carlos Alcaraz. Mensik, 19 at the time, was just the fifth teen to defeat Djokovic on the ATP Tour.

In a standout year, the Czech jumped to a career-high No. 16 in the PIF ATP Rankings in August, while he earned four Top 10 wins in 2025, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index. Mensik defeated Jack Draper, Taylor Fritz and Djokovic in Miami and eliminated Casper Ruud en route to the third round at the Australian Open.

Daughter of two-time champion Hana Mandlikova, Mandlik has rocketed up 80 spots in the rankings since switching coaches in September.ByDavid KanePublished Nov 25, 2025 copy_link

Melbourne has been a special place for Elizabeth "Elli" Mandlik's family since long before she was born.“Obviously, my mom played,” the 24-year-old reminded me, modestly noting mother Hana Mandlikova's two Australian Open titles.But the family lineage goes even further: Mandlik's grandfather Vilem was in Melbourne running in the 1956 Summer Olympic Games, reaching the semifinals in the 200 metres.“Maybe I can be the third one in my family to do something big there!”Mandlik is set to return Down Under in January for the first time in two years. The former world No. 97 won the USTA's annual Australian Open Wild Card Challenge, edging countrywoman Claire Liu in a series of tournaments across a five-week stretch this fall.

When you're guaranteed main draw, you get a longer pre-season, you can enter a warm-up event or two before the Australian Open if you'd like...I've had to play qualies the last couple years so having the wild card means a lot. Everything feels much calmer. Elli Mandlik

“It's a really great opportunity for all the Americans to battle with each other and fight for that wild card,” said Mandlik, who made her Australian Open debut as a lucky loser back in 2023.🖥️📲 THIS WEEK: Stream the Australian Open Asia-Pacific Wild Card Play Off on the TC App!Prior to the Challenge, the Boca Raton-born Mandlik was just hoping for the chance to enter Melbourne's qualifying draw, her ranking having fallen to No. 270 at the beginning of October.

I feel very blessed to be playing a sport she played already. She knows the ins and outs and she's been able to prepare me for all the little crevices I might get into. Obviously, I've had to go through a lot on my own, but she knows how it feels when different things have happened to me, so it allows me to feel a little bit ahead of the game sometimes. She gives me so much support and knowledge. Elli Mandlik on mother Hana Mandlikova

“It was actually pretty crazy how it all played out,” Mandlik recalled. “We both won our first rounds and I won my second round. If she had won her second round, we would have played each other and that would have been the match to secure the wild card.“She ended up losing one round early, but it was crazy to think of people watching that match had it happened, and if they knew what we were playing for. It would have been a completely different level of stakes and pressure. Not being able to play that match was a little disappointing because it would have been such a great experience. Still, I was very happy to secure it outright!”Though still ranked outside the Top 100, the guaranteed main-draw entry not only lengthens Mandlik's pre-season but also opens more opportunities to compete ahead of the first Grand Slam tournament of 2026.“When you have to play qualies, it's more difficult because you can't play that extra warm-up. You have to cut your pre-season shorter,” Mandlik explained. “So, having that main-draw date and knowing your schedule makes things much easier. I've had to play qualies the last couple years so having the wild card means a lot. Everything feels much calmer.”

Mandlik's initial WTA breakthrough came in 2022, when she stunned Alison Riske-Amritraj and pushed then-No. 4 Paula Badosa to a third-set tiebreaker in San Jose.

Managing stress has been crucial to Mandlik's resurgence, allowing her rediscover the form that first turned heads in 2022. As a qualifier at a WTA event in San Jose, she knocked out Alison Riske-Amritra and pushed then-world No. 4 Paula Badosa to a third-set tiebreaker. A month later, she won her first Grand Slam main-draw match in at the US Open, shocking former Roland Garros semifinalist Tamara Zidansek.“In the past, I was more of an emotional player,” Mandlik recalled. “I could have a great week and then have a horrible week and get really upset about that. It was kind of like a roller coaster in my mind. As I got more used to being on tour, breaking into the Top 100 and falling out, I've really figured out how to calm my mind and work through all the day-to-day things that let me play every day like it's the same.”Drawing experience from her mother, a five-time major champion and Hall of Famer, has also impacted her development.

After falling to No. 270 in the WTA rankings at the end of September, Mandlik is back in the Top 200 thanks to a title run at the W100 tournament in Edmond, Oklahoma.

“I feel very blessed to be playing a sport she played already. She knows the ins and outs and she's been able to prepare me for all the little crevices I might get into. Obviously, I've had to go through a lot on my own, but she knows how it feels when different things have happened to me, so it allows me to feel a little bit ahead of the game sometimes. She gives me so much support and knowledge.”Mandlik will have family joining her in Melbourne; her brother and his fiancée will be making the trip for the first time, and Mandlik herself plans for an early arrival Down Under to maximize her prep time for her first major main-draw match since 2023 Roland Garros.But before the Mandlik family begins a third generation's quest for success in Australia, they'll spend the off-season together at home.“I travel all the time as it is!” joked Mandlik, having already booked her first big ticket of 2026.

A few months later at Roland Garros, Tiafoe got the last laugh when Gauff joined the club. She walked onto Court Philippe Chatrier for her first-round match carrying an empty bag of her own.Read More: Coco Gauff forgets her racquets, but brings Parisian style, in Roland Garros opening winGauff went viral after arriving to face Australia's Olivia Gadecki in a stylish leather jacket and a fresh New Balance kit, only to quickly realize she was missing something essential."She was full out shaking her whole bag like it was an empty cookie jar on Chatrier,” Tiafoe recounted. “I was like, ‘What are you doing?'"... I'm going to keep ripping her for a long time. I've never seen someone (ranked No. 2) in the world have zero things in her bag. That was incredible.”

Gauff explained the mishap in her on-court interview: "Honestly, as long as I've been on Tour, my coach has always put the racquets in the bag before the match because he's very superstitious. He likes to grip each racquet new each day. I don't care, I can play with a dirty grip.“And so I go on the court and I realize I have no racquets, and I literally just made fun of Frances for it in Madrid. But now I'll be quiet."Gauff recovered, defeated Gadecki 6-2, 6-2, and went on to win her second Grand Slam title at Roland Garros—but she didn't escape Tiafoe's jokes."@cocogauff you gotta get more professional I'd never do something like this," Tiafoe wrote on Instagram."Can't believe I'm in the same stat line as @bigfoe1998 smh 🤦🏾‍♀️," Gauff replied.

F1 Academy: The Story of the 2025 Season

Doriane Pin's journey to the 2025 F1 Academy title

Find out who topped the Power Rankings table after the Las Vegas Grand Prix weekend.

Max Verstappen took a crucial win in the Las Vegas Grand Prix, and with both McLaren drivers disqualified, slashed Lando Norris' championship lead to just 24 points. The Dutchman topped the top 10 of our Power Rankings list, but who else impressed last weekend? Check out the latest scores and overall leaderboard below...

Having overtaken poleman Lando Norris when the McLaren driver ran wide at Turn 1, Max Verstappen never looked back en route to his sixth win of the 2025 campaign. The Red Bull driver briefly had to soak up pressure from George Russell's Mercedes, but thereafter cruised to a 20-second-plus win. With Norris and team mate Oscar Piastri both disqualified, Verstappen remains a real threat for the title with two Grands Prix and a Sprint remaining, as the Dutchman sits tied on points with Piastri and just 24 behind Norris.

A disastrous Qualifying left Kimi Antonelli only P17 on the grid as moving fractionally before the lights went out then earned the Mercedes driver a five-second penalty. Despite that, the Formula 1 rookie put in an inspired drive, switching his soft tyres on the second lap and running the remaining 48 tours with a set of hard tyres. He moved into fourth, holding Piastri at bay and only dropping behind at the chequered flag due to the penalty, before the McLaren disqualification moved the Italian up to an unlikely podium.

A seventh pole position of the season – achieved in treacherous conditions – put Norris in prime position for victory and practically allowed him to place one hand on a maiden Drivers' World Championship. The Briton aggressively cut across the front of Verstappen off the line but ran deep into Turn 1, dropping behind both Verstappen and Russell. Biding his time to overtake Russell in the second stint, Norris was comfortably P2 until backing off substantially over the final laps. The team's call was linked to concerns over skid block wear which would ultimately prove futile as he was disqualified – a result that could have huge ramifications for the title.

Another impressive Qualifying performance on a low-downforce, high-speed circuit similar to Baku left Carlos Sainz third on the grid, which eventually became P5 in the final classification. The Williams driver lost a position to Russell at the start but held quicker cars including Charles Leclerc and Piastri at bay over the opening stint, only slipping behind the pair after the pit stop sequence. Promoted two places due to McLaren's disqualification, Sainz achieved his second-best result of the season after his Baku podium, finishing more than 10 seconds clear of Isack Hadjar.

Having just missed out on a Q3 appearance after finishing P11 in Qualifying, Nico Hulkenberg utilised the hard tyre in the opening stint compared to all those ahead on the medium rubber. Extending his first stint, which ultimately allowed him to rejoin in P9, the Kick Sauber driver was never headed again and jumped up to seventh in the final classification. It has moved the team to within four and five points respectively of Aston Martin and Haas in the Constructors' Championship after back-to-back scores for the German.

A winner in Las Vegas 12 months ago, Russell ultimately had to settle for the runner-up spot in 2025 having nursed a steering issue from the opening laps. It didn't stop the Mercedes driver jumping ahead of poleman Norris on the first lap, though, and the Briton even challenged Verstappen in the first stint. Pushing too hard in the second stint destroyed his tyres and allowed Norris back ahead, but P2 beckoned with McLaren's impending infringement.

Going under the radar, Hadjar bagged more points for Racing Bulls and back-to-back scores in the process having been classified sixth in Las Vegas. The Frenchman qualified P8 but moved up several positions through the opening turn, finding himself initially in fifth before being re-passed by Piastri's McLaren and Leclerc's Ferrari in the opening stint. Having made his sole pit stop, Hadjar circulated alone for the second stint to solidify Racing Bulls' P6 in the Teams' Championship.

Having struggled for pace in a wet Qualifying, Leclerc put on a charge during the race and ultimately just fell short of a podium by two-tenths. Starting P9 and having just avoided been taken out through the opening corner, Leclerc went on to overtake Ollie Bearman, Piastri and Hadjar, as well as Sainz as the Williams exited the pits. Sub-optimal strategy meant he rejoined behind Piastri and slipped away from the battling McLaren driver and Antonelli ahead, the Ferrari driver eventually classified P4.

Left only P5 on the grid, Piastri slipped behind both Racing Bulls at the first corner which included contact from Liam Lawson. The Kiwi suffered an issue on the second lap allowing Piastri back ahead, but the McLaren driver then slipped behind Leclerc in the opening stint, only moving back ahead through the pit stop sequence. Stuck behind Antonelli in the final phase and eventually being disqualified from P4, a potential 30-point gap to Norris is just 24 heading to Qatar.

Quietly going about his business, Esteban Ocon raced on the fringes of the top 10 for much of proceedings, having started P13 and eventually finished just outside the points in P11. McLaren's double disqualification helped move Ocon and Haas team mate Bearman into the points, the American team also moving ahead of Aston Martin in the Teams' Championship by a single point as a result.

Bearman just misses out on a place in the top half of this week's Power Rankings, the Briton having run in the points in the early stages and re-passed Fernando Alonso in the second stint before taking P10.

Editorial Director/Box Office Editor


	Well, it's finally here: the last big opening of 2025. This morning, 20th Century Studios' James Cameron directed threequel Avatar: Fire and Ash arrived on tracking three weekends ahead of its Dec. 19 opening and it's looking pretty good with a $110M debut or $100M-$130M range. 


	You don't get to those numbers unless it's a four-quad movie, and Avatar: Fire and Ash is strong with men and women in first choice (mostly men, but also solid enough with women). Note, it's behind the first tracking first choice numbers of Avatar: Way of Water, which opened to $134.1M, and that's just fine. Note, unlike most Marvel Studios movies, Avatar movies are appointment viewing. Audiences seek out the best 3D, Imax and premium large format seats. There's no Easter Eggs going on ala a Marvel movie which require an immediate rush-out by fans.

Avatar: Way of Water‘s tracking indicated a $150M-$175M opening three years ago, but the sequel came in below that. What went wrong? Tracking was working off the gas and comparison to Sony/Marvel Studios' Spider-Man: No Way Home the holiday season prior which posted the second biggest domestic opening ever at $260.1M behind Avengers: Endgame ($357.1M). Note, for Avatar: Way of Water to come out and open to $134M, 13 years after the original movie's $77M opening — well, that was fantastic. Nothing to ding. When we're talking about the opening for Avatar: Fire and Ash, consider, Avatar: Way of Water‘s domestic start essentially the ceiling in regards to a first weekend comp.

Avatar: The Way of Water did a 5x multiple off its domestic opening for a final of $688.4M in U.S./Canada. And that's with a badass winter storm during its second weekend. Worldwide it was $2.34 billion, the third highest grossing movie ever. 


	During the press tour of Avatar: Way of Water earlier this fall, Cameron said he's not committing to a fourth Avatar movie, despite having footage in the can, until the success of the third movie is determined; that's because these movies cost a ton. Avatar: Way of Water was the most profitable Hollywood movie of 2022 earning well over half billion in the black. 


	The original Avatar did a crazy 10x multiple off its $77M U.S./Canada opening for a final of $785.2M. The combined franchise total from Avatar over two movies is $5.26 billion. Cameron owns the first (Avatar at $2.92 billion), third (Avatar: Way of Water) and fourth (Titanic at $2.26 billion) highest grossing movies of all-time at the global box office; a feat no other filmmaker can boast in the top ten movies of all-time. 


	The current 2025 domestic box office for the period of Jan. 1-through Sunday, Nov. 23 stands at $7.48 billion, +3% over the same frame in 2024. The Thanksgiving harvest of Zootopia 2 and Wicked: For Good will only propel business higher.

Tara Reid has filed a police report in Illinois after claiming her drink was drugged at a hotel bar outside of Chicago last weekend. The actress said she is “willing to prosecute” anyone involved in the alleged incident, which the Rosemont Police Department is investigating, Rolling Stone can confirm. 


	The police report offers Reid's most detailed account yet of what happened last Saturday, Nov. 22, before she wound up briefly hospitalized. Reid was in the Chicago area for a celebrity signing event, and the night before, she got a drink at the hotel bar. Reid said the lobby was full of people who were “supposedly YouTubers,” who “had their phones out and the whole thing felt suspicious, but I didn't know what was going on.” 


	After ordering a glass of wine at the bar, Reid said someone came up to her and introduced himself as a “very successful influencer and YouTuber,” who was with the group in the lobby. He sat next to her, they spoke, and when Reid said she was going to step out for a cigarette, the influencer said he would go with her.

	











	“We went out for a smoke, exchanged numbers, and came back, and there was a napkin over my drink,” Reid said, per the police report. “Then the last thing I remember was drinking that drink and seeing a couple sitting next to us. The next thing I remember was waking up in the hospital around 8 hours or more later not knowing where I was or anything that happened. I completely blacked out with no recollection of anything.”

	Reid said her agent “somehow found what hospital” she'd been taken to and went to pick her up. She claimed the hospital told her she was “free to go” and did not give her “any release forms or discharge papers.” Reid's agent took her back to the hotel, where she got her bag and checked out.


	Reid claimed that the influencer she sat next to later texted her videos of her at the hotel after the alleged drugging (ostensibly referring to the footage obtained by TMZ that showed Reid slurring her words and sliding off a wheelchair, before a medical team took her out on a stretcher). Reid said she thought the influencer “was trying to extort, saying he could stop the videos going out.”

	The police report ended with her saying, the influencer “also told me I called security on him and he also confirmed that I only had one drink.” 


	Despite being hospitalized, Reid still attended the autograph event on Sunday, Nov. 23, where she posed with fans who'd bought tickets to meet her. An event organizer told Rolling Stone, “Even though she was late, she did come,” Adelstein says. “I did not hear one bad thing at all. She obviously was very polite and happy to everybody.”

It turned out to be a historic night for the Irwins! Fan-favorite Robert Irwin has officially won “Dancing with the Stars.” 

His sister Bindi Irwin marked the milestone with a loving message and a celebratory photo. “TWO MIRRORBALLS NOW CALL AUSTRALIA ZOO HOME!!!! Congratulations and all the love in the world to @robertirwinphotography and @witneycarson. What. A. Night,” she wrote.

The win arrives ten years after Bindi earned her own historic Mirrorball trophy during season 21 with Derek Hough. 

Now, Robert has added a second shining prize to the family's legacy. 

The siblings each made “DWTS” history in their own way, drawing global love as they honored their late father, Steve Irwin, through their performances.

Robert's victory capped a heated three-round, three-hour live finale in Los Angeles on Tuesday evening. The 21-year-old overcame a painful rib injury to defeat fellow finalists Jordan Chiles, Alix Earle, Dylan Efron, and Elaine Hendrix. 

His emotional season, which began with a visit to his father's star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in August, made him a fan favorite from the start.

The unexpected elimination of frontrunner Whitney Leavitt the week before pushed the momentum even further in Robert's direction. By the final night, his win felt inevitable.

Robert delivered some of his best dances of the season during the finale. His judges' choice quickstep to “Are You Gonna Be My Girl” by Jet showed clean footwork and a strong frame. His freestyle, performed to Avicii's “The Nights” and Sam Sparro's “Black & Gold,” leaned into full-throttle choreography and explosive lifts. 

He also excelled in the “instant dance challenge,” where he and partner Witney Carson received their style and song only minutes before performing.

Despite entering the show with no dance background, Robert leaned into his natural charisma and physicality. He embraced the lighthearted moments, including ripping his shirt mid-salsa, while still honoring his family values and his father's legacy.

After taking the Mirrorball trophy, Robert said he is heading into an even busier chapter of life. “I go to New York and then straight to South Africa to film another show over there,” he told E! News. “And then, I'm back home.”

Witney chimed in that she will be with him soon. “Witney's coming down to Australia,” Robert said, as the dancer joked, “You're not getting rid of me that easy.”

Robert reflected on the meaning of the season. “I've been able to write my own legacy with Witney as we tell stories of positivity, vulnerability, passion and fun.” He also shared that this journey has been years in the making. 

A recently resurfaced 2015 video showed young Robert backstage during Bindi's winning season, saying he hoped to compete on the show someday.

That dream just came true—along with a family celebration that now includes two Mirrorball trophies at Australia Zoo.

							By 

	Ryan Gajewski


Senior Entertainment Reporter


The Dutchman is ready to arrive in theaters.


	Rogue Pictures and Inaugural Entertainment are set to release director Andre Gaines' psychological thriller in theaters nationwide Jan. 2, 2026, The Hollywood Reporter has exclusively learned. André Holland, Zazie Beetz and Kate Mara star in the modern feature adaptation of the 1964 Obie Award-winning play of the same name.




The Dutchman centers on Clay (Holland), a successful but troubled businessman who attends therapy sessions with wife Kaya (Beetz) but soon learns that the therapist follows unconventional methods. Clay also deals with the potentially life-altering impact of a chance encounter with seductive Lula (Mara), whom he meets on a New York City subway ride.

	Gaines helmed the movie from a script he co-wrote with Qasim Basir that is based on Amiri Baraka's play Dutchman. Gaines produces the project alongside Jonathan T. Baker. Stephen McKinley Henderson, Aldis Hodge, Lauren E. Banks and Lenny Platt round out the cast for the film that premiered earlier this year at SXSW.


	“The Dutchman is a bold, electrifying adaptation that captures the raw power of Amiri Baraka's play with unflinching style and urgency — exactly the kind of provocative, conversation-starting cinema that audiences are starving for right now,” says Inaugural Entertainment founder Kevin Weisberg. “For Inaugural Entertainment it is the exact type of film we can't wait to put in theater.” 

	











	Adds Gaines, “Rogue and Inaugural are the perfect partners to bring The Dutchman to audiences across the country. Marc [Danon], Mike [Arrieta], Kevin and Ryan [Adams] have been champions of this film since day one, which means the world to me. Bringing The Dutchman to theaters nationwide is not just a dream come true — it's an opportunity for audiences to engage with a story that demands to be felt, enjoyed and discussed.” 


	In her review of The Dutchman for The Hollywood Reporter, critic Lovia Gyarkye wrote that Gaines “intensifies the dramatic work's surrealist undertones and takes the central couple's story above ground.” Gyarkye added that moving the narrative beyond the play's train car gives the film “greater contemporary resonance.”

Kaia Gerber's all bundled up in blue.

The 24-year-old model stepped out in Beverly Hills on Tuesday evening in a bold blueberry-hued faux fur statement coat worn over a micro-minidress. She accessorized with slingback pumps and shoulder-grazing silver hoop earrings.

The full look is from Mango's new party collection, on which Gerber collaborated as a brand ambassador. 

Her coat is currently on sale for $280, while the LBD — a high-neck knit mini with cut-out sides — retails for $100. 

Her shoes have a metal toe cap and stiletto heel, and are currently sold out online. The after-dark-inspired line launched in October and features embellished pieces in black and silver along with suiting and going-out tops.

Gerber joined Mango earlier this year, following in the footsteps of her lookalike mother's fellow supermodel peers. Cindy Crawford's former '90s runway rivals Claudia Schiffer, Naomi Campbell and Kate Moss have all served as ambassadors for the Barcelona-based label.

About her party style references, Gerber told Vogue she's “been a chronic Pinterest girl since [her] pre-teens” and usually looks to Audrey Hepburn or Jane Birkin — or else Moss in the early '90s. “If you don't know what to wear to a party, she always does chic, simple, and sexy really well,” she said.

In a separate interview with the publication earlier this year, she said she looks at old photos of her supermodel mom for beauty inspiration.

“The nice thing about like looking quite similar to a parent is if I want to know if a hair or makeup look will look good on me, I will look up pictures of my mom — because if it looks good on her, most of the time, I can pull it off as well,” 

The “Bottoms” actress has been enjoying plenty of mother-daughter moments lately. Earlier this month, Gerber and Crawford, 59, twinned in custom Gucci gowns at the 2025 LACMA Art+Film Gala.

Crawford wore an embellished off-the-shoulder gold gown while Gerber dazzled in a red sequined number.

When Penélope Cruz walked onstage at the Academy Awards last March, she uttered three words that marked a turning point for Brazilian cinema: “I'm Still Here.” Presenting the award for Best International Feature, Cruz announced the film directed by Walter Salles and starring Fernanda Torres as the winner. Across Brazil, people celebrated in bars and public squares that warm Carnival Sunday night as if the country had just won the World Cup. In a way, it had: It was the first time Brazil had ever brought an Oscar home.

Only weeks later, “The Secret Agent”, directed by Kleber Mendonça Filho, took home Best Director and Best Actor (for Wagner Moura) at the Cannes Film Festival. Distributed in the U.S. by Neon, the film is now expected to follow the footsteps of “I'm Still Here”; currently, Petra Costa's documentary “Apocalypse in the Tropics” is also positioned for an Oscar nomination. By early 2025, a sense of rebirth permeated the industry. With three major international victories in a row — the Oscars, Cannes, and Berlin, where Gabriel Mascaro's “The Blue Trail” won the Grand Jury Prize — Brazilian cinema seemed to have rediscovered a long-awaited sense of stability.

Yet as the year draws to a close, those red carpets and golden trophies haven't translated into greenlights for those working behind the cameras. The very system that made this resurgence possible is now stalling — and must be jump-started to deliver on the promise of a strong, steady industry symbolized by Salles' Oscar win.

 










Oscar-nominated “I'm Still Here” producer Rodrigo Teixeira summed up the moment with both excitement and caution. “Brazilian cinema is enjoying an incredible level of visibility — maybe the best in decades — but that doesn't mean the system works,” he said. “We need to make films consistently, not just when the political winds blow our way.” Teixeira, who works across Brazil, Europe, and the United States, has a rare vantage point, knowing the inner workings of three production ecosystems. In his view, Brazil “has the talent and the ideas — but not the predictability.”

The numbers underscore the paradox. A study by the MPA (Motion Picture Association) and Oxford Economics found that Brazil's audiovisual industry now generates about R$ 70 billion a year (roughly $1.3 billion U.S.D.) and supported 608,970 jobs in 2024 — more than the country's automotive sector. Yet Brazil still lacks an industrial policy that treats cinema as a strategic sector rather than an artistic exception. This absence of consistent structure resurfaces with every political cycle, subjecting the industry to a roller coaster of incentives and setbacks.

Today's wave of success stems from a framework of public policy decades in the making. Since the creation of the Audiovisual Law in 1993 and the Sectorial Audiovisual Fund (FSA) in 2006, Brazil has built a system that combines tax incentives, public grants, and direct investment. In theory, it's a mechanism capable of sustaining a robust industry. In practice, the machine has jammed.

 










Ana Paula Sousa, a journalist and film professor at ESPM-SP, noted that Brazil's model is unique in its scope. “No other Latin American country has such a comprehensive system, from screenwriting to distribution. The problem is that it's become too slow,” she said. Each step — project evaluation, funding approval, auditing — has piled up in endless bureaucratic queues, delaying production by years.

Sousa, author of the book “The Cinema You Don't See: The Political War Behind Brazilian Film Production in the 21st Century,” said part of the paralysis stems from staff shortages and overlapping duties at Ancine, Brazil's national film agency. “Many of the agency's most experienced professionals left during years of institutional dismantling, and the new teams are still finding their footing,” she explains. “It's a system that depends on people, not just on rules — and when people leave, the engine stops.”

The FSA, the country's main source of public film funding, currently has more than 800 approved projects awaiting disbursement. Some of the money is frozen due to budgetary or legal impasses. Meanwhile, producers are racking up costs and missing deadlines for international co-productions. “A European investor doesn't understand what it means to wait two years for a funding decision,” Teixeira said. “That kills a project before it begins.”

 










The contrast between the pace of artistic creation and the speed of government bureaucracy has become emblematic of what Brazil must overcome. In October, the Ministry of Culture announced R$ 100 million in new audiovisual investments for the state of São Paulo — a welcome gesture, but one that doesn't change the structural reality. It's a short-term relief for a system in need of deep reform.

Behind the award-season euphoria lies a stubborn math problem. A study presented at the Rio2C conference in April revealed that streaming platforms in Brazil earn more than R$ 75 billion annually, yet only a tiny fraction of that money returns to independent production. The long-debated VOD (video on demand) regulation bill aims to correct that imbalance.

The bill, approved by Brazil's lower house in October, requires foreign streaming companies to contribute a percentage of their revenue to national productions. But compromises between government and corporations have diluted the intended impact. Industry estimates suggest that out of R$ 75 billion in total revenue, roughly R$ 1.4 billion should flow into the FSA — but after exemptions and deductions, the real number won't exceed R$ 185 million a year. 

“That's nowhere near enough for a market this size,” said Mauro Garcia, executive director of BRAVI, which represents more than 600 independent producers.

 










Garcia said the problem isn't just the amount but the distribution model: “Platforms will be able to allocate some of those resources directly to projects of their choice. That weakens the fund's public role and reduces room for truly independent production.” 

In other words, a law designed to democratize the market could end up reinforcing its inequalities, a side effect already seen in other countries.

Regulatory uncertainty also scares off foreign investors. “No one wants to enter a market where the rules change every year,” Teixeira said. “Cinema depends on trust, not surprises.” That legal instability, combined with the slow pace of public funding, has created a paralyzing climate. Award-winning filmmakers return home to find a system incapable of supporting them.

For mid-size producers — those without access to international funds — each new public grant cycle brings renewed hope, followed by years of waiting. “It's a limbo,” said Garcia. “You have a project approved, but no idea when you'll actually be able to shoot. Meanwhile, you have to pay staff, rent, consultants. It's impossible to plan.”

Sousa identified unpredictability as the industry's biggest enemy. “Brazil doesn't just need more money; it needs a reliable calendar. If calls for projects came out every April, producers could plan ahead. Right now, they live off rumors.” Teixeira agreed, calling it “an annual lottery with no draw date.”

 










The situation worsens because many state and municipal funds depend on federal disbursements, creating a domino effect of delays. Small production companies often downsize or fold, shrinking the labor market. A 2023 survey by SICAV (Sindicato Interestadual da Indústria Audiovisual) found a 44% drop in production volume, a direct consequence of administrative bottlenecks and lack of predictability. Paradoxically, it remains one of Brazil's fastest-growing sectors in revenue, as noted by the MPA and Oxford Economics. The market generates wealth but not stability; it's large and labor-intensive yet still precarious.

While Congress debates VOD regulation and the restoration of the FSA, another challenge looms: rebuilding Brazil's film ecosystem after years of political dismantling and economic crisis. The country entered a recession between 2014 and 2016, ending the decade with stagnant GDP and high inflation that eroded purchasing power and drastically reduced cultural investment.

The COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and 2021 made things worse. According to studies by Ancine, BRAVI, and Tela Viva, film production fell by roughly 80%, with shoots halted, funding calls suspended, and dozens of independent producers shutting down. Reports by UniCEUB (Brasília University Center) based on Ancine data recorded a 35.3% drop in film releases from 2019 to 2020, while trade publications estimated that around half of production companies laid off staff at the height of the crisis.

 










The governments of Michel Temer (2016–18) and Jair Bolsonaro (2019–23), the far-right icon, accelerated the institutional collapse. Temer downgraded the Ministry of Culture to a sub-secretariat under the presidential office, stripping it of autonomy and budget. Bolsonaro went further: on his first day in office, he abolished the ministry altogether, dismantled cultural councils, and froze audiovisual funds. The result was near-total paralysis. Today's challenge is not merely to unfreeze money, but to rebuild a dismantled policy and redefine who has access to it.

Behind the scenes, the industry now faces a delicate debate between representation and efficiency. One source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said recent funding programs have prioritized identity-based criteria — race, gender, geography — without equally strong technical evaluation mechanisms. “The goal of promoting diversity is legitimate and necessary,” the source said, “but when political criteria outweigh technical ones, the system risks stalling again.”

The debate — present across the cultural sector but particularly intense in film — reveals a tension between inclusion and predictability. Brazil is striving to correct decades of invisibility for Black, Indigenous, and female filmmakers while trying to rebuild a bureaucracy that works.

 










Sousa argues that balance is crucial. “Affirmative policies are essential, but they need structure and training behind them. Otherwise, we build inclusion without support.” That gap is what institutions like Projeto Paradiso, a nonprofit dedicated to developing Brazilian talent and screenwriting, aim to fill.

“Our focus is on preparing professionals to engage with the global market,” said Josephine Bourgois, executive director of Projeto Paradiso. In just over five years, the initiative has supported more than 500 projects and scholarships, connecting young writers and producers with international programs. “It's not enough for Brazil to have great ideas,” she added. “Those ideas need to travel and be understood abroad.”

A recent Ancine study found that Brazil's audiovisual sector faces a shortage of skilled technical professionals — a bottleneck that limits production growth. In this context, the Paulo Gustavo Law, passed in 2022 and implemented in 2023, injected R$ 1.06 billion into the industry, distributing funds across all states and capitals. The measure played a crucial role in restarting shoots and rehiring crews — a welcome lifeline, though far from a structural fix.

Projeto Paradiso's work highlights that middle ground between public policy and market logic, a bridge in an otherwise fragmented ecosystem. “When there's a gap between funding cycles, professionals lose momentum,” Bourgois said. “Our role is to keep the flame alive between one round and the next.”

 










The metaphor neatly describes Brazil's current predicament: preventing its international momentum from fading while domestic gears still grind.

Institutional reconstruction also runs through Ancine, now trying to rebuild its staff and credibility. In November, the agency announced a new calendar of funding calls and a plan to simplify accountability processes — steps producers see as positive, though still insufficient.

“It takes more than political will,” said BRAVI's Garcia. “The machine is tired. Many public servants have left, and those who remain are overworked. What we need is regulatory intelligence and modern management.”

Brazilian cinema knows this cycle of collapse and revival all too well. In the 1990s, President Fernando Collor de Mello dismantled the state-run Embrafilme and shut down public film funding, triggering a devastating blackout. When Carla Camurati's Carlota Joaquina, Princess of Brazil grossed R$ 1.29 million in 1995, it became the unlikely symbol of a rebirth later dubbed the Retomada — the “film comeback.”

By the decade's end, Bruno Barreto's “Four Days in September,” Fábio Barreto's “O Quatrilho,” and Salles' “Central Station” were all Oscar nominees; Fernanda Montenegro, a national icon and Fernanda Torres' mother, earned a historic Best Actress nomination. In the early 2000s, Fernando Meirelles' “City of God” scored nominations for directing, screenplay, editing, and cinematography, cementing Brazil's global reputation. The “Retomada” was real — but full maturity still hasn't arrived.

 










Since 2023, Brazil's Ministry of Culture has been working to rebuild audiovisual policy. Initiatives once discontinued, like the Reunião com o Setor dialogue series, have resumed, and there are ongoing efforts to decentralize production beyond Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo. Yet progress is slow. Many pre-2020 projects remain on hold, and new funding lines are advancing at a crawl.

Teixeira sees this moment as a chance to redefine priorities. “Brazil needs to treat cinema as an industry, not as a government pet project. As long as we depend on the goodwill of whoever's in office, there won't be consistency.”

Despite the gridlock, signs of adaptation are emerging. The rise of FAST (free ad-supported streaming TV) channels — a trend discussed at this year's Rio2C — has opened new windows for Brazilian films and series on digital platforms. The model, which offers free content supported by advertising, could become a key outlet for independent productions sidelined by major streamers. Meanwhile, the international success of “I'm Still Here” and “The Secret Agent” has reignited global interest in Brazilian stories.

At the same time, Brazil faces the same global challenge as everyone else: bringing audiences back to theaters. According to Ancine and Comscore, the country saw a 19.6% increase in attendance and 24.9% growth in box-office revenue in 2024 compared with the previous year. Even so, admissions remain below pre-pandemic levels, reflecting a slow transition from streaming consumption back to the big screen.

 










For this moment to translate into lasting stability, the gears of creation, funding, and distribution will need to align. Brazilian cinema closes 2025 with rare global visibility — and a domestic market still under reconstruction. “There's no strong cinema without strong policy,” said Sousa. Brazilian film, she added, is as resilient as the Brazilian people themselves.

“The Secret Agent” opens in New York on November 26 and in Los Angeles on December 5.

	The final Culpables film, Culpa Nuestra, which are based on Mercedes Ron's novels, dropped on Prime Video on October 16.

	











	Wallace is also starring in The House of Spirits, a Spanish-language Prime Video series out of Chile based on Isabelle Allende that has Eva Longoria among its executive producers.

His “Favorite Girl.”

Justin Bieber and his wife, Hailey, put on a united front after the musician was accused of snubbing the model for her birthday.

In photos obtained by Page Six, the “Peaches” singer and the Rhode founder were spotted out and about in their white electric G Wagon in Los Angeles on Tuesday.

In the snaps, Justin, who was dressed in a pink hoodie, sat shotgun as his wife drove.

The pair appeared to be in the middle of a conversation as the pop star looked down at his phone.

The couple's outing came days after Hailey celebrated her 29th birthday over the weekend.

At the time, Justin had not publicly posted anything online about his wife's special day. However, the “Baby” crooner hasn't uploaded anything to his Instagram feed since Nov. 14.

While social media users initially believed Justin had skipped out on his wife's lavish birthday party, Hailey proved that her beau was in fact there.

On Monday, the billionaire beauty mogul shared a video of herself blowing out the candles on the “prettiest cake” as her loved ones looked on.

Justin, who was dressed in a pink tank top, could be seen in the background watching his wife with a smile on his face.

Hailey and the two-time Grammy winner have long battled split speculation since they secretly tied the knot in 2018.

Last year, the rumors ramped up last year after the August 2024 birth of their son, Jack.

Over the summer, an insider shared that Justin's newly released “Swag” album was reportedly to blame for the strain on his marriage.

“The intense focus and emotional toll of creating new music had put a strain on their marriage,” a source close to the couple told Us Weekly in August.

The insider explained that Justin gets “completely consumed and shuts everything else out” when he's creating new music in the studio.

EXCLUSIVE: Popeye The Slayer Man producer Jeff Miller is launching a slate of films within what he's calling the “twisted serial killer universe”.


	Movies will include Jeffrey Dollmer and Ted Bunny. The former will see models on a photo shoot stalked by a doll possessed by the spirit of serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer. Above is a first look.

David Letterman threw his support behind Seth Meyers after the Late Night host became the latest talk show target of President Donald Trump. 


	After Trump called on NBC to fire Meyers, Letterman appeared on “The Barbra Gaines Show” (Gaines was Letterman's longtime producer on The Late Show) and said, “I've never been more proud of Seth Meyers,”. An incredulous Letterman then recalled his reaction to Trump's demand, quipping, “I thought, ‘This is just delightful. How do you think that's going to go?'” 


	Letterman went on to note that Late Night used to be his “old show” before his move to CBS: “We used to do that show, and [Meyers] does a magical job. But just remember, Seth, things happen. You know what I'm saying?”


	While Trump has lashed out at Meyers before, earlier this month, the president called on NBC to fire him in a post on Truth Social. Trump accused Meyers of “suffering from an incurable case of Trump Derangement Syndrome,” and insisted the comedian had “no talent.” Trump's post was notably shared by his FCC chairman, Brendan Carr, whose previous threats against ABC helped lead to Jimmy Kimmel's temporary suspension in September.

	Trump's post about Meyers appears to have had little impact. Meyers brushed off the jabs on his show, joking, “I'm also aware that being attacked by the president this weekend doesn't make me special in any way, shape or form. I was simply on the same shit list as Christopher Wray, James Comey, Indiana Republicans, Thomas Massie, Rand Paul, Marjorie Taylor Greene, and former President Joe Biden.”

	











	He added, “I want to clarify that I take no issue with the president voicing his displeasure with my show. That is his right, and on a lot of nights, he's got a point.”

	As for Letterman, he's been a frequent critic of Trump (later on “The Barbra Gaines Show,” he called the administration a “wonder of idiocy” and referred to the president as “our dictator”), especially as the president has focused his ire on Letterman's late-night successors. During the Kimmel debacle, Letterman said, “You can't go around firing somebody because you're fearful or trying to suck up to an authoritarian criminal administration in the Oval Office. That's just not how this works.”


	And after CBS canceled his old show, The Late Show (now hosted by Stephen Colbert), Letterman slammed the network as “gutless” and “pure cowardice.” While CBS has insisted the decision to axe the show was financial, many have speculated it was done under pressure from the Trump admin due to a then-pending merger between CBS' parent company Paramount and Skydance.

After the artist's successful Breezy Bowl World Tour, Anthony "Ant" Wilson talks about a new album and that anticipated "Verzuz" match with Usher.


													By
												

	Gail Mitchell



	It was 20 years ago this week (Nov. 29) that 16-year-old Chris Brown vaulted onto the scene with his self-titled debut studio album and triple platinum-certified Hot 100 No. 1 “Run It!” And in celebrating that anniversary, Brown — under the guidance of manager Anthony “Ant” Wilson of Tycoon Music — has achieved various other career milestones during what's become an even more momentous year for the singer-songwriter.


	Brown kicked off 2025 with the best R&B album Grammy for his latest album 11:11 (Deluxe) — his second win in that category after 13 years. He's now closing out the year with two more nominations for the 2026 Grammy ceremony: best R&B song and best R&B performance for “It Depends” featuring Bryson Tiller, which peaked at No. 16 on the Hot 100. Prior to that in 2024, Brown picked up his first RIAA Diamond-certified single for “No Guidance” featuring Drake.


	Of witnessing Brown's second Grammy win, Wilson — a 2025 R&B/Hip-Hop Power Players honoree — told Billboard in August, “Winning isn't everything, but it feels good. And the consistent recognition of his artistry continues to solidify him as one of the biggest artists in the world.”


	Between those Grammy bookends, Brown embarked on what's since been logged by Billboard Boxscore as his highest-grossing live outing to date, the Breezy Bowl XX World Tour. Spanning 39 cities and 48 shows, his 20th anniversary and first-ever stadium run (June 8-Oct. 16) earned $300 million and drew 2 million fans across North America, Europe and the U.K. Accompanied by Tiller as a special guest through the run and Grammy-nominated artists Jhené Aiko and Summer Walker on select dates, Brown also welcomed pop-up performances along the way by Usher, 50 Cent, GloRilla, Tyga, Bow Wow, Sexyy Red and Davido during his three-hour, 56-song set.


	It's Brown's indefatigable energy and love of performing that Wilson first focused on strategically when he became the global star's manager 10 years ago after predecessors Tina Davis and Mike G.


	“We started off doing club and spot dates,” Wilson recalls. “Then we got the Heartbreak on a Full Moon tour [2018 with H.E.R., 6lac, and Rich the Kid]. I just wanted to get him back to the touring part of the business because I felt he could touch the most fans there. That was my initial goal.”


	Wilson also created the annual Tycoon Music Festival. Presented this year in association with Live Nation and 313 Presents, the festival marked its sixth anniversary on April 19 at Little Caesars Arena in Detroit. Headlined by Brown, the lineup also starred Skilla Baby, Fabolous, Gucci Mane and Wiz Khalifa with surprise appearances from Sexyy Red, G-Herbo, Payroll Giovanni and Tee Grizzley.


	Based in Las Vegas, as is Brown, Wilson recently spoke with Billboard about what's next on the drawing board for him and his superstar client.


What's it like managing such a tireless artist as Brown?


	We don't sleep too much over here [laughs]. That's because he stays up working in the studio he has in his house. He's in that studio every day until we put out an album. And then the hard part before that is figuring out what songs are going to make the album. Chris also has a billion ideas about different things. So another hard thing is trying to get those billion ideas down to at least 10.


Talk about the rapport between the two of you, which is an important part of the artist/manager collaboration.


	I met Chris when I was working with Bow Wow. that's when Tina was involved. She's a friend of mine as well. So I used to help out whenever she needed some assistance. Mike G was there too; we were all together then. But Chris is my brother first then it's business, I don't hope that he wins. He has to win because he's my family. So that's why there is no sleeping because I've got to make sure he does. I don't know if there's a blueprint on how to manage an artist. Every artist is different. But there is one key thing: understanding the artist and the fans of that artist.


Very few artists have made the successful transition from teen to adult star. Why has Brown been able to cross that bridge?


	A lot of artists can do one thing; they can either sing or they can dance. But not a lot of artists can perform the way that he does: he's singing, he's dancing, he's crying, he's laughing, he's flying, He's doing everything he can to please fans. He'll take less money just for the production to be what it is. He just wants [his performance] to stand out. Breezy XX was originally three and a half hours. I'm like, “Chris, come on. We're going to run into overtime on every show. Like I said before, that's the hardest thing … trying to get things down to where we're both happy [laughs].


A new album coming before this year is out has been rumored given the 20th anniversary. Any hints about the next project?


	There's always an album. The name of it always changes. The songs always change. Even with the last album, we were in the studio putting another song together on the day before it came out. So I can't say the name or a date for the album. I'll leave it open because he could wake up and say let's put it out next week. I'm ready though. I have it [the album] at the moment, but it changes every week.


What else is next? A concert movie à la Taylor Swift and Beyoncé or a return to acting?


	He loves and wants to act. There are acting classes, and he's gearing up for that. I also think the Super Bowl would be a great place for him. I believe it will happen.


Have there been any overtures on that front?


	We'll just see.


How has it been navigating the negativity that he still encounters as you work to move his career forward?


	It's nothing that I'm not used to at this point. We just smile and keep going. I just try to show improvement with work over the words, you know? I think that's the best way. But his kids ground him. He's a great, involved dad. I also think Chris' fans love him so much because they can relate. He's a real person who's gone through things that others have but he did it in front of the world. So I feel like that's his legacy: going through life with everyone else.


Now that Verzuz is back, is the long-rumored Usher/Chris Brown match-up a stronger possibility?


	It may. Usher and Swizz Beatz are friends of mine; Swizz recently spoke to me about it. I'm not saying no if it makes sense.


Beyond your ownership of the Tycoon Festival, what other projects are you shepherding?


	I also work with 50 Cent in a company called the Green Light Gang. We have 40 TV shows [in the works] at the moment and a few movies. We're also going to build a production company in Shreveport, Louisiana. So that's my new baby, television.

When Terri Irwin penned a heartfelt Instagram post following Robert Irwin's victory on Dancing with the Stars, the moment took on extra meaning. Her words captured more than pride — they conveyed a mother's joy, a family's legacy, and the powerful emotional resonance behind Robert earning the Mirrorball Trophy alongside his partner Witney Carson. With Robert and Witney's win, Terri's post became a celebration not just of dance, but of heritage, perseverance, and deep-rooted love. As confetti fell and music faded, Robert's win felt like a shared family triumph.

Terri captioned “Congratulations Robert! Your passion, dedication, hard work, and kind heart got you to this point. A night you will remember forever. Thank you to everyone who supported Robert through this journey, and made us realise that even a zookeeper can learn to dance. Witney – you are now part of our family. God bless. I am so very proud of you, Robert. I know your dad is too. Wow!”

Days before the finale, Terri gave fans a preview of what was at stake: heart. In a post she shared via Instagram Reel, she reflected on Robert's childhood, describing him as “the boy full of wonder and adventure,” and called him “your father's son.” She wrote that when Robert danced “for the final time tomorrow,” she would be “holding a lifetime of love in my heart.” 

The actual night delivered — not in fireworks, but in raw emotion. Robert's dances with Witney, especially during “Dedication Night,” became more than steps and music. They turned into a tribute to his mom's resilience, and a public acknowledgment of love, loss (for his late father, Steve Irwin), and the family threads that carry on. 

In the lead-up to the finale, Witney revealed that rehearsals had been brutal — physically and emotionally. She admitted, “My body is feeling it right now, Robert's body is feeling it right now,” and that the pair felt like they were “kind of falling apart” from exhaustion. Nonetheless, Terri's post served as a grounding anchor — a reminder of love and family beyond the spotlight. Her pride, love, and faith in Robert transformed what could have been just another win into something deeply human.

Robert Irwin's Season 34 victory closed a circle for the family. He and Witney Carson were crowned champions after a tight finale, earning the coveted Mirrorball trophy. Terri's post reflected how much more the win meant when viewed against the Irwin family's history — not just in wildlife conservation, but in dance.

This triumph echoes the earlier success of his older sister, Bindi Irwin, who won Season 21 of the same competition years ago. In her own career, Bindi turned the Mirrorball into a symbol of joy, resilience, and emotional openness — and now Robert carries that torch forward. Terri's emotional caption didn't just celebrate the present win — it honored a legacy of family strength, love, and shared achievement.

Robert Irwin's Mirrorball win and Terri Irwin's emotional post mark a milestone that's about more than dance. It's about identity, legacy, healing — and family's ability to hold you up when you soar. For viewers, it's a powerful reminder that behind contestants and choreography are stories, roots, and real people carrying hope, grief, joy.

For Terri, this moment offered public acknowledgment of her love and sacrifices — a validation that a family built on wilderness and compassion can gracefully step into the glitter of the ballroom. For Robert, it wasn't just about winning; it was about honoring the past while dancing toward the future.

Warner Music Group, one of the major labels that sued AI song generator Suno last year for copyright infringement, has signed a licensing deal with the company. The new partnership, which settles their prior litigation, is designed to help Suno move toward a licensed model where users will pay to download songs made on its platform with artificial intelligence. According to the announcement, artists and songwriters will be compensated if they choose to opt in to AI deals, and will retain “full control” over how their music, likeness, and other copyrights are used. Suno has also acquired the concert listings Songkick, formerly owned by Warner, as part of the deal.

In a bid to hold back the AI music flooding streaming services, the current, more liberal Suno models will be phased out, according to the press release. Notably, the press release imagines a future where Suno launches “new, more advanced and licensed models,” but not fully licensed models, which would require mass industry cooperation.

Litigation by Universal Music Group (UMG) and Sony Music Entertainment, the companies that filed the lawsuit against Suno alongside Warner, is ongoing. That suit accused Suno and a similar company, Udio, of training AI on major-label artists like Drake, Bruce Springsteen, and Green Day, saturating the market “with machine-generated content that will directly compete with, cheapen, and ultimately drown out” the originals. In October, UMG settled its part of the lawsuit against Udio in a deal that limited the scope of the platform. Last week, Klay became the first AI music startup to land licensing deals with all three major labels and their publishing arms.

Welcome to IndieWire's “Eyes Wide Shut” Week. The password is, of course, “fidelio,” but we've already taken care of admittance, inviting you into five days of stories celebrating Stanley Kubrick's swan-song masterpiece from 1999. Criterion Collection has just unveiled its 4K restoration of the classic erotic odyssey starring Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman, and it now looks better than ever, gloriously, at home.

Though “Eyes Wide Shut” is very much one of IndieWire's favorite Christmas movies, we'll be unveiling over the Thanksgiving week conversations with director of photography Larry Smith, second unit cinematographer Malik Hassan Sayeed, editor Nigel Galt, set decorator Lisa Leone, and star and Kubrick mentee Todd Field, aka Nick Nightingale, blindfolded piano player to the sex-crazed elite. “Give up your inquiries, which are completely useless.”

There are few, if any, people more qualified to comment on “Eyes Wide Shut” than Nigel Galt — the man who spent 15 months in a post-production room with Stanley Kubrick before the director's death.

 










The film editor — who is going on record for nearly the first time, circa the new Criterion Collection 4K release of Kubrick's final film — has rarely spoken about his experiences with the director. Kubrick died on March 7, days after he screened his working cut of the 1999 erotic mystery to Warner Bros. brass and the film's stars, Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman. By that time, Galt had been close with the Oscar-nominated filmmaker for nearly a decade and was one of his most trusted longtime collaborators. After first working for Kubrick as a sound editor on 1987's “Full Metal Jacket,” he had risen up through the ranks, eventually having a hand in the international re-releases of almost all of the auteur's films. And he was creatively involved on “Eyes Wide Shut” even before shootin, as Kubrick liked his opinion on sound, image, and even music.

Galt was also the person most intimately involved in what happened to the movie between Kubrick's death and its July 1999 theatrical release. He not only oversaw the last-minute fixes, like adding final establishing shots, but also was tasked with navigating censorship of the orgy scene — you know, the one where Cruise's Dr. Bill Harford rides out in a taxi to an ominous mansion that plays hosts to a Boschian bacchanalia of masked, depraved sex.  

 










Despite demands and moral panic from the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA, now known as the MPA), Galt refused to make cuts to the film in order to secure an R rating — resolute that Kubrick never would've permitted them. But it was Galt's idea, as he explained to IndieWire, to insert digital figures into the masquerade sequence to block certain instances of penetration and satisfy the censors.

That censored sequence is now widely unavailable to the public, despite ending up in the version that was first released in theaters, when “Eyes Wide Shut” was rated R for “strong sexual content, nudity, language, and some drug-related material.” The new unrated Criterion release, supervised by director of photography Larry Smith, includes no such digital “hooded figures,” as Galt said, finally restoring the film to what Kubrick envisioned in the literal hours before his death. 

This interview has been edited for length.

IndieWire: You spent 15 months with Kubrick in the edit bay after production finished on “Eyes Wide Shut,” but when did you come on the movie proper?

Nigel Galt: I was on [“Eyes Wide Shut”] before shooting. 

I was very fortunate: At the end of “Full Metal Jacket,” we got on very well, Stanley and I. I was a “deemed competent,” [which was] I think, the best compliment I got. He wasn't very generous with compliments but] he did say to me that he'd like to work with me again. I had to wait nine years, or eight years, but he was loyal to his word and phoned me up. I ended up being his go-to man to fix things on the old films. We would fix old foreign versions where optical [negatives] had gotten damaged or there were issues. I got involved in getting a new master of “2001” six-track, supervised it for him, and worked on “Clockwork Orange.” I've actually worked on every film he did in some form or another, so I knew I was going to do [“Eyes Wide Shut”], and I was on it a month before we started shooting.

 










We edited for 15 months. By the time the film finished, I'd been on it over three years. During shooting, I was looking after rushes, the dailies. I was on set most days, being around if he needed me, just doing anything editorial. But we did no editing during shooting. Stanley never cut during shooting.

Walk me through what happened from Kubrick screening the movie for Warners up until his death. 

The film was screened to Terry Semel and Bob Daly at Warner Bros., and Tom and Nicole, on the same night in New York. I flew to New York. In the preceding days, we did the temp mix for the screening. We screened it on Wednesday twice. I flew home. I had Thursday off. I saw him on Friday, and we talked about the response to the film and the screening, which was very positive from everybody. And he died the next night, on Saturday. 

In that last conversation, we just talked about the things that needed to be done, which were a few establishing shots we needed to put in. We had, at that point, just found the Ligeti piano piece, so that was a huge thing, because it's so important in the film. It's actually … a Ligeti piano exercise. When he found that piece of music, he was so excited. When we first put it up against the picture, it worked straight away. Just bizarre.

 










How does the Criterion release, which I know you haven't seen in full yet, compare to past home video versions and the prints that were in theaters in 1999?

Stanley wasn't around to grade the film, so it was reliant on the experience of his contacts with the laboratory, people who'd worked with him at Deluxe on everything, going back to “Barry Lyndon” and “Clockwork Orange.” When it came to the DVD, it was a different matter, because it was effectively a new domain for a medium. The issues with the DVD were more related to the fact that the film was force-developed, all of it, through shooting. So it's effectively underexposing it and then correcting it in the development. The [new Criterion edition] has a lot of profound effects in how things look because it brings out the grain more, and this created a lot of issues in the making of the original DVD.

The DVDs are coming from the original negs. The only difference with this new Criterion one is, I believe, Warners made a new 8K scan from the original neg. That is going to mean that what Larry just did in the regrade will have obvious benefits. Larry graded it on [the Criterion release] the way it should have been graded, which wasn't done before.

After Warner Bros. saw the film, there were still changes to be made, and most significantly in demands to censor the orgy masquerade.
 










The problem with Stanley dying is there was no plan B. Stanley and I had a conversation the night before he died, agreeing on everything that needed to be done to the picture, which was very little, because the only thing that was missing were some establishing shots that, when we were making the screening for New York, we just didn't have time to put them all in. But we knew what they were, so all I had to do was add in exterior shots of buildings, like Ziegler's [house], and that was it. Any idea of re-editing the film was never on the cards, because this is a Stanley Kubrick film. Who has the right to change it?

The only issues that occurred were with the MPAA when we were trying to get the rating. We went off down a path I didn't agree with because they got obsessed about the nudity. They were so mundane and ridiculous about it. They had me make changes, and I had to do them because I was told to. But in the end, I went back to Warner Bros. and, with Jan Harlan in the office, said, “I'm putting the film back exactly as it was, and we have to find another way to release the film if the MPAA won't sanction it.”

What was your reaction to being asked to censor the movie to secure an R rating?

You've probably seen the version that doesn't have the hooded figures in it. You know when he walks through the orgy? He comes around the corner, and there's a guy taking a girl from behind; she's leaning over a chair. Do you know what the MPAA said? “You can't have that. He's fucking her up the ass.” I said, “He's taking her from behind!” [Laughs] This is the kind of ludicrousness.

 










We had five screenings with the MPAA, and every time they kept trying to get us to take more out. And then it became clear that this was not going to happen. Who are they to tell the world what they see in a Stanley Kubrick movie? The premise was, as far as Warners was concerned, they only wanted one release of the film.

So whose idea was it to insert these digital figures that block the onscreen sex?

Who was the one who came up with the idea? Moi. I'm trying to think, “How can we put the film out without changing a single frame of the cut?” 

I suppose in hindsight it was the right thing to do because, in the end, that American hooded version, [with the] cloaked figures, has disappeared. It never gets seen anymore. The worldwide version is the Stanley version. Especially when you take into context the Japanese [audience]… I took the film to Japan for the censorship screening, and the Japanese had a very strong thing about pubic hair. They waived it all because Kubrick to them is Kurosawa, and they don't interfere in that kind of thing.

What would Kubrick's reaction have been if he were alive at the time?

As a hypothetical argument, knowing Stanley, he would have said to Warners, “Well, I'll either have to reshoot, or they have to accept it.” But he wouldn't have made cuts, because Stanley had final cut. Stanley generated this career where he bought himself total independence, total freedom from budgets, and total amount of time to make the film. This was one of the most remarkable things about working with him. The best thing about working with him was you knew he was in charge.

 










What was it like working on “Eyes Wide Shut” with such a small crew?

We had a crew of just 55 people. As much as me being an editor … I could become a driver. That's how it worked. There were no delusions of grandeur if you worked with Stanley. You did what you were told.

How complicated was that orgy scene to film, and were you on the set for any of it?

It went on forever, shooting at Elveden [Hall] and the other place they went to [the sequence shot in at least three locations in the U.K.]. I never went on the set during it. He wouldn't let me on the set with too many pretty women. [Laughs]

They were all-night shoots. I was at the lab at 6 a.m. every morning picking up the rushes. It was quite intense from what I know [but] it wasn't any more stressful or harder than anything else. There was a lot of night shooting and late shooting on the film. Shooting on the set with Stanley was the same whether you went on the set day or night. It was not Jim Cameron-style or anything like that — no shouting or screaming. He might have shouted at the technicians or the construction guys or the riggers, but never in front of the cast.

Well, he may not be screaming at people, but he did drive Shelley Duvall to a nervous breakdown on “The Shining.”
 










Apart from when he [chews out] Shelley Duvall, which is pretty brutal, he was a much more thoughtful person. He could be prone to reacting to things, but that wasn't his real raison d'être when he worked. Everything was very methodical.

What do you make of conspiracy theories about the movie, whether it was designed as a critique of Scientology or, as Roger Avary once claimed, a movie about child trafficking? Or a critique, even of, Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman's marriage?

He wanted Tom and Nicole because he wanted their relationship onscreen to be real. That's why he wanted a married couple. It's as simplistic as that, and everything else with Stanley, as with all his movies, is the myths and legends that grow up around them. It was the most uneventful film I've been on — other than it took three years.

“Eyes Wide Shut” 4K is now available from Criterion Collection.

EXCLUSIVE: Netflix and Adolescence director Philip Barantini's indie are in talks to turn Jade Franks' buzzy Edinburgh play Eat the Rich (But Maybe Not Me Mates X) into a TV series.


	Inspired by Franks's life as a working-class student at Cambridge, the play was a huge hit at the Fringe Festival this past August, leading to a frenzy of interest from streamers and networks. Multiple sources say Netflix won a bidding war and is now beginning early stage development.


	Deadline can also reveal that Netflix has struck a development deal with Barantini's It's All Made Up Productions, which the in-demand Barantini runs with Boiling Point exec Samantha Beddoe. A Netflix spokeswoman told us the streamer is “picking up the rights to Eat the Rich in connection to our development deal with Its All Made Up Productions.”

	We understand Franks plans to adapt the play herself, similar to how Richard Gadd transferred his one-man play into Netflix hit Baby Reindeer. Franks and her agent at Independent Talent Group had been meeting with producers in the UK and U.S., we are told. The adaptation is in early development and is not guaranteed to make it to screen.

Eat the Rich (But Maybe Not Me Mates X) is inspired by Franks's life as a working-class student at Cambridge. It follows Jade, a first-year university student from Liverpool in the north of England who juggles secret cleaning shifts with the culture shock of Oxbridge privilege.


	The play, which comes from JFR Productions and director Tatenda Shamiso, has been praised for its exploration of the absurdities of class, money and belonging in the UK. It won The Scotsman's Fringe First Award, The Holden Street Theatres Award and The Filipa Bragança Award, and will soon begin a short run at the Soho Theatre in London.

	











	It's All Made Up, which is backed by Avalon, has a development deal with Netflix and is also making Hell Jumper for the streamer, a feature adaptation of the award-winning BBC documentary. 


	If Eat the Rich makes it to screen, it will follow in a line of Netflix shows adapted from plays that made a splash at Edinburgh.


Baby Reindeer was one of the streamer's most popular shows of 2024, having an outsized impact on the zeitgeist. Deadline then revealed that Netflix had scouted out Brian Watkins and Julia McDermott's Weather Girl, an apocalyptic one-woman play about a Californian weather girl in meltdown that staged sold out shows to rave reviews at Edinburgh. That show was recently confirmed with A24 and Robert Downey Jr's Team Downey. Eat the Rich will of course also draw comparisons to Phoebe Waller-Bridge's Fleabag, which ushered in the era of the buzzy one-person play and was adapted for TV by the BBC and Amazon.

Guy Fieri is wheelchair-bound after he “slipped down a set of steps” while filming “Flavortown Food Fight.”

The Food Network star explained to Fox News Digital on Monday that “one foot went forward and the other foot got caught on the threshold” during his fall — which tore his quad muscle “in half.”

When the 57-year-old was rushed to the hospital, the doctor told Fieri he hadn't seen a comparable injury in the “biggest, thickest” part of the leg throughout his 20 years on the job.

“You normally tear that muscle at your tendon or the tendon tears off the bone, but this was right in the center of the whole quad muscle and it exploded,” Fieri noted.

The chef was ushered straight into surgery to ensure his muscles didn't “recede.”

At the time, “everybody [was] in town” for the show and 125 people were on set and “ready to go.”

Fieri recalled, “We figured out how to pivot through it and to have some creative filming techniques. But it's been a run.”

Since the accident, the restaurateur has been getting around with the help of crutches and a wheelchair.

“I have to stay off it,” Fieri told the outlet. “I can't walk on it for eight weeks.”

At that point, the Emmy winner will get a cast and undergo rehabilitation — which he wants to start “as fast as possible.”

He did not specify when the injury occurred, but did confirm that “it sucked” and was a “damper.”

His eldest son, Hunter, is taking the reins this Thanksgiving and hilariously texted Fieri that it's his “time to shine.”

The “Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives” star said his youngest son, Ryder, and nephew Jules also “know how to cook.”

Fieri said, “It's gonna be me quarterbacking from the wheelchair and telling them what to do. And we cook for about 40 people up here. So it's going to be … an adventure.”

He shares Hunter, 29, and Ryder, 19, with wife Lori Fieri, whom he wed in 1995, and has vowed not to leave them any inheritance unless they “get two degrees.”

EXCLUSIVE: Warrior Nun and Continuum creator Simon Barry is in development on detective series Time Of Death, which is part of a slate of projects to emerge from a formalized scripted production deal between Canadian companies Omnifilm and Barry's Reality Distortion Field.


Time Of Death will follow a haunted detective who, after a decade spent chasing Britain's most elusive serial killer, relocates to Vancouver only to become convinced his old nemesis has resurfaced there. As he dives into new cases in an unfamiliar city, his relentless obsession threatens to pull him back into the darkness he thought he'd escaped.

	Across the shared slate, Reality Distortion Field (RDF) will provide creative oversight while Omnifilm will provide physical production, post-production, production administration and financing. The two companied have hired scripted consultant Alexandra Finlay to help steer the slate. London-based Finlay was most recently VP, Scripted International Co-Productions for A&E.


	Distribution for the individual projects on the slate will be handled by Canadian and international partners on a per-project basis. Omnifilm's previous credits include Disney movie Kim Possible, Netflix comedy series Fakes, which it teamed on with RDF, and upcoming TV projects Freaks Underground and Impossible Cities.


	“This partnership with Omnifilm allows us to combine creative and production forces in a way that expands what both companies can achieve,” said Reality Distortion Field Principal Simon Barry, who most recently developed Netflix series Bet and has multiple features in the works with producer Uri Singer. “Together, we can shepherd scripted projects from the first spark of an idea all the way through to delivery at the highest level of quality.”

	











	Added RDF Principal Stephen Hegyes: “By pairing RDF's creative development and deep relationships with top writing talent with Omnifilm's production infrastructure, we're setting the stage for a truly dynamic collaboration.”


	Omnifilm partner and CEO Brian Hamilton stated: “Building on almost a decade of close collaboration between our two companies, we see this agreement as a natural extension of our relationship that further leverages the strengths that we each bring to the table.”


	Alexandra Finlay commented: “Omnifilm and RDF's partnership strategically merges creative development and deep production expertise. At a time when partnerships are key to reaching global audiences, I'm excited to be collaborating with Simon, Stephen and Brian to drive the slate forward.” 


	RDF has also revealed the departure of its Head of Creative Affairs, Bhavika Mantri, who will be staying on as an executive producer for select projects. 


	“Bhavika's vision and creative instincts have been integral to RDF's success,” said Simon Barry. “Her ability to shape stories and support talent has elevated our slate, and we're thrilled she'll remain involved in a producing capacity.”

Xochitl Gomez gushed over Robert Irwin's “Dancing With the Stars” win amid dating rumors.

The actress, who won the Season 32 Len Goodman Mirrorball Trophy, recorded the moment Irwin and his pro partner, Witney Carson, were revealed as this year's champions.

“I am so incredibly proud of you two!” the “Raven's Home” alum, 19, captioned the video of Irwin, 21, and Carson, 32, emotionally hugging onstage.

“What a season!” she added, alongside a heart emoji.

While Gomez had previously shared the number fans could text to vote for Irwin, who suffered an injury shortly before the show, she did the same for fellow competitors Alix Earle and Jordan Chiles.

Notably, photos surfaced hours earlier of the former Disney Channel star having a private meetup with Irwin on the “DWTS” lot.

Gomez brought the Season 34 winner a bouquet ahead of his win, and the duo laughed and chatted.

According to TMZ, the “Baby-Sitter's Club” star also “spent some time backstage” with Irwin's family members.

Reps for Irwin and Gomez have yet to respond to Page Six's requests for comment.

The pair sparked dating speculation earlier this month when they danced together during the show's 20th anniversary celebration.

Irwin gushed about having the “best time” working with Gomez, calling their routine “so much fun.”

He went on to tell the New York Times, in an interview published Sunday, that dating in the public eye is “challenging to navigate.”

Over the weekend, the zookeeper explained, “Anything you do will be on TikTok the next day.”

Irwin's last public relationship was with Rorie Buckey from 2022 to 2024.

Carson wrote via Instagram in September that viewers have been “flooding” her with “applications” to date Irwin.

“We are currently dancing our lives away so we are unable to respond,” she quipped — before pitching her dance partner for the next “Bachelor” season.

The following month, Irwin joked to Page Six that he wanted admirers to “keep [the messages] coming, saying, “I'm on the lookout, and it'll happen when it happens.”

The Prime Video series adaptation also stars Jamie Lee Curtis and Bobby Cannavale.

Managing Editor, East Coast


Nicole Kidman has stepped into the iconic literary character of Dr. Kay Scarpetta for her next series, Scarpetta.


	In a first look from Prime Video at the forthcoming adaptation of Patricia Cornwell's best-selling novels (photos above and below), Kidman is seen starring in the forensic crime thriller that was developed and written for television by Liz Sarnoff (Barry, Lost). 




Scarpetta releases March 11, 2026. 


	The series will unfold across two timelines, the dual narrative tracking Kay Scarpetta from her beginnings as a chief medical examiner in the late '90s to her present-day return to her hometown, where she resumes her former position while investigating a grisly murder.

Jamie Lee Curtis, Bobby Cannavale, Simon Baker and Ariana DeBose round out the cast, along with Rosy McEwen, Amanda Righetti, Jake Cannavale and Hunter Parrish portraying younger versions of the characters.


	Here's the logline: “With skilled hands and an unnerving eye, unrelenting medical examiner Kay Scarpetta is determined to serve as the voice of the victims, unmask a serial killer and prove that her career-making case from 28 years prior isn't also her undoing. Set against the backdrop of modern forensic investigation, the series delves beyond the crime scene to explore the psychological complexities of both perpetrators and investigators, creating a multi-layered thriller that examines the toll of pursuing justice at all costs. As Scarpetta pursues justice, she must navigate complicated relationships, including the fraught dynamic with her sister Dorothy Farinelli (Curtis), confront long-held professional and personal grudges, and face secrets that threaten to unravel everything she's built.”

	











	Over 120 million copies have been sold worldwide since the character's debut in 1990. The series is produced by Amazon MGM Studios and Blumhouse Television in association with Blossom Films, Comet Pictures, and P&S Projects. 


Scarpetta is executive produced by Kidman and Per Saari through Blossom Films, Curtis through Comet Pictures, writer and showrunner Sarnoff through Sarnoff TV, author Cornwell through P & S Projects, as well as Jason Blum, Jeremy Gold, Chris Dickie and Chris McCumber through Blumhouse Television. David Gordon Green directed five episodes and is executive producer alongside Amy Sayres.

When Vince Gilligan first announced that he and Peter Gould were working on a Saul Goodman-focused Breaking Bad spin-off, they initially described their new project as a comedy. During the development process, that plan obviously changed. But it's not hard to see why Gilligan assumed he could go that route. Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul are both filled with dryly funny dialogue and cleverly constructed, clockwork-precise visual gags—which crank up carefully and then go pop, like a jack-in-the-box.

It'd be a stretch to describe Pluribus as an out-and-out comedy. But the more time Carol spends alone, the more Gilligan and his team (including this week's credited screenwriter Ariel Levine and director Gordon Smith) seem to be taking lessons from Looney Tunes. There are moments in this week's “Got Milk” that play like a Jacques Tati film—or like Tex Avery's old MGM “The House Of Tomorrow” cartoon—where modern technology goes haywire, making life more complicated for some overwhelmed dope.

The “modern technology,” in this case, is the Joined, who make a radical decision at the start of this episode. Unable to cope any longer with Carol's surly, chaotic energy, they abandon Albuquerque, en masse, leaving behind only a skeletal drone army to respond to any requests Carol might have. The robots prove to be a poor substitute. We can see with our own eyes over the course of this episode the huge difference between the way a hive-run facility operates—like an eerily efficient, organic machine—and the clunky awkwardness of the literal machines assigned to run the city in their absence.

The first sign that things won't go smoothly comes when Carol makes a call to the Joined around the same time we see them streaming out of Albuquerque in a convoy of cars and buses. The image of the vehicles rolling out, all in a row, is impressive…and kind of beautiful. The recorded message Carol gets on her phone is anything but. The voice on the line explains the situation, then thoughtfully adds, “Our feelings for you haven't changed, Carol; but after everything that's happened, we just need a little space.” For the rest of the episode, every time Carol calls, she has to sit through this entire answering machine recording with this same addendum. It runs on for so long. It gets funnier every time.

Carol's requests aren't handled all that well either. With the city emptied out and powered down, packs of wild dogs now roam freely through town, scavenging through the garbage. Carol calls to get the lights turned back on, then calls again to ask about trash pickup. When a drone comes flying in to haul her trash bags away, it struggles with the weight, before getting tangled on a lamppost. A lot of the framing in this episode makes Carol look small and alone, and this works to wonderful comic effect when she's standing—all tiny—on the far edge of the frame and watching her garbage spill onto the street on the other edge, thanks to a clumsy drone.

The trash drone is actually the second one to come to Carol's aid. Earlier in the episode, she records a video message for her fellow un-Joined, in which—after putting on a business-like jacket and making sure her booze bottles are out of the picture—she lays out what she's learned about “these afflicted people, these Others.” She also issues a warning, saying that if her peers are of the opinion that the collective is making the world better, they should relish that opinion, because, “It may be the last one you ever possess.” She insists that the Others translate her message for anyone who doesn't speak English and then send it to all concerned. “If you don't do it, I can't be held responsible for the biblically shitty mood in which I will no doubt find myself,” she says into the answering machine. Minutes later, the first sputtery drone arrives, to carry her message to the masses.

Or does it? Much as with last week's episode, the true cleverness of “Got Milk” comes not just from its wry gags but for how they fit together and push the plot forward. With no confirmation that anyone's listening or that anything she does matters, Carol begins relying on herself more, and the results are astonishing. I mean literally astonishing—as in Carol ends this episode with a look of astonishment on her face.

One of her “Carol taking care of Carol” moments is more character-building than plot-building. When the wild dogs return and begin digging up Helen's grave—seen in a terrifying, jittery hand-held shot—Carol uses her purloined police car's siren to scare them off. The next day she picks up some concrete slabs at the hardware store, to make sure Helen's final resting place will remain undisturbed. She even paints a little headstone for the plot, as the sun sets. It's lovely.

But earlier, when Carol suffers through her trash mishap, she makes a more significant discovery: The dumpsters in her neighborhood are filled with used milk cartons. We never see the Joined eat, but they do drink milk pretty regularly. Carol tracks their milk supply to a local dairy, where she finds a warehouse full of sugary grains in heaping, heavy sacks. She tests the final milk product, finding that it's odorless and non-acidic and has a weird amber color and a texture like olive oil.

Then, in another example of Pluribus playing the “think along with Carol” game, we see her track the sacks containing the milk powder to a local pet-food packager, Agri-Jet. Inside the Agri-Jet warehouse—where it's bitterly cold—she sees something that makes her gasp in horror. To be continued! 

We don't see what she sees, of course—just her reaction. But a crafty visual storyteller can do a lot with a good reaction shot, properly deployed and using just the right face. There's nothing like a good pop of surprise at the end of an hour of cranking.

Elton John has called time on full-scale touring. That hasn't changed, but he's still standing, he's done almost a dozen private shows this year, and he's cracking on with new music.

	The legendary British pop artist spoke with Variety for a dive into his philanthropy and fundraising efforts for HIV/AIDS, his love of Chappell Roan, his own health problems, and the road ahead.

	Creating music, well, he's not turning his back on it anytime soon.


	“But I tell you what,” he insists, “I'm singing better than I've ever done before, and I'm playing really well, and I'm enjoying it, and that is helping me a lot.”


	Elton's farewell tour wrapped up in 2023, Almost five years after launching, the Farewell Yellow Brick Road jaunt grossed $939.1 million and sold 6 million tickets according to figures reported to Billboard Boxscore. 


	These days, Elton still puts his hand up for the occasional one-off show, including his recent headlining spot in Singapore for the F1 Grand Prix, and for TV specials, including An Evening With Elton John and Brandi Carlile, produced by Fulwell Entertainment and shot in March at the London Palladium to promote their joint album Who Believes in Angels.


	Music has “been my whole life and has given me so much and takes me on journeys that I never thought I would ever go on — and it's still doing that,” John explains. “I just like doing the odd thing. It pays the rent very well, and it keeps me musical. I just can't wait to go into the studio now and write some new songs and go from there.”

	











	Elton is battling with vision problems, but he has a workaround — a teleprompter — and his friends from the music community are never far away, with offerings of encouragement, love and support.


	“Paul McCartney FaceTimes me to see how I'm doing. It's really beautiful,” he enthuses. “The love I've received from him and from Pete Townshend and Mick Jagger and people like that have been amazing. Or you get an email from Keith Richards saying, ‘Hello, darling, how you doing? You know we love you,' and that's it, but it just makes my day.”


	A followup to Who Believes in Angels, which went to No. 1 on the Official U.K. Albums Chart and cracked the top 10 on the Billboard 200, might not be far away.


	Elton has “seven new lyrics” from longtime collaborator Bernie Taupin. And “they're really, really good, so I can't wait to go in the studio with Andrew [Watt, his recent favorite producer] and just write and see what happens.”


	It was Elton who presented Taupin with the Musical Excellence Award at the 2023 Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony. John was inducted in the Rock Hall class of 1994.


Who Believes in Angels? debuted at No. 9 on the Billboard 200 chart dated April 19, marking the 22nd top 10 for John and fourth for Carlile. In his homeland, Angels gave Elton a landmark 10th U.K. chart leader,  and a first for Carlile.

The Hollywood Reporter is inside the ballroom for finale night, where couples performed three new numbers, including their coveted freestyle routines.


							By 

	McKinley Franklin



[This story contains major spoilers from episode 11 of Dancing With the Stars‘ season 34.]


Dancing With the Stars has crowned a 34th winner!




	Tuesday night's finale was a star-studded affair, as the full cast returned to cheer on the top five finalists: Alix Earle, Dylan Efron, Elaine Hendrix, Jordan Chiles and Robert Irwin. For the first time in the show's history, the remaining couples performed three separate new dances, including the judges' choice, instant dance challenge and freestyle rounds.

	Eliminated castmembers Secret Lives of Mormon Wives stars Jen Affleck and Whitney Leavitt, author-influencer (and wife to Alec Baldwin) Hilaria Baldwin, retired NBA star Baron Davis, actor-musician Corey Feldman, Boy Meets World star Danielle Fishel, Pentatonix's Scott Hoying, Fifth Harmony member Lauren Jauregui and comedian-actor Andy Richter all returned for the final episode of the season.

	











The Hollywood Reporter was inside the ballroom for finale night, where the five remaining duos were kept busy engaging in three rounds of competition. The first dance, which tasked the pairs to perform to a song chosen by one of the three judges, was great, but it was the instant dance challenge that felt the most electrifying.


	Yes: the couples actually learned which style and song they were dancing to mere minutes before they hit the stage. And while it was a daunting task, each of the celebrities performed exceptionally well, leading the night into the beloved freestyle round of competition. 

	











	All five couples received perfect scores for their freestyle numbers, and each of the routines was perfectly unique to each celebrity. Jordan's number featured quite the cameo as Fifth Harmony's Normani hit the stage with the Olympian as she performed to her track “Motivation,” putting a powerful cap on season 34 of DWTS.


	Though ultimately it was Robert Irwin and Witney Carson who took home the mirrorball trophy, leaving a long-lasting legacy on the competitive ballroom dance series that Robert's older sister, Bindi Irwin, started a decade ago when she also won the show. It was a moment that was years in the making, one that Carson previously told The Hollywood Reporter “would just mean everything to me.”

	To celebrate the success of season 34, THR spoke with DWTS showrunner Conrad Green and casting director Deena Katz, where they dished on the secrets behind the series' newfound virality. With a boost from social media and a savvy casting strategy, DWTS reached new heights this season and became a ratings dream for a veteran series. 


	Katz explained that “what has happened is the TikTok world has opened something up that I've never seen before, where we are so involved in the TikTok story every single week that there's a whole new audience that needed to start watching our show to keep up with what was going on in social media.” 


	And Green also dished on the real weight of viewers votes versus judges score (“It's 50/50, effectively”), which is how eliminations are ultimately decided on the show.

	











	“When you see the judges' leaderboards, say there's five couples and you're in first place on that leaderboard, you get five judges ranking points. If you're in second place, you get four, if you're in third place, you get three, [so on and so forth],” he explained. “We do the same with the amount of public votes. You add those two [separate] ranking points together, and the couple with the lowest combined total of those ranking points goes home. And if there's a tie on those ranking points, the couple with the fewest public votes goes home.” 


	The couple with the lowest combined total of judges' scores and viewer votes is eliminated at the end of each episode. Live voting takes place during the East Coast airing of each show and ends shortly after the final performance is completed.

Nearly a decade after an anonymous Fast & Furious star called Dwayne Johnson a “candy ass,” turning the e La Familia into a “two Christmases” household, Vin Diesel, who many believe to be the “candy ass” sayer, has offered some unexpected praise of his former Fast co-star. In an Instagram post about The Smashing Machine, Diesel takes a moment to “celebrate Dwayne.” Despite the two having a complicated working relationship, Diesel had nothing but praise for Johnson in the post, writing, “People don't understand what it takes to uphold a global perception every single day. I remember asking our global family who they'd love to see me work with, and a woman named Jan left a comment saying her dream was for me to collaborate with Dwayne.”

Jan's suggestion, according to Diesel, led to “one of the most dynamic pairings in cinema, two strong personalities who pushed each other and created something unforgettable.” Those two strong personalities were so combative, apparently, that they had to be separated, leading to a couple of weird shots in Fast 6 and Johnson's Fast spin-off, Hobbs & Shaw. But, Dielsel continues, “When he stepped into Hobbs, he did it with full commitment and left an indelible mark on Universal's character hall of fame.”

Diesel is old friends with Smashing Machine subject, Mark Kerr, “one of the first friends” he made in Los Angeles, and who trained Diesel for the first XXX movie. “This is a man who would often tell me about the kids he was teaching to wrestle, to fight, to take ownership of their lives usually for no money at all,” he writes. “Mark Kerr is so deserving of this moment… and Dwayne really did it… He brought us back in time and shined doing it.”

Is this the first step toward actually getting the final Fast & Furious movie made? Who knows. But for one glorious day in November, no one was a candy ass, and we all smelled what the Rock was cooking.

Russell Crowe, a longtime friend of the Irwin family, made a rare appearance during “Dancing with the Stars” finale week and shared what he believes Steve Irwin would think of Robert's emotional run on the show. In an interview with the New York Times published Sunday, November 23, Crowe said Steve would be “so impressed” by his son's performances. 

Robert, 21, went on to win the season 34 title on Tuesday, Nov. 25, after delivering some of his strongest dances of the competition.

“Although Steve could read the rhythms of the seasons and every living creature, he was absolutely not gifted with a sense of musical rhythm,” Crowe joked. “In his hands, a tambourine became a deadly weapon.”

He added that Steve would be moved by watching Robert perform on the ballroom floor. “I think he would watch Robert dancing and how he uses his body, the strength and poise, and he would be in awe of his son.”

Crowe's warm memories highlight the bond he shared with the late conservationist and the way he sees Steve reflected in Robert today.

Crowe repeated one of his favorite anecdotes from their friendship. “Although Steve could read the rhythms of the seasons and every living creature, he was absolutely not gifted with a sense of musical rhythm,” he said again. “In his hands, a tambourine became a deadly weapon.”

The actor said Steve's lack of rhythm only makes Robert's success on “DWTS” more striking. He believes Steve would be “in awe” of Robert's precision, strength, and musicality.

Robert has often said Crowe has played a significant role in helping him understand who his father was. At the 2025 AFI Fest premiere of Crowe's film “Nuremberg,” Robert attended with his mother, Terri Irwin, and spoke about the impact the actor has had on him.

“I've known him for as long as I've been alive,” he said. “I have some very early memories, actually. Some of the earliest memories of me with my dad were also with Russell, which is really special.”

Robert said Crowe gives him a view of Steve that he cannot get anywhere else. “I'm really grateful that I have someone in my life who … he's actually been there to, in a way, keep my dad alive in my life,” he continued. “He has so many stories to share of him and dad, and I feel like I build an even better picture of my dad when I'm around Russell.”

Robert added that Crowe offers a perspective he cannot get from his mother, Terri, or his sister, Bindi, who won season 21 of “DWTS” with Derek Hough in 2015. 

“Russell and dad were just great mates, so it's a different perspective than when you're hearing about your mom,” he explained. “It's meaningful. He's someone that I look up to and has truly inspired me.”

Steve Irwin became a global icon through his series “Crocodile Hunter.” He died on Sept. 4, 2006, after being attacked by a stingray while filming an underwater documentary.

Undeterred by the swift backlash to the Riyadh comedy festival, the adaptation of the young-adult romance Chasing Red is set to film in Saudi Arabia next year. Starring Riverdale‘s Madelaine Petsch and Summer I Turned Pretty‘s Gavin Casalegno, Chasing Red is the first part of the Red saga, a massively popular collection of young-adult books written by Isabelle Ronin on the platform Wattpad. The series follows Veronica (Petsch), a.k.a. “Red,” a straight-A college student with a troubled past, who has undeniable chemistry with the charming playboy, Caleb (Casalegno). It has since been published as a WEBTOON comic and a physically published book. For its next act, it'll be doing some light whitewashing of the Saudi government, which, in addition to allegedly dismembering journalist Jamal Khashoggi, recently hosted the likes of Dave Chappelle, Aziz Ansari, Bill Burr, and Louis C.K. for the Riyadh Comedy Festival.

Wattpad has become a significant generator of young-adult content for studios in the last decade. Netflix's The Kissing Booth was written initially for Wattpad, as were the four After movies, which have allegedly grossed more than $168 million. Unfortunately, we haven't been big fans of the After films. Reviewing for The A.V. Club, Caroline Siede wrote, “Though After We Fell aims for the scintillating eroticism of a lithe young couple risking getting caught with some semi-public hot tub sex, the whole experience is more akin to taking a lukewarm bath in a swimsuit.”

	After much wishful thinking, Radiohead performed “Like Spinning Plates” during their last show today at the O2 in London. The band closed out its four-show run in the city, surprising lucky fans to the Amnesiac track and giving the song its debut on Radiohead's reunion tour.


	“Like Spinning Plates” was built over the backing track of an early recording of “I Will” (which later appeared on 2003's Hail to the Thief), run in reverse. “We'd turned the tape around, and I was in another room, heard the vocal melody coming backwards, and thought, ‘That's miles better than the right way round,' then spent the rest of the night trying to learn the melody,” Thom Yorke told The Wire in a 2001 interview, per Citizen Insane.


	Fans have responded accordingly to today's performance, with one attendee on X declaring, “wtf do you mean i just heard like spinning plates live??????”

	Earlier this month, Radiohead performed both “Kid A” and “Talk Show Host” for the first time since 2018 at the Unipol Arena in Bologna, Italy. The band previously broke out Amnesiac songs tracks “You and Whose Army” and “Pyramid Song” during its current trek.

	











	After months of speculation, Radiohead announced their reunion back in September — their first live performances together since 2018. The European run kicked off with four nights in Madrid, followed by four evenings each in Bologna and London, with Copenhagen and Berlin in December.

	“Last year, we got together to rehearse, just for the hell of it,” drummer Philip Selway said in a statement at the time. “After a seven-year pause, it felt really good to play the songs again and reconnect with a musical identity that has become lodged deep inside all five of us. It also made us want to play some shows together, so we hope you can make it to one of the upcoming dates. For now, it will just be these ones but who knows where this will all lead.”

Robert Irwin and Xochitl Gomez did little to dispel dating rumors with a private pre-show powwow. 

Irwin, who is one of four finalists on Tuesday's season finale of “Dancing With the Stars,” was pictured privately hanging out with Gomez ahead of the big night. 

In photos obtained by TMZ, Gomez, 19, presented Irwin with a massive bouquet, gave him an affectionate side hug and laughed and chatted with him.

The actress wore a black strapless dress with a detached collar, while Irwin wore a sparkling black button down top and slacks.

A source told the outlet that Gomez also “spent some time backstage” with members of Irwin's family. 

Page Six has reached out to reps for Irwin and Gomez. 

The actress — who won Season 32 of the dance competition series with Val Chmerkovskiy — first sparked dating rumors with Irwin, 21, with a jaw-dropping dance routine during the show's 20th anniversary celebration earlier this month.

When TMZ later informed Irwin that “everyone” was “asking” if they were “an item,” Irwin instead directed attention to how much “fun” they had during the intimate performance.

“Oh my gosh, we had the best time,” Irwin told the outlet, adding, “That dance was so much fun.”

The high energy performance saw the nature conservationist and “DWTS” alum perform a high-energy jive to “Dance with Me Tonight” by Olly Murs.

Irwin also addressed his foxtrot tribute to his late father, Robert Irwin, along with his sister, Bindi Irwin, and pro partner, Witney Carson.

“It was so cool to do two, such distinct dances,” Robert told TMZ on Nov. 14.

“Like, one that was really slow and heartfelt. And then the dance with Xochitl which was just like energy and fun.” Robert gushed of Gomez. “She's the best, it's been really, really great.”

Robert's sighting with Gomez comes after it was revealed the Australian TV personality suffered a rib injury hours before the competition.

“Today at [camera] blocking is a little stressful because we just have to make the freestyle all come together. Robert's ribs have been killing him and more will be revealed on Tuesday and you guys can get a better idea of what we've been dealing with all week,” Carson explained via TikTok on Monday.

Carson also revealed that the dancing duo had to “change some things” in their routines, and it was “the most stressful part.”

Paramount, Comcast and Netflix submitted bids just five days ago as the formal process kicks in to higher gear on Dec. 1. 


							By 

	Erik Hayden


Executive Editor, Business


	It's time to up the ante. After the first round of offers for Warner Bros. Discovery arrived, the David Zaslav-run studio giant has set the next deadline for the sweetened bids from suitors. 


	That next wave of multibillion-dollar offers is expected by December 1, a source confirms. That's only 11 days removed from the initial offers that were submitted by November 20. While the David Ellison-owned Paramount has pursued a full takeover of the Warner Bros. Discovery assets, both the Brian Roberts-run Comcast and the Greg Peters and Ted Sarandos-led Netflix have submitted bids.

	The latter two suitors are expected to be more interested in the studios and streaming businesses, rather than the linear TV properties, whereas Paramount may aim to acquire the whole company. “Look, what I would also say, as it relates to M&A in terms of our mindset, I think it's important to know that there's no must-haves for us,” said Ellison on a Nov. 10 earnings call as he rounded out the first 100 days of his Paramount ownership.  Bloomberg earlier reported the deadline for the second round of offers.

	The next bid marks the latest turn in a process that accelerated beginning in June when Warners formally unveiled a plan to split its studio business (Warner Bros. Television, Warner Bros. Motion Picture Group, DC Studios, HBO and HBO Max) from its global networks unit (CNN, TNT Sports, Discovery and streamer Discovery+) that's been diminished as cord-cutting eroded the Pay TV landscape.

	











	After word of Ellison's overtures leaked, the company formally put up a “For Sale” sign on Oct. 21, saying it received “unsolicited bids” from “multiple parties,” although the conventional wisdom has suggested that the son of Oracle owner Larry Ellison (current net worth: $257 billion) has the inside track. The younger Ellison only months ago in August closed an $8 billion merger for his Skydance Media to effectively take over the owner of Paramount Pictures, CBS, MTV and Paramount+. Adding Warner Bros. to New Paramount's stable of assets would create a formidable studio empire that also would remove another major player from the mix of buyers for film and TV projects. Creatives have been circumspect as the prospect of a Warner Bros. sale has moved ahead.


	At the time it was formally put up for sale, Warners itself indicated that it'd like to see its separation of its assets move forward, believing that the two companies would provide more value for shareholders when they're eventually sold in pieces. Samuel A. Di Piazza, Jr., chair of the Warner Bros. Discovery board of directors, noted at the time, “We continue to believe that our planned separation to create two distinct, leading media companies will create compelling value. That said, we determined taking these actions to broaden our scope is in the best interest of shareholders.”


	As of Warners' Nov. 6 earnings, Zaslav had declared the sale an “active process” but didn't name suitors, as the WBD board will evaluate its options as the process moves ahead. He added, “When you look at our films like Superman, Weapons and One Battle After Another, the global reach of HBO Max and the diversity of our networks offerings, we've managed to bring the best, most treasured traditions of Warner Bros. forward into a new era of entertainment and new media landscape.”

Taylor Swift‘s “The Fate of Ophelia” has been given the club treatment, thanks to a remix by the Chainsmokers. 


	Today, Swift's official fan account, Taylor Nation, announced on Instagram that the “The Fate of Ophelia (The Chainsmokers Remix)” is now ready to download on iTunes and Amazon Music. Quoting the song's lyrics, the account quipped that the reimagined version is “wrapping around us like a chain, a crown, a vine.”


	The DJ duo celebrated the drop in the comments, writing, “This is truly and honor. we love u T.”


	The original “The Fate of Ophelia” is featured as the lead track off Swift's 12th studio album, The Life of a Showgirl, and has spent seven weeks on the Billboard Hot 100. The video for the Shakespeare-inspired song premiered last month in The Official Release Party of a Showgirl, Swift's film that screened in theaters from Oct. 3-5.


	The Swift-directed and written video begins with the pop star as the tragic heroine Ophelia from Hamlet in a painting on the wall of an ornate and lonely hotel, before it's revealed that it's a set. As Swift embodies a variety of showgirls from different eras, she's backed by dancers and the band from her Eras Tour. The glamorous spectacle ends back in a hotel room, where Swift stars as herself in a bathtub, echoing the album's cover art.

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	In Rolling Stone‘s review of The Life of a Showgirl praising the album, writer Maya Georgi observes that from “the first Fleetwood Mac-inspired drumroll and melancholy keys of ‘The Fate of Ophelia,' it's clear Swift has stepped into uncharted territory.”

	“The world might know how Shakespeare's Hamlet ends, and even how the latest chapter of Taylor's own love story goes, but the tantalizing melody shaped by a wondrous mix of steel guitar and Omnichord trills makes you want to keep listening to find out just how Swift changed her prophecy,” Georgi adds of the hit opening song.

It's Wilson's ninth top 10 on the chart -- putting her in a tie for third-most among solo women.

	Russ Penuell



Lainey Wilson logs her ninth top 10 on Billboard's Hot Country Songs chart dated Nov. 29, as “Somewhere Over Laredo” rises 11-9. The track pulls 4.1 million official United States streams (up 3%), 24.6 million in radio audience (up 8%) and 1,000 in sales (up 36%) during the Nov. 14-20 tracking week, per Luminate.

	











	Wilson co-wrote the Jay Joyce-produced track, which interpolates 1939's iconic “Over the Rainbow.”The Baskin, Louisiana, native is quickly growing her footprint among country's most successful women. Of the top 100 artists by count of top 10s on Hot Country Songs in the last 10 years, Wilson's nine tie her with Maren Morris for third among solo women behind Taylor Swift and Carrie Underwood, who have logged 17 and 10, respectively. Including ties for fifth (Jason Aldean and Luke Bryan's 15), eighth (Blake Shelton, Dan + Shay and Florida Georgia Line's 11), and ninth (Carrie Underwood and Old Dominion's 10), Wilson places comfortably in the top quarter overall at No. 10, tying both Maren Morris and Cole Swindell. Narrow the lens to the last five years and her rise looks even sharper: Wilson trails only Swift among solo women and places fourth overall behind Morgan Wallen (37), Luke Combs and Taylor Swift (14 tie) and Zach Bryan (13).


Kelsea Ballerini, meanwhile, makes her own Hot Country Songs impression with two titles. She bows at No. 36 with “Emerald City” (2.9 million streams). The track sits just behind “I Sit in Parks,” which rises 14% (37-32) and logs 3.3 million streams. Both appear on Mount Pleasant, her new six-song EP, which opens at No. 9 on Top Country Albums with 13,000 equivalent album units. “Emerald City” becomes Ballerini's 24th charted title on the list, seven of which have made the top 10 since 2015's breakthrough “Love Me Like You Mean It.”

J.D. and Turk still can't do this all on their own. Thankfully, they've got their old friends scrubbing in once again. Despite being down a showrunner, the Scrubs reboot is still riding the ambulance to Sacred Heart Hospital for its February 2026 debut. Fifteen years after they said goodbye to their legion of patients, Zach Braff and Donald Faison have their stethoscopes at the ready for another season of Scrubs. To prove it, here's the first teaser for the revival.

﻿

Here's the synopsis from Disney:

J.D. and Turk scrub in together for the first time in a long time: Medicine has changed; interns have changed; but their bromance has stood the test of time. Characters new and old navigate the waters of Sacred Heart with laughter, heart, and some surprises along the way.

Aside from Neil Flynn's absence, the whole cast, including Braff, Faison, Sarah Chalke, Judy Reyes, and John C. McGinley, appears physically unchanged from their mid-2000s heyday. Still, they also have no trouble falling back into the familiar comedic rhythms of the show. Dr. Cox is still giving it to J.D. as Turk and Elliot follow the fun. The teaser also sets up the series' premise. J.D. is “back, baby,” to teach a new class of medical interns, and in the teaser, he comes face-to-face with a new group of Zoomer medical professionals who have no idea who he is.

Scrubs returns on February 25, 2026, on ABC.

    Meet up with the Winchester boys, Crowley and Lucifer at a new streaming spot.
  

Supernatural, the hit monster-hunting show that ran on the WB and later on the CW for 15 seasons, has been a reliable Netflix mainstay for over a decade. The show has been streaming on Netflix since 2012, with new seasons dropping on the platform shortly after they aired on The CW. When the series ended its run on network TV back in 2020, Netflix's licensing agreement gave it the rights to host all 15 seasons for a period of five years from the date of the show's final season. 

Welp, those five years are up, and now the show is about to disappear from the site. You know how sometimes you take things for granted without even realizing it? Supernatural on Netflix is one of those instances when you don't truly appreciate what you have until it's taken away. 

So when, exactly, is Supernatural leaving Netflix, and where is it going?

Supernatural, which stars Jared Padalecki and Jensen Ackles as Dean and Sam Winchester, siblings who are paranormal investigators and demon hunters, is being taken off Netflix on Dec. 17. Luckily, it won't be off streaming for long: It's been confirmed that all 15 seasons will drop on Peacock just five days later, on Dec. 22. 

If you don't subscribe to Peacock, or just want to own the series outright so you don't have to worry about it jumping around from platform to platform, the show is also available to buy on Prime Video for $0.48 an episode or $8 a season, and on Apple TV and FandangoNow (prices there range from $10 to $25 a season). In the meantime, you can certainly try to watch all 327 episodes before they leave Netflix, but that will require you to watch about 11 per day every day (factoring in time for sleep and a few hours of work, if you can muster the strength). 

Don't miss any of our unbiased tech content and lab-based reviews. Add CNET as a preferred Google source.

Though there isn't one available at the moment for Peacock, we encourage you to stay on the lookout for Black Friday streaming service deals this week. However, there are other ways to get Peacock Premium at no -- or low -- cost if you're savvy.

Science is thrilling, especially when it relates to the universe. Years ago, NASA found a UFO-shaped galaxy, which has long been a mystery. The first thing they do when they find an extraterrestrial subject of this sort is to examine the globular clusters and stars. Just recently, another research was conducted on this galaxy, and the mystery that seemed hidden has now been solved. 

NASA UFO-shaped galaxy, otherwise known as Dragonfly44 (DF44), was first discovered in a deep survey of a Coma cluster, a cluster with several thousand galaxies. Scientists were wowed by the discovery because of the quantity of dark matter found in it, almost as much as that of the Milky Way. Recall that the Milky Way is equivalent to a billion solar masses. 

The galaxy was first discovered by an international group of astronomers using the world's most powerful telescopes. The scientists used W.M. Keck Observatory and the Gemini North Telescope (both on Maunakea, Hawaii), and the study was published in The Astrophysical Journal Letters. This UFO-shaped galaxy came into the limelight when NASA found that it consists of more dark matter, more than usual, making it 99.9% invisible.

While it has been under the radar for decades because of its dim appearance, it finally emerged when the Telephoto Array pointed out a region of the sky in the constellation Coma. Scientists further discovered that the galaxy had fewer stars, such that it could go berserk if something wasn't holding it together.

Scientists found that the dark matter content in DF44 is much less than when it was first observed. While it competes with the size of the Milky Way, this galaxy only has a hundred million stars compared to the Milky Way's hundred thousand million stars. This estimation affirms that the former is a thousand times fewer. The group of astronomers suggested that it would have been quite a subject of attraction with 100 times as much dark matter as expected from the number of its stars, like this mysterious glowing frozen young star discovery.

It was further noted that the total number of globular clusters is around 20, and the ratio of dark matter to luminous matter is 300 to 1. The updated analysis confirmed that the galaxy holds an ideal number of clusters that any normal galaxy should have. While a previous study referred to Dragonfly44 as anomalous, a recent study emerged, eradicating errors and confirming that the dark matter content is much less than earlier findings. You can find the results in Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society (MNRAS).

The mystery surrounding DF44 has now been solved, thanks to the international team of astronomers led by the Kapteyn Institute of the University of Groningen (the Netherlands). Other participants include scientists from the Instituto de Astrofísícal de Canarias (IAC) and the University of La Laguna (ULL). Kudos to Ignacio Trujillo and Michael A. Beasly, IAC researchers and co-authors of the study, for their commitment to analyzing the dark matter and stars within the galaxy.

Up until now, there have been no physical explanations for the relation between the number of globular clusters and the total mass of the galaxy. All conclusions are based on pure observations. Let's not forget that the dark matter of a galaxy can be determined by measuring the number of globular clusters in it. Some believe the relation has to do with the gas from which the clusters and stars have formed. It is now left for NASA to further research new galaxies and their composition, leading to this ejected supermassive black hole, racing through space.

Was an alien space craft hovering over New England this week? Some observers may have thought so.

On Tuesday, a huge funnel-like cloud was spotted above Mount Washington in New Hampshire. The fluffy formation looked like a tube ready to vacuum New England's highest peak up into the clouds.

Though the massive mountain stayed right where it was, that cloud formation didn't stick around for too long.

Luckily, the jaw-dropping moment was captured in photos and shared by the Mount Washington Observatory.

Appearing somewhat like a spaceship dropping out of the sky, the formation is actually  a lenticular cloud.

Though I certainly remember learning about cumulus and nimbus clouds back in school science class, the lenticular cloud probably never came up.

Perhaps that's because these clouds pretty much only form over mountains and need very specific conditions to stick around.

Lenticular clouds form as moist air is pushed up over a mountain, then cools into a cloud as it hits cooler air higher up. The air then cools again as it's pushed over the cloud peak, leaving a stacked tube-like shape that often appears to be sitting still in the sky.

Air around a lenticular cloud is actually pretty turbulent, helping to create the circular stacks of clouds that resemble UFOs. They're also good indicators of air patches that could be dangerous to aircraft.

So not only did this particular cloud over Mount Washington give us all an amazing site to see, it also gave local pilots a heads up about flying over the 6,288 foot peak.

Is 3I/ATLAS a technological artifact long forgotten by one of our cosmic neighbors? Or is it a spy probe hurled at Jupiter, the largest and probably the most visible planet from the backyard of another world, hopefully benevolent? Or is it just a playful icy rock trynna tease us with its un-comet like property, while being one, just a distant cousin with tantrums?

From its epileptic path to chemical composition with abundance of nickel, and alleged non-gravitational acceleration, there are 13 anomalies with six major ones, highlighted by Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb. The researcher in his latest blog made an extraterrestrial wager while reacting to Dr. Michael Shermer on the latter's $1000 bet, where he quipped

More recently, proponents of UAPs as alien spacecraft have appeared before the U.S. Congress, confidently claiming that they know people who have seen and even touched aliens and/or their spaceships, back-engineered their technologies, and even communicated with the aliens. 

Yet when pushed for evidence, they always demur, saying that it's “classified” or “top-secret,” that Men-in-Black threatened them into silence, that their careers and even their lives are at stake if they disclose said evidence, that they could only reveal the evidence in a “SCIF” (Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility) but not in Congress, and that many people in the U.S. government, CIA, FBI, NSA, etc. (never named) have this information and evidence of alien visitation.

Avi Loeb wrote,

The search for technological artifacts has just started in earnest in 2025 with the discovery of the anomalous interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, the launch of the Rubin Observatory and the construction of three Galileo Project Observatories. Given that there are billions of Earth-Sun analogs in the Milky Way galaxy—most of which are billions of years older than the solar system—and that it will take less than a billion years for our Voyager spacecraft to cross the Milky Way disk, we must engage in the scientific search for extraterrestrial technological artifacts.

He further suggests that the seeker community at large must keep their eyes, hearts, and minds open.

It is better to be an optimist because life is sometimes a self-fulfilling prophecy. This is why I am engaged in the search with the hope that we will find a partner on our blind date with interstellar objects.

For decades, America's intelligence agencies have treated the public like background noise, a nuisance to be managed, not a nation to be informed. But the twin scandals now colliding in the Epstein cover-up and the UAP/UFO secrecy regime are exposing something far more corrosive than bureaucratic incompetence. They reveal a government culture that has grown accustomed to lying, concealment, and contempt for the very people it serves. And after the latest disclosures, hearings, whistle-blower accounts, and forced transparency laws, it's impossible to pretend this is about “national security.” What's unfolding is a betrayal of democracy on a constitutional scale.

“There comes a point where secrecy is no longer protection — it's sabotage.”

That's where we are now. The Pentagon, CIA, and FBI have crossed that line so many times it's practically policy. They buried the truth about a global sex trafficking network connected to Jeffrey Epstein. They buried evidence and testimony about unidentified aerial phenomena that could reshape science itself. They buried intelligence from presidents and Congress. They buried trust. And they expect the public to just swallow it all, quietly, forever.

This country didn't become the world's powerhouse through fear and gatekeeping. We became the world's leader because we trust our people more than we trust our paranoia. But that philosophy stopped at the doors of the intelligence community and the damage that wall of secrecy has done is becoming impossible to ignore.

The government would have you believe that Jeffrey Epstein was a lone monster with a private island, a private plane, and no co-conspirators. A convenient narrative, considering the sheer number of powerful people who orbited his operation for years. After everything we now know about the scope, scale, and structure of Epstein's criminal network, the idea that he acted alone isn't just absurd — it's insulting.

Federal agencies had warnings for decades. They had thousands of victims. They had corroborating evidence. They had intelligence reports. They had flight logs and financial records showing Epstein moving between global power centers like he was running an intelligence operation. And still, the FBI let him walk free for years. When he was finally prosecuted the first time, they negotiated a secret non-prosecution deal so grotesque it read like a ransom note written by privilege itself.

Only now, under overwhelming public pressure, has the government been forced to release the Epstein files. Congress had to pass a law compelling the DOJ to hand over documents the FBI should have made public a decade ago. And even now, officials are already hinting that “ongoing investigations” may justify redactions. Americans have heard that excuse before. It's code for “protecting powerful people.”

What makes this cover-up even darker is the geopolitical angle nobody in the intelligence community wants to talk about. Epstein's closest partners, business ties, and funding channels raise questions that intersect with foreign intelligence, questions federal agencies have every incentive to keep buried. If they're shielding a foreign ally's involvement in an international trafficking operation, that's not national security. That's corruption.

“When the system protects predators instead of victims, it's no longer a justice system, it's a cartel.”

Then there's the other scandal, the one that has nothing to do with billionaires on private jets and everything to do with the nature of existence itself.

UAPs used to be a punchline. Now they're a policy crisis, a national security gridlock, and a scientific black hole all because the Pentagon and intelligence agencies buried evidence for generations. For years, pilots, engineers, scientists, and military officers reported craft doing things that break known physics: zero propulsion signatures, instant acceleration, sudden directional changes, transmedium capabilities. And what did the Pentagon do? Ridicule, deny, mock, classify. Anything except confront the truth.

The Age of Disclosure documentary didn't drop out of nowhere. It's the product of decades of whistle-blower frustration, men and women inside the system who saw extraordinary materials, extraordinary craft, and extraordinary evidence locked away in private vaults owned by defense contractors and shielded from elected oversight. These weren't conspiracy theorists. These were program leads, scientists, pilots, colonels, analysts. People who held clearances far above what the President of the United States gets.

Now, whistle-blowers say entire divisions of government ran retrieval programs without briefing presidents, Congress, or inspectors general. That is not national security. That is a shadow state. And hiding technological breakthroughs from the scientific community isn't protection, it's the sabotage of human progress.

“You don't beat China by hiding physics from your own scientists.”

Every time the government classifies discovery instead of sharing it with the scientific world, it hobbles innovation. It slows engineering. It hands adversaries a head start. Secrecy doesn't make America stronger. Transparency does. It always has. And the agencies who claim otherwise are lying to cover their own failures and wishes.

If the Pentagon or CIA truly kept UAP programs off presidential briefings, that is a constitutional crisis. Civilian oversight is the bedrock of the American military system. If intelligence officers think they can decide what the Commander-in-Chief is allowed to know, then they're not public servants, they're self anointed kings.

And if Congress has been systematically misled about Epstein connections, UAP recoveries, black-budget programs, or the private-sector handling of recovered materials? Then we are no longer living in a functioning democratic republic. We are living under a self-appointed clerical class, a priesthood of secrets accountable to nobody.

These agencies have forgotten who their employer is. It's not Lockheed Martin. It's not a classified chain of command. It's the American people. Their salaries, their weapons, their programs, their jets, their satellites — all of it exists because taxpayers fund it.

Yet the agencies behave like transparency is an inconvenience, oversight is an insult, and democracy is optional.

We are now at the breaking point. A nation cannot lead the world when its own government refuses to tell the truth about crimes committed by the powerful… or the technological breakthroughs that could redefine civilization. The United States cannot claim moral leadership while sheltering predators, lying to Congress, and gatekeeping science that could reshape energy, transportation, defense, and medicine.

This level of secrecy is not protection. It is paralysis. And it is destroying trust at a rate the government cannot repair.

The Epstein scandal exposes the government's moral rot. The UAP scandal exposes its structural rot. Combined, they expose institutional decay that no democracy can survive without major surgery.

This is where the conversation has to go next: legislation, not outrage. Complete classification reform. Independent science review boards. Civilian oversight with subpoena power. Criminal penalties for withholding information from Congress. Declassification deadlines that can't be gamed or delayed. And full public disclosure of Epstein's network — every name, every flight, every deal, every accomplice.

The Pentagon, CIA, and FBI don't need more power. They need limits, hard limits, written into law. Because the American people aren't children. And they aren't idiots. They are the owners of this country. And it's long past time the agencies remember that.

The first part exposed the rot. Now we get into the remedy, the part Washington fears the most. Because once you understand the scope of deception behind the Epstein cover-up and the UAP blackout, it becomes obvious the problem isn't a single agency or director. It's a system. A culture. A cartel of secrecy embedded so deeply into the Pentagon, CIA, FBI, and their contractor ecosystem that it now operates independently of elected authority.

This isn't an “intelligence community.” It's an unelected power bloc. And if America wants to remain a functioning democracy capable of leading the world, that bloc must be broken by law, by force of oversight, and by a public that finally sees through the myth that secrecy is strength. It isn't. Secrecy is the cancer.

“A government that hides truth from its own people is not guarding the nation — it's guarding itself.”

The era of blind deference must end. This blueprint lays out how.

The U.S. classification regime was designed for wartime secrets like troop movements, operational plans, cryptography, the stuff that could get Americans killed if leaked. But over the past 60 years, that system metastasized into a catch-all cloak for bureaucratic embarrassment, agency mistakes, political damage, technological breakthroughs, and, in the Epstein case, evidence implicating the powerful. The number of classified documents has exploded into the tens of millions. Information stays classified not because it protects the nation, but because it protects institutions.

And nowhere is that clearer than in the two scandals now defining our era:

• The Epstein network: where agencies hid evidence rather than expose who enabled it.• The UAP programs: where agencies hid discoveries that could change physics rather than risk accountability.

Both cover-ups relied on the same tactic: bury it, classify it, deny everything.

The solution begins with tearing down the broken classification wall.

Every successful reform movement in U.S. history started by changing the rules of power. Today's rules allow intelligence agencies to unilaterally decide what the public is allowed to know, with no timeline, no accountability, and no external review. That ends now.

• Ban classification to avoid embarrassment or political damage.If it protects institutions instead of the nation, it cannot be classified. Period.

• Force automatic declassification deadlines.No document should outlive its relevance by 40 years simply because some bureaucrat enjoyed the power of hiding it.

• Require civilian oversight boards with subpoena power.Not dependent on appointments from the very agencies they're meant to police.

• Criminalize deliberate misclassification.If you hide evidence of crimes or hide breakthroughs from elected leaders, you go to prison.

• Give Congress real-time access to any program, no exceptions.If a senator can't get briefed on a program funded by taxpayers, that program is unconstitutional by definition.

This is how you dismantle a secrecy cartel, by removing the legal shield it hides behind.

Whistle-blower testimony in the UAP arena revealed something that should terrify every American: retrieval programs and materials allegedly hidden from multiple presidents. Think about what that means. Unelected government employees decided the Commander-in-Chief wasn't “ready” or “qualified” to know certain information. At that point, the presidency becomes symbolic, not sovereign. If any program is deemed too “sensitive” to brief the president, that program should be shut down immediately and its leadership removed. Anything else is a coup in slow motion.

“If contractors and mid-level officials decide what the president can know, we don't have a democracy — we have a managed illusion of one.”

Restoring constitutional supremacy: the elected branch must control the unelected one, not the other way around.

The deeper you go into the UAP story, the more obvious it becomes that private contractors have become the vault keepers of America's biggest secrets. They store materials. They run labs. They control access. They decide what gets logged, what gets buried, and what gets lost. That's not accountability, that's privatized secrecy. Defense firms are essential for national security, but they cannot be the custodians of the most sensitive knowledge ever recovered. If non-human technology exists, no corporation should own the file cabinets.

Congress must pass laws requiring that all recovered materials, analysis, and historical archives be transferred to:

• A federal scientific review board• Independent physicists• Publicly accountable agencies

Contractors must be vendors, not gatekeepers. America cannot let corporations privatize the universe.

The Epstein scandal is the moral litmus test of this era. If America cannot tell the truth about who enabled, funded, protected, and participated in an international trafficking operation, then the rule of law has collapsed.

The DOJ must release everything. Names. Logs. Testimony. Communications. Deals. And it must do so without hiding behind “ongoing investigations” or “foreign intelligence relationships.” If a foreign ally was involved, the American people deserve to know. If billionaires were involved, the American people deserve to know. If intelligence agencies used Epstein for operations, the American people deserve to know.

This nation cannot move forward with a justice system that protects predators and punishes the truth.

One of the most urgent reforms America needs is also the simplest: when the government encounters a craft, material, or biological sample of unknown origin, the public deserves a documented, accountable process, not silence, not rumors, and certainly not a handoff to defense contractors who operate outside democratic oversight. A modern republic cannot function when its most consequential discoveries are locked behind doors never opened to Congress or independent scientists.

Under a reformed system, discoveries of unknown origin would trigger immediate, mandatory notification to both branches of civilian oversight, elected lawmakers and an independent scientific review board. This is not sci-fi theater. It is basic governance. The era of secret vaults and buried evidence must end. A democracy cannot afford to let a small circle of insiders decide what humanity is allowed to know about the universe.

The truth is simple: secrecy has cost the United States decades of scientific progress. We have likely lost time on propulsion breakthroughs, advanced materials, energy systems, and technologies that could reshape the entire global balance. The idea that locking this knowledge away somehow “protects” the public is not just wrong — it is dangerous. You do not win the future by handcuffing your own researchers. You win it by unleashing them.

For all the drama of UFO secrecy and the political fallout of the Epstein files, the deeper problem is cultural rot inside the intelligence bureaucracy. In today's system, when officials lie to Congress, withhold documents, destroy evidence, or bury programs, the consequences are laughably small. Maybe they're reassigned. Maybe they retire early. Usually, nothing at all happens.

That culture must be torn out by the roots.

Real reform requires criminal accountability, not symbolic reprimands or internal memos. Intelligence obstruction should carry mandatory prison time, not comfortable pension packages. Any official who lies to Congress, manipulates classification to hide wrongdoing, or blocks lawful oversight must face real penalties. Not theoretical penalties. Actual consequences.

And the contractor class cannot be immune, either. If a private company conceals evidence, alters records, or interferes with a congressional inquiry, they should face the same penalties federal employees do. The oversight system must treat contractors not as privileged partners but as extensions of government authority and therefore subject to the same scrutiny.

An intelligence bureaucracy that fears no punishment is a bureaucracy that fears nothing at all. That's how democracies collapse.

Everything comes down to a simple principle that Washington lost somewhere along the way: the truth belongs to the American people. Not the Pentagon. Not the CIA. Not the FBI. Not the contractors holding half the UAP archives in private vaults. And definitely not the bureaucrats who've built careers on deciding what the public is “ready” to know.

Transparency is not a favor the government grants when it feels generous. It is the operating system of a free nation. Without it, the country becomes an empty ritual, elections without accountability, laws without enforcement, and institutions without legitimacy.

Reform begins by reclaiming that foundation. It requires laws that force disclosure, systems that mandate oversight, and a cultural shift inside the intelligence world that makes truth the rule rather than the enemy. It means scientific transparency where secrecy once lived. It means presidents receiving full briefings without interference. It means Congress having real authority again, not ceremonial access.

Most importantly, it means returning ownership of information to the public.

This is how America leads again, not by hiding reality but by confronting it openly, boldly, and with the confidence that built the nation in the first place. A country that trusts its people will always out-innovate, out-perform, and out-imagine every adversary on Earth. And it will do so without the cancer of secrecy eating away at its core.

Oh, how the times have changed. Not too long ago, if you claimed you believed in aliens, people would have thought you were crazy. Now, not only are people believing in them, but there are support groups for people who have endured alien encounters. Not only are you no longer seen as crazy by the masses, but it almost appears as if it has never been cooler to have had contact with an other worldly life force. Now, one woman is offering a "safe space' for people to discuss their alien encounters.

What started off as a small in-person meeting at her public library has now spread across the globe. The NY Post shares that Catherine Chapey now considers these meetings the highlight of her week. Rather than meeting with just a few people at the library," she now has a mailing list of thousands — some beaming in from as far as Japan and New Zealand." The former electrician is now an ordained "interspiritual minister", according to the Post, after having an otherworldly encounter herself. After sharing her experience, she found others who also had unique experiences with the extraterrestrial.

People in her weekly groups can have a "safe space to recount their abductions, telepathic visions from beyond, and other celestial come-to-Jesus moments." While they may not be readily believed outside of this group, within the confines of the Zoom meeting, all alien encounters are listened to with respect.

The current hot-button topic in the group is the 3I/Atlas, "the interstellar object that's streaking through our atmosphere." This interstellar object has caused a lot of speculation, leading many people to argue that it could be connected to the estraterretrial. Luckily for all the believers out there, this alien encounter group provides them with the space to discuss it openly and without judgment. Each person in the group claims to have had some sort of contact with aliens. One man claims to have been working with them since he was 14 years old. Another woman claimed she is an "ET-human hybrid." Additionally, a woman shared how she enjoys the group because it allows her to open up about this topic. When she broached the topic with friends and family, they thought she was insane.

While it is definitely unorthodox, it would appear that this alien therapy group is truly helping people.
