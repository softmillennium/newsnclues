                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Four members of Amazon Employees for Climate Justice tell WIRED that they began asking workers to sign the letter last month. Backers inside Amazon include high-ranking engineers, senior product leaders, marketing managers, and warehouse staff spanning many divisions of the company. A senior engineering manager with over 20 years at Amazon says they signed because they believe a manufactured “race” to build the best AI has empowered executives to trample workers and the environment. “The current generation of AI has become almost like a drug that companies like Amazon obsess over, use as a cover to lay people off, and use the savings to pay for data centers for AI products no one is paying for,” says the employee, who like others in this story, asked to remain anonymous because they feared retaliation from their bosses. Amazon, along with other big tech companies, is in the midst of investing billions of dollars to construct new data centers to train and run generative AI systems. This includes tools helping workers write code and consumer-facing services such as Amazon's shopping chatbot, Rufus. It's easy to see why Amazon is pursuing AI. The open letter demands that Amazon abandon carbon fuel sources at its data centers, bar its AI technologies from being used to carry out surveillance and mass deportation, and stop forcing employees to use AI in their work. Amazon spokesperson Brad Glasser says that the company remains committed to its goal of reaching net-zero carbon emissions by 2040. “We recognize that progress will not always be linear, but we remain focused on serving our customers better, faster, and with fewer emissions,” he says, repeating earlier company statements. Glasser didn't address employee concerns about internal AI tools or external uses of the technology. His administration has rolled back labor protections, climate policies, and AI regulations. Many are also concerned about job security as automation threatens entry-level software engineering and marketing roles. In 2023, hundreds of prominent scientists petitioned the biggest AI companies to pause work on the technology for six months and evaluate potentially catastrophic harms stemming from it. The campaigns have generated scant success, and companies continue to rapidly release new, increasingly powerful AI models. But despite the challenging political environment, members of the climate justice group at Amazon say they felt they had to try to combat potential harms from AI. Their strategy, in part, is to focus less on longer-term worries about AI that is more capable than humans, in favor of putting more emphasis on consequences they argue must be confronted now. We are in the few remaining years to avoid catastrophic warming.” Rallying support for the open letter was more difficult than in previous years, workers say, because Amazon has increasingly restricted employees' ability to solicit people to sign petitions. Orin Starn, an anthropologist at Duke University who spent two years undercover as an Amazon warehouse worker, says the moment is ripe for taking on the giant. “Many people have tired of brazen billionaire excess and a company with nothing more than cosmetic PR concern about climate change, AI, immigrant rights, and the lives of its own workers,” he says. Two of the Amazon employees say executives are minimizing problems with the company's internal AI tools and glossing over how dissatisfied workers are with them. But the engineer says that Amazon's tools for writing code and technical documentation aren't good enough to reach such ambitious targets. The open letter calls for Amazon to establish “ethical AI working groups” involving rank-and-file workers who would have a voice in how emerging technologies are used in their job duties. They also want a say in how AI might be used to automate aspects of their roles. The Amazon employee group, which formed in 2018, claims credit for influencing some of the company's environmental pledges through a series of walkouts, shareholder proposals, and petitions, including one in 2019 that drew over 8,700 employee signatures. The activists note that Amazon's emissions have grown about 35 percent since 2019, and they want a new detailed plan established to reach the company's goal of net-zero by 2040. The activists say what they have received from Amazon recently is uninspiring. One of the employees says that several weeks ago, at a companywide meeting, an executive stated that demand for data centers would grow 10-fold by 2027.

The 84-kilowatt solar array is paired with Level 2 EV charging that can accommodate 20 vehicles simultaneously. The $3.7 million project includes electrical infrastructure to support the future installation of panels capable of nearly 30 times more power generation — up to 2.5 megawatts. The solar canopy is a pilot project supporting the UW's goals to cut its carbon footprint, said Mark Huppert, interim director of UW Transportation Services. “Generating solar power from a parking lot may sound modest, but the strategic value is enormous,” said Darin Leonard, president of Trinity Energy, in a statement. The project was funded by UW Transportation Services, Seattle City Light and Washington state's Climate Commitment Act, administered through the Washington State Department of Commerce's electric vehicle charging program.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Artificial intelligence startup xAI, founded by Elon Musk, told city and county planners in Memphis last week that it plans to build a solar farm next to its Colossus data center — one of the world's largest facilities for training AI models. Musk's company has come under fire for operating over 400 megawatts of natural gas turbines without permits, according to the Southern Environmental Law Center (SELC). The legal organization, which is working with the NAACP, says that xAI has operated at least 35 turbines capable of emitting more than 2,000 tons of NOX pollution — nitrogen oxide emissions that contribute to smog and respiratory problems — annually. The turbines have sparked fierce opposition from residents in nearby Boxtown, a predominantly Black community where researchers at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, found that peak nitrogen dioxide concentration levels increased by 79% in areas immediately surrounding the data center after xAI began operations. Community activists have reported increased asthma attacks and respiratory issues since the facility opened. The AI company has said that it intends to use the turbines until it can secure additional power, but local officials gave xAI a permit to operate 15 turbines through January 2027. In September, xAI said it would build a 100-megawatt solar farm nearby, which will be paired with 100 megawatts of grid-scale batteries to provide a 24/7 source of electricity. Meanwhile, xAI has added gas turbines in Mississippi to power its Colossus 2 data center. Tim De Chant is a senior climate reporter at TechCrunch.

Get those two things under control, with or without GLP-1 drugs, and an enormous array of complications are made less likely.For people with healthy, ideal diets at an optimal weight and with good blood sugar control, there are only remote, hypothetical benefits. There is some evidence it reduces inflammation and might ward off neurodegenerative disorders, but those likely have more of a relationship with blood sugar spikes, and again lifestyle changes are more impactful.

(Except I'll note that's true for more than one hormone, as tirzepatide is both a GLP1 and GIP agonist, and I believe retatrutide is also Glucagon?) “We think that, by modulating cerebrospinal fluid pressure and reducing intracranial venous sinuses compression, these drugs produce a decrease in the release of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), a key migraine-promoting peptide”, Dr Braca explained. “That would pose intracranial pressure control as a brand-new, pharmacologically targetable pathway.” We've learned that depletion of neural ATP levels can result in an energy crisis which results in cortical spreading depression, which stimulates the release of CGRP.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After Myanmar's military junta raided a notorious scam compound and destroyed buildings with explosives in October, officials claimed the country would entirely “eradicate” forced scamming within its borders. Experts on scam compounds, meanwhile, say the entire effort is likely “propaganda.” High-resolution images of the KK Park scam compound, which is located near the Myanmar-Thailand border, show how military forces have razed multiple buildings, leaving piles of rubble in their place. Multiple experts tell WIRED that the raids at KK Park and some other scam compounds are likely part of a wider “performative” effort by Myanmar's military government, which has come under increasing pressure to tackle the highly lucrative scam compounds that have flourished in recent years. “It's important to keep monitoring this to verify what they're actually doing and [see] if this is just for show or if they're actually cracking down on the real problem.” The satellite images, taken on November 16, appear to show that some buildings located around courtyards have been almost totally destroyed, with debris strewn around other buildings. Heintz says that the images, plus extra social media footage, indicates that some “villas” and dormitories where trafficking victims may have been housed appear to have been damaged or destroyed. (Myanmar's military government has said further destruction started on November 17; third-party reports also suggest more buildings have been destroyed). “All of the critical buildings that you would need to perpetrate the scams are still intact and still ready for use,” says Mechelle B Moore, the CEO of anti-trafficking nonprofit Global Alms, which is based in Thailand and works to help people who have trafficked into scam compounds in Myanmar. Over the past decade, dozens of scam compounds have appeared in Southeast Asia, primarily across Myanmar, Cambodia, and Laos. Often operated by or linked to Chinese organized crime groups, the compounds trick people into working at them—often with the offer of high-paying jobs—and then force them to run a range of scams. Myanmar's military junta has been conducting raids on KK Park since the middle of October and on the Shwe Kokko compound since mid-November. The sites are linked to “telecom” fraud and illegal gambling operations, government statements say. A statement from Myanmar's Ministry of Information published online on Wednesday says officials are “dismantling and removing illegal buildings, and taking further action in accordance with the law.” The statement claims that officials are demolishing buildings in three areas of KK Park, and since the raids began a “a total of 237 buildings out of 635 illegal buildings have so far been demolished.” It says that 1,847 “undocumented foreign entrants” have been detained, along with more than 3,000 computers, 21,000 mobile phones, and 102 Starlink satellite internet systems. Multiple Myanmar government departments did not immediately respond to WIRED's request for comment. A member of Myanmar's London embassy said they would prefer to discuss the topic in person, which was not viable ahead of publication, but did not otherwise comment. Alongside multiple government statements, the Associated Press reports that state television in Myanmar has been broadcasting “extensive” video footage of buildings being dismantled in KK Park, and the unusually detailed reports “appear to reflect the military government's desire to publicize its efforts after months of bad publicity.” Some video footage shows steamrollers crushing thousands of smartphones and computers. “This is really performative, and it continues to be the case,” says Jason Tower, a senior expert at the Global Initiative Against Transnational Organized Crime. The military government is also holding a widely criticized election in December. “We have several different groups that are being held in scamming compounds. Groups of victims that are too scared to leave, even though the crime syndicates have left or they're being held under guard and they're not allowed to leave.” Tower says another development, which is more significant than the military junta action, has come from anti-government, resistance groups also starting to disrupt scam compounds; he points to one group, the Karen National Liberation Army, recently taking over a compound. “I think this was the first time on the Karen border that you've seen resistance forces really step in to put pressure on the military and to take this issue up as part of their revolutionary activity,” Tower says. Meanwhile, Heintz says that when people enslaved in scam compounds are freed or escape, authorities need to properly class them as victims of human trafficking and not treat them as criminals themselves.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Several public websites designed to allow courts across the United States and Canada to manage the personal information of potential jurors had a simple security flaw that easily exposed their sensitive data, including names and home addresses, TechCrunch has exclusively learned. A security researcher, who asked not to be named for this story, contacted TechCrunch with details of the easy-to-exploit vulnerability, and identified at least a dozen juror websites made by government software maker Tyler Technologies that appear to be vulnerable, given that they run on the same platform. To log into these platforms, a juror is provided a unique numerical identifier assigned to them, which could be brute-forced since the number was sequentially incremental. The platform also did not have any mechanism to prevent anyone from flooding the login pages with a large number of guesses, a feature known as “rate-limiting.” In early November, the security researcher told TechCrunch that they identified at least one jury management portal for a county in Texas as vulnerable. The vulnerability could have exposed personal health data inside a juror's profile in some cases. For example, if a juror had requested to be exempted from service for health reasons, they may have disclosed what medical reason they think disqualifies them. Contact Us Do you have more information about vulnerabilities in Tyler Technologies' products? “We have developed a remediation to prevent unauthorized access and are communicating next steps with our clients,” the statement said. In 2023, a security researcher found that, due to a separate security flaw, some U.S. online court record systems exposed sealed, confidential, and sensitive data, such as witness lists and testimony, mental health evaluations, detailed allegations of abuse, and corporate trade secrets. Two other government technology providers were exposing data in that case: Catalis, through its CMS360 product, a system used across several U.S. states; and Henschen & Associates, through its CaseLook court record system, used in Ohio.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Jonathan Duncan has applied to roughly 200 jobs since getting laid off in May after working at Microsoft for more than two decades. He's tried adapting resumes for each role, subscribing to job alerts, networking with peers, and internal referrals. Experienced tech professionals across the industry are learning they're not immune to Big Tech's widespread layoffs — and that finding a new job isn't as easy as it used to be. For years, tech workers were told there was a talent shortage. But in 2025, leaders who built their whole careers on growing headcount and mastering organizational processes are getting “mowed down right now in stunning numbers,” said Laura Close, CEO of Close Cohen, a job search and executive coaching firm. Close said some “super high-value professionals” she works with are taking 12-to-18 months to find a new job. And in an industry that “equates youth with innovation and stamina,” Close said longtime workers are finding that their previous success metrics are no longer valued — decades of expertise have become liabilities, not assets. “What we're seeing right now is ageism on steroids,” Close said. Allison Shrivastava, an economist with Indeed, said it's difficult for anyone trying to get hired — from new college grads to more veteran workers. “If you've been trying to get a job or change jobs in a tech-related field, you're probably really, really struggling,” she said. While unemployment broadly remains low, the amount of time that people remain unemployed is increasing, Shrivastava said. More than 114,000 tech workers have been laid off this year so far, compared to nearly 153,000 workers in 2024 and nearly 265,000 in 2023, according to Layoffs.fyi. Seattle-area tech giants Microsoft and Amazon have announced major workforce reductions in 2025. Both companies are investing heavily in AI infrastructure while emphasizing efficiency. As a senior manager at Microsoft, Duncan said budgets were recently slashed across the board — training, travel, morale-building. Every quarter brought new demands to return unspent funds. He also noticed what he calls “underleveling” — senior director roles being posted at lower levels than before, manager positions offered at what used to be individual contributor levels. “I think the days of high-paying tech jobs are drying up,” he said. Shrivastava said the current layoffs are likely a “shedding” from a massive over-hire during the post-pandemic tech boom, not necessarily an AI restructuring story. But at the same time, as The Wall Street Journal reported, many companies are betting that AI can help them grow — without growing headcount. For many of these workers, the timing couldn't be worse with aging parents, kids heading to college, and retirement on the horizon. “I consider this the most expensive time of my life,” Duncan said. Nancy Poznoff, an executive coach at Close Cohen, said financial pressure is compounding an identity crisis for many laid-off executives. “They've been high performers their whole career,” Poznoff said. And now they're suddenly having this identity crisis on top of it, because a lot of them have been at their company for so long, they have this fear around, ‘How do I operate when I'm not at Amazon?' Duncan still talks to his former teammates at Microsoft. Angus Norton, a former Microsoft and Amazon exec, recently wrote about the toll of perpetual layoffs on those who remain.

This seems extreme to me. This seems extreme to me. RealPage made it so that landlords were less competitive and more cooperative.

So the difference is using pricing info to beat your competitors vs using pricing info to collude with your competitors. The way competitors legally message each other to suggest a price increase is via the prices themselves.E.g. an airline wants to raise the price of a ticket from New York to Los Angeles from $500 to $530 -- and they secretly want the other airlines to follow them and raise their prices too.1) The airline submits the price increase to the global travel reservation system that all airlines can see. All the other airlines have computers constantly monitoring all the other airlines' ticket prices and can instantly adjust prices in response.2) The airline that wants the price increase waits to see how the other airlines respond. Either (1) the competitor airlines keeps their lower prices to "take market share" -- or -- (2) they also raise their prices to match which "maintains status quo of market share" but all competitors get to take advantage of charging the higher price3) If the other airlines don't match the higher price, the airline that "proposed" the higher price then rolls it back to $500. All this can happen within a few hours.That's the way competitors "collude" to raise prices out in the open. The prices simultaneously act as both a "cost to buy" and as a "message to cooperate".Legal "collusion" via price signals is easier in concentrated industries with few competitors (e.g. airlines). E.g. a barbershop wanting to raise the price of haircuts by $5 isn't going to get the hundred other barbershops to also raise their prices by $5.

I'm not sticking up for Realpage; I don't know enough about how it works. How is this any different than other sorts of transactions that occur on a recurring basis? For instance dog walking services or personal trainers? Such vendors are also presumably pricing their services based on what everyone else's pricing is, but any subsequent price changes aren't public.2.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Artificial Intelligence has been a buzzword in the auto industry, not just as a solution for ever-increasing costs in developing new electric vehicles, but also to speed up development times, reduce the number of prototypes developed, and make system updates more quickly. However, some companies are still finding it difficult to fit AI and software-developed products into their existing corporate structures. Former GM Chief AI Officer Barak Turovsky announced on November 21 in a LinkedIn post that he'd resigned from his position of eight months. Formerly an AI executive at Google and, most recently, Cisco, Turovsky wrote in his post, “Physical AI is just as exciting as LLMs,” while adding that he would be taking “a little sabbatical to work on some exciting new ideas.” Turovsky's departure after less than a year is another blow for GM's technology expertise as it pivots back to internal combustion engine vehicles, hastily adds hybrids, and moves more production to the United States after years of electric vehicle development was thrown for a loop by the Trump Administration's tariff actions this year and the end of the federal EV tax credits in September. Compounding problems is GM's persistent employee reorganization following domestic policy changes. Its Software and Services team gained a new leader in former Aurora Innovation co-founder and ex-Tesla Autopilot executive Sterling Anderson at the beginning of this month after former head Dave Richardson, himself a former Apple executive, stepped down at the end of October, according to WardsAuto. While GM is rolling out a new AI assistant and a more sophisticated version of its SuperCruise advanced driver assistant system in the coming years, those were developed under previous teams. And it's unclear where software-developed vehicles will land with automakers going forward, as EVs are struggling to achieve the projected levels of adoption in several large markets, and consumers get more price-conscious amid economic uncertainty. As EV demand drop begins, GM is betting on AI to spur sales GM is refocusing its strategy on gas-powered vehicles and cheaper EVs. The car maker expects slower EV adoption and billions in losses under Trump-era policies. General Motors is prepping for layoffs across several assembly plants.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A French archaeological mission headed by Sorbonne University's Frédéric Payraudeau found 225 funerary statuettes of King Shoshenq III, but not in his tomb—in King Osorkon II's. The team found Shoshenq III's ushabti and new inscriptions on the walls of the northern chamber of Osorkon II's tomb, according to a social media post by Egypt's Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities. They were in their original positions, in silt, and near a previously discovered granite coffin whose owner was still unknown. Both Shoshenq III and Osorkon II were pharaohs from the 22nd Dynasty, which lasted from around 945 to 730 BCE during ancient Egypt's Third Intermediate Period (around 1069 to 525 BCE), the last of three periods best known for disunity. In fact, Shoshenq III's “reign was long but difficult, with a bloody dynastic war between kings of the North [himself] and two kings in the south [his cousins] of Egypt,” Payraudeau told Live Science. According to the ministry, Shoshenq III was one of the most important 22nd Dynasty kings and built many of Tanis' most significant buildings. Osorkon II's tomb was already famous thanks to a collection of “treasures” known as the Tanis Treasures found in 1939, now at the Egyptian Museum in Tahrir. It is still not certain whether Shoshenq III was buried inside Osorkon II's tomb or if his burial goods were moved there to keep them safe from theft, said Hisham Hussein, head of the Central Administration of Antiquities of the Maritime Region, as cited by the ministry's post. If Shoshenq IV wasn't originally buried in Osorkon II, contrary to what Payraudeau says, the outlet posits whether Shoshenq IV might have moved him. I, for one, would just like to point out that Mr. Shoshenq III didn't plan for just a few helpers in the afterlife—he wanted (at least) 225.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Compare that to something with no real off-ramp: testosterone replacement therapy. Once you're on TRT, you can permanently suppress your body's own testosterone production, and many men won't produce enough on their own afterward. Bariatric surgery shows 25-65% significant regain rates depending on definition and timeframe. That's... just how weight loss works, not a unique GLP-1 problem.Calling a return of symptoms (obesity) a "safety issue" is like saying insulin has "no safe off-ramp" because diabetics get hyperglycemic when they stop taking it.Fear gets clicks, I guess.

"It's less clear how "unsafe" those regressions in health markers are. It's less clear how "unsafe" those regressions in health markers are. The testes atrophy over time when LH and FSH are suppressed. Even if LH and FSH return (which isn't guaranteed) the testes need to be able to respond to those hormonal signals, but atrophied testes do not respond the same.For someone with true intractable hypogonadism this hardly matters because they weren't capable anyway. Everyone I know who did try testosterone or steroids thought they were doing it the safe way (HCG, PCT, limited cycle length) but became unable to produce enough endogenous testosterone by their 40s even with SERMs.Men on TRT for years will have considerable testicular atrophy that is not totally reversible.> The question is, why would someone with clinical hypogonadism cease TRT?TRT is no longer limited to men with clinical hypogonadism.

TRT is no longer limited to men with clinical hypogonadism. They should be investigated and if found of wrongdoing, have their medical licenses revoked. Some of the clinics were even prescribing anabolic steroids intended for terminal cancer patients.If you want to read about something even crazier, look up the services that were started during COVID to be prescription mills for Adderall or Xanax. The FDA cracked down on these, though.There's even a famous story of a whistleblower who worked at one of these clinics and got reprimanded for not prescribing Adderall enough. There was a leaked memo where they pushed providers to prescribe Adderall over other options because their data showed the highest customer retention rate that way.

I don't think it's analogous at all to medical marijuana. Then your sample is either very limited or very weird, because I test my testosterone, and my friends who did multiple cycles in the past (10–15+ years ago, and not huge competition level doses) are also within the normal range. I am considering going back on AAS for the QoL benefits, but would like to create a better mental model of long-term ramifications for testicular health.It's my understanding that 40, it simply is expected that your hormones levels will be much lower (and that is not necessarily a bad thing). Studies of TRT patients have even shown that 1/4 of TRT patients may not have had their testosterone levels measured before being prescribed TRT: (Source https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6406807/ ) Completely unacceptable given how cheap testosterone testing is, but its happening.TRT clinics have also become a big business. Their business model relies on prescribing TRT to anyone and then charging them monthly or quarterly to continue receiving those prescriptions, which as the parent comment noted become physically necessary after TRT causes the testes to atrophy.The trick the clinics are using now is “diagnosing by symptoms”. They have a long list of “symptoms of low T” and the patient is basically prompted to check off enough boxes to justify TRT. It's the same model as the medical marijuana card businesses where you can go in and the doctor will “find” a reason to give you the prescription.It's a real problem when combined with social media influencers who tell people that everything is a symptom of low testosterone and TRT will fix it.

Setting an average across a population is not really realistic - you can't say Shaq should work to the same levels as, say, Emo Phillips.TRT is normally used due to aging, though, so you are unlikely to have your testosterone levels spontaneously recover as you get older. TRT is normally used due to aging, though, so you are unlikely to have your testosterone levels spontaneously recover as you get older. I mean, bodybuilders essentially have a whole branch of alternative medicine which they have wholesale made up, so, ah, I'd be sceptical. The TRT clinics are ignoring levels or even not testing at all. They'll find an excuse to prescribe to someone even who has clinically high levels because they want the monthly recurring revenue from keeping that customer for life. I'm not going to say TRT clinics are the best actors here, but to an actual endocrinologist, diagnosing hormone issues isn't so simple as looking at single point-in-time measurement of total testosterone.Testosterone levels naturally vary even for a given individual - two readings at the same time of day on different days even a short period apart can be dramatically different - and that's not even taking into consideration the fact that total testosterone levels aren't the sole (or even primary) mechanism for diagnosing androgenic endocrine issues.

TRT cessation does not inherently cause men to have suppressed hormone levels after. With precautions and extra steps like HCG to maintain leydig cell/testicular function, preventing atrophy, one may safeguard against that risk.Coming off TRT, yes you will have lower levels as your HPTA has been suppressed by exogenous hormones. One may speed up this recovery using "PCT" (post cycle therapy), which involves taking a SERM (selective estrogen receptor modulator, e.g. enclomiphene) to resensitize and restart your HPTA. However this is not always necessary, and if one takes a look at the HARLEM study, most users return to their baseline levels within a year of going cold turkey.In the cases of true permanently lowered levels of hormones, I believe the two most common reasons are: using other AAS besides testosterone (1) and lifestyle or health factors that correlate with the need to be on TRT (2).With 1, this can be seen in users of decadurabolin (deca), which notoriously has hormone receptor active metabolites that last around for atleast a year, continuously suppressing the system. Or trenbolone (tren/cattle bulking hormone) which is inherently neurally and endocrinically otherwise toxic.With 2, you hop on TRT because there is some reason your hormones are not at healthy levels. Whatever the reason is, it is still there, and once you've stopped bandaiding the issue its effects resurface.---I have also used many GLP-1s (semaglutide, tirzepatide, and retatrutide). GLP-1s are good for impulse and behavioral disorders like ADHD, which it did help. However, I have decided to not take it due to the negative effects on personality and reward seeking behavior.They are neuro-active in the brain, and their effects I've decided are not worth it.

Is this just your N=1 or an effect proven in studies? There is an off ramp for TRTs but some people have, “true permanently lowered levels of hormones.”2. My personal experience was that it takes about 2 years for the new 'normal' to kick in. The 'after' period was as taxing as the 'losing' period, but in a different way)At that point only can you 'relax' a bit around your body's cravings for calories.This has already been studied extensively:https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5764193/It's not the worst thing in the world to be on a medication for a couple years rather than a few months, but long-term study of this class of drugs is certainly warranted and necessary.

So weight loss was actually maintained for most people -- the hard part is finding a healthy daily lifestyle which can maintain the drastic effects of GLP1s.This information isn't new -- weight regain has been studied before and I've written about it before:https://glp1.guide/content/do-people-regain-all-the-weight-l...The missing piece to this article is just how bad the alternative is -- never having the cardiovascular and metabolic benefits is clearly not the best strategy (and if simply changing patterns was so easy, people would have done it already).GLP1s don't work for everyone but they're pretty close to miraculous in effect given the balance of positive and negative side effects. Making GLP1s cheaper & more tolerable then figuring out how to actually deal with the complex web of how to keep the weight off sustainably for most people seems like the right way forward here, not avoiding potentially life-saving medication because you may not be able to get off of it as fast as you want (if you can afford it).BTW, there is already generic Liraglutide, and legal workarounds for getting compounded Semaglutide that already mean no one pays the $1000 that was in the zeitgeist a while ago. Even Lilly Direct and similar outfits from Novo sell for $500/month, with the $150/month pricing coming soon[0].

Enabling the average person to control their physical health is orders of magnitude better for society and orders of magnitude less profitable than the current trends.Maybe a setup where glp drugs are nationalized and only used to further understand why we have an obesity epidemic and eventually finance changes to combat it? Ideally the drug makers would do this without requiring government intervention, but I doubt they will.

To be honest, I think a lot of the existing discourse on this topic was just wishful thinking, because before GLP-1s the bottom line was not "some people need a pharmaceutical intervention" but "some people are just gonna be obese and there's nothing we can do to help them". * We don't want the government to forcibly restrict people's food access. * Many people have proposed specific ingredients or nutrient classes that can be adjusted in a person's diet to resolve obesity, but none to date have checked out.In principle, I suppose, there could be some crazy diet hack we don't yet know about.

There does not seem to be any good genetical explanation, there might be cultural based behavioral explanations, but Japanese communities in the US are also more obese than ones in Japan (although less obese than the general US population).So it is clearly entirely possible for a society to have plenty of easily accessible delicious food, with no major government restrictions in place, and not have an obesity crisis. And there seems to be some particularly bad environmental and/or cultural factor in the US driving the abnormally bad obesity epidemic there, and no intervention before GLP-1 has managed to reverse the trend (not that there have been many). There are a lot of theories about this topic, but no clear scientific consensus beyond "all very sweet things are probably maybe bad".PS: I am aware that Japans "fat-tax" exists and is technically a form governement restriction, but I would assume that it plays a relatively minor role overall.

Yes, you can loose weight without it, I did, I'm even in the healthy range now.No, you don't have to, if you need medicine help, take it.When I lost weight, I had my first real job that I liked so much, it didn't felt like one, 11 weeks of vacation per year, a nice enough apartment I couldn't be evicted of, great emotional support and advices and support from a doctor.The only thing draining my willpower every day was the calorie restriction, and nothing else to worry about.If you're in a similar spot I was, maybe trying a diet without glp-1 is better since we don't have any long term study on it yet, but if you're not: obesity will destroy your body more than any long term side effects can. Please take them if you can afford it.The only thing I earned beside uncomfort and pain when I lost weight without drugs are internet points on hacker news, and the ability to say 'i did it' (also glp-1 didn't exist, so less long term health issues from obesity). Weight loss is hard, and not being able to do it without help is not an indictment on you or your character, but on your situation.

These symptoms will be familiar for anyone who has lost weight dieting and then returned to eating junk food. So there appears to be an off-ramp, we just don't know what it is. Calorie restriction works up to a certain point, and weirdly the benefits aren't linear, and almost flat for visceral fat(i.e: if you're using 2.6 kcal a day and eating 2.4 kcal, you will loose roughly the same amount of visceral fat than if you only ate 1.8kcal, and slightly more 'external' fat (that one you shouldn't care much if you're only interested in health)).Calorie expenditure works linearly though, but it's hard to out-exercise your diet, and exercise while obese can be dangerous (my ankles still have to be reinforced despite me being under 24 BMI) Calorie expenditure works linearly though, but it's hard to out-exercise your diet, and exercise while obese can be dangerous (my ankles still have to be reinforced despite me being under 24 BMI) Most medicines aren't permanent cures and obesity results from a variety of factors with lifestyle and diet being major elements.I was seriously obese for decades and about 9 years ago, hovering on the edge of becoming diabetic and other serious obesity-related health issues (high BP, IBS/GERDS, chronic apnea, etc), I decided I had to do something. GLP-1's weren't available then but none of the other typical approaches, including medically supervised diets worked more than a few months. It was hard at first but also remarkably effective. Just like many people do with dieting, keto or any other intervention. But any intervention that works can be an invaluable for the few willing to understand, use it as a tool and do the work.I stayed strict keto for 5 years. Then I started a rigorous process of gradually transitioning away from strict keto over a period of two years and that's also worked. I still eat a pretty low carb diet averaging less than 100g or less a day and will for life because there is no "Eat whatever junk you want and stay fit", at least for my metabolism. Reading that article, the criticisms of GLP-1s would also apply to keto or just "eat less, move more". I suspect GLP-1s could help others in a similar way. Obviously, there is no magic drug that "cures" obesity by making you immune to bad habits and the physics of calories in/calories out.

I guess taking weight loss drugs don't really teach healthy eating habits. You don't say ;-) I lost 50 lbs and have kept it off for the past year while maintaining great BP. But I'm under no illusions GLP-1 medications don't have dangers and cause problems for many. It should be handled on an individual basis like any serious medication.That said, is someone losing a lot of weight then gaining half of it back worse than them just staying where they were? I don't know the answer to that one. That said, is someone losing a lot of weight then gaining half of it back worse than them just staying where they were? I don't know the answer to that one. My wife is back devouring cookies after being on mounjaro for 4 months. Thankfully she lost most weight all by herself so wasn't totally reliant on the medication. I think the intuition many people have--which I am not at all defending as correct, but it certainly isn't so obviously wrong that we should scoff at someone for thinking it works this way--is more like "if my weight was stable before I did this intervention, I just need to lose the weight and then my weight will once again be stable after it"; in this mental model, one would assume you only need lots of willpower to lose weight: after, you only will need as much willpower as you already know you have to not gain it back, as it isn't as if you are gaining weight currently. That's literally the implication of these findings.But one can always hope for a miracle drug that you can take for a bit, then stop, and have its effects last.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Meta's reported deal with Google shows a growing interest in alternative AI hardware, but Nvidia says its platform remains unmatched. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Nvidia has broken its silence following reports that Meta is in advanced discussions to spend billions of dollars on Google's custom Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), a move that would mark a rare shift in the company's AI infrastructure strategy. Nvidia, which saw its stock dip last week as Alphabet's rose, issued a pointed statement in response on Tuesday. “NVIDIA is a generation ahead of the industry — it's the only platform that runs every AI model and does it everywhere computing is done. NVIDIA offers greater performance, versatility, and fungibility than ASICs, which are designed for specific AI frameworks or functions.” While Meta's reported plan involves an initial rental phase and phased purchases starting in 2027, any serious pivot away from Nvidia hardware would reverberate throughout the AI ecosystem. Google's TPU architecture, once used solely in-house, is now part of an aggressive bid to capture hyperscaler business from Nvidia's dominant platform. We're delighted by Google's success — they've made great advances in AI and we continue to supply to Google.NVIDIA is a generation ahead of the industry — it's the only platform that runs every AI model and does it everywhere computing is done.NVIDIA offers greater…November 25, 2025 Google's TPUs are application-specific chips, tuned for high-throughput matrix operations central to large language model training and inference. TPU v5p pods can contain nearly 9,000 chips and are designed to scale efficiently inside Google Cloud's infrastructure. Crucially, Google owns the TPU architecture, instruction set, and software stack. Broadcom also supplies high-speed SerDes, power management, packaging, and handles post-fabrication testing. TPUs are programmed via Google's XLA compiler stack, which serves as the backend for frameworks like JAX and TensorFlow. While the XLA-based approach offers performance portability across CPU, GPU, and TPU targets, it typically requires model developers to adopt specific libraries and compilation patterns tailored to Google's runtime environment. By contrast, Nvidia's stack is broader and more deeply embedded in industry workflows. As a result, moving from CUDA to XLA is no trivial task. Developers must rewrite or re-tune code, manage different performance bottlenecks, and in some cases adopt entirely new frameworks. Meta has internal JAX development and is better positioned than most to experiment, but friction remains a gating factor for wider TPU adoption. According to Reuters, some Google Cloud executives believe the Meta deal could generate revenue equal to as much as 10% of Nvidia's current annual data center business. Hyperscalers like Meta are not new to custom silicon; AWS developed Trainium, Microsoft has Maia, and Google's own TPU efforts date back nearly a decade. What's new is the suggestion that another hyperscaler might shift some training off of Nvidia's platform. Even if only partial, it highlights a desire for second-source resilience and bargaining power. Nvidia's Grace Blackwell architecture will serve to make that kind of migration harder. At the same time, Nvidia is moving deeper into vertical markets where TPUs don't compete. From Jetson edge modules to DGX supercomputers, Nvidia is positioning its stack as the default execution environment for AI inference everywhere, not just for training large models. By exploring alternatives now, Meta potentially gains leverage in future hardware negotiations and insurance against vendor lock-in. Even if Google's TPUs don't replace H100s wholesale — which they likely won't — they could take on selected inference tasks or serve as overflow capacity in peak cycles, especially if the economics are favorable. At this stage, Meta's TPU adoption looks like little more than minor diversification. The company's combination of software tooling, developer lock-in, and general-purpose capability gives it a lead that TPUs can't erase overnight. Google's biggest challenge in all of this is going to be gaining ground from Nvidia. Meta's participation would give TPUs credibility beyond Google Cloud and Anthropic, but scale is only part of the equation. Whether TPUs can meet the needs of complex, evolving AI workflows outside of a tightly controlled environment — and whether more hyperscalers are willing to put their faith in a platform that lives largely within one company's walled garden — still remains to be seen.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Gizmodo's consumer tech team and I reviewed so many products and spent so much time traveling for various gadget-filled conferences our brains are stenciled with images of the latest hardware. Today's amalgamations of books, wood, and cardboard are ingenious—even if you're forced to play them digitally. The board games and role-playing games I've played this past year may offer a richer experience than any AAA video game demanding your attention. I have such rare time for board games and even less opportunity to sit down for a TTRPG (tabletop role-playing game) session with just my friends and me. Holding physical dice in my hand is the best catharsis I can offer from today's screen-obsessed landscape. While Dungeons & Dragons usually sucks up most of the oxygen in the realm of RPGs, the indie tabletop scene is sometimes so niche, there are some games I can recommend that may be hard or impossible to buy if you just wanted to hop on Amazon and send the warehouse workers scrambling. As a gift, you could buy the PDF for the small indie RPG GrimoirePunk—an anarcho-esotric game about using random nouns and verbs to dethrone oligarchal wizards—print it out, and hand it to your friend or loved one, but that may not feel like a gift to some. And why shouldn't you just go out and get a Dungeons & Dragons book or one of the many branded toys or plushies? Because you're looking for something substantive, a gift that says you know the person and what they will enjoy, even if they don't know it yet. Instead, I'm trying to offer a wide variety of different game types so you can get a sense of what's out there and what may set your giftee's heart alight. It's the kind of set made for four players and boils down one of those massive 4X games (itself an abbreviation of explore, expand, exploit, exterminate) like Civilization VI or Stellaris and condenses it into a simple board with a trick-taking game at its heart. For those who don't know what trick-taking means, think Uno, but having the highest card of a suit will win you the “trick.” The base game itself is a tight and still evocative piece of media that will have you scratching your head about how to take a piece of your extrasolar empire and still come out on top. If I have any suggestion, it's that you need to play with the various leader cards to really emphasize different playstyles. Players take on the role of characters you'll remember from the films, but you'll be racing to build up your forces, collect spice, and upgrade alliances in order to beat your opponents in points. There are also several expansions that can add more complexity to the game. However, I feel that Uprising is best on its own, especially if you have not played many board games. Chess shouldn't feel as daunting as it does, especially if you don't know what you're doing beyond the basic rules. Against a more experienced player, every move can feel like the wrong one. The speed of your game slows, and you start to devolve into decision paralysis. Of any of the smart chessboards I've tried, the ChessUp 2 Smart Chess Board doesn't feel nearly as hand-holding or complicated. It offers both in-person and online players the chance to see what kinds of decisions are possible and which may be the better choice. Simply picking up a piece will see the board glow with green, blue, or red spaces to tell players what moves are better or worse. There's a chess clock function built in as well. The chessboard interacts with Chess.com to let you play digital players on a physical board. On the opponent's turn, their move will light up and you simply follow along. This means you can be receiving the digital aid while your opponents struggle along on their lonesome. I'll let the chess community come to that conclusion on their own. At least it can be far less controversial than the whole overblown anal beads chess cheating scandal from 2022. The sun now sets just before I can even leave my office at 5 p.m. So among the stacks of city blocks and slate-gray skies, having a game on hand so full of green is particularly helpful for my mental health. Earthborne Rangers is a cooperative game about exploring, traveling, and aiding the people in a utopian society intrinsically connected with nature. Players build decks for a variety of different classes, then set out into the world to either overcome or harmonize with the surrounding flora and fauna. When other, similar games like Arkham Horror: The Card Game ask you to scrap and scrape for every advantage, Earthborne Rangers begs you to revel in the complicated ways nature may interact with itself. For instance, a wolf-like creature may engage a deer as its next meal, only to be injured in turn by the male buck and his massive head of horns. It also won't scratch the itch of anybody looking for a deeper story and characters with rough edges. Triangle Agency is an RPG about committing to the bit. There's an entire section of the rulebook that is hidden from view—essentially redacted—until the players unlock those abilities as a form of advancement. The main rulebook is beautifully illustrated, and every page has its own unique layout as if ripped from the spiral notebook of some government desk jockey. You can't go into the game without a sense of commitment, but for those who want an RPG whose style is substance, I can't think of another game that does it better. You are also a vampire, coffin-dropped into occupied France. Your mission: kill Hitler and drink all his blood. The players don't have to go through the motions of creating characters for themselves, instead embodying a vampire, each with their own quirks. The game is built upon the “Havoc Engine,” which necessitates players push their luck to do crazier and crazier stunts until it inevitably blows up in their face. I could say more, but just look at the art in that picture above, and you'll get a better idea of this game's style than I could possibly articulate. Fiasco is an absolute classic in roleplaying circles, and I personally think it's a better gateway drug for more story-centric roleplaying games than the crunchy and often obtuse Dungeons & Dragons. Players take on the role of characters who are meant to fail, who have too much ambition and too little impulse control, all leading to their farcical downfall. The end result is often zany and engrossing in equal parts. Players are forced to enact scenes with each other consistently, pushing the normally shy players to try their chops at acting like an utter fool. While I've played the original game plenty, which simply relies on a single book as well as many, many fan-made playsets, the more recent boxed game makes it even simpler to get in through the clever use of cards—no dice needed whatsoever. Another one of Bully Pulpit Games' titles, Desperation, is also a great option with a little less variety for those who prefer gothic, moodier settings than what's provided typically in Fiasco. Kabuto Sumo: Sakura Slam is a so-called “dexterity game” that involves simply pushing small tokens onto a board to topple your opponent players' pieces. Each player picks from one of several odd and charming bug-like characters with wrestler names, like the bat-wielding “Great Bugbino” and “Queen Bee,” which all come with their own special ability and oddly shaped wooden tiles. This is one of those games I recommend to most people who may not be all that interested in board games in the first place. You don't have to complete much complex math, but it still requires a fair bit of critical thinking and high-risk, high-reward play. There are few roleplaying games that make me hungry to play like Mythic Bastionland. Players take on the role of knights, though rarely will you have the option of making a character bedecked in shining plate armor. You're still asked to go on quests of renown for your liege lord, but the glory you may receive is often decided by harsh and bloody combat. Designer Chris McDowell has crafted one of the most interesting games in the indie RPG space, and there's a reason people are still talking about it. No console should make players adjust graphics settings per game to get a good experience. It's hard to get truly excited about ModRetro's M64 when Palmer Luckey is on board. Everything Valve has said paints the Steam Machine as a PC. The demand for AI is making every gadget cost more, whether it's a PC or gaming console.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>So, Taiwan's Iron Dome plan needs to include a few drone zappers. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. It would require around 1,000 to 2,000 specially adapted electronic warfare drones for this hostile act to pay off, reports the South China Morning Post (SCMP). The research, taken in tandem with recent news about China's advanced internet cable-cutting capabilities, ratchets geopolitical and world semiconductor ecosystem tensions even higher. Zhejiang University & Beijing Institute of Technology ran simulations to determine how the CCP-controlled People's Liberation Army (PLA) could deny their democratic foe's access to Starlink. Access to tech like Starlink is just one of the speed bumps that have made Putin's 3-day "Special Operation" extend towards a grueling near-four-year campaign. According to the Chinese scientists, the complex, ever-changing satellite mesh networking coverage provided by Starlink could only be countered by a broad distributed jamming strategy. To reach their unhappy-for-the-PLA conclusion, the scientists used actual Starlink data to create a simulated dynamic satellite mesh the size of Taiwan over 12 hours. A mix of wide and narrow-beam electronic noise-generating jammers featured in the test simulation. Airborne Chinese jammers, situated around 3 to 6 miles apart from each other, could form an effective 12-mile-high internet blocking mesh, it is now thought. Under ideal conditions, a successful Chinese Starlink blockade would require 935 coordinated interference nodes, suggests the research. Of course, hostile blanket drone coverage wouldn't exist unopposed in Taiwan's skies. The ambitious and industrious Silicon Island (and aspiring 'AI island') might even be considering its own Iron Dome-inspired protective network, no doubt further infuriating its neighbor.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Major tech companies aren't just using AI to help you generate or summarize content — they also want you to use it for shopping. Startups like Perplexity, Daydream, and Cherry have also built businesses around AI for product discovery. All these efforts have resulted in customers using more AI for shopping. Onton (previously known as Deft), an AI-powered furniture shopping platform, says it has seen its user base grow from 50,000 monthly active users to over 2 million monthly active users, serving millions of searches and image generations. Fueled by this growth, the startup announced today that it has raised $7.5 million in a new funding round led by Footwork, with participation from Liquid 2, Parable Ventures, and 43, among others. This round brings the startup's total funding to approximately $10 million. Using this funding, the company wants to expand into new categories such as apparel and then eventually consumer electronics. Zach Hudson, co-founder of Onton, says that while large language models (LLMs) are good at guessing probable intent, they have not solved many problems in e-commerce. For its core technology, the company uses what's called neuro-symbolic architecture. He added that the startup's model can also learn information from the real world that might not necessarily be included in a product description. “Let's say you are looking for furniture that is pet-friendly. Our tools learn these things through every single search and become smarter at a faster rate,” Hudson said. He added that often, when you search for a product that might be called different things on different sites, you don't get great results. The company's AI model takes those scenarios into consideration while presenting results. You can also add images of your room and ask the tool to furnish it. The startup said that with these approaches, it has been able to convert customers 3-5x more than traditional e-commerce sites, as they can trust the underlying data. In this category, it will face competition from companies like Daydream, Aesthetic, and Style.ai.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Among other things, this has involved ordering rollbacks of clean water regulations and opening up public lands to coal mining. The announcement is part of a sweeping set of overhauls pushed by the Trump administration following several executive orders related to AI and a White House AI Action Plan, both rolled out in July. The Action Plan was formed after soliciting more than 10,000 public comments, which included hundreds from industry interests. These actions, the White House has said, will usher in a “golden age for American manufacturing and technological dominance.” “In previous administrations, political people stayed out of [chemical regulation]—they tried to let science win. September's announcement was part of a larger push to expedite new chemical reviews at the EPA. Clearing out that backlog has been a priority of Trump's second-term EPA. Helping to lead that charge at the agency are several former chemical industry executives, lobbyists, and lawyers. “We inherited a massive backlog of new chemical reviews from the Biden Administration which is getting in the way of projects as it pertains to data center and artificial intelligence projects,” EPA administrator Lee Zeldin said in a statement. “No part of the new chemicals review process will be skipped or bypassed for chemicals that meet the criteria for data center or covered component projects,” agency press secretary Brigit Hirsch said in an email. “There are some really big loopholes in here to get chemicals through,” Schweer says. “If you've got some friend at the Department of Defense or the Department of Commerce, all you have to do is get that person to send a letter saying, ‘This is a qualifying project.' Experts tell WIRED that physical data centers themselves are unlikely to be a major source of chemical applications under this new policy. Walter Leclerc, an independent health and safety consultant to the data center industry, points out that many of the chemicals currently used in data centers are already used in a variety of other industries. Most of those chemicals, including lubricants, fire suppressants, and water treatment chemicals, are not specific to data centers—they “are no different from [what's used in] Suzie and John's industrial business.” he says. But there is one area of data center development where newer chemicals might be game changers. Keeping the equipment inside data centers cool is a huge component of their operating costs. One technique that can help cut these costs, called immersion cooling, involves dunking server racks and other machinery in a special liquid that does not conduct electricity. These cooling techniques can reduce the need for fans, pumps, and other equipment, and can save data centers a lot of money in the long run on their electricity bills. The market for specialty cooling liquids for data centers has skyrocketed in recent years, with big names like Exxon and Shell getting into the game. Some of the substances used in two-phase immersion cooling largely contain fluorine and carbon, which help create types of per- and polyfluoroalkyl chemicals (PFAS). They have also been subject to increased regulation in recent years, with the EU proposing working towards what could be a particularly strict ban on PFAS. Several US states are also moving to restrict or eliminate the chemicals. (While the Trump administration has said that PFAS regulation is a priority, it has begun to roll back some Biden-era rules on some of these chemicals.) Some bigger companies seem well aware of the risks of using forever chemicals in their cooling systems—especially following legal battles and settlements that have hurt PFAS producers like 3M, which has pledged to discontinue manufacturing and using PFAS this year. While Microsoft has touted its research into two-phase cooling in the past, including a hyped-up pilot project at a data center in Washington, Microsoft spokesperson Donna Whitehead told WIRED that the company “is not currently using immersion cooling technologies in [its] data center operations.” Companies like Exxon and Shell, meanwhile, take care to advertise their cooling liquids—which are not used in two-phase cooling—as “PFAS-free.” After developing a line of products that uses fluids containing fluoride, hydrogen, and carbon, which can be types of PFAS, Chemours collaborated with Samsung to test one liquid's performance earlier this year. In August the Delaware-based company said that “testing for subsequent generations will begin in the months ahead.” (While the chemical compounds being used in these products have not been linked to specific health effects, some scientists are concerned about forever chemicals as a larger class.) Chemours has emphasized in its sustainability reports that these fluids could help reduce the energy needed to cool data centers by up to 90 percent. The company, along with DuPont and other chemical companies, still faces a number of multinational lawsuits from cities, counties, and states over pollution from PFAS production. In response to questions on its two-phase cooling products from WIRED, including whether or not the company planned to submit chemicals for fast-tracked consideration under the administration's new data center exemption, Chemours spokesperson Cassie Olszewski said the company is “in the process of commercializing our two-phase immersion cooling fluid, which will require relevant regulatory approvals.” “Our work in this area has been focused on developing more sustainable and efficient cooling solutions that would allow data centers to consume less energy, water, and footprint while effectively managing the increasing amount of heat generated by the next generation of chips with higher processing power,” Olszewski said. These chips could also be a significant source of new chemicals. Schweer says that in his last few years working at the EPA, this industry submitted a large number of applications for new chemicals. Kalmuss-Katz says that semiconductor manufacturers “are a main driver of new chemicals.” In March, Nancy Beck, a former policy director for an industry lobbyist group who now leads the Office of Chemical Safety and Pollution Prevention, the office that oversees new chemical reviews, met with representatives from SEMI, a global advocacy organization for the industry. ("The Trump EPA encourages stakeholders to submit and document their comments on proposed rules so that we get a diverse array of perspectives," says Hirsch, the EPA spokesperson.) Both this summer's AI executive orders and the EPA's new policy open the door to fast-track chemicals far beyond those used only, or even primarily, within data centers. This, experts tell WIRED, could enable a wide variety of companies to try and get approval for their new products by linking them to data center construction. But they both expressed concerns about the new data center policy. Making it quicker and easier for chemicals to go through the EPA is “a pro-growth move,” Leclerc says.
