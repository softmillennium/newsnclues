If you buy through our links, we may get a commission. Meet up with the Winchester boys, Crowley and Lucifer at a new streaming spot. Supernatural, the hit monster-hunting show that ran on the WB and later on the CW for 15 seasons, has been a reliable Netflix mainstay for over a decade. Supernatural on Netflix is one of those instances when you don't truly appreciate what you have until it's taken away. Luckily, it won't be off streaming for long: It's been confirmed that all 15 seasons will drop on Peacock just five days later, on Dec. 22. In the meantime, you can certainly try to watch all 327 episodes before they leave Netflix, but that will require you to watch about 11 per day every day (factoring in time for sleep and a few hours of work, if you can muster the strength). Don't miss any of our unbiased tech content and lab-based reviews. Add CNET as a preferred Google source. Though there isn't one available at the moment for Peacock, we encourage you to stay on the lookout for Black Friday streaming service deals this week. However, there are other ways to get Peacock Premium at no -- or low -- cost if you're savvy.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Credits: Pepe López (Astroalcoy) with Celestron CGE Pro Science is thrilling, especially when it relates to the universe. The first thing they do when they find an extraterrestrial subject of this sort is to examine the globular clusters and stars. Just recently, another research was conducted on this galaxy, and the mystery that seemed hidden has now been solved. Recall that the Milky Way is equivalent to a billion solar masses. This UFO-shaped galaxy came into the limelight when NASA found that it consists of more dark matter, more than usual, making it 99.9% invisible. Scientists further discovered that the galaxy had fewer stars, such that it could go berserk if something wasn't holding it together. Scientists found that the dark matter content in DF44 is much less than when it was first observed. While it competes with the size of the Milky Way, this galaxy only has a hundred million stars compared to the Milky Way's hundred thousand million stars. This estimation affirms that the former is a thousand times fewer. The group of astronomers suggested that it would have been quite a subject of attraction with 100 times as much dark matter as expected from the number of its stars, like this mysterious glowing frozen young star discovery. It was further noted that the total number of globular clusters is around 20, and the ratio of dark matter to luminous matter is 300 to 1. The updated analysis confirmed that the galaxy holds an ideal number of clusters that any normal galaxy should have. While a previous study referred to Dragonfly44 as anomalous, a recent study emerged, eradicating errors and confirming that the dark matter content is much less than earlier findings. Other participants include scientists from the Instituto de Astrofísícal de Canarias (IAC) and the University of La Laguna (ULL). Kudos to Ignacio Trujillo and Michael A. Beasly, IAC researchers and co-authors of the study, for their commitment to analyzing the dark matter and stars within the galaxy. Let's not forget that the dark matter of a galaxy can be determined by measuring the number of globular clusters in it. It is now left for NASA to further research new galaxies and their composition, leading to this ejected supermassive black hole, racing through space.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Was an alien space craft hovering over New England this week? On Tuesday, a huge funnel-like cloud was spotted above Mount Washington in New Hampshire. The fluffy formation looked like a tube ready to vacuum New England's highest peak up into the clouds. Though the massive mountain stayed right where it was, that cloud formation didn't stick around for too long. Though I certainly remember learning about cumulus and nimbus clouds back in school science class, the lenticular cloud probably never came up. Perhaps that's because these clouds pretty much only form over mountains and need very specific conditions to stick around. Lenticular clouds form as moist air is pushed up over a mountain, then cools into a cloud as it hits cooler air higher up. Air around a lenticular cloud is actually pretty turbulent, helping to create the circular stacks of clouds that resemble UFOs. They're also good indicators of air patches that could be dangerous to aircraft. So not only did this particular cloud over Mount Washington give us all an amazing site to see, it also gave local pilots a heads up about flying over the 6,288 foot peak.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Is 3I/ATLAS a technological artifact long forgotten by one of our cosmic neighbors? Or is it just a playful icy rock trynna tease us with its un-comet like property, while being one, just a distant cousin with tantrums? From its epileptic path to chemical composition with abundance of nickel, and alleged non-gravitational acceleration, there are 13 anomalies with six major ones, highlighted by Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb. More recently, proponents of UAPs as alien spacecraft have appeared before the U.S. Congress, confidently claiming that they know people who have seen and even touched aliens and/or their spaceships, back-engineered their technologies, and even communicated with the aliens. Yet when pushed for evidence, they always demur, saying that it's “classified” or “top-secret,” that Men-in-Black threatened them into silence, that their careers and even their lives are at stake if they disclose said evidence, that they could only reveal the evidence in a “SCIF” (Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility) but not in Congress, and that many people in the U.S. government, CIA, FBI, NSA, etc. (never named) have this information and evidence of alien visitation. Given that there are billions of Earth-Sun analogs in the Milky Way galaxy—most of which are billions of years older than the solar system—and that it will take less than a billion years for our Voyager spacecraft to cross the Milky Way disk, we must engage in the scientific search for extraterrestrial technological artifacts. He further suggests that the seeker community at large must keep their eyes, hearts, and minds open. This is why I am engaged in the search with the hope that we will find a partner on our blind date with interstellar objects.

                </div>
                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>For decades, America's intelligence agencies have treated the public like background noise, a nuisance to be managed, not a nation to be informed. They reveal a government culture that has grown accustomed to lying, concealment, and contempt for the very people it serves. And after the latest disclosures, hearings, whistle-blower accounts, and forced transparency laws, it's impossible to pretend this is about “national security.” What's unfolding is a betrayal of democracy on a constitutional scale. “There comes a point where secrecy is no longer protection — it's sabotage.” The Pentagon, CIA, and FBI have crossed that line so many times it's practically policy. They buried the truth about a global sex trafficking network connected to Jeffrey Epstein. They buried evidence and testimony about unidentified aerial phenomena that could reshape science itself. They buried intelligence from presidents and Congress. And they expect the public to just swallow it all, quietly, forever. This country didn't become the world's powerhouse through fear and gatekeeping. But that philosophy stopped at the doors of the intelligence community and the damage that wall of secrecy has done is becoming impossible to ignore. A convenient narrative, considering the sheer number of powerful people who orbited his operation for years. After everything we now know about the scope, scale, and structure of Epstein's criminal network, the idea that he acted alone isn't just absurd — it's insulting. Federal agencies had warnings for decades. They had flight logs and financial records showing Epstein moving between global power centers like he was running an intelligence operation. And still, the FBI let him walk free for years. When he was finally prosecuted the first time, they negotiated a secret non-prosecution deal so grotesque it read like a ransom note written by privilege itself. Only now, under overwhelming public pressure, has the government been forced to release the Epstein files. Congress had to pass a law compelling the DOJ to hand over documents the FBI should have made public a decade ago. And even now, officials are already hinting that “ongoing investigations” may justify redactions. Americans have heard that excuse before. What makes this cover-up even darker is the geopolitical angle nobody in the intelligence community wants to talk about. Epstein's closest partners, business ties, and funding channels raise questions that intersect with foreign intelligence, questions federal agencies have every incentive to keep buried. If they're shielding a foreign ally's involvement in an international trafficking operation, that's not national security. “When the system protects predators instead of victims, it's no longer a justice system, it's a cartel.” Then there's the other scandal, the one that has nothing to do with billionaires on private jets and everything to do with the nature of existence itself. Now they're a policy crisis, a national security gridlock, and a scientific black hole all because the Pentagon and intelligence agencies buried evidence for generations. For years, pilots, engineers, scientists, and military officers reported craft doing things that break known physics: zero propulsion signatures, instant acceleration, sudden directional changes, transmedium capabilities. It's the product of decades of whistle-blower frustration, men and women inside the system who saw extraordinary materials, extraordinary craft, and extraordinary evidence locked away in private vaults owned by defense contractors and shielded from elected oversight. These were program leads, scientists, pilots, colonels, analysts. Now, whistle-blowers say entire divisions of government ran retrieval programs without briefing presidents, Congress, or inspectors general. And hiding technological breakthroughs from the scientific community isn't protection, it's the sabotage of human progress. “You don't beat China by hiding physics from your own scientists.” Every time the government classifies discovery instead of sharing it with the scientific world, it hobbles innovation. It hands adversaries a head start. And the agencies who claim otherwise are lying to cover their own failures and wishes. If the Pentagon or CIA truly kept UAP programs off presidential briefings, that is a constitutional crisis. And if Congress has been systematically misled about Epstein connections, UAP recoveries, black-budget programs, or the private-sector handling of recovered materials? Then we are no longer living in a functioning democratic republic. We are living under a self-appointed clerical class, a priesthood of secrets accountable to nobody. These agencies have forgotten who their employer is. It's not a classified chain of command. We are now at the breaking point. The United States cannot claim moral leadership while sheltering predators, lying to Congress, and gatekeeping science that could reshape energy, transportation, defense, and medicine. This level of secrecy is not protection. And it is destroying trust at a rate the government cannot repair. The UAP scandal exposes its structural rot. Combined, they expose institutional decay that no democracy can survive without major surgery. This is where the conversation has to go next: legislation, not outrage. Criminal penalties for withholding information from Congress. Declassification deadlines that can't be gamed or delayed. The Pentagon, CIA, and FBI don't need more power. Because the American people aren't children. They are the owners of this country. And it's long past time the agencies remember that. A cartel of secrecy embedded so deeply into the Pentagon, CIA, FBI, and their contractor ecosystem that it now operates independently of elected authority. And if America wants to remain a functioning democracy capable of leading the world, that bloc must be broken by law, by force of oversight, and by a public that finally sees through the myth that secrecy is strength. “A government that hides truth from its own people is not guarding the nation — it's guarding itself.” The era of blind deference must end. The U.S. classification regime was designed for wartime secrets like troop movements, operational plans, cryptography, the stuff that could get Americans killed if leaked. But over the past 60 years, that system metastasized into a catch-all cloak for bureaucratic embarrassment, agency mistakes, political damage, technological breakthroughs, and, in the Epstein case, evidence implicating the powerful. Information stays classified not because it protects the nation, but because it protects institutions. And nowhere is that clearer than in the two scandals now defining our era: • The Epstein network: where agencies hid evidence rather than expose who enabled it.• The UAP programs: where agencies hid discoveries that could change physics rather than risk accountability. Every successful reform movement in U.S. history started by changing the rules of power. Today's rules allow intelligence agencies to unilaterally decide what the public is allowed to know, with no timeline, no accountability, and no external review. • Ban classification to avoid embarrassment or political damage.If it protects institutions instead of the nation, it cannot be classified. • Force automatic declassification deadlines.No document should outlive its relevance by 40 years simply because some bureaucrat enjoyed the power of hiding it. • Require civilian oversight boards with subpoena power.Not dependent on appointments from the very agencies they're meant to police. • Criminalize deliberate misclassification.If you hide evidence of crimes or hide breakthroughs from elected leaders, you go to prison. • Give Congress real-time access to any program, no exceptions.If a senator can't get briefed on a program funded by taxpayers, that program is unconstitutional by definition. This is how you dismantle a secrecy cartel, by removing the legal shield it hides behind. Whistle-blower testimony in the UAP arena revealed something that should terrify every American: retrieval programs and materials allegedly hidden from multiple presidents. Unelected government employees decided the Commander-in-Chief wasn't “ready” or “qualified” to know certain information. At that point, the presidency becomes symbolic, not sovereign. If any program is deemed too “sensitive” to brief the president, that program should be shut down immediately and its leadership removed. Anything else is a coup in slow motion. “If contractors and mid-level officials decide what the president can know, we don't have a democracy — we have a managed illusion of one.” Defense firms are essential for national security, but they cannot be the custodians of the most sensitive knowledge ever recovered. If non-human technology exists, no corporation should own the file cabinets. Congress must pass laws requiring that all recovered materials, analysis, and historical archives be transferred to: • A federal scientific review board• Independent physicists• Publicly accountable agencies America cannot let corporations privatize the universe. If America cannot tell the truth about who enabled, funded, protected, and participated in an international trafficking operation, then the rule of law has collapsed. And it must do so without hiding behind “ongoing investigations” or “foreign intelligence relationships.” If a foreign ally was involved, the American people deserve to know. If billionaires were involved, the American people deserve to know. If intelligence agencies used Epstein for operations, the American people deserve to know. This nation cannot move forward with a justice system that protects predators and punishes the truth. One of the most urgent reforms America needs is also the simplest: when the government encounters a craft, material, or biological sample of unknown origin, the public deserves a documented, accountable process, not silence, not rumors, and certainly not a handoff to defense contractors who operate outside democratic oversight. A modern republic cannot function when its most consequential discoveries are locked behind doors never opened to Congress or independent scientists. Under a reformed system, discoveries of unknown origin would trigger immediate, mandatory notification to both branches of civilian oversight, elected lawmakers and an independent scientific review board. The era of secret vaults and buried evidence must end. A democracy cannot afford to let a small circle of insiders decide what humanity is allowed to know about the universe. We have likely lost time on propulsion breakthroughs, advanced materials, energy systems, and technologies that could reshape the entire global balance. The idea that locking this knowledge away somehow “protects” the public is not just wrong — it is dangerous. You do not win the future by handcuffing your own researchers. In today's system, when officials lie to Congress, withhold documents, destroy evidence, or bury programs, the consequences are laughably small. That culture must be torn out by the roots. Real reform requires criminal accountability, not symbolic reprimands or internal memos. Intelligence obstruction should carry mandatory prison time, not comfortable pension packages. Any official who lies to Congress, manipulates classification to hide wrongdoing, or blocks lawful oversight must face real penalties. And the contractor class cannot be immune, either. If a private company conceals evidence, alters records, or interferes with a congressional inquiry, they should face the same penalties federal employees do. The oversight system must treat contractors not as privileged partners but as extensions of government authority and therefore subject to the same scrutiny. An intelligence bureaucracy that fears no punishment is a bureaucracy that fears nothing at all. And definitely not the bureaucrats who've built careers on deciding what the public is “ready” to know. Transparency is not a favor the government grants when it feels generous. It is the operating system of a free nation. Reform begins by reclaiming that foundation. It requires laws that force disclosure, systems that mandate oversight, and a cultural shift inside the intelligence world that makes truth the rule rather than the enemy. It means scientific transparency where secrecy once lived. It means presidents receiving full briefings without interference. It means Congress having real authority again, not ceremonial access. Most importantly, it means returning ownership of information to the public. This is how America leads again, not by hiding reality but by confronting it openly, boldly, and with the confidence that built the nation in the first place. A country that trusts its people will always out-innovate, out-perform, and out-imagine every adversary on Earth. And it will do so without the cancer of secrecy eating away at its core.

Not only are you no longer seen as crazy by the masses, but it almost appears as if it has never been cooler to have had contact with an other worldly life force. Now, one woman is offering a "safe space' for people to discuss their alien encounters. What started off as a small in-person meeting at her public library has now spread across the globe. Rather than meeting with just a few people at the library," she now has a mailing list of thousands — some beaming in from as far as Japan and New Zealand." After sharing her experience, she found others who also had unique experiences with the extraterrestrial. People in her weekly groups can have a "safe space to recount their abductions, telepathic visions from beyond, and other celestial come-to-Jesus moments." While they may not be readily believed outside of this group, within the confines of the Zoom meeting, all alien encounters are listened to with respect. This interstellar object has caused a lot of speculation, leading many people to argue that it could be connected to the estraterretrial. Luckily for all the believers out there, this alien encounter group provides them with the space to discuss it openly and without judgment. Each person in the group claims to have had some sort of contact with aliens. One man claims to have been working with them since he was 14 years old. Additionally, a woman shared how she enjoys the group because it allows her to open up about this topic.</p>
