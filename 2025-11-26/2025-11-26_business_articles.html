Crypto:

Bitcoin climbed above $90,000 for the first time in almost a week, clawing back ground after a more than a month-long selloff, as a broad rally in risk assets and easing volatility gave traders room to push higher.

The advance, though modest, put higher levels back in focus, with digital assets moving in step with equities amid growing conviction that the Federal Reserve may soon resume cutting interest rates. BlackRock's US Bitcoin ETF attracted fresh inflows, snapping a streak of redemptions. Liquidity remains thin ahead of the Thanksgiving break, but with volatility ebbing — and little evidence of fresh forced selling — bulls appear to be testing whether the worst of the drawdown has passed.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Drug pricing has emerged as a key topic to watch for pharmaceutical companies and investors in 2025. As President Donald Trump pushes for lower medicine prices for Americans, the sector is facing additional pricing pressure from a Biden-era law called the Inflation Reduction Act. It's now making waves also across the Atlantic. A number of European companies have announced sizeable U.S. investments to placate Trump and his aggressive tariff agenda, while AstraZeneca is moving toward another direct listing on the NYSE to tap into the deeper pockets of U.S. capital markets. Meanwhile, Novo Nordisk has cited a failure to deal with changes in the U.S. market as part of the reason for recent leadership changes. Late Tuesday, the CMS announced newly negotiated prices for 15 blockbuster drugs from 2027, including Novo Nordisk's mega bestseller Ozempic which will see a 71% discount to its list price. Among other European pharma giants, AstraZeneca's cancer drug Calquence will face a 40% discount, while GSK's lung disease medicines Trelegy and Breo with 73% and 83% discount, respectively. Overall, discounts ranged between 38% and 85%, with estimated savings of about $8.5 billion, 36% lower than recent annual spending. "Whether through the Inflation Reduction Act or President Trump's Most Favored Nation policy, this is what serious, fair, and disciplined negotiation looks like," said CMS Deputy Administrator Chris Klomp in a statement. A GSK spokesperson said they were pleased with the agreement. "We continue to have serious concerns about the Inflation Reduction Act's impact on patients and remain opposed to government price setting," a spokesperson told CNBC in emailed comments. "We have seen that government price setting has not translated to lower out-of-pocket costs for patients and can lead to a loss of coverage for medications and higher insurance premiums," they added. The U.S. is a key market for most large-cap pharma companies, mostly due to the significantly higher prices for branded medicines. Prescription drug prices are about three times higher in the U.S. compared to other wealthy countries, a 2024 report by RAND found. "The [IRA price] cuts were a little higher than last year, which I think people were expecting," Barclays analyst Emily Field told CNBC. "It doesn't seem like there was any surprises at all," she added. AstraZeneca and GSK rose less than 1% each in afternoon trading. That said, Medicare plans already get large discounts on companies' list prices, but those rates aren't typically disclosed. The IRA price negotiations are, however, not the main concern for companies, Field said, noting how it's becoming a better-understood and predictable process. "What people are much more worried about is further directions that MFN could go… if they decide to do something different," she said. Trump has made it a priority to rein in U.S. drug costs and in May, signed an executive order to implement so-called Most Favored Nation pricing, meaning U.S. prices would be tied to lower ones paid abroad. Lower prices in the U.S. could have a dramatic effect on companies' top and bottom lines, but companies are finding ways to mitigate the impact by making deals with the Trump administration to voluntarily lower certain prices, as well as pledge investments in U.S. manufacturing to avoid tariffs. Earlier this month, Trump announced deals with Novo and rival Eli Lilly to slash prices of weight loss drugs for Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries in 2026, as well as offering them directly to consumers at a discount through the TrumpRx.gov website. Under the agreement, starting doses of Novo's Wegovy and Lilly's Zepbound will be $350 per month and trend down to $245 per month over a two years. While reduced pricing will hit sales, volume gains from opening up broad access for obesity drugs could offset that headwind, BMO analysts noted. Last week, Novo also announced it is lowering prices of Ozempic and Wegovy to $349 per month from $499 for patients paying out-of-pocket, following pressure from Trump. Other companies including AstraZeneca and U.S.-based Pfizer have also announced deals with the Trump administration to cut drug prices.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A judge in Georgia on Wednesday dismissed the historic racketeering case brought against President Donald Trump over his efforts to overturn his loss in the state's 2020 election. The ruling by Fulton County Superior Court Judge Scott McAfee, who ordered the case "dismissed in its entirety," draws to a close the final criminal case against Trump that remained unresolved after he won back the White House in 2024. McAfee's ruling came shortly after state prosecutor Peter Skandalakis moved to drop the case against Trump and his remaining co-defendants "to serve the interests of justice and promote judicial finality." "In my professional judgment, the citizens of Georgia are not served by pursuing this case in full for another five to ten years," Skandalakis wrote in a court filing. Steve Sadow, Trump's lead attorney in the case, said in a statement to CNBC, "The political persecution of President Trump by disqualified [Fulton County District Attorney] Fani Willis is finally over." "This case should never have been brought. A fair and impartial prosecutor has put an end to this lawfare," Sadow said. The case brought by Willis initially charged Trump with 13 criminal counts, including the serious charge of violating Georgia's powerful anti-racketeering law. The indictment, returned by a grand jury in August 2023, alleged that Trump and numerous co-defendants — including his former lawyers Rudy Giuliani and John Eastman, and former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows — illegally tried to reverse Joe Biden's victory in the state's 2020 presidential contest. The case was once seen as one of the biggest threats to the GOP leader, who was already grappling with a torrent of other criminal indictments and civil lawsuits. It also produced one of the most striking images in recent U.S. political history: a mugshot of the president, who was forced to travel to Fulton County jail to be booked on the state charges. But the case ran into major problems long before Trump's reelection in 2024 effectively put it on ice. In September 2024, McAfee tossed out two of the criminal counts against Trump and some of his co-defendants, though he kept the top charges intact. She defended herself in dramatic courtroom testimony against the allegations of impropriety, but was ultimately disqualified from the case in December 2024. The Georgia Supreme Court declined to hear Willis' appeal. The case was eventually handed to Skandalakis on Nov. 14, less than two weeks before he asked McAfee to dismiss it. "Never before, and hopefully never again, will our country face circumstances such as these," he wrote in the motion for what is known as a "nolle prosequi." He noted that the prospect of bringing the case against Trump to trial would take years, as there is "no realistic prospect that a sitting President will be compelled to appear" in court and it would be "impossible" to quickly proceed after he leaves office in 2029. "Some may argue that cases against the campaign attorneys and advisors should proceed even if President Trump is removed from the indictment," Skandalakis wrote. The Prosecuting Attorneys' Council of Georgia also lacks the resources to conduct multiple trials, according to Skandalakis. "Continuing this litigation under these circumstances would neither serve the citizens of Georgia nor fulfill our statutory obligations." Despite asking for the case to be closed, Skandalakis suggested that the efforts by Trump and his allies to to overturn the 2020 election, in Georgia and elsewhere, were serious. "As I have previously stated, contesting an election is not unlawful," he wrote. But he acknowledged that former special counsel Jack Smith, who had pursued federal election interference charges against Trump, was forced to drop his case after the Supreme Court strengthened immunity powers for former presidents, and after Trump won reelection.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This was CNBC's live blog covering the 2025 Autumn Budget. Startup leaders are responding positively to tax breaks for employees and investors unveiled by Finance Minister Rachel Reeves in the budget. "This Budget shows that the government has seriously listened to founders and tried to make things better to build and scale a startup in the UK," Dom Hallas, executive director of lobby group Startup Coalition, told CNBC. "Big progress on expanding share options, doubling the scale of the enterprise investment and venture capital trust schemes to back scaleups, and looking again at how entrepreneurs are incentivised in our tax system will make a material difference to founders building today and in the future." Measures announced by Reeves include doubling the annual limits of venture capital schemes — which allow tax breaks for investors in early-stage startups. "Through EMI reform, today's budget has delivered meaningful change for Britain's startups," said Hannah Seal, partner at Index Ventures. "It will now be easier for companies to attract, retain and reward the talent they need to scale and compete globally — especially critical in an AI-first world where talent costs and capital requirements are higher than ever." In a briefing immediately following Rachel Reeves' Autumn Budget, Rigby said the chancellor is aiming to deal with the root causes of the U.K.'s productivity challenge, which data showed would reduce revenues by some £16 billion. This includes "historic" levels of underinvestment, Rigby said, adding that the government is focused on creating conditions for future growth, highlighting the approval of key infrastructure projects in nuclear and AI. Separately, Rigby also expects today's measures around savings and listings would help the U.K. "break out" of its aversion to retail investment. She acknowledged this remains the lowest level out of all G7 nations, adding that changes to listings and prospectuses would help "turbo charge" the London stock market. "Today's U.K. Budget has not derailed Morningstar Wealth's broadly positive outlook for the U.K. equity and bond markets," he said in an email. "Significant focus has been on the U.K. economy's fiscal headroom and the improvement here, based on today's OBR forecasts, is encouraging." He added that moderating U.K. inflation means gilt yields are likely to continue their downward trajectory "once the dust settles from the budget." "However, the U.K. dividend tax hike — which impacts our home market more than others given its higher payouts — is a clear disincentive for stocks and there was no mention of specific U.K. equity incentives within ISAs," Preskett said. "High government debt and political flip-flopping has weighed on U.K. gilts this year," Benjamin Jones, global head of research at the investment firm, said in an email. "[But] we believe this budget has provided enough to ease those fears a little." Gilt yields were volatile before and during Reeves' budget announcement, with the yield on the benchmark 10-year gilt last seen trading almost 6 basis points lower while yields on 30-year gilts fell by 10 basis points. "With yields in the U.K. higher than many other developed markets and the Bank of England now having more reasons to cut, we think that gilt yields across the curve will fall," Jones said. Reeves delivers 'historic' tax raising measures: Sanjay Raja, chief U.K. economist at Deutsche Bank, said the budget delivered "historic" tax raising measures — and noted that Reeves was left with "larger headroom than anyone expected going into this forecast." On top of that, many of these new measures won't take effect immediately, further weakening confidence in their impact." "As a result, financial markets are likely to stay uneasy, at least until the government sets out a more convincing and reliable tax plan." OBR error a 'fitting end' to weeks of leaked budget detail:"The entire contents of the Budget being accidentally published by the OBR was perhaps a fitting end to the most leaked fiscal event in living memory," Tom Selby, director of public policy at AJ Bell, said Wednesday. Kemi Badenoch, the leader of the opposition Conservative Party, has slammed Chancellor Rachel Reeves' Autumn Budget, calling it a "total humiliation." As for the budget statement, which contained a raft of smaller rather than headline tax rises, Badenoch described it as a "smorgasbord of misery." "Last year she put up taxes by £40 billion, the biggest tax raid in British history. She told everyone that from now on, there would be stability and she would pay for everything with growth," Badenoch said, addressing lawmakers in the House of Commons. "Today she has broken every single one of those promises. Of course, Chancellor Rachel Reeves didn't call her new "High Value Council Tax Surcharge" a "mansion tax" but that's what it's been dubbed by the media and markets. Essentially, the "surcharge" amounts to £2,500 for properties worth more than £2 million and £7,500 for properties worth more than £5 million. Telling lawmakers that she was taking further steps to "deal with a longstanding source of wealth inequality in our country," Reeves said: "Currently, a Band D home in Darlington or Blackpool pays just under £2,400 in Council Tax … nearly £300 more than a £10 million mansion in Mayfair," she said, referring to one of London's most prestigious areas. "And so from 2028, I am introducing the High Value Council Tax Surcharge in England ... This will be collected alongside Council Tax, levied on owners," she said. This new surcharge will raise over £400 million by 2031 and will be charged on fewer than the top 1% of properties, Reeves added. U.K. wealth management firms advanced on Wednesday amid a flurry of tax announcements. St James's Place moved 4.6% higher, AJ Bell advanced 3.4%, and IG Group gained 8.5%. Reeves confirmed a £2,000 cap on salary sacrifice pension contributions will be introduced from 2029. "Reliefs in our tax system cost the taxpayer billions of pounds every year, but many of them no longer serve their original purpose," she said. Reeves said tax breaks on salary sacrifice pension schemes are forecast to cost £8 billion by 2030, "with the greatest benefit going to higher earners … while those on the minimum wage or whose employers don't offer salary sacrifice don't benefit at all." "This is not sustainable for the public finances," she said. "That is a pragmatic step so that people, especially on low and middle incomes, can continue to use salary sacrifice for their pension without paying any more tax than they do now." Spending policies, including removing the so-called two-child limit for welfare claimants, are expected to increase borrowing by £11 billion in 2029-30, according to the OBR's forecast. The chancellor unveiled plans to widen eligibility for enterprise incentives, including expanding the enterprise management incentive — which offers tax incentives to employees in smaller, high-risk companies — so more companies can offer tax-relieved share options. The finance minister also said she plans to "re-engineer" enterprise investment and venture capital trust (VCT) schemes — which provide tax relief for investors in early-stage startups. There will also be tax breaks for companies that choose to list in the UK. Reeves said new listings will get a three-year exemption from stamp duty reserve tax. Reeves is set to announce a bevy of welfare measures, according to the OBR's unexpectedly released forecast, with a combined cost of £9 billion in 2029-30. These include the reversals to previously announced cuts to winter fuel payments and health-related benefits, which will cost £7 billion in 2029-30. "The U.K. Budget offers little relief for homebuilders," Jack Fletcher-Price, equity analyst at Morningstar, told CNBC via email. "On the proposed mansion tax, if it's scheduled for 2028, we expect the Conservatives and Reform to pledge its abolition at the next general election - making it unlikely to ever come into effect," Fletcher-Price added. The problem is, we already know what's in it after the Office for Budget Responsibility published its assessment of Reeves' latest policies, and its U.K. economic outlook early, in error. She's begun her address stating that the OBR's release was "deeply disappointing" and a "serious error" on their part. It said: "A link to our Economic and fiscal outlook document went live on our website too early this morning. It said it would be reporting to its Oversight Board, the Treasury, and the Commons Treasury Committee on how this happened and, "will make sure this does not happen again." The OBR said its economic and fiscal outlook and supporting documents would be released (or re-released) when the chancellor has finished her speech. The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) has given markets a surprise by publishing its forecasts for the public finances and the economy before Chancellor Rachel Reeves has unveiled her Autumn Budget, which will take place at 12.30 p.m. The OBR report, which appears to have been published early in error, states that the U.K. economy is forecast to grow by 1.5% on average over the forecast [period], 0.3 percentage points slower than we projected in March, due to lower underlying productivity growth." As for the Autumn Budget, the OBR said tax rises set to be outlined by Reeves would raise £26.1 billion by 2029-2030, the end of this parliamentary term, "through freezing personal tax thresholds and a host of smaller measures." U.K. government borrowing costs fell on Wednesday after the country's Office for Budget Responsibility unexpectedly released its economic and fiscal forecasts ahead of the Autumn Budget. Yields on the benchmark 10-year gilt were last seen 4 basis points higher at 4.535%, after falling as much 4 basis points following the release. The OBR was scheduled to publish its forecasts following the budget, which Finance Minister Rachel Reeves will deliver in parliament at 12:30 p.m. London time (7:30 a.m. Read more on this developing story here: UK government borrowing costs seesaw as official economic forecasts released early It's been a longer-than-usual wait this year, with budgets usually delivered in late October. We've also had so much news flow on what tax rises could be included in Chancellor Rachel Reeves' budget statement that it's become hard to keep up. This "kite flying" of policy proposals — designed to test public and market reaction to an idea before committing to it — has led to criticism of the Treasury, with analysts saying the near-constant drip feed of information (and the scrapping of policy ideas) has confused the public, businesses and markets. It has also made it harder to gauge what we're actually going to get when Finance Minister Rachel Reeves finally unveils her spending and taxation plans for the year ahead. CNBC has taken a close eye on what we might see later today when Reeves unveils the Autumn Budget around 12.30 p.m. London time. Read more: The UK's Autumn Budget is coming: Here's what it could mean for your money Speculation has been rife in recent weeks about the policy mix Reeves could deliver today. A tax raid is widely expected, with several potential sources of revenue hitting headlines in the U.K. recently. Currently, the basic 20% rate of income tax only kicks in on earnings above £12,570 ($16,552). A 'mansion tax' is another policy reportedly being considered by the Treasury, which would come as an annual council tax surcharge applied to homes valued at more than £2 million. Private pension contributions and other salary sacrifice schemes — like Cycle to Work benefits — could also be targeted, with reports suggesting Reeves has been considering ending tax breaks for some of those programs. Salary sacrifice currently allows workers to give up some of their earnings in exchange for a non-cash benefit, meaning it isn't received as taxable pay and the employee pays less income tax and National Insurance. Pension provider Fidelity said that under this system, someone earning £110,000 a year and sacrificing £10,000 into their pension would be liable for an additional NI bill of £160 a year, while their employer would have to pay an extra £1,200 a year. There are already some industry-specific taxes in place, however, including duties of up to 25% on slot machines, a 15% tax on horse or dog races, and a levy of 21% on internet casino bets. Tourism tax has already been confirmed as a possibility, with Local Government Minister Steve Reed announcing Tuesday that mayors of English cities will be given the power to roll out duties on overnight stays. Sugar tax will also be another source of additional revenue, with the existing duty on soft drinks with added sugar set to be broadened to include milk-based and milk-alternative beverages from 2028. Markets are anticipating an increase in top-tier council tax, dubbed a 'mansion tax,' but some have issued warnings that it could slow down the U.K.'s housing market and have knock-on effects on trust in the Labour government. "Both policies would disproportionally hit London and the South East and we maintain our preference for housebuilders with minimal exposure to these markets, such as Persimmon," Jack Fletcher-Price, equity analyst at Morningstar, covering U.K. homebuilder stocks, said in a statement. The changes to council tax bands is probably overdue,  Fletcher-Price said, "but it will further undermine trust in this Government given they promised not to do this in the run up to the election." The measures will send a strong signal that the City of London is open for IPO business, according to Inigo Esteve, a partner at law firm White & Case. "Stamp duty on share transfers is one of the remaining areas in which London differs from competing listing venues," said Esteve, a partner in White & Case's capital markets group. "By removing this additional tax for investors in newly listed companies, the stamp duty exemption would hopefully help stimulate demand, attract more global capital and support valuations." Fundraising from London market debuts tumbled to a thirty-year low earlier this year. While bond yields reflect borrowing costs for the governments who issue them, they can also affect mortgage rates, investment returns, the wider economy and personal borrowing. Back in 2022, Prime Minister Liz Truss's swathe of unfunded tax cuts triggered a bond sell-off that had long-lasting effects on the economy and led to her resignation just 44 days into the job. CNBC's Ian King takes a fascinating look at Autumn Budgets past and present in his latest UK Exchange newsletter here: History lessons for Reeves ahead of UK's much-hyped Budget Give or take one or two, most Budgets are quickly forgotten by most people apart, maybe, from some politics nerds and the splendid folk at the Institute for Fiscal Studies who are paid to assess these things. Her first Budget, delivered on Halloween 2024, is still debated a year on because of the £25 billion ($33 billion) she extracted from businesses via an increase in employers' national insurance contributions (a payroll tax) and the resulting rise in unemployment. "Rachel Reeves' reckoning will come from gilt markets," Nigel Green, chief executive of global financial advisory deVere Group, said in a note this morning. "Today's Budget speech is only the first act. Investors will be keeping a close eye on the degree to which Chancellor Rachel Reeves will raise the amount of fiscal "headroom," or wiggle-room, she has to meet her self-imposed "fiscal rules" on spending, borrowing and reducing debt by the end of the decade. The rules were being met by a small margin when the Office for Budget Responsibility assessed them in March, but events since then mean that this headroom is likely to have disappeared, particularly in light of the OBR's likely downgrade to productivity and economic growth, as well as U-turns on welfare spending cuts. Jack Meaning, chief U.K. economist at Barclays, told CNBC that Reeves is likely to target a bigger fiscal headroom of £15-20 billion if she is to avoid having to again look for more money in the near-future. "Certainly, when we've looked at it in the past, with something [fiscal headroom] as small as £10 billion that she had last time, that means there's a one in three chance she'd have to come back for more tax increases or more spending cuts next time round. So I think probably £15 billion is the minimum the market is looking for," he told CNBC's Ian King on Wednesday. Reeves' current fiscal headroom of around £10 billion is viewed as istorically very low, "and that's meant that the market has kept asking questions," Meaning said. We already know one tactic the government will use to raise more money through taxes: a so-called milkshake tax. The government confirmed on Tuesday that from Jan. 2028, some milk-based drinks will no longer be exempt from the U.K.'s sugar tax, a levy that's added onto soft drinks with a high sugar content. When the changes come into effect, the charge will apply to pre-packaged milk-based or milk-alternative drinks like milkshakes, flavored milks, sweetened yogurt drinks and ready-to-drink coffees. The threshold will also be lowered, so that the tax kicks in once a drink contains 4.5 grams of sugar per 100 ml. Markets will be watching the strength of sterling this morning as speculation ahead of the U.K. budget has led to put calls. "If Reeves treads cautiously, then concerns over U.K. deficits and a rising debt burden should weigh on sterling." "Notably, despite worsening news on the budget and weaker U.K. data, GBP has failed to sell-off in recent weeks. This suggests a saturated short GBP position with the bad news likely priced in," he said. Citi had been targeting 0.88 for EURGBP into the budget, "and that target has been met but EURGBP has also failed to push higher despite numerous attempts," Tobon told CNBC in emailed comments. "Absent a negative shock in the budget, we see a greater risk of a 'position squeeze' (unwind of short GBP positions) and suspect some investors are already starting to unwind these short GBP trades as gilts fail to sell-off further." What Sanjay Raja, chief U.K. economist at Deutsche Bank, had to say ahead of the budget: "It's a very unusual budget, because for the first time in since I can remember, we know how this budget is going to start and we know how this budget is going to end. It ends with the chancellor taking her fiscal headroom back up to £15 to 20 billion, so potentially double what she had. And it looks like there will be a smorgasbord of tax raising measures coming through as part of [Wednesday's] budget ... while it won't be as exciting as last year's budget, we hope this will be a historic budget. Ahead of the chancellor's critical statement — which could herald tax rises, spending cuts, or a combination of the two — fund managers are lining up high-conviction trades on U.K. housing, the British currency and beaten-down cyclical equities. Take a closer look here: Three ways for investors to trade the budget "The budget effectively seems to be being driven by keeping the Labour party factions together and ensuring they can get whatever they do announce through parliament," former Conservative U.K. Treasury Minister and Goldman Sachs Chief Economist Jim O'Neill told CNBC on Tuesday. Reeves's past attempts to slash the U.K.'s welfare bill were watered down following a rebellion among some of the Labour party's own lawmakers. "I don't have high expectations for it being an 'oh wow, this is really getting to grips with things' budget, but it will definitely be done to keep the fiscal rules on balance, at least for now," O'Neill added.

While rising cities may not offer the biggest paychecks compared to places like New York or San Francisco, they're seeing the fastest wage growth and offer a lower cost of living, Glassdoor researchers note. These are the top 10 cities for early-career wage growth since 2020, according to Glassdoor research: Job groups with fastest wage growth: Health care; skilled labor and manufacturing; business Job groups with fastest wage growth: Health care; sales; skilled labor and manufacturing Job groups with fastest wage growth: Customer services and support; consulting; marketing Job groups with fastest wage growth: Engineering; health care; retail and food services Health-care jobs are the most in-demand roles with rising pay for young workers, Glassdoor lead researcher Chris Martin told CNBC Make It via email. These positions led wage growth in three of the top 10 cities: Boise, Charleston and Rochester. Overall, health care along with private education jobs have propped up the labor economy for some time. And in many cities, wages are rising for jobs across the income spectrum, according to Glassdoor data.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>At this point, shopping on Black Friday is every bit a Thanksgiving tradition as turkey dinners and pumpkin pie. In fact, 36% of items on sale for Black Friday offer no savings compared with how they were priced between Oct. 27 and Nov. 17, according to new data from WalletHub. "There's some trickery happening," says consumer savings expert Andrea Woroch. So they may repackage something and say it's on sale for Black Friday when, in reality, it was the same discount a few weeks ago." For items that are on sale, the average markdown is about 24%, according to WalletHub's data. "The consumer has to be proactive," says Chip Lupo, a writer and analyst at WalletHub. "Because retailers do more or less rely on people rushing in at the last minute and taking advantage of anything that appears to be a sale." Ideally, says Woroch, you'd begin researching items that you're considering buying long before an anticipated sale while keeping an eye on the price. But if you come across an enticing discount while shopping Black Friday sales, "it's definitely not too late" to do some research to make sure you're getting a good deal, Woroch says. Using online price tracking tools is a good place to start, Woroch says. She recommends CamelCamelCamel, which compares current prices for items listed on Amazon with their historical high, low and average cost. Woroch also likes the Droplist browser extension from Honey, which allows you to make a list of items you're interested in purchasing and will notify you of price drops at more than 800 retailers. Some products will be more difficult to track because they're manufactured specifically for Black Friday sales, says Woroch. "Don't assume that the model is the same one you saw all year long that you've been waiting for it to drop in price," Woroch says. "Look at the model number, look when it's been sold, read reviews and make sure it offers everything you need." Winter apparel, for instance, tends to go on sale after Christmas, says Woroch. "You may be able to find good deals on mattresses," says Lupo. And no matter what you buy, beware of deals that encourage what Woroch calls "spaving" — spending more money than you otherwise would to unlock discounts. "Maybe it's buy two sweaters, get one free. You could come out of Black Friday having spent extra money on things you don't really need, she says. And if you're on a tight budget, "you could find yourself in a lot of trouble because of it."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Black Friday is proving more popular for younger consumers than for their elders, according to a new report provided exclusively to CNBC. "Black Friday is always such a big deal, and the pricing and the offers and advertising that's done during that time is probably what would draw Gen Z, especially things done on social media," said Angela Rutherford, AT&T's vice president of mid-market sales. The enthusiasm for Black Friday comes even as Gen Z plans to pull back their spending. Consulting firm PwC reported in September that Gen Z shoppers plan to spend 23% less on average this holiday season than a year ago – the sharpest decline of any generation and a significant change from the previous year, when Gen Z said they planned to spend 37% more. And as non-wealthy Americans face pressures of higher prices and economic uncertainty, some reports are showing signs of a "K-shaped" economy that may stretch into the holiday season, with wealthier consumers spending more and lower-income consumers shopping more conservatively. A new Deloitte survey found that consumers at large plan to spend 4% less on Black Friday than they did last year, primarily due to concerns of financial constraints and a higher cost of living. Still, Rutherford said consumers are being more "intentional and value-driven" in their holiday shopping this year. That spending is translating into more support for small businesses rather than large legacy retailers, with 77% of consumers reporting they would do all of their holiday shopping at small businesses if they could and if the pricing was the same, according to AT&T's survey. Compared with last year, the number of survey respondents who said they shop at small businesses to boost their local economies grew by 8 percentage points. "I think there's a price consciousness out there, combined with a, 'If I can still save money or get a good price, I will still shop local,' type of mentality out there," Rutherford said. The AT&T survey also found that 72% of people reported getting their gift ideas from in-person shopping rather than from social media. And even as artificial intelligence begins to reshape the way people shop, more than half of shoppers said they were more likely to use traditional online search methods for their gifting this holiday season than AI – just 9% of those surveyed said they are more likely to use AI to find gifts. "AI has exploded over the last couple years, and it's infiltrating all aspects of life," Rutherford said. "I think as time goes on, you will see a shift from the traditional search to AI for shopping." Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In a Tuesday post on his new Substack, the investor of "The Big Short" fame called out Nvidia's recent memo to Wall Street analysts, saying it was responding to claims he didn't make. Burry, in a post titled "Unicorns and Cockroaches: Blessed Fraud," wrote that he couldn't believe Nvidia's responses had come from the world's most valuable public company. The market veteran, who recently closed his hedge fund to outside cash and turned his focus to writing, said he'd never suggested Nvidia was dragging out the depreciation of its property, plant, and equipment (PP&E), as it's primarily a chip designer with minimal capital expenditures, not a manufacturer. "No one cares about Nvidia's own depreciation," he said. Burry also dismissed Nvidia's argument that its older-generation chips are still being used, saying his concern is that newer chips could become functionally obsolete between 2026 and 2028. Burry added that Nvidia's rebuttal to him was "disingenuous on the face, and disappointing." He disclosed in his latest post that he's placed wagers against the chipmaker and another AI darling: "I continue to own puts on Palantir and Nvidia, both of which will be discussed at another time." Nvidia and Palantir didn't immediately respond to requests for comment on Burry's latest post. One of Burry's chief concerns is AI companies' depreciation accounting, or how quickly they're projecting their assets will decline in value and how much they'll be worth at the end of their useful life. Companies can increase their short-term profits and the stated value of their assets by spreading those costs over five or six years, rather than three. He also highlighted a recent interview with Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, in which Nadella said he had slowed the company's data center buildout earlier this year because he was wary of overbuilding infrastructure to serve one generation of AI chips, as the next generation will have different power and cooling requirements. He hinted that between the memo and wider market reaction, his depreciation comments have sparked a bigger reaction than he anticipated: "I have been drawn into something much bigger than me." Known for his dire warnings about crashes and recessions, he returned to X after a two-year break in late October, making the case that AI stocks are in a bubble. Burry's Scion Asset Management previously revealed on November 3, the same day as Palantir's third-quarter earnings, that it held bearish put options on both companies at the end of September. Palantir CEO Alex Karp called the bets "batshit crazy" in a televised interview the next day, prompting Burry to post on X that he wasn't surprised Karp "couldn't crack a simple 13F." In a subsequent X post, Burry said the Palantir puts were "done last month" and he was "on to much better things" ahead of his Substack's launch. The earlier positions had a combined notional value of $1.1 billion, but Burry wrote in his latest Substack post that they only cost him around $10 million each. Burry hasn't shared the thinking behind his Palantir wagers.</p>

I'm referring to Alphabet's landmark legal victory in early September, which saw the company avoid having to sell off its Google Chrome web browser. Just look at the stock chart, which shows a 53% spike since then. They haven't explained the rationale behind their stake, nor do we know exactly when in the third quarter it was built. But a core tenet of Warren Buffett's investing philosophy has always been to find companies with big competitive moats. What better option than the tech giant that just won its antitrust case? Going beyond Berkshire, it's possible that — on the heels of its legal win — Alphabet is simply getting more aggressive with its AI ambitions, rather than playing things more conservative to avoid attracting unwanted attention. It also has OpenAI paving the way for new technology rollouts with its "move fast and break things" approach. Alphabet has the luxury of being able to monitor developments at OpenAI, and wait to assess the level of blowback before introducing their competing version. Don't underestimate how much completed AI tech Alphabet has up its sleeve.</p>
