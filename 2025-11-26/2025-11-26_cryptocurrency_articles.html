                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>UFC star Conor McGregor publicly blasted longtime rival Khabib Nurmagomedov after the retired champion dropped a series of papakha-inspired NFTs, digital versions of the traditional Dagestani hat he made famous during UFC fight nights. Social media posts claimed the release generated around $4.4 million, and after the sale, Nurmagomedov deleted earlier posts promoting it. McGregor immediately accused Nurmagomedov of running a “scam,” claiming he used his late father's name and Dagestani culture to take money from fans before wiping off promotional evidence. “There is just no way good guy Khabib used his late father's name, as well as Dagestan's culture, to scam his fans and fire sell a bunch of digital NFTs online and then delete all of the content after they were sold, leaving his fans robbed of their money?” McGregor wrote. Nurmagomedov fired back, calling McGregor an “absolute liar” and insisting the NFTs were legitimate “digital gifts” with real value, created to celebrate the Dagestani tradition. He said McGregor was trying to insult him years after losing their infamous 2018 fight. McGregor also had his own history with crypto ventures. The former UFC champion previously partnered with Real World Gaming DAO to launch a meme token called REAL, aiming to blend meme coin appeal with utility and transparent fundraising. However, the presale fell short of its target, and the team eventually processed refunds for all bidders. Don't have an account?</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>South Korea's Top Crypto Exchange to Be Absorbed By Tech Giant in $10.3 Billion Deal South Korea's largest crypto exchange is officially getting acquired—pending regulator approval—by one of the country's top tech giants. Naver Financial agreed Wednesday to absorb Dunamu, operator of crypto exchange Upbit, in an all-stock deal valued at $10.29 billion. According to a related filing, the deal will see Naver issue 2.54 new shares for every share in Dunamu, as the company is absorbed. That deal would see Dunamu's leadership become the largest shareholders in parent company Naver Financial, despite the crypto company being absorbed as a wholly owned subsidiary. “In addition, they will review various restructuring plans to secure future growth engines through functional and organic cooperation between the two companies,” the outlined agreement said. In July, Dunamu revealed plans for a won-backed stablecoin issued by Naver. The company has also developed a layer-2 Ethereum network specifically designed for facilitating stablecoin transactions and retail payments. The deal between both companies now must be approved by South Korean regulators, namely the country's Fair Trade Commission. The latest news, articles, and resources, sent to your inbox weekly.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Just a year after developers—led in part by Vitalik Buterin's push for scaling—began advocating for higher gas limits, Ethereum is now operating with a 60 million block gas limit, doubling network capacity in only 12 months. As pointed out by Ethereum Foundation researcher Toni Wahrstätter, this marks one of the most important throughput expansions on Ethereum's mainnet in years and shows a maturing network ready for more complex applications. A 60 million gas limit means each block can fit far more transactions, contract calls, and on-chain operations. Gas limits determine how much computation can fit inside each Ethereum block—effectively setting the ceiling for transaction processing and smart-contract execution. Higher limits, while beneficial for users, increase pressure on block builders and full nodes, raising concerns about long-term sustainability. He expects continued gas growth, but “more targeted / less uniform” increases in 2026 rather than another blanket doubling. These targeted increases would allow Ethereum to scale computationally heavy operations without overstressing other parts of the network. The gas limit expansion reinforces Ethereum's gradualist scaling philosophy: incremental improvements, carefully measured, with long-term decentralisation preserved. With proto-danksharding (EIP-4844) already live and full danksharding under active development, the execution layer is now gaining complementary headroom.

Individual investors include Marc Weinstein, Jason Yanowitz, and Ameen Soleimani. These satellites, called SpaceTEE units, will run secure blockchain and cryptography tasks from space, according to the press release. The funding will also go toward building network software, setting up how the satellites work together, and offering new services like private computing and secure record-keeping. The investment highlights growing interest in using novel approaches, like space technology, to advance blockchain infrastructure. By moving beyond traditional satellites, blockchain operations could become harder to mess with on Earth. “The SpaceComputer project represents an optimistic, yet pragmatic cypherpunk ambition,” said co-founder Daniel Bar. Bar added that the “importance and opportunity” of space for decentralized technologies is “undeniable.” Major financial institutions have also explored the potential of satellites for secure transactions. A few years ago, JPMorgan's digital asset arm tested what it called the “world's first bank-led tokenized value transfer in space.” The banking giant used a blockchain network deployed on low-Earth orbit  (LEO) satellites to execute smart-contract transactions. These developments come as scientists grow extremely concerned with the expanding amount of space debris. In 2023, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) warned in a letter to Congress that debris from LEO satellites, like SpaceX's Starlink constellation, could pose a danger to people on the ground during reentry disposal. A separate 2022 study claimed that Elon Musk's swarm of satellites is obstructing astronomers' telescope views. Know what matters in Crypto and Web3 with The Defiant Daily newsletter, Mon to Fri</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Conor McGregor and Khabib Nurmagomedov have words again Conor McGregor is firing shots at his old friend Khabib Nurmagomedov again. Nurmagomedov recently announced an auction for a new NFT called Papakhas on social media platform Telegram. That brought out a tweet from McGregor, who was Nurmagomedov's biggest career rival in the fight game, and appears to still be in that role. “There is just no way good guy khabib used his late fathers name, as well as Dagestan's culture, to scam his fans and fire sell a bunch of digital NFT's online and then delete all of the content after they were sold, leaving his fans robbed of their money? There is just no way good guy do this,” McGregor wrote. Nurmagomedov then responded to McGregor's post, saying that McGregor will do anything in an attempt to soil his name, while also tweeting out a commercial of sorts for the platform and NFT. They don't create exclusive digital gifts with real time value, that you can share with your friends and family. “Traditions and culture that slowly walking over this world, whether you like it or not! Of course, McGregor wasn't going to let it go without getting the last word. “Apologize this instant for using your late father's name to sell these ‘gifts' that cost your fans so much of their money,” McGregor wrote. “Also to sell something means it is not a gift you low IQ troglodyte! That is the direct opposite of what ‘gift' means. It was a lopsided performance for Nurmagomedov before eventually submitting the former two-division champ in Round 4.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Similar to traditional currency, which may be referred to as central bank money, a CBDC is simply a digital form of existing legal tender. Governed by the same central bank as any given traditional currency would be, most CBDCs are intended to expand access to safe payment options without reducing or replacing fiat systems. The Bahamas, Nigeria, Jamaica, and Zimbabwe are the only nations to have fully launched a CBDC solution, but many other countries are exploring their potential for digital transformation. Most countries that have launched a CBDC in some form have done so for the sake of three key goals: faster payments, financial inclusion, and reduced cash dependency. As such, governments are taking the next steps toward this future. Central bank digital currencies are starting to feel less like local experiments and more like chess pieces in a global power game. Governments do not just see them as fancy digital cash, they see levers of control, ways to fine tune their money flow and pull away from systems like SWIFT that tie them to others. China's digital yuan kind of kicked the hornet's nest, pushing Europe, Japan, and everyone else to hurry up and figure out their own versions before they fall behind in the digital money race. If these currencies really take off, sending money across borders might go from a slog of days to something closer to blinking speed. But whoever builds the slickest, strongest digital pipes might end up holding a bigger slice of global influence. Then there is the idea of programmable money, where funds can come with strings attached, like expiring on a date or only working for specific things. It is the kind of thing that could twist the usual idea of fiscal policy into something much more precise, maybe even unnerving. For crypto, it is a strange mix of threat and validation. On one hand, CBDCs show that the core ideas behind blockchain actually work. While there are many ways to distinguish between CBDCs and crypto, the core difference between these digital assets comes down to centralized versus decentralized control. Where digital tokens like cryptocurrency and stablecoins are defined by their decentralization, separate from regulatory bodies like central banks, CBDCs are directly governed by such institutions. At the same time, privacy and surveillance concerns largely absent from crypto projects could take center stage within a CBDC initiative. Where traditional currency is difficult to trace, every transaction could be recorded by a CBDC's governing body. While this decision may limit areas of growth for the U.S., it could allow the nation to learn from how other world leaders attempt to implement a CBDC before doing so itself. Though cryptocurrency and CBDCs are distinguished by centralized versus decentralized control, it is possible that the implementation of a CBDC could impact the crypto market. This is especially true for stablecoins, which are often connected to traditional currencies like the U.S. dollar. Though stablecoins are largely intended to eliminate the need for the exchange of crypto and fiat currency, a fast, low-cost, and well-regulated CBDC could overtake this role. A CBDC could provide the average person with new levels of financial control, automating tax collection, stimulus distribution, and accelerating payments. For this reason, decentralized cryptocurrencies remain a prominent facet of the modern digital environment. Investing involves risk and your investment may lose value.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>BIS appoints Tommaso Mancini-Griffoli to lead its Innovation Hub as it advances CBDC pilots, tokenised deposits and digital money The Bank for International Settlements has chosen Tommaso Mancini-Griffoli to lead its Innovation Hub from March. His appointment arrives at a time when central banks are looking into major changes in payment systems, digital money frameworks and tokenised financial tools. Tommaso Mancini-Griffoli has been appointed head of the #BISInnovationHub for a five-year term starting on 1 March 2026. The Hub studies new financial technology that could support central banks and public institutions. It also builds prototypes, tests platforms and supplies research for ongoing digital currency projects. Additionally, its centres operate in Singapore, Hong Kong, London, Toronto, Stockholm, Frankfurt, Paris and Switzerland. His work covers CBDCs, payment rails, settlement systems and models for regulated digital assets. He has also urged caution toward private stablecoins that lack strong oversight or safe reserves. For cross-border payments, the use of tokens or virtual currencies is a very interesting idea. He often argues that secure digital money should combine public oversight and private innovation. He noted that such arrangements could give private firms room to build new services while giving the system stronger safeguards. He also supported tokenised financial instruments when they operate under clear rules. His work stresses the need for structures that protect users from liquidity issues or loss of value. He also often warns that poorly designed products can expose users to unnecessary risks. The mBridge project links several central banks and tests cross-border CBDC settlement. It also aims to improve cross-border payments that often face delays or high fees. It studies how banks could issue tokenised versions of customer deposits and settle them through shared infrastructure. The Hub also works on Project Nexus, a system that connects instant payment networks across countries. Nexus aims to help users send funds across borders using existing national payment systems. Instead, it studies how modern tools can work under central bank oversight. His term started in July and will last five years, as the organisation enters a period of leadership renewal.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After years of ‘only Bitcoin and Ethereum matter,' $XRP ETFs have emerged as the leading altcoin product, pulling in more than $622M in eight trading days and even outpacing Solana's inflows. That isn't noise but a rotation signal. As capital finally moves beyond the big two cryptos, institutions are effectively curating a short list of altcoins they trust: scalable infrastructure, clear narratives, and real users. That's where early-stage exposure can still offer asymmetric upside. Below are three very different ways to position for that rotation: PEPENODE's ($PEPENODE) virtual miner, SUBBD Token's ($SUBBD) AI and Web3 creator platform, and $XRP itself, which is quietly becoming the institutional benchmark for altcoin exposure. PEPENODE ($PEPENODE) positions itself as the world's first mine-to-earn meme coin, taking the old-school mining concept and turning it into a virtual, gamified economy on Ethereum. Instead of buying ASICs and worrying about sky-high electricity bills, you'll be able to acquire and upgrade virtual miner nodes, then earn meme coin rewards like $PEPE and $FARTCOIN for your in-game performance. At the core is a Virtual Mining System with tiered node rewards. As an early adopter, you can secure more powerful nodes that generate higher returns, echoing how early Bitcoin miners enjoyed outsized rewards. But here it's abstracted into an ERC-20 system without hardware or technical barriers. Gameplay and the full dashboard go live post-TGE. In the meantime, though, you can stake your $PEPENODE for a massive 587% APY. That's still micro-cap territory relative to mainstream meme coins, but with clear upside if mine-to-earn becomes a recognizable sub-narrative. Buying early lets you buy and stake during presale for boosted returns, effectively front-running future node inflation. If you've missed earlier meme cycles or are bored with copy-paste dog coins with no mechanic beyond speculation, $PEPENODE offers a more structured, game-like path to yield. The project's pitch is straightforward: most creators are trapped in Web2 rails, sharing revenue with platforms while having limited control over their data, audience, and monetization options. SUBBD merges Web3 and AI to flip that model. That enables a creator to scale their presence across multiple channels without diluting brand control or giving everything to centralized platforms. The presale metrics are already notable: $1.3M+ raised with tokens at $0.05705, plus a 20% first-year staking yield for early participants. The same goes for its $SUBBD token, which our SUBBD Token price prediction sees reaching a potential high of $0.48 by the end of 2026. That's about a 741% increase from its current price. Ripple's $XRP remains the institutional altcoin benchmark, and its recent price action proves it. Designed for fast, low-cost cross-border payments on the XRP Ledger, $XRP offers 3- to 5-second transaction finality and negligible fees, making it attractive for banks, fintechs, and liquidity providers that need reliable settlement. This utility is now mirrored in market structure. That amount of inflows allowed $XRP to surpass Solana's and signaled that institutions want liquid, battle-tested assets when they step outside $BTC and $ETH. If you're a crypto investor, $XRP represents the blue-chip end of the current rotation, allowing you to ride institutional adoption of blockchain payments with relatively lower volatility than micro-caps. Pairing a core $XRP position with selective bets in narratives like mine-to-earn ($PEPENODE) and AI creator platforms ($SUBBD) can therefore be a winning combination in the market's current cycle. 🚀 Buy $XRP at its current price of $2.17 on Binance.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Although Bitcoin and some of the best cryptos to buy have stabilized above key support levels, MONAD crypto is leading the charge. However, are there other best crypto presales to bid instead? Their goal, like other ambitious builders, is to resolve Ethereum's scaling challenges while also ensuring interoperability with the first smart contract platforms. Because of this interoperability, developers can deploy their dapps on Monad without code changes, taking advantage of existing infrastructure, including tools and wallets. With each MON trading for $0.025, they raised over $200 million. Even before this oversubscribed ICO via Coinbase's token sale platform, Monad had raised over $225M from venture capitalists, including Jump Crypto and Coinbase. At spot rates, MON crypto is up nearly +100% from its ICO price, propelled by FOMO. This whale opened a $6M long on Monad $MON last night and is now up $1.2M already pic.twitter.com/YUzTIbuXFA Moreover, commitments to integration from LayerZero, Stargate, and Curvance, for example, also helped lift prices. LayerZero will be live on @monad on day one, ensuring that billions in value from top assets and applications will be available for users to swap, stake, spend, and save. A big chunk of MON tokens that are supposed to be in circulation, that is, from airdrops and ICO, are locked until 2026-2029. The Monad tokenomics are an IQ test that CT is failing. Bitcoin Hyper is already considered one of the best crypto presales to buy now, thanks to its ambition of scaling Bitcoin. How fast Bitcoin scales can determine adoption, especially in zones where transaction fees is crucial. Using the SVM translates to high scalability, low fees, and instant interoperability with Solana. Those who buy HYPER now and stake earn an impressive 41% APY.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Early opportunities appear, doubts creep in, and months later people watch from the sidelines as those who acted early lock in life changing gains. Right now, BlockchainFX ($BFX) is stepping into that emotional gap just as new price action around NEAR Protocol (NEAR) has traders talking once again about the next 1000x crypto. With November in full swing and Q4 heating up, attention is shifting toward projects that combine strong utility with aggressive early entry terms, and BlockchainFX is firmly in that conversation. When NEAR Protocol first launched near an ICO price of about $0.29, many people brushed it off or simply didn't bother to look closer. NEAR later climbed past $20, turning early community members and committed believers into quiet success stories while countless others looked back wishing they had risked even a modest amount at the start. Today, NEAR trades around $1.91 following periods of strong market activity. Despite volatility, the project continues to demonstrate that quality assets often recover and can still create opportunities long after their launch. Crypto regularly hands out second chances, but only to those prepared to move before everyone else decides the trend is obvious. BlockchainFX ($BFX) is built around a simple idea with large implications. Instead of forcing traders to juggle separate platforms for crypto, forex, stocks, ETFs, bonds, and index products, it aims to bring everything together inside a single, tightly integrated ecosystem. The heart of this system is $BFX, which sits at the center of user engagement and daily rewards. The design philosophy focuses on real users who trade often and want both speed and clarity, not just speculative branding. Settlement times can lag, price gaps between marketplaces can create confusion, and user interfaces sometimes feel like they were stitched together from different eras. This mess wastes time, adds friction, and makes scaling a personal strategy more difficult than it needs to be. BlockchainFX's best crypto presale wants to replace that experience with a single ecosystem where access to hundreds of assets is unified, execution is faster, and the learning curve is less painful. The project positions itself as a solution for people who are tired of jumping between tabs, accounts, and liquidity pools just to run a simple strategy. The platform is designed to support more than five hundred assets across different markets. Users are incentivized with daily rewards paid in both $BFX and USDT, turning ongoing activity into a steady feedback loop. This combination of a large asset menu, daily income potential, and real trading utility has pushed BlockchainFX into many discussions about serious presale projects, especially among those looking beyond short-lived meme pumps. Utility, not just narrative, is the main draw. Over eighteen thousand participants have already taken part, which hints at strong early community formation before the platform even goes live. Demand continues to grow because cross-market trading is becoming more important for active investors. Those who believe in the long term potential of a unified venue understand that early exposure to the underlying token can scale quickly if platform usage grows. By using the BF70 code, presale buyers receive an additional seventy percent in $BFX tokens on top of their standard allocation. In a month where many projects are quiet or cautious, this stands out as one of the largest and most aggressive bonus structures available. In a down or uncertain market, this kind of offer can be game changing. Buyers using the code are effectively front loading their exposure before any major price appreciation and before the broader market potentially turns more bullish. BlockchainFX is not just relying on hype or token inflation to support its long term vision. The business model is built around multiple income streams. Copy trading features, with commissions set at 1.25 percent, add yet another layer of monetization tied to actual user behavior. By building diverse revenue channels, the project aims to reduce dependence on any single one-time event, like the presale, and instead grow as more traders use the platform over time. The strongest regrets in crypto usually trace back to early stages that looked interesting but were ignored. NEAR Protocol is a textbook example of exactly that pattern. Now, BlockchainFX has entered the same kind of conversation. The window where early buyers can accumulate at lower prices is still open, but not forever. Seventy percent extra tokens on entry is far from common. Dip conditions and quieter months do not last permanently. Many traders later point back to quiet presale periods just like this as the moments when a decisive move could have made all the difference. This article is not intended as financial advice.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Cryptocurrency investment scams perpetrated by transnational criminal organizations (TCOs) located in Southeast Asia are on the rise. Colloquially known as "pig-butchering" scams, TCOs build trust with victims, convince victims to invest in real cryptocurrency, and then con victims into transferring the real cryptocurrency into fake cryptocurrency investments. According to the U.S. Secret Service ("USSS"), "this scam industry defrauds Americans of nearly $10 billion per year. "1 Now, the U.S. Attorney's office for the District of Columbia has announced it has a plan to stop them. On November 12, 2025, U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia Jeanine Ferris Pirro announced the creation of the Scam Center Strike Force ("Strike Force") in partnership with several law enforcement and Federal agency partners.2 The Strike Force's stated goal is to "secure America against Southeast Asian cryptocurrency-related fraud and scams"3 by recovering stolen assets used to evade sanctions and facilitate scams and returning those assets to victims. While the seizure of property does require judicially authorized warrants, subsequent civil forfeiture actions do not require any initiation of criminal proceedings. If the government can meet this low burden, law enforcement officials have the authority to seize and take control of the property for eventual forfeiture. The DOJ's civil forfeiture authority is extremely broad and can pose significant complications for those whose property is seized. Property owners with no actual knowledge of the alleged criminal activity may still lose possession of their items, which can be difficult and time-consuming to contest, as the property owners must both establish ownership of the property and in some instances prove that the property was not connected to a crime. However, proponents counter that civil forfeiture is an essential tool in combating organized crime as the seizure of criminal enterprises' assets and proceeds materially disrupts their operations. Statutes empowering the Strike Force to engage in civil forfeiture, such as the terrorism subsection of the Civil forfeiture statute, 4 explicitly extend to foreign and domestic assets. DOJ has strong policy and enforcement incentives to use civil forfeiture proceedings under this statute against TCOs, particularly those designated as Foreign Terrorist Organizations. The Strike Force is identified and focused on Chinese-organized crime affiliates with operations in Cambodia, Laos, and Burma as key leaders of these cryptocurrency investment schemes. The Strike Force has already conducted operations in Myanmar, Indonesia, and Thailand, and has seized and forfeited over $400 million dollars in scam-obtained cryptocurrency funds. As part of U.S. Attorney Piro's November 12 Strike Force announcement, she noted the Strike Force has initiated civil forfeiture proceedings seeking another $80 million in stolen funds. Though the Strike Force is focused on Southeast Asia, the rise of cryptocurrency investment scams is a global trend. For example, on November 14, 2025, the Department of Justice announced five guilty pleas and over $15 million in civil forfeiture actions against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea for "multimillion-dollar virtual currency heists at four overseas virtual currency platforms in 2023," among other charges.5 In addition, on October 14, 2025, the DOJ announced the largest ever forfeiture action against approximately $15 billion in Bitcoin tied to a multinational business conglomerate's alleged involvement in cryptocurrency investment fraud schemes run through forced labor compounds.6 The Bitcoin was previously stored in unhosted digital wallets whose private keys the chairman and founder of the conglomerate had in his possession. Moreover, the Strike Force is aligned with a broader shift in U.S. strategy for addressing cryptocurrency scams. In April 2025, U.S. Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche published a memorandum titled "Ending Regulation by Prosecution," which outlined the DOJ's approach to digital asset enforcement under the Trump Administration.7 Blanche stated that the DOJ would "focus on prosecuting individuals who victimize digital asset investors, or those who use digital assets in furtherance of criminal offenses such as terrorism, narcotics and human trafficking, organized crime, hacking, and cartel and gang financing. "8 Further, DOJ prosecutors would start prioritizing cases "that hold accountable individuals who (a) cause financial harm to digital asset investors and consumers; and/or (b) use digital assets in furtherance of other criminal conduct. "9 The Strike Force is a clear step in this direction. Corporations operating in sectors related to cryptocurrency or any companies dealing in large sums of digital assets on foreign exchanges should consider the creation of the Strike Force a warning sign that their assets may be at risk of being frozen even absent direct criminal exposure. Notably, the laws authorizing the Strike Force's activity can be applied to persons that arguably facilitate violations or are strictly liable, including situations where the person "should have known" that they were facilitating a violation.
